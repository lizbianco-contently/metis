Mr. President, in a few minutes, Senator Salazar will rise \nto give his final speech on the floor of the Senate. Parting is with \nsuch sweet sorrow. I have such great respect for this man we call Ken \nSalazar.\n  I spoke yesterday regarding Senator Biden, who will become Vice \nPresident of the United States next Tuesday. I also spoke about Senator \nClinton who, after her confirmation, will become Secretary of State. \nThe accomplishments of Senators Biden and Clinton are well known--two \ngreat Americans. The accomplishments and life of Ken Salazar are less \nknown but no less remarkable; in fact, in most instances more \nremarkable.\n  Kenneth Lee Salazar is a fifth-generation Coloradan and a twelfth-\ngeneration American. His family is a remarkable story about what \nAmerica is all about. His family settled in New Mexico 400 years ago \nand moved to Colorado's San Luis Valley in the middle of the 19th \ncentury, claiming some of the region's first water rights.\n  Ken Salazar grew up farming and ranching the same Colorado land his \nancestors had for hundreds of years. This is real rural America, 300 \nmiles from Denver. The ranch did not have electricity until 1982--no \ntelephone, no television. Senator Salazar and his seven brothers and \nsisters were born to two American patriots. His mom Emma traveled to \nWashington by herself as a 19-year-old girl to do her thing in World \nWar II. She went to work in the War Department here in Washington, DC, \nwhile Ken's father Henry joined the military and became a staff \nsergeant. He was so proud of that service in the military that he \nasked, when\n\n[[Page S634]]\n\nhe passed away, to be buried in his staff sergeant uniform; his family \ncomplied with that.\n  Although Emma and Henry were not educated in the true sense of the \nword by having gone to colleges and universities, their love of \neducation was so strong that all eight of the Salazar children have \ncollege educations, and some such as Ken, of course, have gone on to \ngraduate from law school and other such things.\n  Ken Salazar farmed for more than 30 years; and he and his lovely wife \nHope--who is such a nice, strong person--owned a number of businesses \nin Colorado. As I recall, I think one of them was a Dairy Queen and I \nthink maybe a couple radio stations.\n  I had the good fortune of traveling to South America with Hope and \nKen, and it was a remarkable trip--Bolivia, Peru, Machu Picchu. It was \na wonderful trip, something I will always remember.\n  But later, after having practiced water and environmental law to \nprotect the health of Coloradans and the beauty of that State--and \nanyone who has ever been to Colorado knows it is one of the great \nnational treasures we have in our country. It is a beautiful State. But \nI think what I have learned about the Salazars, and Ken especially, is \nthat if you look at their family, you learn a lot about them. They are \na great American family.\n  When Ken decided to run for the Colorado State attorney general's \noffice, his father Henry was with him all the time. In fact, he had a \npickup truck, and he traveled the State with his son. All 64 counties \nin Colorado they visited. Senator Salazar did not do that just once, he \nhas done it many times.\n  Henry Salazar was not alive long enough to see Ken elected to the \nSenate, but I can say with certainty that as proud as he was of his son \nalready, his pride would overflow for the Senator who is going to \nbecome now a member of President Obama's Cabinet.\n  That election in 2004 was dramatic. All over the country, we \nDemocrats were hoping to pick up seats. We lost just about everything, \nexcept Illinois and Colorado. Two great Senators, two great Americans \nwere elected that year as Democrats: Barack Obama and Ken Salazar.\n\n  Ken's mother Emma, who is now almost 88 years old, is surely just as \nproud as her husband Henry was of her son, who will now serve this \ncountry as a Cabinet Secretary.\n  Senator Salazar's election, as I have indicated, was one of the few \nbright spots of 2004, a year that saw us defeated in the Presidential \nelection and all the close congressional races.\n  Expectations were high for the new Senator from Colorado, and Ken \nSalazar met and exceeded every one of the expectations. While in the \nSenate, Senator Salazar has been a champion for a new defense and \nforeign policy that keeps us safe, restores our authority in the world, \nand honors the courageous service of our men and women in uniform. He \nhas helped lead the fight for affordable health care, and to help \nbroaden the State Children's Health Insurance Program. He serves on the \nSenate Energy Committee, Finance Committee, and Agriculture Committee, \nand these are tremendous assignments that he received as a young \nSenator.\n  He has done so well as a Senator in so many different capacities: as \nan advocate for clean, affordable, and renewable energy and for \nprotecting our environment and natural resources.\n  Coloradans have rightly come to love Ken Salazar. He is now going to \nbring this remarkable experience and wisdom, as he leaves the Senate, \nupon confirmation, to begin a new adventure as President Obama's \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  All of us feel his time in the Senate is far too short, but I know \nhis upcoming service to our Nation will in no way take away from the \nlegacy he has left in the Senate. After having served as a Cabinet \nofficer, it will be enhanced. His new role will enhance that.\n  Senator Salazar has a keen understanding of life and of the \nenvironmental concerns and needs of Western States such as Colorado and \nNevada. He will be a great advocate for the people of both our States \nand the whole West and our country.\n  Barack Obama's Cabinet selections have been one of his most approved \nadventures in Government in a long time: Republicans, Democrats, \nIndependents. I think his appointments to the Cabinet have been so \nsignificant. None has been more significant than Ken Salazar. To take \nthis great Senator and convince him to be a Cabinet officer says it \nall. It shows how remarkable both Obama and Salazar are; classmates who \ncame here together in 2004.\n  The most important attribute I have found about Ken Salazar, this \nrelatively new Senator, was his ability to be a peacemaker, to reach \nout and bring us together. He was new here when we were going through \nthe battle dealing with the nuclear option. But he stepped right in, \nunderstood what our Constitution was all about, why it was so important \nthat matter be settled, and he was one of the leading advocates of \nworking that out, which he did.\n  Immigration, a difficult issue. Who, of course, was the leader on \nthat? Ken Salazar. Because he wanted a program that was comprehensive \nand fair to all sides.\n  As everyone knows, we had a situation with Senator Lieberman that was \na unique situation, and it needed to be resolved. Who did that? Ken \nSalazar. Ken Salazar wrote in hand the resolution. He is the one who \ntalked to Democrats and Republicans, recognizing we were headed in the \nright direction.\n  So he is a peacemaker, not bound by labels but only by his own \nintegrity. Much of that integrity and moral grounding comes from his \nfaith, which I have heard him discuss in personal conversations with \nme, downstairs every Wednesday with our Prayer Breakfast, and other \nplaces.\n  I have seen tears well up in his eyes as he talks about the beautiful \nmountains that surround his home in southern Colorado.\n  Ken tells the story of those mountains being named by a young priest \nwho was dying. He wakes up delirious, with death close at hand, and \nlooks out at those beautiful mountains, 14,000 foot mountain peaks, to \nsee the Sun coming through those mountains. To the priest, they looked \nlike the blood of Christ, and they were named ``Sangre de Cristo,'' the \nBlood of Christ, Mountains.\n  Senator Salazar, your abiding faith, your moral grounding, your \nlifelong love of our country, and your family are treasures that I will \nnever forget, and that will serve you well in years to come. Your \ncolleagues are proud of you, proud of your accomplishments, grateful \nfor your service, and excited for the problems you will solve and the \nprogress you will make for all Americans.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S634-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR KEN SALAZAR\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

I \nhated to see him leave the Senate. Even though he has been here a \nrelatively short time, he has made an enormous number of friends, I \nthink an incredible contribution to the institution and, of course, to \nhis State as well. I think his passion for the issues the Interior \nDepartment deals with overcame what I would have hoped he would have \nconcluded in the end was the right decision, which was to say no to the \nnew President and stay in the Senate.\n  We hate to see him leave. We think he has been an extraordinarily \noutstanding and fine Member of this body. I wanted to join with the \nmajority leader and say how much we appreciate his service and how much \nall of us look forward to continuing to work with him in the coming \nyears in his new and important responsibility as Secretary of the \nInterior.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S634-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S634-S635]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank the Chair, the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island. I thank my great friend the majority leader, \nSenator Reid, for his inspiration and for his leadership of this body \nand his love for this Nation. I think our journey together in many ways \nhas been a similar journey because if you think about a man from \nSearchlight, NV, raised in the house where he was raised, raised in the \ncircumstances in which he was raised, working in the mines and being \nessentially part of the poorest part of Nevada, and yet today he is \nserving in the Senate as majority leader, that is a pathway that \nillustrates the opportunity and promise of America.\n  For his support and his leadership, I will be forever grateful, and \nfor the support from his family, Landra and Rory and all of his \nchildren as well. I admire him and admire them. I appreciate the \ncomments that were so heartfelt from him, and I appreciate the comments \nas well from Senator McConnell.\n  I thank my colleagues who are here this morning. I know almost \neverybody took off last night, so the Chamber is not exactly full this \nmorning, but I see both Democrats and Republicans who came to hear me \nsay the last few words I will say from this desk in the U.S. Senate.\n  Let me start out first by giving tribute to my family. My wonderful \nwife Hope, and my daughter Melinda, who is at Stanford, my daughter \nAndrea and my granddaughter who are in Denver today watching us on the \nSenate floor, they truly are the bedrock of my life. Without them I \nwould not be here, and without them I would not have traveled the 64 \ncounties of my great State of Colorado probably 20 times in the last 10 \nyears because they were always there at my side since they were little, \nholding up balloons and walking parades and doing all the rest of the \nthings it takes to become part of an elected office in such a large \ngeographic area of Colorado. So today I say thank you, and I love you \nall very much.\n  I wish to pay tribute as well to my father Henry. As Senator Reid \ndescribed his history, it is a very true history. He was born into \npoverty and lived through a lot of sacrifice but always remembered the \ntwo most important things in his life, as my brother Congressman \nSalazar often says: No. 1, family; and No. 2, love for country. I think \nthose two values guided him to achieve what he still at the end of his \nlife considered to be his greatest success, and that is that all eight \nof his children--all eight of his children--became first generation \ncollege graduates. So of my father Henry who taught me so many things \nabout life, I will always be forever proud.\n  Within his family, as well as within my mother's family, if you look \nat the genealogy, which I will insert for the Record, we started back \nwith Juan de Salazar who was born in 1520 and Juan de Salazar born in \n1555, who became one of the original founders of the City of Sante Fe--\nthe City of Holy Faith--NM, and then Jose Bernardo de Salazar. It goes \non to the point where I am a 12th generation son of the southwest of \nNew Mexico and Colorado. It is a history I am very proud of. It is a \nhistory that I hope is not forgotten. It is a history that for a long \ntime was essentially shoved beneath the dust and was not given the \nillumination of its reality. I hope in some small part my role here in \nthe Senate has been to give credence as well as to celebrate that \nhistory that makes us such a wonderful and diverse America. So I \nappreciate everything I received from my father's side. Yes, he was a \nproud soldier in World War II. He was a tough master as we grew up. He \nmade us understand the importance of hard work. He had a strong sense \nof pride, a strong sense of community and giving back, and a strong \nsense of love for his family.\n  My mother Emma likewise in so many ways was a strong spiritual person \nwhom I still today call Saint Emma. I call her Saint Emma because \nnothing can even shake her from her roots. She is who she is. She has a \ngreat faith. She is not afraid to live or die. I remember many times in \nmy life, including the death of my oldest brother Leandro, my mother \nwas the one who held the family together after a tragic accident on our \nranch back in 1992. To her selfless--completely selfless--love which \nshe has taught the world and has taught my family, I thank her from the \nbottom of my heart.\n  I often have asked my mother: Is there a single person in the world \nyou do not like, or is there a single person in the world you hate? My \nmother will think about it for a minute, and she will say no. She says: \nI love everybody. Just as she loves everybody, everybody loves her. So \nI thank her for her faith and all that she has taught us.\n  To my brothers and sisters--there are seven of us still left. My \noldest brother Leandro, who passed away, taught us a lot about history \nand about the culture of our community. I remember his days working \nwith Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers and then coming back to \nthe ranch and farming and working with us for so long. He is and always \nwill be my hero. I miss him.\n  To all the rest of my brothers and to my sisters, they have all been \nthe bedrock also of my successes. Today, here on the floor of the \nSenate, as I give my farewell address, I have the honor of being joined \nby Congressman John Salazar, who is a Congressman for the Third \nCongressional District which covers about 65 percent of the State of \nColorado. Congressman Salazar, in his own way, is a personification of \nmany things that my family stands for. If you look at his history and \nhis profile, he is a farmer, he is a soldier and veteran, he is a \nbusinessman. He knows issues such as water. He knows and has taught me \nso much. As he and I have grown up together, being here in Washington \nwith him has been one of the highlights of my entire life.\n  I wish to also thank all of my colleagues here, and I will say just a \nfew specific words about them in a few minutes.\n  In early February, the Senate selects a Member to perform its oldest \nnonlegislative tradition, the reader of George Washington's Farewell \nAddress on the floor of the Senate. In 2006, Senator Harry Reid, the \nmajority leader, gave me the honor of doing that reading. I think \nWashington's famous words are important for us to remember at this time \nof transformation in America. In his farewell to public life in 1796, \nWashington warned us of the dangers of partisanship, of geographic \nsectionalism, and the politics of division. Washington said:\n\n       We are one Nation. With slight shades of differences you \n     have the same religion, manners, habits, and political \n     principles. You have in a common cause fought and triumphed \n     together; the independence and liberty you possess are the \n     work of joint counsels and joint efforts of common dangers, \n     sufferings, and successes.\n\n  Washington's Farewell Address is a message to be reborn today. In \nthis moment, in this time, with the inauguration next Tuesday, with \nthis body in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, there is a \nnew hope, with a growing sense that we are all in this together, and we \nare again becoming the one Nation the first President of the United \nStates of America imagined.\n  Our next President, Barack Obama, embodies this historic change. He \nis asking us not to think of ourselves first as red States and blue \nStates but as Americans first, with obligations of service to one \nanother. We can solve our problems, no matter how difficult they are. \nWe can reach the horizon of human possibilities no matter how difficult \nit might seem, but in order to do that, we must all work together. It \nis in this spirit of collaboration--of Nation before party, of \ncompromise, of results-driven government--that Americans believe we can \nget it done this time.\n  I owe a debt of gratitude to all of you in this Chamber who have \nguided me in our work over the last several years. I wish to comment \nspecifically just on four or five areas I am very proud of that we have \nworked on together in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S636]]\n\n  The first is about the forgotten America and the work we have done \ntogether to make sure the rural part of America that has so often been \nforgotten is no longer forgotten. When you look at the United States of \nAmerica, the fact is, there are about 3,000 counties. About 1,700 of \nthose counties are characterized as rural, and in each of those \ncounties, we have significant unemployment. We have income disparities \nof some $10,000 per capita between people who live in those rural \ncounties and the people who don't live in those rural counties. So it \nhas been important for us to address the issues and needs of rural \nAmerica. We have done that in some significant ways. The passage of the \nfarm bill, which we ultimately had to pass out of this Senate, I think, \non three or four different occasions during the last year, was a \nculmination of that promise to the forgotten America.\n  I wish to thank Senator Reid for making sure we kept our feet to the \nfire to get that bill done. I wish to thank the people who were \ninvolved in that legislation, including the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Tom Harkin; our ranking member, the great Senator from Georgia, \nSaxby Chambliss; as well as Kent Conrad and others who were involved in \nthat historic effort, including all of the members of the Agriculture \nCommittee.\n  Secondly, the creation of a new energy frontier. There were many of \nus, including some of us who are on the Senate floor this morning, who \nset about some 4 years ago with a vision that we could set America \nfree; that we could deal with the reality of the inescapable forces of \nour time of national security and economic opportunity at home and \nenvironmental security for our planet; and that we could set America \nfree from our addiction to foreign oil. Under the leadership of Senator \nBingaman from New Mexico as chairman of the committee, and the work of \nSenator Pete Domenici and other members of the Senate Energy Committee, \nI believe we have taken some steps in that direction which are very \nsignificant. There is much more we must do, and we are absolutely \ncommitted to making sure we take the moon shot to energy independence \nin the years ahead. Of this I am confident: this time we will not fail. \nWe cannot afford to fail in the energy imperative for our Nation.\n  I thank all of my colleagues with whom I have worked on the Senate \nEnergy Committee. I also wish to thank every Member of this Chamber who \nhas worked to make sure America's defenses remain strong and that we \nprotect America at home through homeland security efforts and the \nimplementation and recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, and the \nefforts we have worked on together in this Chamber to give the United \nStates of America a new direction with respect to the war in Iraq.\n  It is because of the debates that have taken place in this Chamber \nthat today we are on a new pathway and new plan in Iraq. As divisive as \nthose debates have been, I am confident that the people who worked on \nthat issue had the best interests of the United States of America in \nmind.\n  It is in that vein that I enjoyed very much the work I did with many \nSenate Democrats and Republicans in trying to craft the legislation \nthat implemented the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group. Sixteen \nMembers of the Senate joined us in that legislation. Because that \nlegislation really created the roadmap for where we are in Iraq today, \nI am pleased with the work I was able to do in that effort.\n  I will never forget the fact that Senator Levin, Senator Warner, and \nSenator Reid were among the first people who took me to that place in \nthe Middle East, places I had never traveled to before, right into \nBaghdad, to places around that country. It was information I gleaned \nfrom those trips that helped me participate in one of the debates of \nour time that characterizes the last 4 or 5 years in America.\n  I wish to make a quick comment about health care. There are many \npeople who have worked on this issue over time. I do think that what we \nwere able to do with the Children's Health Insurance Program and the \npassage of that bill last year demonstrates how Republicans and \nDemocrats can come together. When I see an Orrin Hatch and a Max Baucus \nworking together to move forward with legislation that is so enormously \nimportant for the children of America, it is the right step for us as \nwe try to deal with this enormous domestic problem that faces all of \nus. And there have been so many people who have been involved in those \nefforts.\n  Finally, I have spent a lot of time in this Chamber at this desk and \nmy other desk working on the issue of immigration. It is an issue \nwhich, frankly, still continues to call out in a very clarion and clear \nvoice that we must get to a resolution with respect to this issue \nbecause it affects so much. It affects our national security, it \naffects whether we really are a Nation of laws, and it affects the \nreality of 12 million people who live in the shadows of America today. \nI am hopeful that with President Obama's leadership, the leadership of \nthe Senate, and the leadership of the House of Representatives, \nRepublicans and Democrats coming together, this is an issue we will \nfinally resolve in the year ahead.\n  As I conclude, I want to make one more tribute to Senator Harry Reid. \nWe both are men of faith, and we often share our faith together. He \nencouraged me, along with Senator Mark Pryor, to be a part of the \nWednesday Prayer Breakfast in the Senate. I was proud to chair that \nbreakfast with Mark Pryor over the last several years and with my \ncolleague, Senator Mike Enzi.\n  I appreciate the fact that among those of us who attended that Prayer \nBreakfast, I am certain that among the 100 Members of the Senate, there \nis a great common sense that the possibilities of humanity are somehow \nachievable to all of us, that it is we as human beings who somehow \nstand in the way of finding what those human possibilities are for all \nof humanity.\n  I think back to a story some of you have heard of my grandmother who \nlost five of her eight children before those children reached the age \nof 5 years old. I always ask myself: What is it that kept her going? At \nthe end of the day, my answer to my question has been that what kept \nher going was the fact that she had a faith in the future, that somehow \naround the corner, in a future she could not see, the world would be \nmuch better for her children and for her grandchildren. For sure she \ncould not have seen that the eight surviving children of her only son \nwould all graduate from high school. I am sure she could not foresee \nthat one would become a U.S. Senator, another a member of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. What she could see was the world would be \nbetter for humanity. It is a common bond for Members of this august, \nwonderful Chamber of the U.S. Senate.\n  As I close, I want to share the prayer that I have shared with \nSenator Reid and many of my colleagues in this Chamber before. It is a \nprayer that my brother, Leandro, the oldest in the family, learned when \nhe worked with Cesar Chavez, the founder of the United Farm Workers of \nAmerica. In many ways, I believe this prayer embodies what we do in \npublic service.\n  The prayer is as follows:\n\n     Show me the suffering of the most miserable;\n     So I will know my people's plight.\n     Free me to pray for others;\n     For you are present in every person.\n     Help me take responsibility for my own life;\n     So that I can be free at last.\n     Grant me courage to serve others;\n     For in service there is true life.\n     Give me honesty and patience;\n     So that the Spirit will be alive among us.\n     Let the spirit flourish and grow;\n     So that we will never tire of the struggle.\n     Let us remember those who have died for justice;\n     For they have given us life.\n     Help us love even those who hate us;\n     So we can change the world.\n\n  Mr. President, one thing I forgot to say. The 5 million people of the \nState of Colorado have give me a great honor to serve as their attorney \ngeneral and to serve on their behalf. I will submit for the Record some \nof the work we have done in the representation of all of the 5 million \npeople of the State of Colorado. No matter where they were from, no \nmatter what their economic circumstance, they knew we were working on \ntheir behalf.\n  I am elated that Senator Mark Udall has joined us in the Senate \nbecause I am absolutely confident he will become one of the stellar \nSenators of this body.\n\n[[Page S637]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe genealogy chart of my family and a list of the wonderful DC and \nColorado staff.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Descendants of Capitan Juan de Salazar\n\n       Juan de Salazar, Conquistador, born 1520, became a Noble in \n     1543,\n       Juan de Salazar, Conquistador and founder of Santa Fe, born \n     1559.

Mr. President, I thank my wonderful staff, many of whom \nare here today, some of whom are watching back in Colorado, for having \nmade this possible. Without their great effort, frankly, we would not \nbe able to do what we have done. I thank them.\n  I thank my good friend, the Presiding Officer. I look forward to our \ncontinuing to work together.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise simply to say a few words of \npersonal tribute to our dear friend, the distinguished Senator from \nColorado, who has just spoken so beautifully.\n  We are going to miss this man. He has only been here 4 years, but he \nhas made an extraordinary contribution to the Senate and to our \ncountry. I first got to know Ken Salazar in 2000 when I had the honor \nto be the Vice Presidential candidate for the Democratic Party and went \nto Colorado. I could see at the first meeting at which I met him--I had \nan instantaneous reaction to him--that this was a person of strength, \nof warmth, of character, of purpose. Every day I have known Senator \nSalazar since then has only deepened those feelings about him. You can \nfeel all his strength and all of his purpose and all of his faith and \nall of his passion and all of his humility as you listen to this final \nstatement he just made on the Senate floor.\n  I love the fact that one of the last items Senator Salazar asked was \nunanimous consent to print in the Record his family genealogy because \nit speaks not only to his extraordinary history and greatness but to \nthe greatness of our country.\n  It is, obviously, a fact that the Hispanic-American population has \ngrown and is growing significantly in our country. I have been with Ken \non a few occasions, I say to Senator Reid, when people have said: You \nare Mexican-American. When did your family come to this country? And \nthey are expecting to hear 20 years ago, 50 years ago, maybe 90 years \nago. And Ken will say with that quiet strength: My family came here in \nthe 16th century. The 16th century, before the Pilgrims came. It \nreminds us of a history which, as Senator Salazar said, was for a long \ntime suppressed. But the Hispanic, Mexican-American contribution to \nAmerica is long, it is deep, it is proud, it is strong, and it will \ncontinue to grow.\n  Senator Salazar was raised in a tradition, like so many of us, where \nwe were told by our parents that to be a good American, you don't have \nto assimilate or homogenize. You contribute to our country by being who \nyou are and what you are. In the diversity of this great country, we \ngain more strength. That has certainly been true of the Mexican-\nAmerican community, and it is particularly true of this great American.\n  Senator Salazar talked about his faith, about his family, about the \nlove of country he learned from his parents. This man is, in so many \nways, the quintessential American. He brings this unique cultural \nheritage of his roots, family roots, way back in Mexico, but he \ncombines those with the values we associate with the American West, the \nlove of the land, individualism, a sense of honor, a sense of \nconfidence that has become so much a part of the American character. \nAnd he added to that, which is where it all begins, as he believes and \nI believe and most of us believe, with faith, that we are here for a \npurpose, that our existence here is not an accident, and that we have a \nseries of values that come from our faith which are expressed in the \nfounding American documents and lead us forward.\n  Senator Salazar served our Nation brilliantly in this 4 years he has \nbeen in the Senate. What a thrill to have met Ken in 2000 and to have \nplayed some small part in having him come here and then to have him as \na colleague--as Senator Reid said so well, to watch the role he has \nplayed. He is a doer. He did not come to make speeches. He makes a very \ngood speech, as we just heard. He came to get things done for the \npeople of Colorado and for the people of America, and he has done that \nover and over again.\n  In the so-called nuclear option, I always viewed it as the integrity \nof the Supreme Court selection process. Senator Reid referred to my own \nrecent situation. Senator Salazar came forward, a dear friend, \nincredible across the entire Senate--in this case, the Senate \nDemocratic caucus--and just on my behalf and on behalf of what he \nthought was right, created a path forward that made me feel great--I \ncan say that personally--but I hope also and I believe facilitated a \npath forward and reconciliation within the Democratic caucus. \nObviously, it would not have happened without Senator Reid. That was \nextremely constructive.\n  It was a tough decision for Senator Salazar to leave the Senate. It \nis a tough one for us to see him go because he is unique here. But he \nhas responded to the call to serve our country. He will play an \nextraordinarily important role as a true American environmentalist, a \nlover of the land, in preserving all that the Interior Department \noversees that is America's great natural gift from God--the land. He \nwill also, in a very thoughtful way, play a central role in one of the \nmost significant transformations American Government has made in a long \ntime, which is to turn us toward energy independence and a cleaner, \nmore reliable source of American energy.\n  I wish him well. The only comfort in seeing him leave the Senate is \nthat he is only going down the street a bit. We know he will be here to \nwork with us.\n  I cannot think of a better way to end this simple tribute to a dear \nfriend and a great American than to say that over the years we have \ncome to know each other, both greeted each other and at moments of \nchallenge said a particular two words to one another and then said \ngoodbye to each other with these two words in which we have joined our \nrespective ethnic heritages. And the two words that I say to you, dear \nfriend, fellow colleague, as you leave the Senate to serve our country \nas Secretary of the Interior, and with my confidence that will not be \nthe end of your service\n\n[[Page S638]]\n\nto our country but will go on, in my opinion, higher and higher, those \ntwo words bringing our two ethnic heritages together are ``Viva \nchutzpah.'' God bless you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I, too, rise to commend and thank the \nSenator from Colorado for his extraordinary service to the Senate, to \nthe people of Colorado, and to the United States of America. He is a \nconsummate gentleman. He brought to this Chamber great judgment and \ngreat passion to provide opportunity for all our citizens. He also \nbrought the distinctive values of his State of Colorado--a rough sense \nof individuality, coupled with a commitment to building community; not \njust an isolated group of people but a community of citizens--and these \nvalues have been extraordinarily important to us. His friendship and \nhis leadership have been extraordinarily important to all of us.\n  I see the Presiding Officer is my colleague and friend from Rhode \nIsland, and as he pointed out a few days ago, they were both attorneys \ngeneral together: Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island, of course, and \nSenator Salazar for the State of Colorado. But we were all together in \nRhode Island, and I was reflecting, Ken, I don't know what the \nDepartment of the Interior has to do with Rhode Island. OK, the Outer \nContinental Shelf. There is a reason for my tribute.\n  But we were there together at an event, and Senator Pell, our dear \ncolleague, came. He was frail and ailing, but immediately Senator \nSalazar rushed over to him to say: Thank you, Senator Pell. Because as \nhe told us, the fact is he and his brother, now in the Congress, and \nother family members were able to go to college because of the Pell \ngrant. That spirit of opportunity, of giving Americans a chance, and \nthen standing back and letting them do remarkable things, embodied the \nPell grant and so many other programs. That is what not only prepared \nyou for the Senate but gave you the vision to do all you have done to \nhelp your constituents and the people of this country to see the \nopportunity which is America.\n  You and your family have been in Colorado for five generations. I \nfeel like a recent arrival. My folks got here from Ireland in 1850. So \nfrom a new American, a new American to an old established family: Thank \nyou for your service; thank you for your friendship. Good luck, Mr. \nSecretary.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I didn't intend to say anything about our \nfriend, Ken Salazar today, but in listening to his remarks and knowing \nthe contribution he has made around here in 4 short years, I couldn't \nresist. I am sure the Presiding Officer, if he wasn't presiding, would \ncome down and do the same thing.\n  I first met Senator Salazar before he was a Senator; in fact, as we \nwere getting sworn in as attorneys general together, probably in \nDecember of 1998, if I remember correctly. We both had been elected to \nour offices of attorney general in November of 1998, and we went to a \nNational Association of Attorneys General meeting. We immediately \nbonded. It was very clear and very evident to everyone there that he \nhad the right stuff to be a great attorney general. It turned out he \nwas a great attorney general for the State of Colorado.\n  I encouraged him to come to the Senate when Senator Campbell \nannounced his retirement, and I think it was probably the best thing I \nhave done since I have been in the Senate was to try to get Ken Salazar \nto come here.\n  You know, when I think back about our Founding Fathers and how they \ndesigned the Senate and how I think they envisioned the Senate should \nwork, they had in mind a person such as Ken Salazar to be in this body. \nThey probably couldn't even imagine that Colorado would become a State. \nI mean, they probably couldn't even fathom the way this country would \ngrow and change over the decades and centuries. But I think when they \nset up the Senate, they wanted people with intelligence, work ethic, \ncharacter, and people who could put their personal views aside for the \ngreater good. That is what we have in Ken Salazar. He is all those \nthings.\n  He has been a Senator's Senator for the last 4 years he has been in \nWashington. I know his brother John is here. I know John is very proud \nof him, and I know the State of Colorado is very proud of the work he \nhas done. And they should be because there is a lot to be proud about \nwith Senator Ken Salazar.\n  I know all 100 of us couldn't be here today. We have some committee \nhearings going on, and we also have the inauguration coming Tuesday, so \npeople are kind of bracing themselves and preparing for all of that. \nBut if all 100 were here, I think you would have 99 people stand up and \nbasically say what some of us have already said; that he has been an \nextraordinary Senator, an extraordinary person, and he has had a great \nimpact in his short time in the Senate.\n  One last thing, on a personal note. One of the things I love about \nKen Salazar as a person is his deep and very serious faith. I asked him \nto come in and chair the Senate Prayer Breakfast, which he took to new \nheights. He expanded the number of people who were coming to that. He \nwas great. He chaired the National Prayer Breakfast for a year, and I \nthink they probably set a record that year for attendance and in the \nquality of the speakers they had that year. So he has had not just a \npolitical and governmental influence but an even broader and deeper \ninfluence.\n  Senator Salazar, we are going to miss you very much. We all love you, \nand we all know you are going to do great things at Interior. We know \nthere are a lot of challenges America is facing right now, but we know \nyou are part of the solution. God has called you to be where you are \ngoing right now. So thank you for your service, and we are going to \ndearly miss you in this body.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I, first, thank you for your \ncourtesy in volunteering to take over the duties of Presiding Officer \nfor a moment so I could be relieved of those duties and come to my desk \nand have the chance to say something about a very dear friend whom we \nwill miss enormously. I know we have something very important happening \nin a few minutes, so I will speak very briefly, but I don't want to let \nthis opportunity pass.\n  We had an energetic group of freshmen Senators come in 2 years ago, \nand we found Ken was feeling kind of lonely because his class had been \nsort of a bit smaller than ours. So we sort of adopted him into our \ngroup. He has been kind of a big brother to all of us. I have had the \nprivilege of knowing him as an attorney general, and I will not belabor \nthe point, but what people have said about him as a peacemaker, about \nhim as a friend, and about him as somebody who cares deeply about the \nduty of public service, I can attest to firsthand from many years of \nexperience.\n  So I will only say we will miss you very deeply. We are enormously \nconfident in you. The Department of the Interior is lucky to have you, \nPresident-elect Obama is fortunate to have you join his Cabinet, and we \nwish you Godspeed, my friend.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am so honored to be here with my \nfriend, Ken Salazar. When I think about Ken Salazar, I think about Ken \nSalazar in Colorado in his beautiful mountains, and I think of the idea \nof him going to be the head of the Department of the Interior is \nsomething that is a gift to this country.\n  But I wish to tell one story about Ken. He and I were in Colorado \ntogether, out there for Barack Obama, and they had a big RV with the \nPresident-elect's picture on it. And Ken Salazar is the only Senator \nwho would insist on driving the RV on his own. He did it in style, with \nhis big cowboy hat on. There we were, in the middle of the mountains on \nthis winding road, when all of a sudden we see flashing lights behind \nus. Sure enough, we were being\n\n[[Page S639]]\n\npulled over. There were 20 people in this RV and a caravan of media \nbehind us. Ken was as calm as he could be. He pulled over to the side \nof the road, the deputy comes up--with his big cowboy hat on--and Ken \nrolls down the window and says: Can I help you?\n  Of course, we think he is getting a ticket for speeding, and he was \nready to accept whatever this was. But the deputy says: Sir, your \nlicense tabs are in the wrong corner.\n  And so Ken said: Oh, so sorry. And he gets out with this deputy \nlooking on and with the caravan of media behind with all the cameras, \nand a press guy yelling: This is off the record.\n  So Ken's picture is there in the Denver Post trying to change his \nlicense tabs around the corners.\n  But it was Ken Salazar who wanted to have that moment and that \nfreedom of driving through the mountains of Colorado at whatever the \ncost, and he will be a true tribute to his home State and to this \ncountry.\n  I am taking over the Prayer Breakfast from Ken, and I have seen \nfirsthand his great faith in God but also the faith he has in his \nfamily, whom I see here, and the people of this country. We are all \nvery lucky to have him, though we will miss him as a mentor and friend \nin the Senate.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my \ncolleagues to strongly support my friend and colleague, Senator Ken \nSalazar, as President-elect Obama's choice to lead the Department of \nthe Interior.\n  For reasons I will explain shortly, I believe this man--a fifth \ngeneration son of the West whose ancestors settled Santa Fe before \nAmerica gained independence--is uniquely qualified and experienced to \nlead the U.S. Department of the Interior.\n  I am very proud to have served the State of Colorado with him. He is \nan outstanding public servant and he will make an outstanding Secretary \nof the Interior.\n  Our colleagues in the Senate are well aware of Senator Salazar's \nexcellent record of leadership here--he has worked across the aisle and \nwith diverse stakeholders on many issues ranging from health care to \nnational security.\n  As a member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Ken has \nworked to extend critical renewable energy tax credits, protect our \nnatural resources and encourage environmentally responsible development \nof domestic energy sources. I've been proud to work with him on a wide \nrange of issues, including protection of our public lands and water \nresources in Colorado. I'm especially proud of our work together to \npass legislation that allowed a lovely older woman, Betty Dick, to pass \nher final days in peace on land she treasured at the Rocky Mountain \nNational Park.\n  Ken, I think Betty would be proud of you today too.\n  Even before his time in the Senate, Ken has been a recognized leader \nin the West. As a farmer and rancher, Ken has always had a close \nrelationship with the land and with rural communities. He has spoken \neloquently about what he calls ``the forgotten America'' and he has \nbeen a steadfast champion of the land, water and people of the West.\n  As the executive director of Colorado's Department of Natural \nResources, Ken used his unique background and experience to protect the \nenvironment and Colorado's communities, educate youth about our natural \nresources, and defend Colorado's water.\n  He helped create Great Outdoors Colorado, GOCO, and led it to become \none of the most successful land conservation programs in the country.\n  While serving as Colorado's Attorney General, Ken worked to make our \ncommunities safer and address gang violence. He also led efforts to \npreserve open space during his two terms as Attorney General, where he \nwas well-known as a champion of the natural environment.\n  Ken will bring his rural values--hard work, honesty, and integrity--\nto the Department of Interior and help address the many challenges \nfacing this Department. From addressing Interior's ethical lapses to \ntackling our country's lack of transmission infrastructure, Ken will \nwork hard to put the Department of the Interior back on the right \ntrack.\n  I would be remiss if I did not mention Senator Salazar's family and, \nin particular, his mother, Emma. Like her sons, she is a remarkable \nColoradan. I had the opportunity to visit her at the Salazar ranch, Los \nRincones, last year.\n  And if her son, Ken, demonstrates the same indomitable spirit, \nstrength of character and wisdom of his mother--and I believe he will \nhe should be an outstanding Secretary of the Interior.\n  I urge my colleagues to swiftly confirm Senator Salazar as the \nSecretary of the Interior.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The VICE PRESIDENT.

Congratulations.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Thank you very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. On behalf of all Senators, I congratulate and welcome our \nnew colleague, Ted Kaufman, to the Senate. Senator Kaufman earned his \nbachelor's degree from Duke University, his MBA from the Wharton \nSchool, University of Pennsylvania. He moved to Delaware to work for \nthe DuPont Company, as many people have done over the years, working in \nfinance, technical, and marketing positions.\n  When Joe Biden was elected at the age of 29, in 1973, Senator Biden \nasked Ted to take a leave from DuPont to help him set up his new office \nin Washington. Senator Biden asked Ted for 1 year, only 1 year. He, of \ncourse, has given him a lot more than that.\n  This is a remarkable tenure. It shows Ted Kaufman's extraordinary \nloyalty to the service of his country by working for Senator Biden.\n  There is only one Joe Biden. Senator Kaufman will replace him, but no \none will ever fill the shoes of Joe Biden. As was said on this floor \nyesterday at great length, Joe Biden is a unique individual. But \nSenator Kaufman has known Senator Biden for a long time and worked with \nhim, up real close. He\n\n[[Page S640]]\n\nknows he has to be Ted Kaufman, not Joe Biden, and he will do that.\n  We who work in the Senate know of the strength of Joe Biden, but one \nof the reasons he has had the strength he has had over these years was \nbecause his back was always protected by Ted Kaufman.\n  In this time of great consequence, Senator Kaufman's decades of \nexperience and the wisdom accumulated over those years will serve him \nwell as he serves the people of Delaware and the country in the Senate.\n  Senator Kaufman, welcome to the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The senior Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, actually it is not the first time I have \nbeen recognized as senior Senator. For about 2 months now, since Joe \nBiden was nominated and elected as Vice President, people have been \nreferring to me as the senior Senator. I always have to correct them \nand I say no, it is 4 days, 3 hours, 12 minutes away. Today we counted \ndown, today we counted down to zero.\n  Yesterday, when Senator Biden resigned at 5 o'clock, I think for 17 \nhours I was both the junior and senior Senator. Dick Durbin was that \nfor almost 2 months, from Illinois.\n  I asked one of my colleagues, Do you think I will get paid more for \nthat? He said no, probably not. You shouldn't be.\n  We lament the loss of Joe Biden from the Senate. I am thrilled he is \ngoing to have the opportunity to become the first Delawarean ever to be \nthe Vice President of the United States. As wonderful as he is as a \nSenator, he will do more good for his country in his new role than he \ncould have done in this service, so it is a good thing for the \nadministration and for the country and ultimately for Delaware.\n  If we have to lose Joe Biden to the Vice Presidency of the United \nStates, we could not ask for a better person to take his place than Ted \nKaufman. Sometimes people come here and they have never served in \nelected office. Ted has not. But he comes here steeped in the knowledge \nof the Senate. He knows the place, knows the way this place works, has \na pretty good idea of how to make it work better.\n  He has served as Joe Biden's chief of staff for about 20 years. Joe \nhas been in the Senate for 36 years. For over half those years, Ted was \nhis chief of staff and maybe in a sense his alter ego. We all have \nthose. You couldn't ask for a better one than Ted Kaufman.\n  Our leader said, Ted couldn't get into University of Delaware but he \nwas able to get into Duke as an undergraduate and studied mechanical \nengineering there. Later he couldn't get into the University of \nDelaware MBA program but he did get into the Wharton School at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania and went on to work for the DuPont Company \nfor a while and met a guy running for the Senate at the tender age of \n29. A lot of people in our State got excited by Joe Biden, signed up to \nvolunteer for his campaign, and then ended up being his chief of staff.\n  I think it is fair to say that Joe Biden would not have been maybe \nthe only Senator in our State's history to be elected to 7 terms as \nU.S. Senator but for the support of Ted; not just for those 19 years, \nbut for being his friend all those years and all the years since to \nwork with Joe through two Presidential campaigns, to be his adviser and \ncounselor, and to always have his back.\n  Ted is smart. We have a lot of smart people here. But he is also \nwise. Ted is very well spoken. He is a wonderful speaker. There are a \nlot of good speakers here. He is also a very good listener.\n  Ted takes his work seriously, takes our work seriously. One of the \nthings I love about Ted is he doesn't take himself all that seriously. \nHe is a lot of fun to be with. He will be a good colleague and a good \nfriend.\n  He inherits a good staff. He shared with me he expects to largely \nkeep that staff together. People come and go in these jobs, but the \ngood news is most of the people on board now will stay on board. For \nus, myself and our at-large Congressman Mike Castle, I think that is \nvery good news. He will be taking over the same committees Senator \nBiden has been serving on, in Judiciary and Foreign Relations, and I am \nsure he will do an excellent job there.\n  In addition to working for DuPont and spending 20 years as Joe's \nchief of staff, he has also taught. He taught at Duke in a couple of \ncapacities there. He taught at Sanford, as I recall. And for the last, \ngosh, I want to say for 15 years, he served on the board of governors \nthat oversees and tries to make sure we promote democracy in other \ncountries. We do that through a variety of ways but in part through our \nmedia operations. He has been confirmed, I think, on the board of \ngovernors maybe four terms. I don't know he will serve four terms here. \nHe promised his wife he would not but time will tell.\n  Speaking of his wife, Ted tells me he started dating his wife when \nshe was 12--no, it was 18--and they have been married since 1960. They \nhave three kids. They are not kids--daughters, and they have seven \ngrandchildren, something like that. It is a wonderful family.\n  I was talking about Joe Biden when he stepped down yesterday and gave \na beautiful speech. I said Joe is the real deal in terms of family \nvalues--a loving father, grandfather, and Ted is very much out of that \nsame mold.\n  While we lament the departure of Joe and are thrilled about his \nopportunity to be our Vice President, we very warmly welcome Ted to \nthis family. I think in the history of this country there are maybe \n1700 or so people who have been privileged to serve as Senator. Add a \nfew extra ones this week out of the regular order. But this is a good \nthing for our State, for the Senate. As a point of personal privilege, \nit is a special joy for me.\n  Ted Kaufman, to you and Lynne and your family, welcome to this \nfamily. God bless you.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, one of the really great things about this \njob is I am going to be able to achieve one of his great objectives; \nthat is, to be the senior Senator from Delaware. I thank you for your \nremarks; they are gracious as usual.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, we are joined on the floor today by \nSenator Biden. He is standing back here talking to three of our new \nSenators. Unfortunately, he cannot speak as a Senator, but we will find \nan opportunity for him to preside from time to time and get some things \noff of his chest. But I know if he could speak he would like to share \nwith us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S640-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S640-S641]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO SENATORS\n\n\n                               Joe Biden\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank you.\n  I welcome and commend Senator Kaufman as he succeeds Senator Joe \nBiden.\n  I particularly want to say a few words about Joe Biden. He has had an \nextraordinary career in the Senate, and he is going to be an \nextraordinary asset for President-elect Barack Obama.\n  Senator Obama, the President-elect, said very clearly why he chose \nJoe Biden. He said that when the tough decisions come, and they will \ncome quickly and often, Joe Biden is the guy he wants in the room with \nhim. And I think that choice was extraordinarily inspired because no \none can bring the breadth of knowledge and experience, not only with \nrespect to the Senate but with respect to domestic policy and indeed \ninternational policy, as Joe Biden.\n  The other thing Joe brings to this great challenge of the country is \nhis profound decency and sense of fairness and his commitment to make \nsure America is still a place of opportunity for all citizens. Those \nvalues were shaped in Scranton, PA, where he grew up. They were shaped \nby his mother and father. His mother, Jean Finnegan Biden, is still an \ninspiration to him today, and I am sure one of the reasons he is the \nguy who should be in the room with the President is because if he needs \nadvice, his mother is still there, and I think that is something he \ncherishes.\n\n[[Page S641]]\n\n  Joe has served in this body for many years. He was the author of the \nViolence Against Women Act to ensure that our criminal justice system, \nour system of law, recognized the particular dangers posed to women. He \nwas the chief architect of the COPS bill, which put hundreds of \nthousands of police officers on the street, recognizing that the basic \nresponsibility of government is to provide safety and security to its \ncitizens. There are a lot of people who talked about that, but Joe \nrecognized that if there are more police on the streets, that would \nhappen, and indeed it has. We have seen that statistic over the last \nfew years.\n  As the preeminent expert on foreign relations, he has traveled the \nworld and brought his wisdom to foreign leaders but also sought their \ncandid advice with respect to our leadership in the world, and he will \ncontinue to do that. He has just concluded a trip to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I had hoped to be with him, but duties here prevented me. \nBut that is typical of Joe--hands-on, go to the source of the issue, \nexamine the problem, and move forward.\n  He has had an illustrious career. Beyond his success as a Senator, \nhis success as a master of foreign relations, a leader in terms of \ndomestic policy, has been his extraordinary family: his wife Jill, an \nextraordinarily gifted professional in her own right; Ashley, Hunter, \nand Beau; and I know the five grandchildren are particular joys to Joe. \nWe are particularly respectful that today his son Beau serves in the \nuniform of the United States overseas and is someone Joe thinks of \nconstantly. Once again, in those tough decisions in the White House, I \nthink Joe will have a special equity because his son serves along with \nthe sons and daughters of other Americans, and he will recognize that \nwhen they make difficult decisions regarding the deployment of our \nforces.\n  It has been an honor to serve with him. It is an honor to call him a \ncolleague and a friend.\n\n\n                            Hillary Clinton\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to say a few words about our other \ncolleague who is departing, Senator Hillary Clinton, an extraordinarily \ngifted lady. I had the privilege of traveling with her to Afghanistan \nand Iraq in 2003. I was impressed with her knowledge of international \naffairs and her personal knowledge of so many leaders; it was a first-\nname basis. So I think we have, in the presence of Hillary Rodham \nClinton, an extraordinary asset to the State Department.\n  Senator Obama made a wise choice. She brings not only great \nexperience with great recognition but a tenacious attitude toward work \nand service. She is one of the hardest working people I have ever met. \nAll of these skills are going to be important at this moment in our \nhistory. We have to reform and transform, indeed, our national security \nposture away from the unilateral military force, which I think was the \nwrong approach of this administration, to a much more nuanced, broader \nembrace of diplomacy, backed up by a strong military force. Hillary \nClinton can and will do that, working together with President-elect \nBarack Obama and Vice President-elect Joe Biden.\n  She has been a friend to me, she has helped me, she has inspired me, \nand indeed, perhaps the true test, she has taught me a great deal about \nnot only substantive issues but about how one conducts one's self to a \nhigher standard. I believe she will continue to maintain those \nstandards as she goes forward.\n  So we are losing several dear colleagues--Ken Salazar, Joe Biden, and \nHillary Rodham Clinton. The good news is that America still has their \nextraordinarily valuable services.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in congratulating \nthe new Member from Delaware just sworn in this morning and wish him \nwell in his tenure here in the Senate. I look forward to working with \nhim as we move forward on an important stimulus bill.\n  Everyone knows our economy is in tough shape, and that includes the \nfolks in my home State of Washington where we have seen too many \nhousing foreclosures and too many jobs cuts. That is why it is very \nimportant, as we start the discussion on the stimulus next week, that \nwe get our priorities right, that find a way to inject capital and \nconfidence and construction back into our economy.\n  Although we must act urgently, I believe we must also take care to \nget things right in the stimulus package and take the time necessary to \nmake sure we are getting it right. Getting it right means maintaining a \nlaser focus on job-creation activities in the short term and over the \nnext few decades. This should be our top priority when putting together \nthe stimulus package and making sure we are providing businesses with \nthe certainty they need in the Tax Code to make investments now. That \nis why I believe now is the time to put all of the good ideas on the \ntable. I was so happy to hear President-elect Obama stating a \nwillingness to embrace any good ideas Members or America had for this \ncritical stimulus package.\n  Well, to me, there is no better idea or opportunity than ensuring \nthis stimulus provides a bold and definitive step toward a clean energy \nfuture. Clean energy will create millions of family-supporting jobs \nthat cannot be outsourced and can provide a secure foundation for a \nvery prosperous future for the United States.\n  Investing in clean energy also reduces a lot of risk that is in the \nmarketplace right now. Whether it be the billions of dollars we spend \noverseas on foreign energy, or the fuel price volatility we saw last \nyear, or the fear of supply shock that comes on a regular basis. And \nobviously there is uncertainty about global warming and the crisis it \nmight lead to here and across the world.\n  South Korea understands this. Last Tuesday, the country's Prime \nMinister announced that South Korea would invest $38 billion over the \nnext 5 years on environmental projects to stimulate the economy and \ncreate nearly 1 million jobs. Now, $38 billion may not sound like a lot \nhere in the United States given some of the numbers people have been \nthrowing around lately, but $38 billion for a country with a GDP less \nthan one-tenth of our size--that would be like the United States \nputting up $400 billion just to match the downpayment South Korea is \ninvesting in its clean energy future.\n  South Korea understands that a nation that manages to win the \ninternational race to develop clean energy technologies and industries \nwill have a leg up in determining the energy platform and all of the \nother solutions that will follow. South Korea knows this because it has \nalready been a leader in lithium-ion battery technology made for cell \nphones and for laptops, and now they are utilizing that knowledge base \nto come up with lithium-ion battery solutions for cars.\n  Early movers will have the edge in the largest new industry of the \n21st century--clean energy. The question is, Are we going to put up the \nresources to make sure the United States has that first-mover \nadvantage? Well, I would say that the Government lately has spent or \nput at risk an incredible amount of tax dollars--or I should say future \ntax dollars. In the last 16 weeks or so, some people have estimated \nthat number as high as $10 trillion. If you think about it, how do you \nadd up $10 trillion? Well, about $2 trillion in FDIC assurances, about \n$1.75 trillion in Federal Reserve commercial paper purchases, about \n$900 billion in term auction facility lending, about $600 billion to \ninsure money market funds, about $600 billion to cover Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, about $550 billion for discount Federal Reserve loans, \nabout $500 billion to insure FDIC deposits, about $300 billion for FHA \nmortgage relief, about $250 billion for CitiGroup debt, about $225 \nbillion for security loan facility lending, about $200 billion for \ncontinued debt, about $112 billion for AIG, and a few more items that \nare not only in the billions of dollars.\n  So while I can quibble about how some of this money was spent, I do \nbelieve the Government should take bold action. I think there are many \nthings agencies should be doing to help our economy. But my point is, \nin light of those obligations on future taxpayers and the amount of \nmoney we are spending, spending just $100 billion to make our Nation's \nenergy system cleaner and\n\n[[Page S642]]\n\nmore diverse and more distributed is a no-brainer.\n  In my opinion, stimulus, such as clean energy investment, should get \na gold star. If we are looking for avenues to create jobs and secure \nour future, there is no better stimulus than clean energy. A recent \nstudy from the University of Massachusetts shows that a $100 billion \ninvestment in this area would create 2 million jobs in the next two \nyears--2 million jobs. That rate of jobs generated per dollar \ninvestment is far higher than other types of infrastructure investment. \nThat is to say, when you are looking at stimulative activity and return \non investment, the clean energy infrastructure does better than most \ntypes of other infrastructure investment.\n  So I come to the floor today to discuss four ideas that I believe are \ncritically important for job creation and should be part of a stimulus \npackage when we start to put pen to paper and actually see some of \nthese ideas before our committees next week.\n  First, many of my colleagues have talked about the incredible promise \nof plug-in electric vehicles. But substituting electricity for gasoline \nand diesel fuel, plug-ins can reduce political and economic exposure to \noil markets and spur a broad range of economic activity. If this \nstimulus bill is about figuring out ways to create jobs and economic \ngrowth in both the short term and sustainable jobs in the long term, \nthen plug-ins are a big winner.\n  For consumers, charging up a plug-in hybrid at our current national \naverage electricity rates would cost on average the equivalent of $1 \nper gallon. Now, imagine that compared to what many people have been \npaying over the last year. Moreover, our current electricity grid could \nfuel about 70 percent of the passenger vehicles we are driving in \nAmerica today. So fully utilizing the grid in this way could displace \nabout 6.5 million barrels of oil, that is the equivalent of about 50 \npercent of our imported oil. That translates into hundreds of billions \nof dollars staying right here at home, helping our economy instead of \nOPEC's.\n  Now, how do we get there? Before we can take advantage of this \nopportunity, we need to seize the opportunity in the United States to \nbuild better batteries for cars. Battery technology is the principal \nfactor limiting the potential of the electric plug-in vehicle to \ndisplace gasoline-powered vehicles. But for battery-powered vehicles to \nperform comparable to gasoline, batteries must become lighter, more \nenergy dense, and recharge more quickly.\n  While the United States continues to lead in the research and \ndevelopment of lithium-ion technology batteries, it is countries such \nas China and Korea and Japan that are the ones that are commercializing \nand producing this technology.\n  China has over 120 companies involved in the production of lithium-\nion battery technology, and their battery manufacturing industry today \nsupports over 250,000 jobs. We have no comparable lithium-ion battery \nfacility in the United States.\n  U.S. auto executives have warned that without home-grown suppliers, \nthis country could become as dependent on Asian-made battery technology \nas it is today on Middle East oil. So I think now is not the time to be \ntimid. If we do not push our Nation into making sure we lead this \ntransformation into changing the world's transportation system, other \nnations will take the lead in that transition.\n  It reminds me of a U.S. company, Intel, that led the development of \nthe microprocessor chip. While it is a global company today, it \ncontinues to have its latest and greatest technology developed in the \nUnited States.\n  About 2 years ago, Senator Hatch, President-elect Obama, and I sat \ndown with automakers, battery manufacturers, and utilities to figure \nout how to jump-start this development in the domestic production of \nplug-in electric vehicles.\n  The result was a multitiered tax incentive strategy designed to \naccelerate the domestic development, manufacturing, and sale of a full \nrange of plug-in electric drive vehicles. The good news is our proposal \nreceived a 93-to-2 vote in the Senate and now consumers can access tax \ncredits of up to $7,500 for the first 250,000 plug-in made and sold in \nthe U.S. I do believe that incentive for consumers is a vital first \nstep to bringing this game-changing technology to the marketplace.\n  But we also have to make sure the U.S. also maintains global market \nleadership in plug-in manufacturing components. To do that, we need to \nmake sure we are incentivizing and creating a domestic manufacturing \nbase for plug-in vehicles. That is why yesterday Senator Hatch and I \nintroduced legislation to continue to promote this idea. Our 100-\npercent expensing provision would allow private companies to build or \nretool factories that will put American-made plug-ins in showrooms \nacross the United States. I would like to thank Senators Kerry, \nAlexander, Stabenow, and Bill Nelson for being original cosponsors of \nthis legislation.\n  Manufacturing these game-changing technologies in the United States \nwill create jobs now, and it will sustain jobs for the long term. I am \nnot just talking about in Michigan, but all over the country. It is an \ninvestment we need now more than ever.\n  If what I have said so far does not sway my colleagues, I hope they \nwill consider it will probably not be the GM Volt to be the first plug-\nin in our marketplace. It will not even be a modified Toyota Prius. \nLast month, China's BYD Auto brought the first production lithium-ion, \nplug-in electric car to the market. So I hope my colleagues will renew \ntheir interest in this idea and review this bill and support including \nthese manufacturing credits in a stimulus package.\n  Second, I think we have a tremendous opportunity in stimulus by \ninfusing more intelligence into America's electricity grid. A smarter \ngrid will help ensure that those plug-ins become a stabilizing and \nefficient energy source rather than a burden on the grid. For example, \nwith smart grid metering and control devices, you could allow drivers \nto ``fill up'' their vehicles automatically, in their garage overnight \nwhen the electricity loads and prices are lowest.\n  Eventually, with a smart grid, plug-ins could also become their own \n``virtual mini powerplants,'' allowing consumers to link their vehicles \nwith millions of others and sell stored battery power to the \nelectricity grid during periods when their vehicles are not in use.\n  But right now we are a long way from that promising future. Even \nthough our Nation's electricity grid is vital to our economy and our \nway of life, it has been called one of the most complicated machines on \nEarth, it is outdated and one of the biggest roadblocks to fully \nincorporating all the renewable energy and energy efficiency that the \n21st-century commerce can deliver.\n  Smart grid technology can change that and make our grid more \nefficient and reliable. A recent Department of Energy report found that \na smart grid could improve the efficiency of power delivery by as much \nas 30 percent. And infusing intelligence into the grid enables real-\ntime electricity pricing. It allows efficiency. It makes distributed \ngeneration work, and it makes the grid more resilient and empowers \nhomeowners and businesses to take advantage of all those savings.\n  Now, in my home state, the Pacific Northwest National Lab did a \ndemonstration project that found that consumers could save 10 percent \non their current electricity bills basically by understanding how power \nwas being used in their homes and then making decisions that were \nconvenient for them to make.\n  The study found there were no technical hurdles standing in the way \nof wide-scale adoption of grid-friendly technologies, and these \ntechnologies are projected to reduce the need to build about $70 \nbillion of new generation, transmission, and distribution systems over \na 20-year period.\n  I for one cannot think of another source of energy that could quickly \ncome to the market that could provide us 10 percent more fuel, but that \nis what a smarter grid could do for us, provide us 10 percent more \nfuel.\n  Now, how do we get there? Because many of these smart grid \ntechnologies are ready to go. According to a recently released report, \nif the Federal Government would invest $16 billion over the next 2 \nyears--if we would invest $16 billion over the next 2 years--we would \ndrive a $64 billion investment in related projects by the private \nsector, resulting in 280,000 direct jobs\n\n[[Page S643]]\n\nacross a variety of categories. So I believe the opportunity for \nstimulative activity by building an intelligent electricity grid should \nbe one of the top priorities of our stimulus package.\n  Mr. President, 150,000 of those jobs could be created by the end of \nthis year. As we look at more companies announcing layoffs, it is \nimportant we prioritize within the stimulus package those types of jobs \nthat will be created in the very near future. And out of those 150,000 \njobs, 140,000 would become permanent positions after smart grid \ndeployment.\n  In 2007 I was very happy to have the chance to write a section of the \nEnergy bill dealing with getting into place smart grid language. I know \nand realize many of my colleagues now want to appropriate resources to \nthat section of the bill. I hope we can, in this package, because the \nmore we incent development of smart grid technology and smart meters, \nthe faster we are going to reach that deployment and savings of 10 \npercent to consumers and help in the creation of that 280,000 jobs.\n\n  I also believe as we look at the grid, we need to build out our \ntransmission lines. While there is language providing the Western Power \nMarketing Association with resources to expand the grid, I also support \ngiving the Bonneville Power Administration $5 billion in new borrowing \nauthority, which they pay back to the Treasury with interest, to allow \n4,700 megawatts of renewable energy to come on line in the Pacific \nNorthwest for States such as Washington, Oregon, Idaho, and Montana. \nThis additional access to capital, over the next 2 years, will create \n50,000 jobs. So we know immediately that more jobs can be created in \nthe other Washington by making the right grid investment decisions here \nin Washington DC.\n  The third area--besides plug-ins, besides a smarter grid--that I \nthink can help us and provide a stimulating effect to our economy is to \nestablish a 30-percent investment tax credit for construction or \nreequipping renewable energy or smart grid technology manufacturing \nfacilities. So this incentive would go to anyone investing capital to \nproduce the components of a clean energy economy, such as wind turbines \nand solar panels and grid technology. That will help us create jobs at \nhome, and it will help us with new industries that can support entire \ncommunities and can help transform our energy system.\n  The solar industry is a good case study of why we need this \nincentive. First Solar is a leading American photovoltaic module maker. \nThey built their first pilot plant in 2005 in Ohio. But when they \nneeded to scale up production, generous manufacturing incentives and \nmarket demand drove them to Germany and Malaysia, leading them away \nfrom the United States.\n  If we can get a clean energy manufacturing incentive into the \nstimulus bill, it will launch a wave of new clean energy manufacturing \nfacilities in the United States instead. Just the effect of this on the \nsolar industry alone, it has been estimated, would create 315,000 jobs. \nSo ensuring this kind of a manufacturing credit is critical.\n  The stimulus should also address one of the clean energy industry's \nmost urgent challenges how to get the renewable production investment \ntax credits to work, again, given what has happened to the capital \nmarkets.\n  Vital investments in American infrastructure should not have to wait \nfor Wall Street to get their house in order. There is something wrong \nwhen these companies that are key to our energy independence are unable \nto get financing because of the financial meltdown that has \noccurred. This situation is not only hurting our opportunities for \nclean energy, but it is hurting our opportunities for job creation.\n\n  Florida Power and Light, the largest owner of wind power projects in \nthe United States, announced a 25-percent reduction in capital \nexpenditures on wind in 2009. LM Glasfiber, a global leader in wind \nblades, is laying off 150 workers in Arkansas. OptiSolar, a maker of \ncutting-edge, thin-film solar cells, announced last week they had to \nlay off 300 people--almost half of its employees--and they are going to \ndelay construction of what was to be the largest PV manufacturing \nfacility in North America.\n  I know there are many people who are thinking about this now and how \nto put more flexibility into the Tax Code for these effected \nbusinesses, and I want my colleagues to understand that most of these \nproposals that I hope will make it into the stimulus bill have little \nor no cost to the U.S. Treasury. So I think this area is another \nopportunity to help fix the damage created by the financial markets, \nwhich has already hurt the hard work we did getting a clean energy \nincentive package that we passed last October.\n  I also believe we should expand a very successful initiative called \nthe Clean Renewable Energy Bonds program, which provides publicly-owned \nutilities and states and municipalities an alternative to the \nproduction or investment tax credit which they cannot use. An expansion \nto CREBs would allow 6,000 megawatts of shovel-ready renewable energy \nprojects to proceed, translating to over $15 billion in economic \nactivity.\n  I also believe the last area we should focus on is making sure we \nhave tax credit parity in our energy laws. One of the areas that has \nbeen an ongoing concern to many of my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle has to do with the fact that many promising renewable energy \ntechnologies only receive half the production tax credit of mainstream \ntechnologies such as wind. It has inhibited a number of projects in my \nState, especially in biomass. This could be a great opportunity to \ncorrect this longstanding grievance and provide a lot more market \npredictability for other energies by giving everybody the same credit \nof about 2 cents a kilowatt hour. That way, we would be bringing all \ntechnology onto a level playing field and providing certainty about the \nkind of treatment those energy resources would get from the tax code.\n  So I believe these areas I have just outlined are very positive \nenergy stimulus. I know for me, and I think for many of my colleagues, \nclean energy has become post-partisan; that is to say, everyone \nappreciates it is a game-changing technology and it can help us \nenvironmentally, with our national security, and the economic changes \nthat are facing our Nation. The question is, how do we make sure these \ncrucial energy measures get into the stimulus package we will be voting \non in the next few weeks?\n  I plan to work with the President-elect and many of my colleagues \nboth here in the Senate and in the House to make sure these energy \nprovisions do become reality. We know as we face this financial crisis, \nwe need to make the right decisions to put the few pillars in place \nthat will be the strength we can lean on as our country faces these \ndifficult times.\n  I can think of nothing more simple and game-changing than a $100 \nbillion investment in clean energy to get us on the right track, and to \nmake us the leaders in what is likely to be the largest industry of the \n21st-century, producing jobs long into the future.\n  I thank the President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S643-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S643-S646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            ECONOMIC CRISIS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, yesterday's paper and today's paper \ndescribes some pretty ominous news. And yesterday's action in the \nSenate was prompted as a result of the financial crisis that exists in \nthis country.\n  Each day the paper brings us another chapter of this sad saga.\n  ``Bank of America to Get Billions in U.S. Aid.'' That was the Wall \nStreet Journal's headline.\n  ``Bank of America to Get More Bailout Money,'' the New York Times.\n  Yesterday, this Senate voted to proceed with $350 billion in \nadditional\n\n[[Page S644]]\n\nfunding for what is called TARP, Troubled Asset Relief Program. In \nfact, TARP is not being used to purchase trouble assets, but that is \nwhat the program is called.\n  I did not support that proposal yesterday. I didn't support the \nproposal of releasing another $350 billion, but that is not surprising \nperhaps. I didn't support the proposal on the $700 billion last \nOctober.\n  I didn't support that, not because I didn't think there was a \ncrisis--I think there is a financial crisis in this country. But I \ndidn't think there was the foggiest notion of how that was going to be \nused effectively to address this country's financial problems. It turns \nout, I believe, I was right.\n  Since the $700 billion was authorized last October, we have seen the \nfirst $350 billion made available spread around in almost every \ndirection. It is almost as if you turned a ceiling fan on to a stack of \nmoney. The Secretary of the Treasury said: We have a financial crisis. \nAnd he said: Here is a three-page piece of legislation, and I want you \nto pass a $700 billion bill in 3 days.\n  The Congress didn't do that, but in relatively short order, the \nCongress authorized $700 billion for the Treasury Secretary to do as he \nwanted to do: buy troubled assets from the largest financial firms in \nthe country.\n  He got the money. But it turns out that he did not want to buy \ntroubled assets after all. Instead, he wanted to invest in bank \ncapital. So he began investing in bank capital. The investments in bank \ncapital at one point was $125 billion to nine banks, some of which did \nnot ask for it and did not need it, no strings attached.\n  He said: We are doing it to expand lending because we want to \nincentivize expanding lending and we want to try to unfreeze these \ncredit markets. Well, $125 billion with no strings. So was lending \nexpanded? Probably not. Nobody knows. Ask the banks what they did with \nthe money and they will say: None of your business; money is fungible; \nwe are not going to tell you.\n  Now the question is the other $350 billion. One of the reasons I was \nnot even interested in starting on the $700 billion or the $350 billion \nis we don't have any regulations that will close the gate and stop the \nvery kinds of practices that steered this country's economy into the \nditch in the first place.\n  I come from a ranching background raising some horses and cattle in a \nfarm State. I understand the notion about closing the gate. You have to \nclose the gate. There is nothing here that closes the gate to stop the \nkinds of practices that put us in the position we are now in.\n  I talk about these headlines with Bank of America. Let me start out \nby saying Bank of America apparently has been a good bank. It is an \nFDIC-insured bank. I don't have particular problems with Bank of \nAmerica. But I have serious problems with what has happened with \nrespect to government-sponsored failure, and government-sponsored \nfailure is not something of which we ought to be particularly proud. \nGovernment-sponsored failure is to stand behind failed financial \ninstitutions with taxpayers' money.\n  Winston Churchill once said success is the ability to go from failure \nto failure without losing your enthusiasm. There sure ought to be a lot \nof enthusiastic people around because we are going failure to failure.\n  Let me describe what I mean. You take an FDIC-insured bank--in this \ncase, Bank of America--and the Federal Government watches while the \nFDIC-insured bank buys the biggest mortgage company in this country \nwhich was failing, Countrywide Mortgage.\n  I have described that Countrywide was led by a man named Mozilo, \nlargely celebrated as one of the great CEOs in America. He received the \nHoratio Alger Award. By the way, he got out of Countrywide with about \n$200 million, it appears, and Countrywide was failing. So Bank of \nAmerica buys Countrywide, an FDIC-insured bank that the taxpayers are \nresponsible for, is allowed to buy a failed mortgage company called \nCountrywide.\n  By the way, I have shown this many times. Let me show you what \nCountrywide was doing and why it was a spectacular failure. This big \nmortgage company was advertising this to the American people all the \ntime they were running up this unbelievable amount of speculation and \ndebt:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us . . .\n\n  ``Call us.'' You wonder why a business such as this fails--\nadvertising if you have bad credit, trouble paying your bills, call us, \nlet me give you a loan.\n  So Bank of America bought Countrywide. I don't have the foggiest idea \nwhy they bought Countrywide. But 8 months later, the Federal Government \nencouraged Bank of America to buy Merrill Lynch, a failing investment \nbank, that was about to go bankrupt, we guess, on about the same \nweekend Lehman went bankrupt.\n  The Federal Government helped an arranged marriage, apparently, \nwithout even any dating--at least you would think they would date a \nlittle bit. On a weekend, Bank of America, one of the biggest FDIC-\ninsured banks in America that had picked up, 8 months earlier, a bad \nmortgage company that helped steer this country into the ditch, was now \ntold: We want you to pick up a failed investment bank, Merrill Lynch. \nSo they did.\n  What is the result? This arranged corporate marriage now gives us \nheadlines and a deal overnight last week by which that parent company, \nBank of America, needs billions more in order to keep going. What \notherwise had been a healthy bank and what we are told this morning in \nnews accounts that without Countrywide and without Merrill Lynch, Bank \nof America would be fine, now they need $20 billion. That is on top of \nanother $25 billion last fall. This company now needs to be bailed out \nby the American taxpayers. Why? Because they put together FDIC-insured \nbanks with more risks coming from, in this case, Merrill Lynch and \nCountrywide.\n  You think that is success? I don't. The question is: When do we stop \ndoing things that fail?\n  So we wake up in the morning, and we discover that as a country, we \nhave $20 billion less money in our hands, we have $20 billion less \nbecause somebody decided this company that bought Countrywide and \nMerrill Lynch now needs $20 billion to keep going.\n  By the way, last month, the CEO for Merrill Lynch was trying to get \nMerrill Lynch to give him a big million bonus for 2008. It was reported \nthere was a proposal somewhere in that system to give him a $30 million \nbonus. The CEO was apparently trying to get Merrill Lynch to give him a \nbonus after he sold Merrill Lynch to the Bank of America but before the \nbank actually took over Merrill Lynch.\n  Not only that, that CEO of Merrill Lynch had just joined Merrill \nLynch the year before and received a $15 million signing bonus and a \npay package valued at between $50 million and $120 million. I didn't \nknow failure paid so well in this country.\n\n  The reason I am describing this specific case, and I have talked \nabout this at length, and I am going to talk about it again, this all \nresults from now almost 10 years ago on the Senate floor. Our friend \nfrom Texas, Senator Phil Gramm, authored a piece of legislation called \nGramm-Leach-Bliley and, to be fair, supported by the Clinton \nadministration, supported by the then-Treasury Secretary and some of \nthe same people who are now being consulted on this crisis, they got \nsomething called financial modernization passed through this Congress.\n  What was financial modernization? Financial modernization was \nlegislation that said: You know what, we have all these old-fashioned \nrules around here, for God's sake; let's dump them so we can move into \nthe future with some modernization. Why should we still, 70 years after \nthe last Great Depression, have on the books the laws that were put in \nplace after the Great Depression that prevent banks from being involved \nin real estate and securities and insurance? Let's get rid of those \nlaws. Let's allow our banks to be modern. Why can't our banks be \ninvolved in real estate and securities and so on?\n  That was the sermon that was being preached on the floor of the \nSenate and elsewhere.\n  What was a stimulant for it, by the way, was Citicorp wanted to buy \nTravelers Insurance, one of the biggest merger acquisitions in history, \nbut they couldn't do it because the law prevented it. Why did the law \nprevent it?\n\n[[Page S645]]\n\nBecause after the Great Depression, where banks failed all across this \ncountry, because in the roaring twenties, everybody was making lots of \nmoney doing stupid things, a lot of speculation, everybody was getting \nrich, like hogs in a corncrib, they were all making all this money and \nloading up banks with risks. Banks were up to their necks in risky real \nestate. They were up to their necks in risky securities. And then the \nwhole thing came tumbling down and banks failed in large numbers.\n  So after the Great Depression, Franklin Delano Roosevelt came in and \nsaid: By the way, we are going to fix this. We are going to put in \nthings that prevent that from ever happening again. We are going to \nseparate banks from risky enterprises. Banks are not going to be \nengaged in real estate and securities. Banks are about FDIC-insured \ndeposits of the American people, and you are not going to be engaged in \nthose kinds of risks. We will prevent it. We will pass something called \nthe Glass-Steagall Act, saying to banks you can't do it.\n  In 1999, Senator Phil Gramm and a whole lot of others who joined a \nbig chorus to sing the same song said: You know what, those things are \nhopelessly old-fashioned. We have to get rid of those restrictions. \nThose were put in place in the 1930s. They don't apply in this modern \nage.\n  Eight of us on the floor of the Senate voted no. I wish to describe \nwhat I said on the floor of the Senate in 1999, when I opposed that \nlegislation. I said:\n\n       Fusing together the idea of banking, which requires not \n     just safety and soundness to be successful, but the \n     perception of safety and soundness, with other inherently \n     risky speculative activity is, in my judgment, unwise . . .\n\n  That is what I said on the floor of the Senate almost 10 years ago.\n  I also said this:\n\n       I say to the people who own banks, if you want to gamble, \n     go to Las Vegas. If you want to trade in derivatives, God \n     bless you, do it with your own money. Don't do it through the \n     deposits that are guaranteed by the American people and by \n     deposit insurance.\n\n  I said this 10 years ago:\n\n       This bill will also, in my judgment, raise the likelihood \n     of future massive taxpayer bailouts.\n\n  I sure wish I had not been right. This bill will raise the likelihood \nof massive taxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the consolidation and \nmergers in the banking and financial services industry at the expense \nof customers and others.\n  And I said this during the debate; that we will look back in 10 \nyears' time and say: We shouldn't have done that because we forgot the \nlessons of the past.\n  I take no pride in believing, 10 years ago, that what was preached on \nthis floor--and, yes, in the administration and elsewhere--about \nmodernization was something that I felt would undermine this country's \ninterest. But it has, and it will continue to.\n  The point I make today is none of these lessons has been learned. If \nwhen we went to bed last night someone was working to tell us this \nmorning that $20 billion of American taxpayers' money has been taken in \norder to shore up a bank, one of the biggest banks in America because \nthey are in trouble because they were allowed to buy an investment bank \nwith toxic assets, if that is the lesson we learned from waking up this \nmorning of what the people in charge of our money are doing with our \nmoney, I tell you, we haven't learned any lessons at all. Is there \nanything that will remind us of the absurdity of fusing together \nbasically risky things with banking, which requires just the perception \nof safety and soundness? If people think a bank isn't safe and sound, \nit doesn't matter how much money that bank has, there will be a run on \nthat bank and the bank will fail. Perception of safety and soundness is \ncritical.\n\n  How do you retain that perception--in fact, more importantly, how do \nyou have the reality of safety and soundness--if you have the biggest \nbanks in the country merging through corporate marriages with some \nunbelievably bad mergers--in this case a very good bank, Bank of \nAmerica, buying Countrywide Mortgage, and then purchasing Merrill \nLynch? How do we justify that?\n  The reason I voted against the proposition of releasing the $350 \nbillion yesterday is I am not prepared to move forward with any of \nthese things until and unless there is a commitment by the people \nrunning these operations that they have learned the lesson and they are \ngoing to close the gate and this sort of thing can't happen.\n  Now, I have a chart to show you that we have now committed $8.5 \ntrillion of the taxpayers' money--$8.5 trillion--and here is how it has \nbeen committed. There is nothing in the U.S. Constitution that \ndescribes this kind of governing--nothing. The Federal Reserve has \ncontributed about $5.5 trillion. They have opened their window for the \nfirst time to loan money directly to investment banks. Never been done \nbefore in the history of the country. And if you try to find out who \ngot the money and how much, you can't--$5.5 trillion. FDIC programs, \n$1.5 trillion, Treasury Department programs, $1.1 trillion, and Federal \nHousing Administration, $300 billion. All this taxpayer money shoved \nout the door with no accountability, no transparency, and much of it \nwithout strings. I am not willing to be a part of that.\n  If I felt that those who steered us into this ditch were going to \nshow up with an ambulance, or if those who steered us in this ditch had \nlearned their lesson that you can't continue to do this sort of thing, \nI would feel differently. But yesterday's and today's newspapers tell \nme they haven't learned a thing.\n  So my notion is that we are still going down the same road. And to \nbelieve that while America sleeps we will keep throwing money at \nfailure--because we merge banking with risk--and somehow people will \nbelieve that we don't have this risk attached to banking is not going \nto work.\n  Let me talk for a second about Citigroup. One of the largest banking \ninstitutions in America--in the world, in fact--is coming apart. It \nlost $8.2 billion in the last 3 months, and it lost $18.7 billion in \n2008. Citigroup is a bank. It is an investment bank, it is a brokerage \nbusiness, it is an insurance company. It is almost everything. How does \nall that happen? It happened because in 1999 the Financial \nModernization Act said: You know what, to be modern you have to allow \nbig holding companies and gather all this stuff together in one place. \nYou put it in a big holding company and then you can build firewalls. \nIt turns out they were tissue paper firewalls, but nonetheless we have \nall these mergers and holding companies, and now Citigroup is \ncompletely coming apart. In the meantime, these companies are judged by \nour country--by the Federal Reserve and others--to be too big to fail. \nIt doesn't matter how incompetent they might be, they are too big to \nfail. Interestingly, they have not been big enough to regulate. I am \ntalking about the investment banks. It seems to me if you are too big \nto fail, you surely are not too small to regulate.\n  Why would we not have regulatory authority to prevent this sort of \nthing? Five banks that are deemed too big to fail, by the way, hold \n$171 trillion in what are called derivatives. Most people don't \nunderstand the lexicon of derivatives, CDOs, collateralized debt \nobligations, swaps, or credit default swaps. Most of that doesn't even \nsound like the English language. It is like some foreign language. In \nfact, some is so complicated that those engaged in it don't understand \nit. But again, these banks--too big to fail--hold a notional value of \n$171 trillion in derivatives.\n  Going back to the mid 1990s, I have offered five pieces of \nlegislation here in the Congress to regulate derivative trading and \nalso to regulate hedge funds. Obviously, there is enormous resistance \nby Wall Street and others to anybody who wants to regulate anything \nthey do, and so I have not been successful. It is not because I haven't \ntried, but there is a massive amount of dividends out there. And what \nprompted me to do that is that banks--FDIC-insured banks--were trading \non derivatives on their own proprietary accounts. They might as well \nhave put some craps tables or blackjack tables right in the lobby of \nthe bank because that is what you are doing exposing that kind of risk \nto basic banking.\n  But everybody was fat and happy around here. Regulators were \nwillfully blind. They would come to town and say: Let me be a regulator \nso I can put blinders on. Or as one of them said at the SEC: There is a \nnew sheriff in town. This is a business-friendly place now, which meant \nthat those who were\n\n[[Page S646]]\n\nsupposed to look out for the public interest didn't give a rip. In \nfact, Alan Greenspan was right in front of the parade. He believed in \nwhat is called self-regulation. Isn't that interesting. If we don't \nlook, don't pay attention, don't worry, and be happy, self-regulation \nwill be fine. Well, it is about $8.5 trillion short of being fine.\n  And the question is, When--when--at last, at long, long last--will \nthis Congress, this administration and the new administration, decide \nthat we are going to regulate these activities in the future; that we \nare going to close the gate; that this cannot happen again. When will \nwe decide if you want to trade in derivatives, then it will have to be \nnot in the dark--no more dark money--it will have to be transparent and \nregulated. If you have an FDIC-insured bank, you are not going to be \nable to buy a Merrill Lynch because you can't fuse risky enterprises \nwith FDIC insured banks.\n  Now, let me say that is not unbelievable criticism of Bank of America \nbecause, as I said, that was a corporate sponsored marriage. \nApparently, the folks down at Treasury went to Bank of America and \nsaid: You know what, we have this pretty little corporation called \nMerrill Lynch that is in some trouble and we would like you to marry \nit. So as I said, with apparently not too much thought, they decided to \nhitch up. Turns out to have been a pretty bad marriage. My point is it \nis not only this. I mention Citi and I have mentioned Bank of America. \nThe fact is this river runs deep, the river of failure here. And the \nquestion is, When--when--will we get to the point where we are going to \nsay yes, that we are willing to make investments to steer us out of \nthis problem in exchange for regulation and in exchange for coming back \nto pass a piece of legislation similar to Glass-Steagall, similar to \nthe protections that were put in place after the Great Depression.\n  Unbelievably, there are a whole lot of folks who are not even willing \nto entertain that. They say: No, no, no, you don't understand what you \nare talking about. We still need to be modern, we still need to \ncompete, and we still need these new financial, exotic instruments. \nWhat they are is a new wrapper; kind of like sheep intestines, a new \ncasing for sausage. They wrapped around something called a securitized \nproduct that began securitizing everything. All of them did. They were \ngiving bad mortgages to people who couldn't pay them, no documentation \nof income, teaser rates at maybe 2 or 3 percent that will triple or \nquadruple in 3 years and lock in prepayment penalties, and then wrap \nthem in a security and sell them upstream with everybody making fat \nbonuses and lots of income.\n  The problem is, the whole thing was a Ponzi scheme. The Ponzi scheme \nis not just Mr. Madoff having breakfast in his $7 million apartment \njail in Manhattan. Yes, that was a Ponzi, apparently by $50 billion. \nBut this whole approach was a Ponzi scheme--wallpaper the country with \ncredit cards. Wallpaper everything with credit cards.\n  The other day I talked about my son, when he was 12 years old, \ngetting a credit card solicitation from a dozen different companies. \nThey offered him a Diner's Club card to go to Europe. In fact, I \nbrought a bunch of those solicitations to the floor of the Senate at \nthat point. And I said, I am sure my son would love to go to Europe at \nsome point, but he is only 12, and he ought not get a credit card. But \nthese companies wallpapered America with credit cards and then they \nsecuritized credit card debt and sold securities upstream. Is there any \nreason these assets are toxic? Securitized credit card debt, much of \nwhich won't be repaid; securitized mortgages by Countrywide and \nothers--Zoom Credit, which says in their advertisements: Is your credit \nin the tank? It is like money in the bank. Come to us.\n  It seems to me you don't effectively repair a house unless you first \nbegin to strengthen the foundation. And the foundation for all of this, \nto try to put this country back on track, in my judgment, is to go back \nand revisit what was done in the last dozen years or so under the \nrubric of financial modernization--modernization of the financial \nsystem, modernization of commodity trading. If we don't go back and \nrevisit that, this country will not be able to steer itself out of this \nproblem.\n  This is a pretty significant financial wreck that has happened in \nthis country. It is one thing for people to put on blue suits and come \nand talk about it; it is another thing for over a half million people \nlast month to go home and tell the person they love or go home and tell \ntheir family they have lost their job--perhaps the same people who had \nto tell them a month or two ago they lost their home. These are tough \ntimes. A lot of people are hurting badly. We need to find a way to \nsteer this country back to economic growth and prosperity again. But it \nwill not happen unless we fix the foundation and reconnect those things \nthat were taken apart over a decade ago.\n  Let me finally say again, while I have talked about this at some \nlength on a number of times, despite it all, if we keep pushing in the \nright direction, I have hope that this country will prevail. This \ncountry has done so many terrific things against the odds, and we will \nagain. But it requires people to be smart and tough. You cannot have a \nwall of debt out there that you don't care about, an unbelievable wave \nof speculation that you say doesn't matter. You can't have regulators \nwho refuse to regulate. You can't have an avalanche of dark money that \nno one can see. The fact is you have to fix all these things, and we \ncan.\n  This problem was created by public policy here and by corporate \npolicy there, and we can fix it and put this country back on a better \ncourse, a course that will grow and provide jobs and opportunity and \nhope once again.\n  But it won't happen by itself. It is going to happen when we as a \ncountry decide that we are going to work together to be part of \nsomething bigger than ourselves, and steer a legislative course and \nsteer some more responsibility on the corporate side to work together \nand fix these fundamental problems. I believe that is possible, and it \nis why I come to the floor so often to talk about what has caused these \nproblems and what we ought to do to fix them. It is not hopeless. I am \nhopeful. But it is going to take a lot of work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. Before I do so, please allow me to thank my \ncolleagues in the Senate, so many of whom have gone out of their way to \nhelp welcome me into this body. Both Majority Leader Reid and Senator \nDurbin have made these first days in the Senate as smooth as possible, \nas has the entire Democratic leadership: Senators Schumer, Murray, \nDorgan, and Stabenow. These first few weeks in the Senate are an \nexercise in thinking on your feet, adapting quickly, and soaking it all \nin. I appreciate all they have done to help me hit the ground running. \nTheir advice and guidance have been so important to me.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including Leader \nMcConnell and especially the senior Senator from North Carolina, \nRichard Burr, have also been very helpful both to me and my staff. \nThere is too much to be done in this country to differentiate a \nRepublican idea from a Democratic idea. We just need good ideas. I hope \nto work with all of my colleagues to identify and implement as many as \nI can.\n  Thanks also to the primary sponsor of this bill, Senator Mikulski, \nwhom I was honored to have walk with me as I was sworn in as one of 100 \nSenators and one of 17 female Senators in this body. I wish to thank \nSenator Mikulski, who has led the way for women her entire career, for \nher leadership in this body and on this important bill. I am honored to \nbe one of the 16 other women for whom she has paved the way.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to help deliver for those in our country who are struggling to \nprovide for themselves and their families. A few days before our new \nPresident is sworn in, there is a sense of urgency but also a\n\n[[Page S647]]\n\nsense of optimism. I am so honored to be a part of this body at this \nhistoric time.\n  As I said, I rise in support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, \nwhich will restore protections against pay discrimination in the \nworkplace. This bill would reestablish a fair rule for filing claims of \npay discrimination based on race, national origin, gender, religion, \nage, or disability.\n  A few months ago, this bill's namesake, Lilly Ledbetter, joined me at \nseveral roundtable events in North Carolina. Her courage and \ndetermination were inspiring. She is committed to this cause even \nthough it is too late to do anything in her own case.\n  In North Carolina, families are facing a serious enough challenge \ntrying to make ends meet on a full paycheck, never mind trying to do so \non a paycheck reduced by discrimination. Women in my home State make an \naverage of 78 cents for every dollar that men make for similar jobs and \nresponsibilities. In these tough economic times--when families are \nbeing forced to choose between putting food on the table and filling a \nprescription; can no longer afford the payments on their house, their \nown small part of the American dream; are being forced to dip into \ntheir savings to help pay their bills--why would anyone find it \nacceptable for women to make less than men or white workers to make \nmore than African Americans or someone to be discriminated against \nbased on national origin, religion, or disability? Why would we allow \nit to be more difficult for working families instead of less?\n  When someone is discriminated against in the workplace or anywhere \nelse, surely they feel the impact of that discrimination for longer \nthan 180 days. This bill would restore a reasonable time limit for \nfiling pay discrimination claims, reestablishing the longstanding rule \ncurrently applied by 9 courts of appeals and the Equal Employment \nOpportunity Commission in pay discrimination cases before this \nunfortunate Supreme Court decision in May 2007.\n  Importantly, this bill does not hold employers responsible for \ndecades and decades of back pay. Current law limits back pay awards to \n2 years before the worker filed the claim. This bill does not change \nthat. It is limited to 2 years of back pay. When discrimination in the \nworkplace results in a lower wage for those discriminated against, the \npeople responsible should be held accountable. This bill helps them to \ndo that. It does not place an undue burden on employers, nor does it \nopen them up to decades-old litigation. It simply says, for all of the \nlegal jargon, that it is not acceptable for women to make less than men \non the same job with the same qualifications and with the same \nperformance. In 2009, that is not too much to ask.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our families are struggling in the worst \neconomy since the Great Depression. It is a difficult time for many who \ndo not have jobs or who have seen their savings shrink or are in danger \nof losing their homes. We are working very hard on many fronts to try \nto get the economy going again.\n  During this time, I think it is important we not lose sight of our \nlong-term priorities. We have to build a better safety net for our \nchildren and families. We must think about the long-term educational \nprospects and tools for success our children need, regardless of the \neconomy.\n  Today, I highlight two bills that address educational needs of \nchildren.\n  First, research tells us that the first months and years of life are \ncritical in laying the foundation for later success in school and \nsocial interaction. As a matter of fact, some people say that half of a \nchild's learning intelligence is developed by 3 years old. For too \nlong, we have thought those wonderful little people under 3 were just \nto be loved and ignored in terms of education. Much of the time is \nspent in the home, and parents are the most influential part of a \nchild's life. It is my view that they must be the child's best first \nteacher. During these early moments, with the parents and other family \nmembers, children establish their social, emotional and intellectual \nhealth that will continue to grow throughout their lives. Enhancing \nthese early critical moments further enhances the later years of a \nchild's education.\n\n  You know, the key to education is exciting their curiosity. If you \ncan make a child curious, then you can begin to teach them because you \ncan respond to what their curiosity seeks. I think it makes sense to \nequip the parents with the skills they need to help maximize the \nchild's health and development. This is exactly what a program that I \nhave worked on in Missouri does. It is called Parents as Teachers--or \nPAT--and that is precisely what it focuses on. It focuses on primarily \nthose first 3 years of life, when half the learning intelligence, when \nthe socialization and interaction are developing, and when the \ncuriosity is excited.\n  The curriculum of PAT is designed to build a foundation for later \nlearning, to provide early detection of developmental delays, as well \nas health, vision, and hearing problems, to prevent child abuse and \nneglect and to increase a child's school readiness and success.\n  Actually, we found that detecting those early childhood developmental \ndelays probably saves more money in avoiding special education or \nremedial education needs later on. The way we finally got the bill \npassed in the Missouri General Assembly was when a commission I had set \nup as Governor studied ways to lessen child abuse. They came back and \nsaid: You know, the best thing you can do is to equip a parent with the \ntools to deal with a child's frustration and keep them from pushing you \nto the point where you are abusive.\n  My Bond theorem is that if you have a 2-year-old child and that child \nisn't driving you nuts on a regular basis, either, A, you are not \nnormal or, B, the child is not normal. Parents as Teachers gives the \nparent a means of dealing with those frustrating and challenging times.\n  Twenty-five years ago, I pushed the Early Childhood Education Act \nthrough the Missouri General Assembly and signed it into law. It was my \nsecond term and I had to fight for 4 years to get the bill passed, but \nit mandates that Parents as Teachers be offered in every school \ndistrict in the State. In other words, to every family; whether they \nwere going to home school their children, whether they had their \nchildren at parochial or private school or in a public school.\n  That was 4 long years of work, and I don't know that I have ever had \na more satisfying 4-year-long battle with that success. I was on a \nmission because the year I started pushing it was the year my son was \nborn. I was anxious to be a new father and shared the same feelings of \nanxiety and confusion many new parents still feel today. I had bought a \nnew car before my son arrived, and it came with a handbook. We took Sam \nhome from the hospital, and they told us to use a car seat and gave us \ndiapers. Well, children's schooling is a key component of a child's \nsuccess in school, and that is why we began working on it.\n  PAT made a positive difference in my family, through sleepless \nnights, teething, and learning the ABCs. My son was probably one of the \nfirst to benefit from the Parents as Teachers materials and books, but \ncountless others have benefited since. And after I passed it, I found \nthat parents would stop me on the street or in my office and say: You \nwould not believe what I learned when the parent educator came to visit \nus. Every time it was something new and different and it gave the \nparents a feeling of power that they could deal with the opportunities \nthis new child gave them.\n  What began as an experiment in Missouri has expanded to more than \n3,000 sites in all 50 States and 8 foreign countries. Countries all \nover the world are investing in PAT because the results are positive \nand the cost is low. We have about 150,000 Missouri families--200,000 \nchildren--participating in\n\n[[Page S648]]\n\nPAT now. I have had the anecdotal results, but scientifically we have \ndetermined, through sound research, that at age 3, PAT children are \nmore advanced in language, social development, problem solving, and \nother cognitive abilities than their peers; and parents who participate \nin PAT are more confident about their parenting and more involved in \nthe children's schooling, which is a key component of a child's success \nin school.\n  I can tell you also that when you talk to an elementary school \neducator or administrator they can tell you which children have been in \nthe Parents as Teachers program because it is that obvious from the \nstart. A 2008 published, peer-reviewed study of almost 8,000 Missouri \nchildren found that 82 percent of low-income children who participated \nin both Parents as Teachers and preschool entered kindergarten ready to \nlearn, as compared to only 64 percent of similar children who had no \ninvolvement in either service.\n  At third grade, 88 percent of low-income children who participated in \nboth Parents as Teachers and preschool received a benchmark level of \nperformance on the Missouri Assessment Program Communication Arts test, \ncompared to 77 percent of similar children with no involvement.\n  These results confirm what I know from personal experience and have \nheard from so many parents in PAT--it is a tremendous benefit to them \nand their children.\n  To date, more than 2 million families nationwide have received the \neducation and support of PAT programs. These are accomplishments of \nwhich we can be proud, but we need to do more. There are more families \nthat can and should be reached by this life-changing program, which is \nwhy I have introduced the Education Begins at Home Act with Senators \nMurray and Clinton. This legislation will establish the first dedicated \nFederal funding stream to support the expansion of PAT.\n  Our bill has had strong bipartisan support in the past, and I expect \nit will continue. It would authorize $400 million over 3 years to \nStates to expand access to Parents as Teachers. It would provide $50 \nmillion over 3 years to fund innovative ideas and partnerships at the \nlocal level to expand access to PAT in communities with limited English \nproficiency, and it would provide $50 million over 3 years to reach \nmore military families by expanding access to PAT in schools and \ncommunity organizations that serve military families.\n  As a side note, we have established the program at several military \nfacilities in Missouri where one parent is often gone overseas, and the \nfamily may not have any normal family network to help them. This brings \nthe parents together and it also provides them some of the resources \nthat they might get from a grandmother or an aunt or even an uncle.\n  Parents as Teachers builds on the principle that babies are born to \nlearn and that the child's parent is the first and most important \nteacher. PAT gives parents the tools they need to prepare children for \nsuccess in school and life, and helps parents become more active \nparticipants in their child's education. I believe the expansion of \nParents as Teachers is a sound investment in the future of our children \nand our families, and I hope my colleagues will join me in it.\n\n\n                        Vision Care For Kids Act\n\n  I, also, wish to add comments about another extremely important act \nto ensure the success of children--the Vision Care for Kids Act. Eighty \npercent of what kids learn in their early years is visual, but one in \nfour children has a vision problem that can interfere with learning, \nand only one in three children receive any form of preventive vision \ncare before school.\n  As I said, children have tremendous potential to learn and succeed, \nbut untreated vision disorders can lead to permanent vision loss. I \nknow that, personally, because I suffer from a permanent vision loss \ndue to a previously undiagnosed condition which wasn't learned about \nuntil it was too late. If the condition had been discovered and treated \nbefore I entered school, I could have avoided a lifetime of vision \nloss--and I might have done a much better job of catching fly balls in \nthe outfield.\n  The Vision Care for Kids Act, which I have reintroduced with Senator \nDodd, establishes a grant program to complement and encourage existing \nState efforts to improve children's vision care. Ensuring good vision \nfor kids will help them see bright futures ahead of them. I invite my \ncolleagues to join us in supporting children and families through these \nimportant bills.\n  For the vision care, talk with Senator Dodd or me. For Parents as \nTeachers, talk with Senator Murray or me. We would love to have you on \nthese two important bills.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank the staff for according me this \nopportunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S648-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S648]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Staff Sergeant Christopher G. Smith\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to honor the life and heroic service of SSG Christopher Smith. \nStaff Sergeant Smith, a member of the 4th Infantry Division at Fort \nCarson, died in Baghdad, Iraq, on December 24, 2008, from injuries \nsustained when his military vehicle overturned into a canal. He was 28 \nyears old.\n  After spending 2 years at Kellogg Community College in Michigan \nstudying for a career in sports medicine, Staff Sergeant Smith joined \nthe Army in 2001. He served in Iraq from March 2005 to February 2006 in \nsupport of Operation Iraqi Freedom and returned to the country for his \nsecond deployment in September of last year. As a cannon crewmember, \nStaff Sergeant Smith played an integral role operating high technology \nweapons systems. He distinguished himself as a strong leader within \n``Bulldog'' Company and would lead his unit in his captain's absence. \nHis extraordinary bravery and talent earned him more than 11 awards and \ncommendations during his service.\n  Staff Sergeant Smith is remembered by those who knew him as a true \npatriot who always looked out for his fellow soldiers and believed \nstrongly in his mission. He was deeply admired by his men, so much so \nthat five members of his squadron incurred hypothermia in a dogged and \nheroic effort to rescue him from the canal. He was often hunting and \nfishing, rooting for the University of Michigan Wolverines, and \ngrilling brisket and ribs for his friends. Most of all, he was a \ndevoted husband and father.\n  Mr. President, Teddy Roosevelt famously said, ``it is not the critic \nwho counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or \nwhere the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs \nto the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust \nand sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short \nagain and again, because there is no effort without error and \nshortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows \ngreat enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy \ncause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high \nachievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while \ndaring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and \ntimid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.''\n  Staff Sergeant Smith sacrificed his life for this Nation as a man who \nknew that his country needed him to be ``in the arena,'' helping \nothers. He accepted the risks of his job with extraordinary \nprofessionalism and served with honor and a dedication to duty that was \nsecond to none. We cannot repay our debt nor replace his loss.\n  To Staff Sergeant Smith's mother Donna, his father Virgil, his wife \nBobbi Jo, his son Adler, his brother Phillip, and all his friends and \nfamily, I know no words that can assuage the pain you must feel. I hope \nthat in time your grief will give way to the pride you must feel for \nChris for all he accomplished and for all the lives he touched. His \ncountry will always honor his legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S648-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S648-S649]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SAVING KIDS FROM DANGEROUS DRUGS ACT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, in reintroducing the Saving Kids from Dangerous \nDrugs Act. I believe we have an ongoing moral obligation in this \ncountry to ensure our young people have every opportunity to grow up \nwithout being accosted by drug pushers at every turn, whether on TV, in \nthe movies, or on the way to school.\n\n[[Page S649]]\n\n  This bipartisan legislation comes in response to the recent warnings \nissued by the Drug Enforcement Administration, DEA, and the White \nHouse's Office of National Drug Control Policy about highly addictive \nand dangerous drugs being colored, packaged, and flavored in ways that \nappear to be designed to attract use by children. As cochairman of the \nSenate Caucus on International Narcotics Control, I can tell you that \nthe most at-risk population for drug abuse is our young people. \nResearch has shown time and again that if you can keep a child drug \nfree until they turn 20, chances are very slim that they will ever try \nor become addicted to drugs. Unfortunately, unscrupulous drug dealers \nare all too aware of statistics like these and have developed new \ntechniques and marketing gimmicks to lure in younger users. As a parent \nand now grandparent, this is extremely troubling.\n  These drug dealers are flavoring drugs with additives to make them \ntaste like candy. For instance, some drugs that have been recovered by \nthe DEA and local law enforcement have been flavored to taste like \nstrawberry and are known as ``Strawberry Quick.'' Other flavors, such \nas lemon, coconut, cinnamon and chocolate are clearly being used to \nmake highly addictive drugs like meth and cocaine seem less harmful and \nmore appealing. These flavored drugs are also being marketed in smaller \namounts, making them cheaper and more accessible to children. According \nto an article in USA Today, at least eight States have reported \ninstances involving candy flavored drugs, and many law enforcement \nofficials are expecting these deadly substances to infiltrate their \nStates in the near future.\n  The DEA recently arrested three men in an undercover operation in \nCalifornia where candy flavored cocaine was being distributed. The DEA \nseized at least four different flavors of cocaine along with other \ndangerous substances. The estimated street value of the flavored \ncocaine seized in this operation was $272,400. The DEA also arrested 12 \npeople in connection to a marijuana-laced candy and soft drink \noperation in 2006. The marijuana-laced candy that was seized in this \noperation was packaged to look like well known brand name candy bars. \nThese drug busts further illustrate the fact that drug dealers will \nstop at nothing to hook a new generation on these deadly substances.\n  Currently, Federal law enhances the criminal penalties that apply \nwhen a person sells drugs to anyone under the age of 21. When this \noccurs, the Federal penalties are doubled--or tripled for a repeat \noffense--and a mandatory minimum of at least 1 year must also apply. \nHowever, this penalty applies only to someone who actually sells drugs \nto someone under 21.\n  The Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act would expand the \ncircumstances under which these enhanced penalties apply to cover the \nentire operation. Under our bill, the enhanced penalties that already \nexist would also apply to anyone who knowingly or intentionally \nmanufactures, creates, distributes, dispenses or possesses with the \nintent to distribute a controlled substance that has been flavored, \ncolored, packaged or otherwise altered in a way that is designed to \nmake it more appealing to a person under 21 years of age. The DEA busts \nare prime examples of why we need this bipartisan bill to keep drug \ndealers from peddling their poison to our children. I am pleased that \nthe National Narcotics Officers Association Coalition is strongly \nsupporting this measure. This organization represents 69,000 law \nenforcement officers who encounter these terrible substances on a daily \nbasis and work endlessly to keep our children and communities safe.\n  The fight against deadly drugs is an ongoing struggle. We must do all \nwe can to protect the most vulnerable among us. We must send a clear \nmessage to those wishing to prey on our youth that you risk serious \nprison time when you target our future.\n  Although this bill was passed out of the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously last year, the Senate never passed the bill in the 110th \nCongress. I ask that my colleagues join us in support of this important \nlegislation and pass the Saving Kids from Dangerous Drugs Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S649-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S649-S650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I began my career as a preschool teacher \nback in my home State of Washington. That background has given me \nvaluable insight into how important early childhood education is \nthroughout a person's life.\n  As a preschool teacher, I could tell from the first day which kids in \nmy class had parents at home who read to them. At 4 years old, those \nkids were already ahead of their classmates because they had been \nintroduced to words and books, and they were interested in learning.\n  I have been proud to work here in the Senate to support education \nprograms like Head Start that help more kids get an equal start in \nschool. So I rise today to talk about two bills I reintroduced this \nweek with my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Bond, as \nwell as Senator Clinton.\n  The bills--the Education Begins at Home Act and the Ready to Learn \nAct--are a pair designed to help prepare children for school by \nfocusing on their learning at home and at preschool and childcare \nprograms.\n  Both of these bills are based on research, and they expand on \nprograms and efforts we already know work. They also have one component \nI especially like--they don't just focus on teachers--they support \nparents learning how to give their kids a healthy start. So I would \nlike to spend a moment describing them.\n  The first--the Education Begins at Home Act--would create the first \nFederal stream of money to help teach parents how to care for their \nkids, starting at birth.\n  The bill would enable State and local governments to create programs \nthat teach parents about healthy parent-child relationships, about \nboosting child development, about the demands and stress associated \nwith caring for babies, about how to deal with difficult behavior, and \nabout how to recognize postpartum depression.\n  Most of us here know how difficult it is to be a new parent--\nespecially when you are under stress because of work or military \nservice. The programs this bill would create will help prevent child \nabuse and teach parents about how their children grow and develop \nemotionally and intellectually.\n  I know how important the Parents as Teachers Program is to families \nin Washington State with young children, and I believe we need to \nexpand on the success of this program and others around the country.\n  The second bill builds on the first by creating a competitive \nmatching grant program within No Child Left Behind. It would fund high \nquality early childhood programs aimed at promoting school readiness \nfor low-income children, particularly 4 year olds. And it would help \nreduce class sizes, increase teacher salaries, and require States to \nreport regularly on the effectiveness of these programs.\n  Research shows that children who get good prekindergarten education \nare less likely to fall behind or need special education services--and \nthey are more likely to graduate from high school.\n  To give you just one example, kids who learn the names and sounds of \nletters before they enter kindergarten are 20 times more likely to read \nsimple words by the end of kindergarten. And children who don't learn \nthe same skill before they start school often fail to catch up--ever.\n  In other words, the early childhood education programs--like those we \nfund in this bill--are a great investment that will pay off in \ndividends later. They save money in the long run and help kids get the \nbest possible start in life.\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, I have been a strong \nsupporter of early childhood education for my entire career. But given \nour economic crisis, investments like the ones I am talking about today \nare more important than ever before.\n  I believe that strengthening our schools and making sure our kids are \nprepared for tomorrow's workplace are going to be the keys to economic \nrecovery. We need to build a workforce that is the most competitive in \nthe world so that we can recruit and hold onto good-paying jobs. And we \ncan't do it unless all of our children get the strongest possible start \nin life.\n\n[[Page S650]]\n\n  So I urge my colleagues to support these bills and help our kids get \non a path to learn and succeed.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize Elizabeth \nSellers on her retirement from the Department of Energy after 26 years. \nBeth most recently spent 6 years as DOE's Idaho Site Manager at the \nIdaho National Lab, INL. During her time there, the INL was created as \nthe lead nuclear research and development laboratory for DOE, and a \nseparate project, the Idaho Cleanup Project, was created to manage and \nclean up the radioactive waste at the site. Since 2003, Beth has \noverseen the work of 300 Federal employees and approximately 6,500 \ncontractors. Beth's leadership and vision has helped further the \ncritical energy and national security missions of INL and the Advanced \nMixed Treatment Project with a commitment to excellence and safety. She \nhas been at the helm as significant state milestones have been met \nthrough the Idaho Cleanup Project, and she will be missed at the lab.\n  Beth was not satisfied simply leading efforts at the lab. She knows \nthe importance of community and maintaining strong community ties, both \nas the DOE Site Manager and on a personal level. She immersed herself \nin the Idaho Falls community life, volunteering in a number of \ndifferent organizations, giving back to her host community. She not \nonly leaves big shoes to fill in her professional life, she leaves a \nhole in the community as well.\n  I wish Beth well in her future endeavors overseas and have \nappreciated working with her during her time at INL.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S650-4", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO NORRIS O'NEIL CHANDLER\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I recognize Mr. Norris \nO'Neil Chandler and his lifetime of service to his country and his \ncommunity. Mr. Chandler was born in Chaffee, MO, on August 11, 1923, \nand enlisted in the Regular Army at Jefferson Barracks. Following basic \ntraining he was assigned to a special amphibious engineering unit \nactivated for World War II--the 149th Engineer Combat Battalion.\n  Mr. Chandler bravely participated in the monumentally important \ninvasion of France on Omaha Beach on June 6, 1944, as a demolition \nspecialist for the 149th. He would fight alongside his brethren, all of \nwhom have rightfully become known as the Greatest Generation, from \nthose Normandy beaches all the way to Germany, enduring hardship, \ntragedy, and triumph along the way. His efforts were one small part of \nchanging the world as the forces of evil that sought to exterminate an \nentire religion and to deny freedom to so many were defeated. Mr. \nChandler returned home, and like so many of his fellow veterans never \nstopped doing his small part to serve his country nor ever asked for \nanything in return for his humble service. This type of character \ncannot be taught, but it certainly can be appreciated. It is the finest \nexemplar of American values, and I honor Mr. Chandler and his American \nvalues today.\n  More specifically, following his service in WWII, Mr. Chandler became \npart of the newly activated Organized Reserve Corps, which developed \ninto what is known today as the U.S. Army Reserve. Mr. Chandler \ncontinued his service in the Reserve Corps from December 1945 until \nOctober 1951, at which point he entered civilian service with the \nMissouri Military District, 11th Army Corps, St. Louis, MO, where he \nheld various positions. Over 40 years later, Mr. Chandler remains \nemployed by this organization, now known as the Directorate of \nLogistics-Washington's Media Distribution Division. This sort of \nlongevity, commitment and humble service is hard to even comprehend in \ntoday's world, but it is easy to understand when you think of the \nvalues of the Greatest Generation that Mr. Chandler exudes.\n  It is because of people like Mr. Norris O'Neil Chandler that I am so \nproud to be a Senator representing the State of Missouri. I have even \nbeen told that he has more than 3,300 hours of unused sick leave, and \nhas donated much of his annual leave to other employees through the \nleave donation program. It is because of the generosity and dedication \nof people like Mr. Chandler that the United States of America is the \ngreat Nation that it is.\n  For 60 years, Mr. Chandler has given so much to his country, his \ncommunity, and his family, yet demanded so little back. I wish today to \ngive my simple, humble thanks to this American hero. I have the utmost \nrespect and gratitude for those who live their lives like Mr. Chandler. \nAs we honor him today, he is a reminder to all of us of the true value \nof selfless service, and the impact of that service in our communities, \nour States, and our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S650-5", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following message from the President of the United States was \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S650-6", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S650-S652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ECONOMIC REPORT OF THE PRESIDENT DATED JANUARY 2009 WITH THE ANNUAL \n       REPORT OF THE COUNCIL OF ECONOMIC ADVISERS FOR 2009--PM-7\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Joint Economic Committee:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  The American economy has consistently proven its strength and \nresilience in the face of shocks such as natural disasters, high energy \nprices, and the terrorist attacks of September 11. The economy \nexperienced 6 years of uninterrupted expansion, which included a record \nstretch of 52 consecutive months of job creation. The past year saw \nthis growth cease as several forces that developed over many years in \nthe credit and housing markets converged. The combination of these \nfactors, coupled with a sustained period of rising energy prices, was \nsufficient to threaten the entire financial system and generated a \nshock so large that its effects have been felt throughout the global \neconomy.\n  Under ordinary circumstances, it would be preferable to allow the \nfree market to take its course and correct over time. But the \nGovernment has a responsibility to safeguard the broader health and \nstability of our economy. Under the extraordinary circumstances created \nby the financial crisis, the potential damage to American households \nand businesses was so severe that a systemic, aggressive, and \nunprecedented Government response was the only responsible policy \noption.\n\n[[Page S651]]\n\n  The actions taken by my Administration in response to the financial \ncrisis have laid the groundwork for a return to economic growth and job \ncreation, and they are beginning to show some early results. A measure \nof stability has returned to the financial system. There will, of \ncourse, continue to be challenges. Temporary Government programs must \nremain temporary and be unwound in an orderly manner as soon as \nconditions warrant. Financial regulations must be modernized to reflect \nthe realities of the 21st century, and these efforts should ensure that \nthe objective of protecting consumers and investors does not come at \nthe expense of the flexibility required for innovations to come to the \nmarket. We must also continue to trust Americans with the \nresponsibility of homeownership and empower them to weather turbulent \ntimes in the market by helping creditworthy homeowners avoid \nforeclosure.\n\n  As the country navigates through this trying period, we must never \nlose sight of the enormous benefits delivered by the free enterprise \nsystem. Americans have good reasons to be confident about the long-term \nhealth of our economy. Despite the current difficulties, there are a \nnumber of positive economic factors. Inflationary pressures have \nmoderated as record high prices for oil and gasoline have retreated. \nProductivity growth, which helps to increase our standard of living and \nimprove our international competitiveness, remains solid. The American \neconomy continues to be the largest and most dynamic in the world, and \nits solid foundation of flexible labor markets, low tax rates, and open \ntrade and investment policies all contribute to its ability to recover \nfairly quickly from shocks. Over the past 8 years, my Administration \nhas worked to strengthen this foundation by adopting pro-growth, \nmarket-oriented policies, and our policies will position the economy \nfor a strong rebound and continued long-run growth.\n  Sound economic policy begins with keeping taxes low. The tax relief \nenacted by my Administration was the largest in a generation. Tax rates \nhave been lowered for every American who pays income taxes. More than \n13 million Americans had their Federal income tax liability completely \neliminated, and individuals and businesses have kept $1.7 trillion of \ntheir own hard-earned money. Raising taxes at any time reduces our \ninternational competitiveness and further distorts the decisions of \nindividuals and businesses; doing so in the current environment would \nhave serious consequences for the economy. This tax relief has been a \nkey factor in promoting the economic growth and job creation of recent \nyears, and it should be made permanent. Unless the Congress acts, most \nof the tax relief that we have delivered over the past 8 years will be \ntaken away, and 116 million American taxpayers will see their taxes \nrise.\n  The Government also has a responsibility to spend the taxpayers' \nmoney wisely. Over the course of my Administration, the rate of growth \nin nonsecurity discretionary spending has steadily decreased from more \nthan 16 percent in 2001 to below the rate of inflation today. While the \nfinancial crisis has required significant taxpayer investments that \nwill increase the budget deficit, we expect that most or all of those \ninvestments will be paid back to taxpayers over time. The greatest \nchallenge to the fiscal health of the country remains the unsustainable \ngrowth in entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid. I have laid out responsible, innovative solutions to address \nthese challenges, which will otherwise only grow more difficult to \nsolve over time. The Congress has an obligation to confront these \nissues.\n   Government does have a role to play in health care, but a robust \nprivate market is critical to ensuring that health care is affordable \nand accessible for all Americans. My Administration has sought to \nbalance public and private roles in health care with market-oriented \npolicies that increase the efficiency of health care delivery, \nencourage competition, and leave decisions in the hands of individuals \nand their doctors. For example, enactment of the Medicare prescription \ndrug benefit program has provided more than 40 million Americans with \nbetter access to prescription drug coverage, expanded competition in \nMedicare, trusted consumers to make their own health care decisions, \nand the costs have been much lower than originally estimated. The \nintroduction of Health Savings Accounts has also provided consumers \nwith greater access to affordable health care plans. There is much more \nthat can be done to improve health care, such as adopting medical \nliability reform, eliminating the bias in the tax code against those \nwho do not receive health insurance through their employers, and \nincreasing the power of small employers, civic groups, and community \norganizations to negotiate lower-priced health premiums. These policies \nwould help reduce frivolous lawsuits that increase patients' costs, \npromote the use of health savings accounts, and encourage competition \namong health plans across State lines.\n   To be competitive in the global marketplace, the United States must \nremain open to international trade and investment and reject the false \npromise offered by protectionist policies. American workers and \nbusinesses can compete with anyone in the world, as evidenced by the \nremarkable performance of American exports in recent years. When I took \noffice, the United States had free trade agreements (FTAs) in force \nwith only three countries. Today, we have FTAs in force with 16 \ncountries. I thank the Congress for its approval of these agreements \nand strongly encourage prompt approval of the agreements with Colombia, \nPanama, and South Korea that will benefit our country. These agreements \nwill provide greater access for our exports, support good jobs for \nAmerican workers, and promote America's strategic interests. We also \nhave an unprecedented opportunity to reduce barriers to global trade \nand investment through a successful conclusion to the World Trade \nOrganization Doha Round negotiations. In addition, the Congress should \nreauthorize and reform trade adjustment assistance so that we can help \nthose workers whose jobs are displaced to learn new skills and find new \njobs.\n   The rapid increase in energy prices in the past year exposed just \nhow dependent our economy is on oil. We must continue taking steps to \nincrease our energy security. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 and the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act of 2007 were major steps toward \nthis goal, but in the short term, our country will continue to rely on \nfossil fuels for most of its energy supply. I am pleased that the \nCongress recognized this reality and agreed to remove restrictions that \nwill allow responsible oil and gas exploration on the Outer Continental \nShelf and expanded access to oil shale to help meet America's energy \nneeds. In the long run, our energy security will require advances in \nclean and renewable energy technologies. My Administration has worked \nto reduce gasoline consumption and promote alternative fuels to \ntransform the way Americans power their cars and trucks. We have also \nworked to develop cleaner energy sources to power Americans' homes and \nplaces of work, such as clean coal, nuclear, solar, and wind power. At \nhome, we are on the path to slow, stop, and eventually reverse the \ngrowth of greenhouse gas emissions, but substantial reductions in \nglobal greenhouse gas emissions are only possible with the concerted \naction of all countries. The Major Economies Process launched by my \nAdministration in 2007 has brought all major economies together to \ndiscuss a common approach to a global climate agreement that includes \nthe meaningful participation of all major economies.\n   The creativity, ingenuity, and resourcefulness of the American \npeople is our country's greatest strength, and a vibrant education \nsystem is key to maintaining our Nation's competitive edge and \nextending economic opportunity to every citizen. Workers who invest in \ntheir education and training enjoy higher incomes and greater job \nsecurity. The No Child Left Behind Act has succeeded in bringing \ngreater accountability to schools, and the results are clear; as one \nexample, African American and Hispanic students are posting all-time \nhigh scores in a number of categories. The Congress should reauthorize \nthis vital law, and our Nation must continue to demand results and \naccountability from our educational system. To be competitive in the \nglobal economy, American workers\n\n[[Page S652]]\n\nalso need to continually update their skills. To that end, my \nAdministration has invested nearly $1 billion in new job training \ninitiatives to ensure our workforce has the skills required of 21st \ncentury jobs. We have also nearly doubled support for Pell Grants to \nhelp millions of low-income Americans afford college tuition. The \ntechnological innovation that drives our global economic leadership \ndepends on continued scientific discoveries and advancements, and I am \npleased that the Congress authorized the doubling of basic research in \nkey physical science and engineering agencies as I proposed in my \nAmerican Competitiveness Initiative (ACI). I urge the Congress to \nappropriate these ACI funds promptly to help sustain our economy's \nlong-term competitive position.\n  Many of these issues are discussed in the 2009 Annual Report of the \nCouncil of Economic Advisers. The Council has prepared this Report to \nhelp policymakers understand the economic conditions and issues that \nunderlie my Administration's policy decisions. Free market policies \nhave lifted millions of people out of poverty and given them the \nopportunity to build a more hopeful life. By continuing to trust the \ndecisions of individuals and markets and pursuing pro-growth policies, \nAmericans can be confident that the economy will emerge stronger than \never from its current challenges, with greater opportunity for \nprosperity and economic growth.\nGeorge W.

A bill to establish a National Commission on Entitlement \nSolvency; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and \nSenator Cornyn to introduce legislation that will address one of the \nmost serious problems facing our Nation--the long-term health of Social \nSecurity and Medicare.\n  Today we propose a bipartisan, independent and permanent commission \nto return these essential programs to solid financial footing for \ngenerations to come.\n  Our legislation mandates the periodic, comprehensive review of Social \nSecurity and Medicare to ensure their present and future solvency.\n  By a year from the date of enactment, it requires the Commission to \ndevise and recommend to Congress and the President a benefit and \nrevenue structure that allows Social Security and Medicare to become, \nonce again, stable and effective over the long-term.\n  The problem we face is astronomical. President-elect Barack Obama is \nwell aware of this, and said so on the front page of today's Washington \nPost.\n  He recognizes the growing threat this problem represents to the long-\nterm health of our economy, and to the American people. So I look \nforward to working with him to find ways to ensure the long-term health \nof these great American institutions.\n  He recognizes, as Senator Cornyn and I do, that inaction is \ndangerous.\n  The Congressional Budget Office announced last week that the fiscal \nyear 2009 deficit is projected to reach $1.2 trillion, a new record.\n  The three largest entitlement programs, Social Security, Medicare, \nand\n\n[[Page S653]]\n\nMedicaid, are expected to grow by at least 8 percent this year.\n  Meanwhile, the Social Security funding shortfall has ballooned to \nroughly $4.3 trillion--the amount necessary to continue full benefits \nbeing paid past 2083.\n  Medicare is in far worse shape, needing $12.4 trillion over the next \n75 years to close the gap and remain in balance.\n  The numbers tell the story: growing cash flow deficits will exhaust \nthe Medicare trust fund in 2019, and Social Security reserves will be \novercome in 2041, according to the most recent Trustees report.\n  Our legislation takes a new approach and is bipartisan to the core.\n  Fifteen experts, some of whom are Members of Congress from the \ncommittees of jurisdiction, are appointed. They take a full year to \nconduct town hall meetings nationwide, assess these trillion dollar \nprograms from top to bottom, and rationalize their cost structure \nthrough intensive evaluation.\n  We advocate an open and transparent process, where all American \nvoices can be heard.\n  Too often during my time in the Senate I have seen approaches that \nrely strictly on elected officials meeting privately and out of the \npublic view fail. A workable solution to these problems must be \ntransparent.\n  In the 110th Congress alone, there were no less than six proposals to \nreform Social Security. The Commission we propose would not be offering \none-time solutions that get tossed aside and collect dust.\n  Far from it: the Commission's detailed analysis, nonpartisan \nrecommendations and findings are provided in writing and take the form \nof legislation that Congress formally considers.\n  The Senate and House, in turn, through expedited legislative \nprocedures, will hopefully be poised to amend if need be and then enact \nthe changes into law. To be clear, this legislation will not prevent \nour colleagues from the opportunity to improve the Commission's \nproposals.\n  We do not hold out, today, certain ideas that we believe the members \nof the commission ought to consider.\n  We rely on their independent expertise and motivation to derive what \nis best for the Nation. Then we let the chips fall where they may from \nthere.\n  President-elect Obama's choice to lead the Office of Management and \nBudget, Peter Orszag, agrees that Social Security is one of America's \nmost successful Government programs.\n  But failure to act on real reform, in his words, ``merely exacerbates \nthe painful choices that will ultimately be necessary.''\n  While such reforms will be difficult, he ultimately argues that, \n``Social Security can be mended in a safe, realistic way, while \nprotecting the most vulnerable beneficiaries.''\n  I believe Mr. Orszag is correct. It will be only a matter of time \nbefore we must implement real Social Security reform.\n  That's because 51 million people, or 1 out of every 6 Americans, \ndepend on it.\n  And by 2034, an astounding 74 million Americans will receive this \nguaranteed benefit. At that time there will be only 2.1 workers for \nevery one beneficiary.\n  For more than 20 percent of retirees, Social Security is it: their \nonly source of income.\n  For half of those 51 million, Social Security keeps them out of \npoverty. And for almost two-thirds, Social Security makes up more than \nhalf of their total income.\n  Six and one half million widows and widowers rely on Social Security, \nas do 7.5 million disabled workers and their 1.6 million children.\n  The long-term challenges are significant. It's not a crisis; we have \ntime to implement gradual reform over time, but we need to get started.\n  However, the current economic crisis leads me to believe that nothing \nis for certain.\n  While the projected shortfall for Social Security amounts to about \n$4.3 trillion, the fact of the matter is that 100 percent of benefits \ncan be paid until 2041 by some estimates, Social Security \nAdministration, or 2049 by others, CBO. Beyond that time horizon, 78 \npercent of benefits can be paid.\n  So the bottom line is that there is the time, the know-how, and the \nresources to, be able to maintain the current system, with phased \nadjustments occurring over many years to the Social Security Trust \nFund.\n  The key, of course, is coming to a rational consensus--Democrats and \nRepublicans united--in the effort to to make Social Security solvent \nfrom this day forward.\n  Most budget experts agree that the Social Security problem pales in \ncomparison to the enormous shortfall facing Medicare Trust Fund, Part \nA--over the next 75 years a total of $12.4 trillion. The various \ntechnical estimates are that Medicare is projected to become insolvent \nfar sooner than Social Security.\n  In fact, the most recent Medicare Trustees report confirms that the \ntrust fund will be exhausted in 2019.\n  Closing the trust fund gap demands action.\n  Pressure on Medicare will only grow as the Baby Boom generation ages \nyet the number of beneficiaries skyrockets upwards--from 44 million \nnow, a number which will double by 2030--as the Baby Boom generation \nages.\n  Compounding the problem, the Congressional Budget Office projects \nthat Medicare spending will rise to 10.8 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct by 2082, up from 3.2 percent of GDP today.\n  Because the program is financed through payroll taxes and general tax \nrevenue, the pressure is building now on working Americans given the \nhuge demographic changes we expect as Baby Boomers retire.\n  The plain truth is that surging health care costs exceed economy \ngrowth. This health care spending must be controlled or Medicare faces \na dire situation.\n  In closing, I should note that Congress is debating a historic \nstimulus initiative, designed to pull our economy out of this current \ndownturn. While these investments are likely necessary, I strongly \nbelieve that they should be coupled with the framework to return to \nlong-term fiscal sanity.\n  I know the incoming administration recognizes the gravity of this \nsituation.\n  I look forward to working with the new President, and my colleagues, \nto advance positive solutions to address the looming entitlement \ncrisis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Gregg, and Mr. \n        Cochran):\n  S. 278. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a tax credit for qualified donations of employees services; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the reintroduction \nof the Serve America Act. I, along with my good friend, the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts first introduced this legislation in the \nwaning days of the 110th Congress, and I am proud to lend my support to \nthe bill during this session. We are currently joined by 20 cosponsors, \nboth Republican and Democrat.\n  I have long been a supporter and advocate for volunteer service. I \nbelieve that, when private citizens offer their time and talents to \nserve in their communities, they benefit along with those they have \nhelped. Furthermore, I believe that, if we can encourage people to \nvolunteer their services in their towns and neighborhoods, we can \nbetter address our Nation's most pressing problems.\n  The Serve America Act does many things. Most apparently, it creates \nnew national service corps that will enlist the help of our people to \naddress specific areas of national need, including education, energy \nefficiency, access to health care, economic opportunity for the \ndisadvantaged, and disaster relief. It also encourages individuals and \nnon-profit groups to come up with new and innovative ways to encourage \nvolunteerism and to use the help of volunteers effectively. In \naddition, it enlists the help of the private sector in addressing \nimportant needs in our nation and community.\n  As in the 110th Congress, Senator Kennedy and I have agreed that, \nwhen this bill goes through the HELP Committee, we will work together \nto ensure that the spending authorized in the bill will be offset. In \nthis way, the bill will be budget-neutral, providing much needed \nassistance to the non-profit sector without adding to the Federal \ndeficit. Indeed, the American people have made it clear time and again \nthat they desire fiscal responsibility in Congress. Due to this \nagreement, the Serve America Act meets those demands.\n\n[[Page S654]]\n\n  Senator Kennedy and I are also reintroducing the Incentive to Serve \nTax Act as a companion piece to the Serve America Act. This bill would \nprovide tax incentives to encourage companies to allow their employees \nto volunteer their services on company time. Specifically, the bill \nwould provide companies a tax credit equal to 25 percent of the \ncompensation paid to an employee who performs at least 160 hours of a \nspecified charitable service.\n  As you might know, a handful of large corporations presently have \nprograms to provide managerial and educational workers to schools and \ncommunity organizations. This tax incentive would encourage these \ncompanies to do even more as well as encourage other companies that, up \nto now, may not have been able to afford to provide such service. This \nwill allow businesses to utilize their employees with various skills \nand knowledge to target specific areas that need to be addressed in the \ncommunities where those workers live and work. In the end, everyone \nwill benefit.\n  Mr. President, these two bills represent a bipartisan effort to \nharness the talents, generosity, and ingenuity of the American people. \nI believe that this is an effort that Members from both parties can and \nshould support. I urge all my colleagues--Republicans and Democrats \nalike--to support this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Snowe, \n        and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 279. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe limitations on the deduction of interest by financial institutions \nwhich hold tax-exempt bonds, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Municipal \nBond Market Support Act of 2009. This bill is similar to one that \nSenator Crapo and I introduced in the 110th Congress, and I am grateful \nfor Senator Crapo's continued leadership on this issue, as well as the \ncosponsorship of Senators Kerry, Snowe, and Schumer.\n  One of the most unfair--but least discussed--impacts of the credit \ncrisis is its severe disruption of the municipal bond market. By \nreducing state and local governments' access to financing, increasing \ninterest costs, and shrinking the universe of available investors, this \ndisruption is threatening critical infrastructure investments that \ngenerate significant economic activity, just when the need for \ninfrastructure enhancements could not be more apparent.\n  Municipal bonds have long played an essential role in financing the \nconstruction, expansion, and repair of schools; highways, roads, and \nbridges; affordable housing; hospitals; public transit; water and \nsewage systems; and community-owned utilities. But currently, the \nmunicipal bond market is significantly impaired. This situation has \nbeen caused by reasons completely extrinsic to events in the municipal \nbond market; indeed, municipal bonds remain among the safest securities \nin the world, with extremely low default rates.\n  Because of this market impairment, states, municipalities and \nauthorities have been and are continuing to face unreasonably high debt \nissuance costs. Due to these high costs, many other state and local \ngovernments are finding themselves suddenly unable to issue debt. For \ninstance, in the fourth quarter of 2008, bond issuance fell 33 percent \ncompared to the fourth quarter of 2007, representing a $35 billion \ndrop.\n  The pain is being felt by States and municipalities across the \ncountry, which have had to curtail new bond issuances, delay, or \nwithhold borrowing altogether from the capital markets. For instance, \nin Connecticut, the state sought to sell $500 million in General \nObligation bonds, but was only able to sell $99 million. As an \nindication as to how interest rates have increased significantly, \nsecondary market trading data indicates that, for instance, through the \nbeginning of 2009 a Clayton, New Mexico, revenue bond series saw a 230 \nbasis point increase. This increase is indicative of the increase in \ncosts that the city would incur if they had to issue new bonds today, a \nrate of 7.60 percent, whereas a year ago the same issue would likely \nhave been issued at 5.29 percent.\n  Infrequent issuers are experiencing an even more difficult time \naccessing the markets. A study by Municipal Market Advisors found that \nfor issuers that borrow once a year or less, borrowing costs increased \nby at least 200 basis points during the last half of last year; in many \ncases, the increase exceeded 250 basis points. For a state or locality \nissuing $100 million in 30-year bonds, a 200 basis point increase \ntranslates to $60 million in additional interest payments over the 30 \nyears. Ultimately, these higher costs will be the responsibility of \ntaxpayers, through higher taxes and/or reductions in other investments \nor services.\n  As Congress looks to legislation that will spur a national economic \nrecovery, we should enhance demand for municipal bonds by liberalizing \nrestrictions on banks' ability to acquire municipal debt.\n  Since the enactment of the Federal income tax in 1913, Congress has \nsupported the municipal bond market by exempting municipal bond \ninterest from taxation. Tax exemption is an effective means of \nconferring Federal assistance on state and local capital investments; \nit also recognizes that decisions about which projects to fund are most \nappropriately made at the State or local level. Historically, banks \nwere significant purchasers of tax-exempt debt. But the Tax Reform Act \nof 1986 severely curtailed banks' participation by automatically \ndisallowing deductions for interest expense whenever municipal bonds \nare purchased. The Act left an exception only for bonds purchased from \nsmaller municipalities, those selling no more than $10 million of bonds \neach year. In contrast, non-bank corporations are permitted to hold up \nto 2 percent of their total assets in tax-exempt bonds, regardless of \nthe size of the issuer, without jeopardizing interest expense \ndeductibility.\n  Given the severe challenges affecting the municipal bond markets, now \nis the time to modify these limitations and thus help channel \nadditional capital to critical infrastructure projects.\n  First, the Act will extend the 2 percent de minimis rule to banks, \nplacing them on the same footing as other corporate investors.\n  Second, the Act will raise the $10 million small issuer exception to \n$30 million. Because the $10 million level was not indexed to \ninflation, its purchasing power has eroded significantly since 1986, \nleaving many smaller governments either to defer projects to comply \nwith this low limit or find non-bank purchasers.\n  Finally, the Act will ensure that the small issuer is made applicable \nat the ultimate borrower level, so that bonds benefiting non-profit \nuniversities and hospitals will not exceed the limitation merely \nbecause they issue bonds through statewide authorities.\n  Taken together, these steps promise to significantly boost municipal \nbond demand, adding liquidity to the market. For instance, Municipal \nMarket Advisors projects that extending the 2 percent de minimis rule \nto banks would increase their municipal debt purchasing power by $56 \nbillion. Additional demand will enable municipalities across the \nnation, and particularly those in small and rural communities, to \nfinance the critical infrastructure projects that play an important \nrole in growing our national economy.\n  Ten national organizations representing state and local governments \nare supporting the Act. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 279\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise in honor of Korean American Day, a \ntime we set aside to commemorate the arrival of the first Korean \nimmigrants to the United States, more than 100 years ago. Since those \noriginal 102 immigrants set foot on our shores on January 13, 1903, the \npopulation of Korean Americans has grown to almost 2 million, bringing \na wealth of talent, rich cultural heritage, and innovation to our \nNation. In particular, Korean Americans have demonstrated tremendous \nbravery and skill in our country's armed forces, serving with \ndistinction during both World Wars and the conflict in Korea.\n  Around 12,000 Korean Americans live in our own great State of Nevada, \nwhere they form a substantial part of Nevada's growing Asian \ncommunity--in fact, Nevada's percentage of Asian Americans is now \nnearly 2 percent greater than the national average. Their \nentrepreneurial spirit has especially made significant contributions to \nNevada's business sector, and I personally greatly admire and share \ntheir emphasis on the importance of strong family ties. As someone \nwhose own life was transformed by education, I also commend the drive \nto academic excellence and pursuit of higher education which has led \nmany Korean Americans to our country. As the Nevadan Korean-American \ncommunity continues to increase, they enrich our state with this \nemphasis on close-knit families, a focus on cooperation, and a strong \nwork ethic that has contributed to so much of their success.\n  Beyond our borders, the United States and South Korea share a long-\nstanding, harmonious friendship. Our strategic partnership has brought \nsubstantial benefits to both our countries, and I look forward to a \ncontinued future of mutual cooperation.\n  I add my congratulations to all those joining together at events and \nceremonies across our country to recognize and honor Korean Americans' \nvibrant role in our society. The United States and Nevada have \nbenefited greatly from their contributions, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to serve my Korea-American constituents as the senior \nSenator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S657-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  UNANIMOUS CONSENT REQUEST--DIGITAL TELEVISION TRANSITION AND PUBLIC \n                           SAFETY ACT OF 2005\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that we proceed \nto the consideration of S. Res. 16.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 16) designating the week of February \n     2 through February 6, 2009, as ``National School Counseling \n     Week.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I know the day is late, but I can't help but \ncomment on this legislation. One of the big problems we have in America \ntoday is a total shortage of counselors. Most of our elementary schools \nhave no counselors and high schools have just a few.\n  Speaking personally, I went to a relatively small high school in \nHenderson, NV, when I was a boy, and we had a part-time counselor in my \nhigh school. Her name was Mrs. Robinson. She taught government and also \ncounseled. Mrs. Robinson called me out of class--I was a junior in high \nschool--and she said: We have looked at all your records, and you \nshould go to law school. Well, Mr. President, I had never met a lawyer, \nnever been to a courthouse, and I knew nothing about lawyers and all \nthat stuff, but because Mrs. Robinson told me that is what I should do, \nfrom that minute that was what I was going to be.\n  That is how important counselors are. I think this resolution is so \nindicative of some of the problems we have in education today. We know \nall the problems that teachers have. Their job would be made so much \neasier if schools had adequate numbers of counselors to help teachers, \nparents, and children work through the problems that kids have growing \nup.\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be \nagreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 16) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                               S. Res. 16\n\n       Whereas the American School Counselor Association has \n     declared the week of February 2 through February 6, 2009, as \n     ``National School Counseling Week'';\n       Whereas the Senate has recognized the importance of school \n     counseling through the inclusion of elementary and secondary \n     school counseling programs in the reauthorization of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965;\n       Whereas school counselors have long advocated that the \n     education system of the United States must leave no child \n     behind and must provide opportunities for every student;\n       Whereas personal and social growth results in increased \n     academic achievement;\n       Whereas school counselors help develop well-rounded \n     students by guiding them through their academic, personal, \n     social, and career development;\n       Whereas students face myriad challenges every day, \n     including peer pressure, depression, the deployment of family \n     members to serve in conflicts overseas, and school violence;\n       Whereas school counselors are among the few professionals \n     in a school building who are trained in both education and \n     mental health matters;\n       Whereas the roles and responsibilities of school counselors \n     are often misunderstood, and the school counselor position is \n     often among the first to be eliminated in order to meet \n     budgetary constraints;\n       Whereas the national average ratio of students to school \n     counselors of 476-to-1 is almost twice the 250-to-1 ratio \n     recommended by the American School Counselor Association, the \n     American Counseling Association, the American Medical \n     Association, the American Psychological Association, and \n     other organizations; and\n       Whereas the celebration of National School Counseling Week \n     would increase awareness of the important and necessary role \n     school counselors play in the lives of students in the United \n     States: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of February 2 through February 6, \n     2009, as ``National School Counseling Week''; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities that \n     promote awareness of the role school counselors perform in \n     the school and the community at large in preparing students \n     for fulfilling lives as contributing members of society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S658-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S658-S659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING CREW OF U.S. AIRWAYS FLIGHT 1549 AND NY CITY EMERGENCY \n                               RESPONDERS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, it is nice to see the Presiding Officer. I \nknow presiding over the Senate is a unique experience. This is his \nfirst time. But having had legislative experience in the State of \nOregon, being in a legislative chamber is not new to the Senator. He \nhas an exemplary record in the State of Oregon, working his way through \nthe system, becoming Speaker of the Assembly. The State of Oregon and \nthe country is very fortunate to have the Senator now representing the \nState of Oregon and the country in the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/16/senate-section/article/S659-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S659]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         ADJOURNMENT UNTIL TUESDAY, JANUARY 20, 2009, AT 3 P.M.\n\n  Mr. REID.
