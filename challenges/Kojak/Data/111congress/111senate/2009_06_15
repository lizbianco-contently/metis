I spoke with the Republican leader on a number of occasions on \nthat issue. To get to it next week, we need a consent agreement because \nthe House will not act on it until probably Wednesday of next week or \nsomething like that.

The HELP \nCommittee and the Finance Committee are going to have their bills \nreported out of their committees before we leave a week from Friday so \nwe can start working on the health care legislation in the Senate.\n  The next work period will be very heavy, although we have--I cannot \ncomplain--we have been able to complete a tremendous amount of \nlegislation. I was told over the weekend the work we have been able to \ndo to this point is as much as any President has ever accomplished and \nCongress has accomplished with the President during the first 5 months \nof a legislative session but for the first time of Roosevelt.\n  We passed some major legislation.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about legislation to \nhelp\n\n[[Page S6574]]\n\nseniors navigate through a complicated and often overwhelming health \ncare delivery system. Because of the fragmented nature of our health \ncare system, we often fail to provide patients, their families, and \ncaregivers with the necessary tools, information, and support to both \nage well and with dignity in the setting of their preference, \noftentimes their homes.\n  I believe if we provide patients with better information about \nadvanced care planning in noncrisis situations, they will make \ndecisions for themselves and their families that result in better care \nand a better quality of life.\n  Today I am introducing the Senior Navigation and Planning Act of 2009 \nto help seniors and their families navigate through a complex system \nand to help them make informed medical decisions. My legislation would \nprovide access to an advanced illness care management benefit, a \nbenefit that does not exist currently in our health care delivery \nsystem.\n  My legislation, as well, would increase the awareness of advanced \ncare planning through a national education campaign and clearinghouse. \nIt would also reduce legal hurdles to the enforcement of advanced \ndirectives. It would create incentives for hospitals and physicians to \nget accredited and certified in palliative care. It would increase \ncompliance with medical orders and discharge instructions. Too often a \npatient may leave a hospital, not do the appropriate actions \nafterwards, and not follow the discharge information, which can result \nin the patient being readmitted to the hospital or ending up with their \nhealth care provider not having the appropriate followup. We have to \nmake sure we put an end to that.\n  My legislation would also educate entities, including faith-based \norganizations, on advanced care planning issues. Oftentimes an \nindividual or family, when dealing with end-of-life issues, will turn \nnot only to their medical provider but oftentimes to their priest or \nrabbi or minister. We want to make sure folks in the faith-based \ncommunity understand the challenges and opportunities people have with \nadvanced care planning.\n  My legislation, as well, would increase coordination and integration \nbetween the Medicare and Medicaid Programs. Too often these programs \nthat both deal with seniors, their health care issues, and aging issues \ndo not cooperate or collaborate.\n  Collectively, these initiatives will create a more accessible \nenvironment for seniors to receive the care they need when they need \nit, and in the setting they prefer.\n  Let me be clear, this legislation does not deny or withhold services. \nHowever, it does recognize that overall health reform should include a \nthoughtful process that informs patients, their families, and \ncaregivers on how to navigate and think through difficult decisions \nabout when and how to pursue treatments at the end of life.\n  By enacting these reforms, we will begin to develop a culture in \nwhich all of us will have the ability to age well, with dignity, and, \nagain, in the setting of our choosing.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record letters of \nsupport from the following organizations: the AARP, the Alzheimer's \nFoundation, the Duke University Divinity School, the Institute on Care \nat the End of Life, the National Hospice and Palliative Care \nOrganization, UnitedHealth Group, and Aetna.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  National Hospice\n\n\n                             and Palliative Care Organization,\n\n                                                    June 12, 2009.\n     Senator Mark Warner,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of hospice programs across \n     the nation, their professionals, volunteers and most \n     importantly, the patients and families they serve, the \n     National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization is writing \n     to express our support for your Senior Navigation and \n     Planning Act of 2009. This health reform legislation will \n     strengthen the quality of end-of-life care, and make it more \n     cost-efficient through enhanced resources to allow more \n     informed choices and prevent unnecessary and costly medical \n     procedures.\n       Research has shown that individuals who have discussions \n     about end-of-life care have less invasive medical treatments, \n     and a higher quality of life. We are pleased that your bill \n     enhances access to additional resources for end-of-life care \n     planning, including: a new transitional benefit delivered by \n     hospice teams for patients with advanced illnesses, an \n     expanded use of advance directives, and increased public \n     awareness of the importance of end-of-life planning. These \n     tools implemented nationwide could help reduce Medicare \n     spending by $15 billion over 10 years.\n       Your legislation will ensure that patients and families are \n     able to navigate the journey at the end of life with the \n     necessary information and support that will bring dignity, \n     quality care, and hope when they are most needed. For more \n     than 30 years, hospices have been providing high-quality care \n     to people at one of life's most challenging times--and \n     research has shown hospice saves Medicare more than $2 \n     billion every year. This legislation uses the knowledge and \n     expertise of the hospice and palliative care community in a \n     valuable way.\n       The Senior Navigation and Planning Act of 2009 will give \n     patients and their families coping with life-limiting \n     illnesses the kind of information and services they need. The \n     National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization strongly \n     endorses your bill, and appreciates your support of \n     strengthening high-quality and compassionate end-of-life care \n     for the 1.4 million Americans who choose hospice each year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                       J. Donald Schumacher, PsyD,\n     President/CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 Duke Institute on\n\n\n                                      Care at the End of Life,\n\n                                                    June 11, 2009.\n     Senator Mark R. Warner,\n     Rusell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Re The Senitor Navigation and Planning Act of 2009.\n       Dear Senator Warner: In my career as a pain and palliative \n     care physician, I have become convinced that innovative \n     models of care that can leverage both community desire and \n     community assets for engagement in the care of the ill and \n     dying--including the involvement and assets of faith \n     communities--are urgently needed.\n       Almost all patients and families experience illness within \n     their community and receive episodic acute care in the \n     hospital. Meeting the needs of patients requires an approach \n     that raises public awareness, provides training and resources \n     to family members and loved ones, and connects the resources \n     of the hospital environment with care resources in the \n     community. Faith communities are logically and historically \n     positioned to be a locus of effective care for the ill and \n     the dying and are a relatively untapped resource to meet the \n     health care needs in the community.\n       The Senior Navigation and Planning Act of 2009 provides the \n     groundwork that can spark such innovative models and has \n     tremendous potential to improve care for the rapidly growing \n     numbers of individuals with advanced illness or who are at \n     the near end of life. I applaud this effort and offer you my \n     wholehearted support for its passage.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Richard Payne, M.D.,\n     Professor of Medicine and Divinity.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Alzheimer's Foundation of America,\n\n                                                     June 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Mark R. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: The Alzheimer's Foundation of America \n     (AFA) is pleased to endorse the Senior Navigation and \n     Planning Act of 2009. On behalf of AFA and its members, thank \n     you for your leadership in introducing this important \n     legislation.\n       AFA was formed in February 2002 ``to provide optimal care \n     and services to individuals confronting dementia, and to \n     their caregivers and families--through member organizations \n     dedicated to improving quality of life.'' Today, the \n     Alzheimer's Foundation of America's membership consists of \n     more than 1,200 member organizations that provide hands-on \n     programs and services from coast to coast, including \n     grassroots nonprofit organizations, healthcare facilities, \n     government agencies, public safety departments, and long-term \n     care communities.\n       Dignity, respect, and quality of life are the treatment \n     goals for individuals in the end stage of Alzheimer's disease \n     and related dementias; as well as support, training and \n     respite for family caregivers. The Senior Navigation and \n     Planning Act would greatly help those with dementia and their \n     families by establishing a new transitional care benefit \n     through hospice for Medicare and/or Medicaid beneficiaries \n     with a life expectancy of 18 months or less. Valuable \n     services provided under this new benefit would include: \n     palliative care consultation services; care planning \n     services; counseling of individual and family members; \n     discussions regarding the availability of supportive services \n     including information on advanced directives and other end-\n     of-life planning tools; encouragement of patient-centered \n     care; family conference services; respite services up to 16 \n     hours per month; and caregiver training provided at the \n     caregivers' home focused on providing effective personal and \n     technical care.\n       For the millions of Americans with Alzheimer's disease or a \n     related dementia, advance directive planning services are \n     essential. To address this challenge, the Senior Navigation \n     and Planning Act would create a national awareness campaign \n     of advance directive planning. It would also establish a \n     toll-free telephone line and clearinghouse that the public \n     and health care professionals\n\n[[Page S6575]]\n\n     may access to find out about state-specific information \n     regarding advance directives and end-of-life planning \n     decisions.\n       This legislation will allow eligible beneficiaries and \n     their family caregivers to receive the information they need \n     about advance directive and other end-of-life planning tools \n     directly from their physicians. In addition, hospitals, \n     skilled nursing facilities, home health agencies, and hospice \n     programs will be required to provide the opportunity to \n     discuss the general course of treatment expected, the likely \n     impact on the length of life and function, and the procedures \n     they should use to secure help if an unexpected situation \n     arises. Such services will not only help improve quality of \n     life, but will also help to reduce the stigma and fear of \n     facing end-of-life issues in general.\n       The Senior Navigation and Planning Act would further \n     protect the rights of individuals by requiring providers to \n     honor written medical orders as a condition of payment. The \n     bill would also provide incentives for hospice and palliative \n     care accreditation and certification by providing bonus \n     payments for those facilities with programs in place and a \n     payment cut for facilities that do not have an accredited \n     palliative program in place by 2020.\n       Beneficiaries with Alzheimer's disease and related \n     dementias place heavy demands on the health care system. \n     Because of the unique nature of their disease, individuals \n     with cognitive impairment must rely on family caregivers and \n     others to identify and obtain the right mix of services and \n     supports to maintain their health and to live in the \n     community as long as possible. This legislation would take \n     the much-needed step of creating an Office of Medicare/\n     Medicaid Integration to align program policies. The Office \n     would simplify dual eligible access to Medicare and Medicaid \n     program benefits and services; improve care continuity and \n     ensure safe and effective care transitions; eliminate cost \n     shifting between programs and among related care providers; \n     eliminate regulatory conflicts; and improve total cost and \n     quality.\n       Faith-based organizations often play a key role in end-of-\n     life decision-making and planning for those with terminal \n     illnesses. The Senior Navigation and Planning Act would \n     empower the Secretary to create web-based materials as well \n     as to establish end-of-life home-based service, training and \n     education grants specifically for faith-based organizations. \n     For individuals with end stage Alzheimer's disease and \n     related dementias and their family caregivers in particular, \n     faith-based services, training and support can make a world \n     of difference in an otherwise isolating situation.\n       AFA is the face of care for individuals and their families \n     who are affected by Alzheimer's disease and related \n     dementias. We are proud to support the Senior Navigation and \n     Planning Act and we look forward to working with you to \n     advance this important legislation. If you have any further \n     questions, please feel free to contact me, or have your staff \n     contact Sue Peschin, AFA vice president of public policy.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Eric J. Hall,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               UnitedHealth Group,\n\n\n                                     Pennsylvania Avenue, NW.,\n\n                                     Washington DC, June 11, 2009.\n     Hon. Mark Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: I am writing to express UnitedHealth \n     Group's strong support for your legislation, the Senior \n     Navigation and Planning Act of 2009, which better equips \n     seniors with the necessary tools, information and support \n     needed to make informed medical decisions and ensure they \n     receive the highest quality care.\n       Your legislation will fundamentally transform the way \n     terminally ill patients and their families navigate the \n     difficult decisions encountered at the end-of-life. We \n     understand that when the elderly and their families are \n     provided with relevant information and resources about care \n     options such as hospice, palliative care, and the use of \n     advanced directives, they are able to make more informed and \n     personally appropriate decisions. By combining the best \n     practices found in the public and private sectors, this \n     legislation will go a long way in ensuring that patients \n     facing the end-of-life are provided--through shared decision \n     making with their physicians and caregivers--the most \n     appropriate and sensitive care. UnitedHealth Group strongly \n     supports patient-centered care, support services and planning \n     tools for those with advanced illnesses. We applaud your \n     focus on this important issue within the health reform \n     debate.\n       UnitedHealth Group has a strong commitment to patient-\n     centered end-of-life care, as demonstrated by the following \n     programs and options that we offer to both Medicare \n     beneficiaries and commercially-insured people:\n       Evercare Hospice and Palliative Care which operates in ten \n     states and serves more than 1,200 people a day for their end-\n     of-life needs.\n       The Advanced Illness Care Model which is offered through \n     our Medicare Advantage and Special Needs Plans. This model \n     provides coordinated care for patients with advanced \n     illnesses and supports education for patients and their \n     families regarding their clinical condition and the \n     management of quality of life treatment issues in the last \n     twelve months of life.\n       The Evercare Institutional Special Needs Plans (SNPs), \n     which are specialized health plans that deploy nurse \n     practitioners in nursing homes to assist in coordination of \n     care and other planning services.\n       The UnitedHealth Care Hospice benefit which is an industry \n     leader in the comprehensiveness of its plan offerings.\n       As a result of this accumulated experience, we understand \n     that providing access to early and comprehensive hospice and \n     palliative care services results in an increase in the \n     quality of life for patients and reduction in futile and \n     duplicative clinical interventions.\n       In conclusion, we are especially encouraged that your bill:\n       Creates a transitional care benefit to increase access to \n     palliative care;\n       Establishes a national education campaign and clearinghouse \n     providing advanced care planning resources;\n       Assures portability of advanced directives across states;\n       Creates incentives for hospitals and physicians to get \n     accredited and certified in hospice and palliative care; and\n       Increases integration and coordination between the Medicare \n     and Medicaid programs.\n       Thank you for your strong leadership in the U.S. Senate on \n     this issue of critical importance to the entire health care \n     system. We look forward to working with you to advance the \n     Senior Navigation and Planning Act of 2009 and on other areas \n     to strengthen our health care system.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Reed V.

Mark R. Warner,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: Aetna is pleased to support the Senior \n     Navigation and Planning Act of 2009. This legislation will \n     strengthen the quality of counseling, support services, and \n     care management for patients and families coping with life-\n     limiting illnesses. We commend you for your leadership on \n     these critical issues.\n       Aetna, itself, has been a leader in advocating for \n     compassionate care in the face of life-threatening illness. \n     In April 2004, Aetna announced a comprehensive program of \n     case management support and expanded benefits to help Aetna \n     members and their families cope more effectively with the \n     complex medical and emotional issues associated with the end \n     of life. In an innovative move, Aetna provided coverage for \n     hospice benefits while allowing members to continue with \n     curative care, and to do so with a life expectancy of twelve \n     months instead of the six months Medicare allows. Aetna also \n     pioneered a comprehensive program of case management provided \n     by nurses trained in advance illness and in coordinating care \n     in a manner that respects ethnic and cultural traditions.\n       Member reaction to Aetna's Compassionate Care Program has \n     been gratifying. Ninety-six percent of participants' \n     caregivers said they believed the member's needs for pain \n     management and symptom relief were met in the final months of \n     life. Sixty-three percent of program members accessed \n     hospice, a significant increase over traditional Medicare.\n       In the pursuit of curative care, we too often fail to \n     engage patients and loved ones in discussions of additional \n     options for dealing with advanced illness and to support them \n     in their choices. This legislation will help change that by \n     facilitating the ability of patients and families to make \n     informed decisions at times of stress and vulnerability. \n     Aetna supports this legislation, and hopes to collaborate in \n     the realization of its goals. We look forward to working with \n     you and your Congressional colleagues to advance the quality \n     of health care for all Americans.\n           Sincerely,\n     Lonny Reisman, MD,\n       Chief Medical Officer.\n     Randall Krakauer, MD,\n       Head of Medicare Medical Management.\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, it was less than 3 weeks ago that the \nPresident announced his intentions to nominate Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \nthe Supreme Court. In announcing her nomination, the White House made \nmuch of the fact that the judge had the\n\n[[Page S6576]]\n\nlengthiest judicial record in recent memory. Last week, in a departure \nfrom past practice, the Democratic leadership of the Judiciary \nCommittee unilaterally scheduled her hearing without even notifying the \nranking member. Because of this unwise and unfair approach, Judge \nSotomayor's hearing will begin just 3 weeks from today. As I understand \nit, her questionnaire is still incomplete. Among other deficiencies, \nshe has not provided materials from 17 cases she handled as a \nprosecutor, nor has she provided materials from any appellate cases she \nhandled, and she has not provided materials from over 100 speeches she \nhas given.\n\n  During the Roberts and Alito hearings, our Democratic friends \nrepeatedly told us it was more important to do it right than to do it \nquick. Now that there is a Democratic President, it appears the \nattitude is to just do it. They want the shortest confirmation process \nin recent memory for a nominee with the longest judicial record in \nrecent memory. There is clearly a double standard at play here--one \nthat undermines our ability to fulfill one of the Senate's most \nimportant and solemn responsibilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/15/senate-section/article/S6576-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6576-S6577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as the national discussion over health \ncare intensifies, one thing is already clear: Both Republicans and \nDemocrats agree health care is in serious need of reform. The only \nthing that remains to be seen is what kind of reform we will deliver. \nAmericans are increasingly worried about what they are hearing from \nWashington.\n  Americans want lower costs, and they want the freedom to choose their \nown doctors and their own care. What they do not want is a Washington \ntakeover of health care along the lines of what we have already seen \nwith banks, insurance companies, and the auto industry. Americans don't \nwant a government-run system that puts bureaucrats between patients and \ndoctors. They certainly don't want the kind of government boards that \nexist in places such as New Zealand and Great Britain that deny, delay, \nand ration treatments that are currently available to Americans.\n  Americans want change, but they do not want changes that will make \nexisting programs worse. That is exactly what a government-run system \nwould do.\n  Unfortunately, the notion of a government-run plan has been gaining \nsteam. Over the past couple weeks, one Democratic leader after another \nhas insisted that it be included as a part of any reform. The reaction \nto this should tell us something.\n  Among those who have begun to mobilize in opposition to America's \nplans are America's doctors who warn it would limit access to care and \ncould lead to nearly 70 percent of Americans being kicked off the \nhealth plans they currently have.\n  The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which represents about 3 million \nbusinesses in this country, has warned that the creation of a \ngovernment plan would lead to a government-run health care system. The \nCEO of the renowned Mayo Clinic warned that some of the best providers \ncould go out of business. The National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, one of the Nation's leading associations of small \nbusinesses, has also expressed its concerns about a government-run \nplan.\n  Americans don't want the kind of government-run system that some in \nWashington have proposed. They do not want politicians to use the real \nproblems we have in our health care system as an excuse to tear down \nthe whole thing, take away everything that is good about it, and \nreplace it with something worse. They want practical solutions to \nspecific problems, and that is what the rest of us are proposing.\n  Here are some commonsense proposals: We all agree health care in this \ncountry is too expensive. Americans don't think basic procedures should \nbreak the bank, and American families shouldn't have to worry about \ngoing bankrupt if a family member becomes ill.\n  But government-run health care will only make matters worse. If our \nexperience with Medicare shows us anything, it is that the government \nhealth plans are not--I repeat are not--cost effective.\n  Over the weekend, the administration proposed making cuts to Medicare \nas a way of defraying the cost of a new government plan. That is \nexactly the wrong approach. America's seniors expect Congress to \nstabilize Medicare so it continues to serve their needs, not drain its \nresources to pay for another, even bigger government plan. Changes to \nMedicare should be used to make Medicare solvent for seniors today and \nfor those who are paying into it and who will rely on the system \ntomorrow, not to build a brandnew government plan on top of one that is \nalready on an unsustainable course. If we want to cut costs and rein in \ndebt, then extending a Medicare-like system to everyone in America is \nexactly the wrong prescription. We need to make Medicare itself solvent \nand find ways to improve the current health care system.\n  One way to do that is to implement reforms that we know will save \nmoney. We could start with illness prevention programs that encourage \npeople to quit smoking and to control their weight. It is no mystery \nthat smoking and obesity are leading causes of the kinds of chronic \ndiseases that are driving up health care costs. And finding ways to \nreduce these illnesses would also reduce costs. We should allow \nemployers to create incentives for workers to adopt healthier \nlifestyles.\n  We should also encourage the same kind of robust competition in the \nhealth insurance market that has worked so well in the Medicare \nprescription drug benefit, Part D. We can enact long-overdue reforms to \nour Nation's medical liability laws. For too long, the threat of \nfrivolous lawsuits has caused insurance premiums for doctors to \nskyrocket. Doctors then pass these higher costs on to patients, driving \nup the cost of care. Well, most people think health care dollars ought \nto be spent on health care, not insurance premiums. Yet doctors all \nacross America are not only passing along the costs of higher and \nhigher premiums, they are also ordering expensive and unnecessary tests \nand procedures to protect themselves against lawsuits.\n  One study suggests that roughly 9 out of 10 U.S. doctors in high-risk \nspecialties practice some form of defensive medicine such as this--and \nthe cost to patients is massive. Some doctors simply shut their \npractices or discontinue services as a result of these pressures. \nPatients such as Rashelle Perryman of Crittenden County Hospital are \nthe ones who lose out. Rashelle's first two babies were born in \nCrittenden County Hospital, about 10 minutes from her home. But her \nthird child had to be delivered about 40 miles away because rising \nmalpractice rates caused doctors at Crittenden County Hospital to stop \ndelivering babies altogether.\n  This isn't an isolated problem, and it is not just obstetricians. \nAccording to a report by the Kentucky Institute of Medicine, Kentucky \nis nearly 2,300 doctors short of the national average--a shortage that \ncould be reduced, in part, by reforming medical malpractice laws.\n  Comprehensive health care reforms are long overdue--reforms that \nlower cost and increase access to care. But a government-run plan isn't \nthe way to do it. There are other solutions that address our problems \nwithout undermining our strengths.\n  Over the past few weeks, I have warned about the dangers of \ngovernment-run health care by pointing to the problems this kind of \ngovernment-run system has created in places such as Britain, Canada, \nand New Zealand. These countries are living proof that when the \ngovernment is in charge, health care is denied, delayed, and rationed. \nAs I have noted, the main culprits in every case are the government \nboards that decide what procedures and medicines patients can and \ncannot have.\n  I have discussed how Britain's government board has denied care to \ncancer patients because the treatments were too expensive. In one case, \nbureaucrats in Britain refused to prescribe cancer drugs that were \nproven to extend the lives of patients because they cost too much. The \ngovernment board explained it this way:\n\n       Although these treatments are clinically effective, \n     regrettably the cost . . . is such that they are not a cost \n     effective use of . . . resources.\n\n  I have also discussed how the government-run health care system in \nCanada\n\n[[Page S6577]]\n\nroutinely delays care. Today, the average wait for a hip replacement at \none hospital in Kingston, Ontario, is about 196 days. Knee replacement \nsurgery at the same hospital takes an average of 340 days. The American \npeople don't want to be told they have to wait 6 months for a hip \nreplacement or a year for a knee replacement, but that is what could \nvery well happen in a government-run health care system.\n  Finally, I have discussed how New Zealand's government board has \nrationed care by deciding which new hospital medicines are cost \neffective. In one case, government bureaucrats in that country denied \npatients access to a drug that was proven to be effective in fighting \nbreast cancer because they thought it was too expensive. As one cancer \ndoctor in the country put it:\n\n       New Zealand is a good tourist destination, but options for \n     cancer treatment are not so attractive there right now.\n\n  Americans want health care reform, but they don't want the kind of \nreform that denies, delays, and rations care, such as the government-\nrun systems in New Zealand, Britain, and Canada. They don't want to be \nforced into a government plan that replaces the freedoms and choices \nthey now enjoy with bureaucratic hassles, hours spent on hold, and \npoliticians in Washington telling them how much care and what kind of \ncare they can have. They want health care decisions left to doctors and \npatients, not remote bureaucrats. But if some in Washington get their \nway and enact a government takeover of health care, that is exactly \nwhat Americans can expect.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I want to take a moment to honor a \nNorth Dakota family filled with heroes. Even in a State where sacrifice \nis more than a slogan and service is a way of life, the Lothspeich \nfamily stands out. When their nation needed them, every single one of \nthe nine Lothspeich brothers rose to answer the call to duty.\n  Today we recognize the service of the three brothers who are still \nwith us, and honor the memory of those who are not. In times of crisis, \nit is our best and bravest that step forward, risking it all, to come \nto the defense of our Nation. The honorable service of each of these \nnine brothers epitomizes the story of our Nation's veterans.\n  Eugene was a machine gunner in Italy in the Second World War, where \nhe was awarded the Purple Heart. Harold served in the Philippines, \nwhere he earned two battle stars. Edward served in the Pacific with the \nNavy, Donald served in Germany at the peak of the Cold War, Gerald \nworked with the atomic bomb program here in the U.S. Lyle was a rifle \ninstructor helping to train the next generation of our Nation's \nservicemembers, and Spike served in the Air Force Medical Service Corps \nin Japan.\n  From World War II through the Korean conflict and the Cold War, for \n15 years running, at least one of these nine men could be found in \nuniform, serving their country in the Army, in the Navy, and in the Air \nForce. It is truly a remarkable story. We owe a deep debt of gratitude \nto them and to all of our veterans.\n  Years ago our forefathers founded this country with a vision of \nfreedom for all. It was that vision that inspired the Lothspeich \nbrothers to leave Park River, ND, to travel to Italy, Germany, Japan \nand the Philippines in defense of this great land. We honor them, and \nwe honor all of our brave veterans and all of those who serve our \ncountry in uniform today. Without selfless service by those like the \nLothspeichs, we simply would not have the freedoms we hold most \ndear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/15/senate-section/article/S6577-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CONGRATULATING RICKEY HENDERSON\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncongratulating Rickey Henderson on his induction into the National \nBaseball Hall of Fame on July 26, 2009. During a remarkable 25-year \ncareer, Rickey Henderson's keen batting eye and unique combination of \nspeed and power earned him the recognition as one of the greatest \nleadoff hitters in the game's long and storied history.\n  Born on Christmas day in 1958, Rickey Henderson and his family moved \nto Oakland, CA, when he was 2 years old. He was a standout athlete at \nOakland Technical High School, where he excelled at basketball, \nbaseball and football. Though his exploits on the gridiron as an All-\nAmerican running back earned him dozens of scholarship offers, Rickey \nchose to pursue a professional baseball career and follow his dream to \ndon the green and gold of his hometown Oakland Athletics.\n  Rickey Henderson made his major debut on June 24, 1979. Over the \ncourse of the next 25 seasons, he would compile one of the most \nimpressive resumes in baseball history. In a game which defines \ngreatness by statistics, Rickey Henderson's name can be found at or \nnear the top of some of the more hallowed records in baseball history. \nThe 10-time All Star retired as the all-time leader in career walks and \nholds the career records for runs scored and stolen bases as well as \nthe single-season stolen base record. The 8 stolen bases that he \namassed during his Most Valuable Player performance in the 1989 \nAmerican League Championship Series remains the record for most stolen \nbases in a single postseason series. A year after spearheading the \nOakland A's 1989 World Series title, Rickey was named the American \nLeague Most Valuable Player in 1990.\n  Rickey Henderson's induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame \nwill see him join Joe Morgan and Frank Robinson as a legend of the game \nwho honed his skills and love for America's pastime during his \nformative years in Oakland. During three separate stints with his \nhometown team, Rickey established a bond with generations of loyal \nOakland A's fans that remains as strong today as when Rickey stole 130 \nbases in 1982. Speaking after his election into the Hall of Fame, he \nsaid that, ``in my eyes, I wanted to see the fans in Oakland enjoy the \ngame as much as I enjoyed it . . . playing in front of friends and \nfamily there gave me a little bit more of a boost. It helped me out in \nmy career, and I was proud to go out there and represent the Oakland \narea.'' Judging from his achievements on the field and his devotion to \nthe fans, it is clear to see why Rickey Henderson is one of the most \nbeloved sports figures in the bay area and a worthy exemplar of the \nrich history of major league baseball in Oakland.\n  As his teammates and fans would attest, Rickey Henderson is a \ndeserving inductee into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. Throughout \nhis career in baseball, Rickey has consistently achieved excellence on \nthe field and conducted himself with integrity and character off the \nfield.\n  I congratulate Rickey Henderson on his induction in the National \nBaseball Hall of Fame, and wish him continued success in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/15/senate-section/article/S6577-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6577-S6578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SISTER CITY RELATIONSHIP\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \n50th anniversary of the sister city relationship between the city and \ncounty of Honolulu and the city of Hiroshima.\n  Mr. President, 1959 was an eventful and significant year in history. \nNot only was Hawaii admitted into the Union as the 50th State, but on \nMay 19, 1959, the city and county of Honolulu Council passed a \nresolution inviting the city of Hiroshima into a sister city agreement. \nEstablished by former U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower, the ``People to \nPeople'' program was to promote peace and mutual understanding between \ncitizens of different countries. Many of Hawaii's residents were of \nJapanese ancestry or were originally from Hiroshima. With this in\n\n[[Page S6578]]\n\nmind, the Honolulu Council thought a relationship between Honolulu and \nHiroshima would be a fitting one, brought together through similarities \nand a resonance of cultural familiarity. This ``sister city'' agreement \nholds special significance for me and my family, as I was born in \nHonolulu and my maternal grandparents were from the Hiroshima \nPrefecture.\n  Fifty years later, this relationship, as well as the overall United \nStates--Japan relationship, has formed into an enduring partnership of \nnations. This valued alliance has matured through the years, and it is \nmy privilege to serve as honorary chairman of the 50th anniversary \ncommittee for the sister city relationship. I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognition of this momentous occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/15/senate-section/article/S6578-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13405 OF JUNE 16, 2006, WITH \n  RESPECT TO BELARUS, AS RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE ON \n                          JUNE 12, 2009--PM 23\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to protect all patients by prohibiting the use of \ndata obtained from comparative effectiveness research to deny coverage \nof items or services under Federal health care programs and to ensure \nthat comparative effectiveness research accounts for advancements in \npersonalized medicine and differences in patient treatment response; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to talk about a bill Senator McConnell \nand I introduced today. I think a companion bill will also be \nintroduced by some of the leadership in the House of Representatives. \nThe number of the bill is S. 1259, and this bill is called the PATIENTS \nAct--``patient'' as in doctor-patient. The idea is to focus on health \ncare as it relates to patients.\n  Health care reform should be patient centered. Nothing should come \nbetween the physician and the patient. We are concerned there is \nsomething being done that we need to stop because it could, in fact, \ninsert government bureaucracies between the patient and the physician. \nWhat has happened is that in the stimulus bill, the Congress \nappropriated $1.1 billion for something called comparative \neffectiveness research. Comparative effectiveness research has been \nused for years by physicians and hospitals. Medical schools do \nresearch, and they determine what kinds of treatments are best. For \nexample, if you have two different drugs for the same condition, they \nwill do testing to see which one seems to work the best. It is called \nclinical trials. They do clinical research, and physicians and \nhospitals frequently use that research as recommended for the best way \nto treat a particular condition. It is not mandatory. Obviously, what \nis good for most patients may not be good for all patients. So it is \nnot something that is obviously forced upon people, but it provides \ngood information. The problem is that too many people now who are \nproposing health care reform want to use comparative effectiveness \nresearch to end up rationing care, to have a Federal entity or even a \nState entity, or I should say a private entity, use that research in \nways that would end up rationing care, to say some care is just too \nexpensive for you to have, and since the government is paying for it, \nthe government is not going to give it to you.\n  What our bill would do is make it clear that comparative \neffectiveness research cannot be used to deny coverage of either a \nhealth care service or treatment by the Secretary of HHS. And we say \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services because all of the various \nentities that might do that in the Federal Government are part of HHS. \nSo we simply prohibit the Secretary of HHS from using this comparative \neffectiveness research to deny\n\n[[Page S6583]]\n\nhealth care service or treatment. You would think that would be \nuncontroversial, and I am hoping at the end of the day that it is not \ncontroversial. Nobody wants their health care rationed by somebody here \nin Washington, DC.\n  It would also require that comparative effectiveness research account \nfor differences in the preference of patients and their treatment \nresponse to personalized medicine on something called genomics.\n  Genomics is the breakdown of the genes in the body into all of the \ndifferent elements which make us unique as individuals. What genomics \nresearch focuses on is, what exactly is it in your gene composition, \nthe human genome, that might be different from someone else's that \nmeans that a personalized treatment would work for you whereas it might \nnot work for someone else. They are actually finding that they can \ntailor specific drugs to treat specific genes in such a way that, if \nthey know your human composition, they can find a way to treat your \ncondition--say, a cancer--potentially slightly differently than they \nwould treat someone else's cancer, whether it is in the dosage of the \nmedicine or in the specific kind of medicine or however it might be--\nthe point being that not everyone is the same. In fact, we are all \ndifferent, we are all unique, and one of the things medicine must \nrecognize is our uniqueness as individuals and not get into the habit \nof saying that there is a sort of a size that fits all here, and we are \ngoing to say that if doctors will treat everyone with this particular \nmedical device or drug or treatment, then we will pay for it, but we \nare not going to pay for it if they do anything else. That would not be \ngood medicine. That inserts the government between the doctor and the \npatient. So we say that can't be done using this comparative \neffectiveness research.\n  By the way, the bill also makes clear that nothing prohibits the FDA \nCommissioner from responding to drug safety concerns under his \nauthority. Obviously, if a drug is not safe, the FDA needs to say the \ndrug is not safe and the Federal Government is not going to pay for it. \nThat is obvious.\n  But the point is that this comparative effectiveness research should \nnot be used by the government to deny or delay or to ration care. The \nreason for it is, obviously, we all want to be in charge of our own \nhealth care with our doctor. We want the choice. If a doctor says: We \nthink you need this kind of treatment and we can get coverage for that \nfrom our insurance, we want to be able to get that care. If we cannot, \nwe want to try to find insurance that will provide that kind of \ncoverage for us. At least at a minimum, we want to be able to pay for \nthe treatment, if nothing else. What we do not want is for the Federal \nGovernment to say that it does not matter if you want to pay for it, it \ndoes not matter if you are covered, you cannot get it because the \nFederal Government says so.\n  This is especially important if we have a government-run insurance \ncompany, which is what many on the other side of the aisle are talking \nabout.\n  The President has said he wants a so-called public option so there \nwill be a government insurance company that will be a place where \neverybody could go for coverage if they don't have it. I happen to \nthink there are better ways of getting everybody covered. To the extent \nwe have some people who need help in getting coverage, the government \ncan provide that help without changing the kind of coverage all the \nrest of us have. Surveys show, by about two to one, Americans believe \nwe should help people get insurance who don't have it. But by the same \nrough numbers, everybody says: However, you don't need to affect my \ncoverage in order to do that. In other words, I have insurance. I like \nit. I want to keep it. I don't want to change. I don't want to have to \npay through my insurance or through having care rationed in order to \nmake sure somebody else gets care. The bottom line is, we all want that \nsacred doctor-patient relationship maintained.\n  One might ask: Why would we be worried that this comparative \neffectiveness research might be used to ration care? Is there anything \nin the legislation that suggests this is going to happen? As it turns \nout, in both the bill that came from the HELP Committee and the \nlegislation that will be drafted in the Finance Committee, there are \norganizations that are going to do this research that could, in fact, \nration care. In the HELP Committee bill, there is a specific provision \nthat a government entity is going to be created to conduct this \nresearch and nothing whatsoever prohibits that entity from denying care \nbased upon the application of rationing. The same is true under the \nplan talked about in the Finance Committee. There a private entity is \norganized, but there is nothing that would prevent the Federal \nGovernment from rationing the care that is researched by the private \nentity.\n  The HELP Committee creates what it calls the agency for health care \nresearch and quality in the Department of Health and Human Services. In \nthe Finance Committee, it is a private research entity. But in neither \ncase is the Federal Government prohibited from using this comparative \neffectiveness research in rationing care.\n  In addition, the HELP Committee bill establishes a medical advisory \ncouncil. The medical advisory council is specifically given very broad \nauthority to make recommendations on health benefits coverage; in other \nwords, what is covered by the Federal Government. Obviously, when the \nFederal Government sets rules, insurance companies frequently apply \nthose same kind of rules. We don't want the government, rather than \npatients and doctors, making decisions about how much health care or \nwhat health care one would have.\n  Another point I have tried to make to colleagues is, if they think \nthe Federal Government isn't considering this, think about what some \npeople have said in the Federal Government about allocating treatment \nbased upon cost. No less than the Acting Director of the National \nInstitutes of Health, Raynard Kington, announced that the NIH could use \nthis stimulus money, money in the so-called stimulus bill that pays for \ncomparative effectiveness research, to ration care just as is done in \nother countries. The NIH released a list of research topics and called \nfor the inclusion of rigorous cost effectiveness analysis because \n``cost effectiveness research will provide accurate and objective \ninformation to guide future policies that support the allocation of \nhealth resources for the treatment of acute and chronic diseases.'' \n``Allocation of resources'' is a euphemism for rationing of health \ncare. Similar statements have been made by Larry Summers. Frankly, the \nPresident himself has talked about this, not in those specific terms, \nbut in a recent interview with the New York Times he said:\n\n       What I think government can do effectively is to be an \n     honest broker in assessing and evaluating treatment options.\n\n  If the government is going to be a broker in treatment options, that \nalso is a euphemism for deciding what it is going to pay for and what \nit will not. In other words, what one can and cannot get.\n  When a former Senator and at one point candidate for HHS Secretary \ntalked about this, he acknowledged in a book he wrote that doctors and \npatients might resent any encroachment on their ability to use certain \ntreatments, but he called for the same kind of body in his book that \nwould, in effect, allocate treatments based upon this kind of cost \nresearch.\n  There are many others who have spoken about it as well. We know from \nexperience that this hasn't worked out so well in countries that have \ntried it such as Great Britain and Canada. In fact, I will quote one \nother individual who has talked about this, a professor at the Harvard \nBusiness School. Regina Herzlinger said that the comparative \neffectiveness research in the stimulus bill could easily morph into \nwhat she called ``an instrument of health care rationing by the federal \ngovernment.''\n  There are comparisons to what is being done in Great Britain and \nother European countries and Canada; ironically, at a time when those \ncountries are actually turning away from the federal monopoly or the \nnational monopoly because of the fact that it has resulted in rationing \nof care that the citizens of those countries don't like.\n  A former head of the American Medical Association, which has endorsed \nthe legislation Senator McConnell and I are introducing, said in an op-\ned in the Chicago Tribune today, talking about the British agency, for \nwhich, ironically, the acronym is NICE:\n\n       For example, the agency that makes these decisions in the \n     United Kingdom determined\n\n[[Page S6584]]\n\n     that we are all worth $22,750 or six months of life or $125 a \n     day. I'm sorry. But $125 is the cost of a nice date with my \n     wife, not the value of my life.\n\n  What he is talking about is something called quality adjusted life \nyears which is the British definition of the value they are going to \nplace on a life for the purpose of comparing the cost done by this cost \neffectiveness research to see whether the cost of the treatment \noutweighs the value of the life. Think about that. Let me quote from \nthe NICE Web site. It stands for National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence, NICE. Here is what it says on Great Britain's Web \nsite:\n\n       With the rapid advances in modern medicine, most people \n     accept that no publicly funded health care system, including \n     the NHS, can possibly pay for any new medical treatment that \n     becomes available.\n\n  If the Federal Government has a monopoly, it probably doesn't have \nenough money to pay for every treatment that becomes available. It goes \non to say:\n\n       The enormous costs involved mean that choices have to be \n     made.\n\n  That is why they ration care in Great Britain. It goes on:\n\n       The QALY [quality-adjusted life year] method helps us \n     measure these factors so we can compare different treatments \n     for the same and different conditions.\n\n  It is an idea of how much extra months or years of life of reasonable \nquality a person might gain as a result of the treatment.\n\n       Each drug is considered on a case-by-case basis. Generally, \n     however, if a treatment costs more than 20,000 to 30,000 \n     pounds per [quality-adjusted life year], then it would not be \n     considered cost effective.\n\n  And they don't give it to you.\n  We have many examples of people in Great Britain who are denied care \nbecause the government has decided that the cost of the treatment is \nmore than the quality-adjusted life year. This is adjusted for age so \nthat the older you get, even though the treatment may cost less, you \nare less likely to get it because of your age. Think about that for a \nmoment. If something costs $20,000 in the United States and you are 65 \nyears of age and they decide that they can't afford to pay for it, is \nthat what the United States of America is all about? Is that what our \ngovernment should be telling us? Should the government have the right \nto say: Based on this research we have done, you can't have that \ntreatment?\n  If you believe that can't happen in the United States, I think it \ncan. It has happened in Great Britain and Canada. Our legislation says \nit can't. So what is the harm in adopting our legislation? That is the \nquestion I will be asking of anyone who says is it not necessary.\n  I want to put the question: Then what harm does it do to say that \nthis research can't be used by the Federal Government to deny or delay \ntreatment? I hope my colleagues will appreciate that health care is the \nmost important thing to all of us for our families. Whatever else we \nmay think needs to be done to reform health care, the one thing we can \nall agree on is, it should not result in rationing of health care for \nAmericans. Our legislation is one step in that process. It doesn't \npreclude rationing of health care in other ways. But at least it says \ncomparative effectiveness research cannot be used in order to ration \ncare. I hope our colleagues will view this legislation as an important \nstep we can take.\n  Let me give a couple examples I said I would provide. There is a \nfellow by the name of Rocky Fernandez, a kidney cancer patient in \nBritain. He was given 2 months to live when the cancer spread to his \nlungs. His doctor wanted to prescribe a drug called Sutent, a new drug \nfor advanced kidney cancer, but the government said no. He and \nthousands of other cancer patients protested the government's decision. \nThis is what you would have to do, I gather. The government ultimately \nreversed its decision and, fortunately, he was able to begin taking the \ndrug. The British health authorities knew this wasn't the end, that as \nmore costly life extending drugs would become available, patients would \ndemand access to the drugs and the government would be faced with \nincreasingly difficult decisions. So faced with a finite pot of \nresources, the British health authorities decided that expensive drugs \nlike Sutent would only be approved under specific conditions: They must \nextend life by 3 months, and they must be used for illnesses that \naffect fewer than 7,000 patients a year.\n  Is that what we want in the United States? Before you could get a \ndrug that would give you better quality of life or extend your life, \nthe government is going to run through tests like this. And if it \ndoesn't meet the test, you don't get the drug? This is the danger of a \ngovernment-run system. In effect, bureaucrats in the government become \nhealth care cops. We don't want that in America.\n  In the reform legislation that we end up acting on, I hope we can all \nagree that one of the things we can do to prevent this rationing is to \nat least say we will do no harm. We will not allow this comparative \neffectiveness research to be used by the Federal Government to deny our \ncare.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record the op-ed from the \nChicago Tribune by Dr. Palmisano from which I quoted earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Chicago Tribune, June 15, 2009]\n\n           Reform Measures Should Not Weaken Our Health Care\n\n                        (By Donald J. Palmisano)\n\n       Over the past several decades, our nation has built the \n     finest health-care system in the world. From birth to death \n     we value and care for life. Surgeons can perform life-saving \n     heart surgery on a child that is still in utero. Expert \n     trauma doctors can save the life of a mother who was badly \n     hurt in a car crash. And end-of-life specialists can provide \n     compassionate palliative care to seniors to ensure their last \n     days are spent in comfort.\n       This didn't all just magically happen. But it could all \n     magically go away.\n       Swirling around us is a great debate that will decide the \n     future of medical care in America. There are those who desire \n     a single-payer system, although the ``single payer'' would be \n     the 100 million Americans who pay taxes. It would leave the \n     government in charge of our medical choices. But since \n     single-payer advocates know the majority of Americans oppose \n     such a system, they have decided to advance an alternative--\n     known as the public option.\n       Either approach would seriously weaken the health-care \n     system we enjoy today. The public option would cost $1.2 \n     trillion to $1.8 trillion to set up. Is that something our \n     nation can afford, especially considering the latest \n     estimates that Medicare is going to be bankrupt in 10 years?\n       Is it the goal of some individuals to eventually wipe out \n     all private insurance plans and house all health care under \n     the umbrella of the federal government? These types of \n     government-controlled systems already exist in other \n     countries, and all have stories of patients who had to wait \n     months to see specialists. It's common to hear of patients \n     who were not allowed to get the treatment their doctor \n     prescribed because a bureaucratic decision was made on the \n     value of their life. For example, the agency that makes these \n     decisions in the United Kingdom determined that we are all \n     worth $22,750 for six months of life--or $125 a day. I'm \n     sorry, but $125 is the cost of a nice date with my wife, not \n     the value of life.\n       The American Medical Association, representing more than \n     250,000 physicians, and an organization I once led, recently \n     came out in opposition to the proposed public plan, saying \n     that it ``threatens to restrict patient choice'' and that it \n     ``would likely lead to an explosion of costs that would need \n     to be absorbed by taxpayers.''\n       That position comes from studying government-controlled \n     health care elsewhere. During my year as president of the \n     AMA, I was able to visit and see firsthand the success and \n     failures of other health-care systems. I recall meeting with \n     the chairman of the British Medical Association in June 2003, \n     when he characterized his nation's single-payer health-care \n     system as ``the stifling of innovation by excessive, \n     intrusive audit . . . the shackling of doctors by prescribing \n     guidelines, referral guidelines and protocols . . . the \n     suffocation of professional responsibility by target-setting \n     and production line values that leave little room for the \n     professional judgment of individual doctors or the needs of \n     individual patients.''\n       And what else will happen when the government asserts its \n     control over health care? Medical creativity, discovery and \n     innovation--the same creativity and discovery and innovation \n     that we have relied on for generations--will dry up. Today, \n     millions of Americans rely on statins to reduce their risk of \n     heart attack. The new da Vinci surgical system is already \n     revolutionizing the way surgery is performed in operating \n     rooms across the country. And wounded veterans are being \n     fitted with next-generation prosthetic limbs so they can walk \n     again.\n       Only in America.\n       We must find ways to expand access to affordable health \n     care to the uninsured. America can solve the current problems \n     with a system that expands insurance coverage through tax \n     credits, consumer choice and market enhancements. However, in \n     the process of expanding care, we cannot create a weaker \n     system for the 80 percent of Americans who are happy with \n     their coverage. It\n\n[[Page S6585]]\n\n     would be a serious mistake to have a government-controlled \n     micromanaged medical system that would result in diminished \n     quality of care, long waiting lines for doctors' visits and \n     surgical care, a lack of access to emerging technologies and \n     the virtual end to new and hopeful medical discovery. Health \n     care shouldn't be dictated to us by a faceless bureaucrat in \n     Washington.\n       A lot is at stake as the nation engages in the health-care \n     debate. Will we have a system that puts the patient in \n     control with the doctor as trusted adviser, or a government-\n     run system that ultimately rations care and stifles \n     innovation and self-determination? I hope it's the former.\n\n  Mr. KYL. We have actually seen the danger in using this kind of \nresearch for rationing of care in another context. When we created \nMedicare Part D, which provides drugs to seniors, we saw the danger of \nrationing of drugs, and so we specifically provided, in the Medicare \nModernization Act, an explicit provision that says you can't use cost-\neffective analysis to allocate the drugs. It is prohibited there. What \nwe should do is take that same policy and apply it to the rest of our \nhealth care, to seniors who are on Medicare and to the rest of the \npopulation, to the extent the Federal Government will be able to \ndictate its care. We have not provided that same protection for any \nother care, and that is what our legislation, the PATIENTS Act, would \ndo.\n  The final thing I wish to discuss is the notion that we can have a \ngovernment-run insurance plan and that somehow that will be healthy for \nAmericans. Stop and think, a government-run option or government option \nwould be the Federal Government making decisions about care. So while \nyou may decide it is a lot cheaper because the Federal Government can \nsubsidize the insurance plan, the government will actually be deciding \nwhat kind of coverage you get. This is one of the areas we are \nconcerned about in using this comparative effectiveness research. \nBecause clearly the so-called public option, in order to keep costs \ndown, could end up rationing care. That is OK if it is merely an option \nand people figured out, wait a minute, even though it is cheaper, I \ndon't want this. But what Lewin and Associates, a health care \nconsulting group, says is that unfortunately, because private employers \nare likely to dump their employees into the government-run system, \nabout two-thirds of the people who have insurance today, 119 million \npeople, would end up with the government-run plan rather than the \nprivate insurance they have today. When the President says, if you like \nyour insurance coverage, you get to keep it, I hope what he means is \nthat we won't do anything in our legislation to make that more \ndifficult.\n  But if, in fact, the predictions of consulting groups such as Lewin \ncome true, what will happen is, employers, faced with the situation \nwhere it is much cheaper for them to insure their employees through \nthis government-run plan, will take 119 million people and transfer \nthem from private insurance to government insurance. At that point, you \ndo not have any option. So the government-run plan is not like it is an \noption for you, unless you want to change jobs to an employer that is \nwilling to maintain the coverage. And those are going to be few and far \nbetween. The same thing is true with the individual health care market.\n  The bottom line is, when people say to you: Well, if you like your \ncoverage, you are going to be able to keep it, that is not true. \nIncidentally, under the bill that is being written by the Finance \nCommittee, that is explicitly not true either. That is why we are \nconcerned about this. Because even though you may like the insurance \nyou have today and say: The Federal Government can't tell me what care \nI can get, it will not be too much longer before that may not be true. \nYou will have the government insurance, and it will tell you what care \nit can give you.\n  When we talk about the fact that we are eager for health reform, what \nwe are talking about is allowing people to keep their current coverage; \nallowing them to take their coverage with them; that is to say, it is \nportable when you leave one job and you go to another job, to make sure \nyou cannot be denied care because you have a preexisting condition; and \nif you need financial help in getting insurance, to find a way to \nprovide that financial help.\n  We believe those are better solutions to making sure everyone is \ninsured than providing a public option. It is a little like the \ngovernment taking over General Motors. The only difference is, it is \none thing if the people who are now running General Motors make a \nmistake. It is usually not going to be a life-or-death situation. But \nit is a whole new ball game if the government is deciding you cannot \nget a particular drug or a particular kind of surgery that your doctor \nsays you need.\n  The bottom line is, Washington-run health care has significant \ndangers in it--more than if you are going to run the insurance \ncompanies or the car companies or the banks. When you have a Medical \nAdvisory Council, as the HELP Committee legislation provides, or a \nNational Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence--NICE--as in \nGreat Britain, it is anything but nice when your health care is denied \nto you.\n  What we are trying to prevent by this legislation, for the final \ntime, is a situation where the government is in a position to tell you \nthat you cannot have a certain drug or treatment or device your doctor \nhas said you need because they use this comparative effectiveness \nresearch to say: Well, in your case, you are not going to live much \nlonger anyway. It is not cost effective for us to buy that for you.\n  That is not the American way. As I said, it is ironic countries such \nas Canada and Great Britain are actually beginning to now provide \nprivate alternatives because they know they cannot take care of all \ntheir citizens, and they know there is a revolt going on in their \ncountries about people who are not getting the care they need. So the \nsafety valve for that is to provide an option for the private sector to \nactually provide for this coverage.\n  Why would we want to replicate their basic mistake in so-called \nhealth care reform? There are easier, less costly, and less harmful \nways to do that than the legislation that is being proposed that would \nallow comparative effectiveness research to ration your care.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at our legislation, S. 1259.

A bill to repeal title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005 and \namend title II\n\n[[Page S6586]]\n\nof the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to better protect the security, \nconfidentiality, and integrity of personally identifiable information \ncollected by States when issuing driver's licenses and identification \ndocuments, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am, along with Senators Voinovich, \nLeahy, Tester, Baucus, and Carper, introducing the Providing for \nAdditional Security in States' Identification Act of 2009, or the PASS \nID Act.\n  This bill represents a pragmatic approach to resolving many of the \nmost troubling aspects of the REAL ID Act, which has been in place for \nthe past 4 years. REAL ID was intended to implement the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendation for enhancing the security of drivers' \nlicenses. I support the 9/11 Commission's recommendation, but I have \nbeen a long-time opponent of the existing REAL ID Act due to the \ntremendous financial burden it imposes on States and the serious \nprivacy risks it creates.\n  Initially, DHS estimated the cost of implementing REAL ID to be $23 \nbillion, of which $14 billion would be borne by the States. In the \nfinal regulations, DHS's overall cost estimate decreased to $10 \nbillion, $4 billion of which States would have to pay. Many States are \nfacing serious budget shortfalls and simply cannot afford this cost.\n  Additionally, REAL ID calls for all States to store copies of \nindividuals' documents such as birth certificates and their photographs \nin databases and to provide all other State Departments of Motor \nVehicles with access to that information. REAL ID does not require any \nprivacy protection of these State databases, which would contain \nmassive amounts of personal information. These databases could provide \none-stop shopping for identity thieves and the backbone for a national \nidentification database.\n  Because of these problems, the Department of Homeland Security has \nbeen forced to provide a series of extensions for compliance. All 50 \nStates plus the District of Columbia and the territories were granted \nextensions until December 31, 2009. DHS may automatically grant States \nfurther extensions to May 11, 2011, if they meet certain benchmarks for \ncompliance. Under the final regulations, complete implementation is \nrequired by December 1, 2017. Even under this drawn out timeline, it is \nunclear if many States will comply. Several States, including Hawaii, \nhave passed resolutions expressing their opposition to REAL ID. Eleven \nStates have outright rejected REAL ID, putting millions of Americans at \nrisk of not being able to enter Federal facilities or board commercial \nairplanes next year if they do not meet DHS benchmarks. Americans' \npersonal information could also be compromised if REAL ID were to fully \ntake effect in its current form. This simply cannot be allowed to \nhappen.\n  Because of my grave concerns with the REAL ID program, during the \nlast Congress, I along with several of my colleagues introduced the \nIdentity Security Enhancement Act, which would have repealed the REAL \nID Act and replaced it with a negotiated rulemaking process that would \nhave enhanced the security of State driver's licenses while also \nproviding for strong privacy protections. Unfortunately, this bill did \nnot advance, and we are now closer than ever to forcing states to \nensure compliance with REAL ID.\n  I along with my colleagues, the Department of Homeland Security, \nprivacy and civil liberties groups, and the National Governors \nAssociation and National Council of State Legislators--representing a \nbroad range of views on REAL ID--have been working together to develop \na bill that will address the onerous problems with REAL ID in a \npractical manner that can win bipartisan support. I believe that the \nbill we are introducing represents a pragmatic alternative to REAL ID, \nwhich will save States considerable money and address the most \ntroubling aspects of the REAL ID Act.\n\n  The PASS ID Act does exactly what the 9/11 Commission recommended: it \nsets strong security standards for the issuance of identification cards \nand driver's licenses. What it does not do is go far beyond that \nrecommendation by requiring the collection of Americans' personal \ninformation and storing it in a centralized repository accessible by \nany State government. This legislation starts with repealing the \nexisting flawed REAL ID Act, and replaces it with a modification of the \noriginal act that peels away the most troubling aspects that add high \ncosts without real security benefits, and implements strong new \nprotections to protect the privacy rights of individuals.\n  Perhaps the most important improvement in the PASS ID Act is the \nremoval of the mandate that States share all of their driver's license \ndata with each of the other States. This provision created a clear risk \nto the privacy of all Americans' personal information and posed a great \nrisk for identity theft and fraud. Moreover, it was this provision that \nraised the specter of a national database of all Americans' personal \ninformation. The PASS ID Act instead will allow States to continue to \nmaintain their own individual databases with more stringent security \nrequirements.\n  In addition, the PASS ID Act includes all of the privacy protections \ncalled for in my previous bill, the Identity Security Enhancement Act. \nThe bill calls on the States to put procedures in place to protect \ninformation that is stored or transmitted in an electronic format. The \nbill also for the first time protects any machine readable data stored \non identification cards and driver's licenses themselves. In \nparticular, Social Security numbers, which are not allowed to be \nprinted on the face of a license, would no longer be allowed to be \nstored in the machine readable zone, MRZ, of a license either.\n  Because of the ability of licenses to hold more and more electronic \ninformation, it is also important to institute important new \nprotections for the use of the data stored on licenses. A new industry \nis growing up surrounding the collection and sale of data stored in \nMRZs for marketing purposes. Often people are not informed that their \npersonal information is being collected and might be tracked with their \npurchases or sold to third parties. This bill would allow scanning of \nlicenses to support law enforcement purposes but not for other \npurposes. For example, a store would be able to scan a driver's license \nto double check that the patron is old enough to buy alcohol, but it \nwould not be allowed to sell the information on the card to marketers. \nThis is an important step forward to ensure that privacy and security \nprotections keep pace with technology, while still ensuring that the \nMRZ can be used for its intended purposes.\n  The other change that I want to point out is the clarification of \nAmericans' right to travel on commercial aircraft and to enter Federal \nbuildings. The current law restricts these rights by requiring a REAL \nID to board commercial aircraft and to enter Federal buildings. This \nbill recognizes the importance of secure identification to increase the \nsafety and security of commercial air travel and a narrower range of \nFederal buildings. Compliant State identification will remain the \npreferred method to board an aircraft, but the PASS ID Act will clarify \nthat people cannot be denied boarding solely because they lack secure \nidentification. The Transportation Security Administration will resolve \nany security concerns with people lacking a PASS ID the same way they \nresolve other security issues--with additional screening or other \ninquiries as needed. Additionally, PASS ID would narrow the secure \nidentification requirement from all Federal buildings to only Federal \nfacilities containing mission functions critical to homeland security, \nnational security, or defense.\n  This bill does not address all of my concerns with REAL ID. Some \nothers will be disappointed that it does not address all of their \nconcerns. However, the reality that we face is that in less than a \nyear, States will be required to comply with a law on the books that \nsimply is overly burdensome and unworkable. I believe that the \nlegislation introduced today is the best bill that can garner broad \nbipartisan support. It represents a strong step toward fixing the most \nserious shortfalls in the REAL ID Act and would introduce long-overdue, \nimportant new protections. We cannot let the perfect be the enemy of \nthe good, especially when we are working to address a seriously flawed \nlaw already on the books.\n\n[[Page S6587]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to talk to your Governors and other State \ngovernment officials, your constituents, and to privacy experts to \nunderstand just how much this legislation does to improve existing law. \nBy taking the time to work with all stakeholders, I think that we have \nachieved a solution that leaves us much better off than we are today.\n  As always, my goal remains to ensure the privacy rights of all \nAmericans, and I will continue to work closely with the Department of \nHomeland Security to ensure that privacy rights are protected fully \nduring the implementation of PASS ID.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1261\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act \nand titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security Act to provide \nadditional resources for primary care services, to create new payment \nmodels for services under Medicare, to expand provision of non-\ninstitutionally-based long-term services, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medical \nEfficiency and Delivery Improvement of Care Act, MEDIC, a bill which \nprovides common-sense solutions to many of the most critical problems \nbesetting our health care system. As we embark on reforming health care \nin America, we are faced with restructuring a system as complex as it \nis important--a system which includes not only doctors and patients but \nmedical schools, nursing homes, hospitals and community health centers. \nWhile every piece of the health care puzzle requires individual \nattention, one common thread connects them all: the need for improved \nefficiency among providers though increased access to primary care \nphysicians. They are the ones who can provide coordinated care for \npatients, leading to better quality and a more efficient system. That \nis why I am introducing this bill as a vehicle for proposals which \nincrease the efficiency and coordination across the health care \nspectrum to improve health and save money.\n  In my State of Washington doctors and hospitals provide some of the a \nhighest quality and most cost-efficient care in the nation. However, \ninstead of rewarding our State for reining in unnecessary costs and \nimproving the health of patients, the current system actually penalizes \nthem. Under the current fee-for-service structure we have today, health \ncare providers are rewarded for maximizing the number of services they \nprovide rather than focusing primarily on health outcomes. This \nprovides a financial disincentive to efficient care because such \nefficiencies actually result in decreased payments. My bill addresses \nthis issue by linking physician payments to the quality of care they \nprovide, not the amount of services they perform. At the same time, the \nbill recognizes the need to allow for the differences in the cost of \ndoing business across different regions. The resulting policy creates a \nfair payment system that increases the overall quality of care while \nresulting in a savings of $55 billion a year off the Medicare rolls.\n  The backbone of our health care system is comprised of the men and \nwomen who devote their lives to the practice of medicine. While our \nnation's physician workforce is the best in the world, current policies \nhave left our primary care network woefully lacking, leaving many \nfamilies--especially those in rural areas--without access to basic \ncare. As few as 2 percent of medical students opt for careers in family \nmedicine and general surgery primarily due to the low pay associated \nwith such specialties. Therefore, a fundamental goal of reform must be \nexpanding the primary care workforce. My legislation includes \nprovisions which provide financial incentives for medical students and \nteaching hospitals--such as interest-free loans and scholarships for \nstudents going into primary care, and increased funding for small and \nrural hospitals to improve their primary care residency programs. The \nbill also calls for increasing payments to primary care physicians \ncurrently in practice. These policies will result in an improved \nprimary care infrastructure throughout the nation, providing for \nquality primary care today and well into the future.\n  Finally, we cannot address health care reform without addressing the \nneeds the individuals who require it the most: those in long-term care. \nFor many older Americans and people with disabilities, long-term care \nis not a luxury but a necessity, a required service needed to maintain \ntheir overall quality of life. Traditionally this care has been \nprovided in institutions such as nursing homes, which can cost upwards \nof $70,000 a year. While some people require the around-the-clock care \nprovided in nursing homes, many of those in need of long-term care \nwould be better off remaining in their homes where they can continue to \nbe active members of the community. Home- and community-based services \nprovide people the care they need in non-institutional settings, which, \nin addition to saving a significant amount of money, allows for the \nfreedom and independence to which people are accustomed. This \nlegislation contains several provisions which provide States with the \nresources they need to move away from institutional long-term care and \ntowards home- and community-based\n\n[[Page S6590]]\n\nservices, such as increasing Federal Medicaid dollars to transition to \nhome- and community-based services, and providing incentives to create \nconsolidated information centers so consumers and their families can \nmake well-informed decisions about long-term care options. If we gave \njust 5 percent of those who go into nursing homes the ability to \nreceive care in their own homes and communities, the Federal Government \nwould see a net savings of more than $10 billion over 5 years. This \nsignificant savings can be achieved while simultaneously providing \nbetter care; a truly win-win situation.\n  In introducing this bill I am reminding my colleagues that reforming \nhealth care need not be a zero-sum game. We can achieve our goals of \nimproving the health care workforce, stabilizing the physician payment \nstructure, improving access to needed care and decreasing the financial \nand emotional burdens associated with long-term care while \nsimultaneously providing significant savings throughout the health care \nsystem. I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate to \nensure these crtical reforms are enacted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1262\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Approximately 21 percent of physicians who were board \n     certified in general internal medicine during the early 1990s \n     have left internal medicine, compared to a 5 percent \n     departure rate for those who were certified in subspecialties \n     of internal medicine.\n       (2) The number of United States medical graduates going \n     into family medicine has fallen by more than 50 percent from \n     1997 to 2005.\n       (3) In 2007, only 88 percent of the available medicine \n     residency positions were filled and only 42 percent of those \n     were filled by United States medical school graduates.\n       (4) In 2006, only 24 percent of third-year internal \n     medicine resident intended to pursue careers in general \n     internal medicine, down from 54 percent in 1998.\n       (5) Primary care physicians serve as the point of first \n     contact for most patients and are able to coordinate the care \n     of the whole person, reducing unnecessary care and \n     duplicative testing.\n       (6) Primary care physicians and primary care providers \n     practicing preventive care, including screening for illness \n     and treating diseases, can help prevent complications that \n     result in more costly care.\n       (7) Patients with primary care physicians or primary care \n     providers have lower health care expenditures and primary \n     care is correlated with better health status, lower overall \n     mortality, and longer life expectancy.\n       (8) Higher proportions of primary care physicians are \n     associated with significantly reduced utilization.\n       (9) The United States has a higher ratio of specialists to \n     primary care physicians than other industrialized nations and \n     the population of the United States is growing faster than \n     the expected rate of growth in the supply of primary care \n     physicians.\n       (10) The number of Americans age 65 and older, those \n     eligible for Medicare and who use far more ambulatory care \n     visits per person as those under age 65, is expected to \n     double from 2000 to 2030.\n       (11) A decrease in Federal spending to carry out programs \n     authorized by title VII of the Public Health Service Act \n     threatens the viability of one of the programs used to solve \n     the problem of inadequate access to primary care.\n       (12) The National Health Service Corps program has a proven \n     record of supplying physicians to underserved areas, and has \n     played an important role in expanding access for underserved \n     populations in rural and inner city communities.\n       (13) Individuals in many geographic areas, especially rural \n     areas, lack adequate access to high quality preventive, \n     primary health care, contributing to significant health \n     disparities that impair America's public health and economic \n     productivity.\n       (14) About 20 percent of the population of the United \n     States resides in primary medical care Health Professional \n     Shortage Areas.\n\n     SEC. 2003.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The health care delivery system must be realigned to \n     provide better clinical outcomes, safety, and patient \n     satisfaction at lower cost. This should be a common goal for \n     all health care professionals, hospitals, and other groups. \n     Today's reimbursement system pays the most to those who \n     perform the most services, and therefore can provide \n     disincentives to efficient and high-quality providers.\n       (2) The regional inequities in Medicare reimbursement \n     penalize areas that have cost-effective health care delivery \n     systems and reward those States that have high utilization \n     rates and provide inefficient care.\n       (3) According to the Dartmouth Health Atlas, over the past \n     10 years, a number of studies have explored the relationship \n     between higher spending and the quality and outcomes of care. \n     The findings are remarkably consistent, concluding that \n     higher spending does not result in better quality of care.\n       (4) New payment models should be developed to move away \n     from paying for quantity and instead paying for improving \n     health and truly rewarding effective and efficient care.\n\n     SEC. 3003.

A bill to require the Secretary of the Interior to assess \nthe irrigation infrastructure of the Pine River Indian Irrigation \nProject in the State of Colorado and provide grants to, and enter into \ncooperative agreements with, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe to assess, \nrepair, rehabilitate, or reconstruct existing infrastructure, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss a bill \nthat I introduced, which seeks to rehabilitate an important irrigation \nand flood control system that is vital to serving the agricultural and \nflood protection needs in Southwestern Colorado.\n  More than 100 years ago, both Indian and non-Indian communities \nutilized the water from the Los Pinos or Pine River to irrigate areas \nof Southwest Colorado. As the population and local agriculture grew, so \ndid the need for more advanced infrastructure. In 1936, the Pine River \nIndian Irrigation Project was authorized by Congress in the Department \nof Interior Appropriation Act, and in 1937 the project grew the \nsystem's capacity to provide water for over 63,000 acres of land. The \ndevelopment of this project provided much needed protection for crops \nand communities from spring floods and summer drought.\n  Today, similar forces of population growth and a steady demand for \nirrigated water are exacerbated by aging and deteriorating \ninfrastructure, creating a need for a stronger system. The Government \nAccountability Office has found the deterioration of key project \nfacilities to be severe. As deferred maintenance and upkeep mount, \nthere is a growing threat to water conservation efforts, a reliable \nwater supply, growth in agricultural production, economic \nsustainability, a safe community, and, equally important, the \npreservation of culture and livelihood of the Southern Ute Indian \nTribe. Though the Southern Ute Tribe and others who live along the Pine \nRiver understand the hazards presented by aging infrastructure, more \nneeds to be done to comprehend the full extent of these hazards.\n  Tribal members, who would like to bring idle lands back into \nagricultural production and continue as good stewards of the land, \ncannot be sure if much-needed water will get to their lands as a result \nof failed structures, overdue maintenance, and inadequate funding. Now, \nthe estimated costs to rehabilitate the system far exceed the ability \nof water users to pay for improvements while managing profitable \noperations.\n  The Pine River Indian Irrigation Project Act of 2009 would fix \ndecades of neglect and inadequate funding for the Pine River Indian \nIrrigation Project. This legislation would direct the Secretary of the \nInterior, acting through the Commissioner of Reclamation, to fully \nassess the needs of the Pine River Indian Irrigation Project. It would \nalso grant the authority to the Secretary of the Interior to provide \ngrants to, and enter into cooperative agreements with the Southern Ute \nIndian Tribe of Colorado to assess and repair infrastructure so that it \nmore suitably meets user needs. The funding that would be provided in \nthis bill is an essential step toward assuring that both Indians and \nnon-Indians have access to the water they need, when they need it. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto move this bill toward passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1264\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pine River Indian Irrigation \n     Project Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) drought, population increases, and environmental needs \n     are exacerbating water supply issues across the western \n     United States, including on the Southern Ute Indian \n     Reservation in southwestern Colorado;\n       (2)(A) a report of the Government Accountability Office \n     dated 2006 identified significant issues with the Pine River \n     Indian Irrigation Project, including the issue that, at the \n     time of the study, the Bureau of Indian Affairs estimated \n     that total deferred maintenance costs for the Project \n     exceeded $20,000,000; and\n       (B) other estimates have placed those costs at more than \n     $60,000,000;\n       (3) the report of the Government Accountability Office \n     demonstrates that key facilities of the Project are severely \n     deteriorated;\n       (4) operations and maintenance fees are not sufficient to \n     address the condition of the Project, even though the Bureau \n     of Indian Affairs has sought to double those fees, from $8.50 \n     to $17, in recent years;\n       (5) the report of the Government Accountability Office also \n     notes that a prior study done by the Bureau of Reclamation \n     determined that water users could not afford to pay \n     operations and maintenance fees of $8.50 and operate a \n     profitable farming operation;\n       (6) the benefits of rehabilitating and repairing the \n     irrigation infrastructure of the Project include--\n       (A) water conservation;\n       (B) extending available water supply;\n       (C) increased agricultural production;\n       (D) economic benefits;\n       (E) safer facilities; and\n       (F) the preservation of the culture of the Southern Ute \n     Indian Tribe;\n       (7) while, as of the date of enactment of this Act, the \n     Project is managed by the Bureau of Indian Affairs, the \n     Southern Ute Indian Tribe also receives water from facilities \n     owned or operated by the Bureau of Reclamation; and\n       (8) rehabilitation and repair of the infrastructure of the \n     Project by the Bureau of Reclamation would improve--\n       (A) overall water management; and\n       (B) the ability of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe and the \n     Bureau of Reclamation to address potential water conflicts.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to require the \n     Secretary of the Interior--\n       (1) to assess the condition of infrastructure of the Pine \n     River Indian Irrigation Project;\n       (2) to establish priorities for the rehabilitation of \n     irrigation infrastructure within the Project according to \n     specified criteria; and\n       (3) to implement rehabilitation activities for the \n     irrigation infrastructure of the Project.\n\n     SEC. 3.
