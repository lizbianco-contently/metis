Mr. President, first, I welcome everyone back. I hope \nthey had a good break.\n  As a nation, our focus continues to be on the disaster in the gulf. \nThis is a national tragedy, the full dimensions of which we still do \nnot know. But one thing is clear: The top priority at this point, as it \nshould have been from the start, is to stop the leak. Americans are far \nless interested in how tough the administration plans to be after the \nleak is fixed than they are in fixing it. People want action more than \nthey want accusations. There will be plenty of time to assess blame and \nto tighten regulations after the crisis is met. But weeks of blame has \ndone absolutely nothing to plug the leak. Let's focus on the crisis at \nhand.\n  As we work to stem the crisis in the gulf, Congress cannot continue \nto ignore another pressing crisis--an exploding Federal debt that \nthreatens our very way of life.\n  This week, the Senate will debate the deficit extenders bill the \nHouse passed just before the recess. Just for a little context, let's \nremind ourselves what this bill is. The original purpose of this bill \nwas to give America's job creators an assurance that the longstanding \ntax benefits they are counting on to retain workers will not be pulled \nout from under them. But because Democrats cannot seem to resist any \nopportunity to use a must-pass bill such as this as a vehicle for more \ndeficit spending, they have piled tens of billions of dollars in \nunrelated spending and debt on top of it, all at a moment when the \nnational debt has now reached $13 trillion for the first time in \nhistory. This is fiscal recklessness, plain and simple.\n  The time has come for hard choices. Americans see what is happening \nin Europe, and they are begging us to bring the debt under control, to \ncut it down before we face a similar fate here. Instead, Democrats in \nWashington just\n\n[[Page S4588]]\n\nkeep piling on as if they are oblivious to the consequences.\n  Some Democrats in the House started to rebel last week, and some \nDemocrats in the Senate have indicated they will ask for amendments on \nthis bill as well. They are demanding that party leaders make an effort \nto at least acknowledge that this debt crisis exists. But Americans \nwant more than lipservice.\n  Here is what the protests of squeamish Democrats in the House \nachieved: A bill that was supposed to increase the debt by $175 billion \nwill now only increase the debt by $54 billion. In other words, instead \nof agreeing that the debt is out of control, Democrats played \npolitics--they spent as much money as they could on this bill without \nlosing the votes needed to pass it.\n  Even in the face of public outrage, Democrats are showing that either \nthey just do not get it on this issue of debt or they just simply do \nnot care. But it is even worse than that because not only are Democrats \nclearly unserious about this issue, they are not giving the American \npeople the whole picture. They did not lower the price tag on this bill \nby making tough choices; they just shortened the timetable on the \nprograms it funds by openly promising to add that spending back later. \nThey do not plan to spend any less; they just plan to spend it all by \nputting it in separate bills, which is a little bit like arguing that \nyou have less debt because you put it on different credit cards.\n  Clearly, Democrats do not see a $13 trillion national debt for the \nemergency it is. So let's remind ourselves where we stand so there is \nno confusion about the gravity of the situation. As I stand here this \nafternoon, every man, woman, and child in America would have to cough \nup more than $42,000 to pay down our debt. That is $42,000 for every \nman, woman, and child in the United States. And that is just the \ncurrent debt. Remember, it took two centuries--two centuries--to \naccumulate a $10 trillion debt. In the first 500 days of this \nadministration, Democrats added $2.4 trillion to the debt and plan to \nadd another $1 trillion this year. Americans are as worried as I have \never seen them about the course we are on, and they have a simple \nmessage for Congress: Stop spending money we do not have.\n  One more thing. If all the domestic crises of the past few years have \ntaught us anything, it is that more government is not a solution in \nitself. Yet this administration has approached virtually every crisis \nit has faced with more government as the primary solution.\n  Right now, among other challenges, we have a debt crisis, a jobs \ncrisis, a housing crisis, a financial crisis, and an oilspill to which \nthe American people clearly do not believe government is effectively \nresponding. One can understand the American people's skepticism when \nthey are told that simply adding more government is the solution to \ngovernment's previous failures. They are being told that adding more \ngovernment is the solution to government's previous failures.\n  Now is not the time to propose more government as a solution to these \ncrises. It is time to rethink the model to start focusing on \naccountability and on results. And a good place to start is the debt. \nAmericans expect action on this issue, and they expect it right now. \nUnfortunately, Democrats in Congress do not seem to be listening on \nthis issue any more than they did on health care or the stimulus or \nfinancial regulatory reform or, for that matter, anything else.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4588-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I welcome back my colleagues from their \ntravels back home. It is always good to see them and my staff. I am \ngrateful for all who are here working hard. I know we all benefit from \nseeing and speaking with our neighbors and constituents, honoring our \nNation's bravest on Memorial Day, and talking about the good work we \nhave done this year.\n  We have really done a lot. Long overdue health care reform is now the \nlaw of the land. To show how much we have done, Norm Ornstein, one of \nthe most celebrated pundits, columnists, journalists in all of \nWashington, reported a few weeks ago that this is the most productive \nCongress in the history of the country. That comes from someone who is \nnot from the left or the right but someone who is a mainstream \njournalist in America today. The House and Senate have each passed \nbills to clean up Wall Street. Three million Americans who are going to \nwork today have the Recovery Act to thank for their jobs. In Nevada, \nthe Recovery Act created or saved more than 4,000 jobs in just the past \n4 months alone. Again, that is in Nevada.\n  But every time I go home, I am reminded how much more we have to do \nand become reenergized to do it. The work period between now and July 4 \nis short, but our to-do list is very long. We have to pass an emergency \nextension of unemployment benefits and other matters related to job \ncreation, which will be in the bill that will be put on the Senate \nfloor this afternoon. These benefits have now expired and so should our \npatience for excuses. These people lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own. They are struggling to put food on the table and to take \ntheir kids to the doctor. It is important that we recognize that. It is \nan emergency for these families and for our entire country.\n\n  Many who oppose this extension gave tax breaks to rich CEOs who \nshipped American jobs overseas. Now their constituents are looking for \na lifeline in a job market they helped sink. I hope both sides can come \ntogether to give them the help both they and our economy need.\n  This legislation cuts taxes for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses. This bill includes a host of tax credits, tax extenders, \nand tax incentives, all of which will help put people back to work--\nsomething Democrats and Republicans should come together to finish \nbecause it is something we can all support and be proud we did. More \nthan that, it is something each of our States desperately needs.\n  To this legislation we intend to add a bill for FMAP funding, that \nis, Medicaid money to ensure the poorest in our communities can afford \nto stay healthy, which will protect jobs in States such as Nevada and \nprevent deep cuts to critical services all over the country.\n  Mr. President, just a few comments about the remarks of my friend, \nthe Republican leader. We all know the debt of our country is \nsignificant and of concern to us. But I am stunned by my friend's short \nmemory of history. One reason we have this red ink that is flowing so \nstrongly is we had two wars that weren't paid for. The Iraq war alone \ncost $1 trillion. Many say it was a war of choice, not of necessity.\n  The financial meltdown came about as a result of decisions \nRepublicans made. For example, in the last 3 years\n\n[[Page S4589]]\n\nof the Clinton administration, we were paying down the national debt. \nWe were spending less money than we were taking in. Some said we were \npaying down the debt too fast. It was a shock to the markets. We had, \nin effect, during the Clinton years, something called pay-go, meaning \nif you had a new program you had to pay for it or raise the revenue to \npay for it. It worked extremely well. That is why we were paying down \nthe debt. When President Bush came in, that was eliminated. Pay-go \nrules went out the window. We have replaced them, in spite of \nRepublicans voting against that.\n  Mr. President, to show the short memory of my friend, the Republican \nleader, there was legislation worked on here for a long time--well more \nthan a year--by Kent Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, and \nthe ranking member, Judd Gregg. They put together a piece of \nlegislation that had wide support here in the Senate to create a debt \ncommission, similar to what we did with our base closing activities. So \nI brought this up for a vote. Democrats overwhelmingly voted for it. My \nRepublican colleagues--seven of them who sponsored that legislation--\nwouldn't vote for it.\n  We couldn't get the base closing legislation done because every time \nwe wanted to close a base, there would be a Senator from that State who \nwould say: No, we can't do that, and so it was difficult. So we brought \nthat base closing legislation to the floor, and there was an up-or-down \nvote on it, no amendments. That is the same legislation Senator Conrad \nand Senator Gregg brought before the Senate. Because of the \nRepublicans, it was voted down.\n  To his credit, President Obama, still concerned about the debt, \ncreated a commission that must report by the end of this year. We know \nthe debt is an issue. But for my friends to start now criticizing what \nhas always been emergency spending to pay for people who are long-term \nunemployed I think shows memories are a little short. We should realize \nDemocrats have not created the problems. President Obama, when he was \nelected, found himself in a real hole created by the prior \nadministration, and we are working our way out of that.\n  After we finish the bill that will be on the floor this afternoon, we \nhave to pass a bill designed specifically for small businesses--to help \nthem grow and to help them hire more workers. This bill will include \nmore tax incentives and also establishes a new lending facility for \nsmall businesses.\n  This week, we will debate a resolution of disapproval that will \nprevent the Department of Transportation and the Environmental \nProtection Agency from working together to slow the pollution from \nheavy-duty vehicles. The result of this resolution, if passed, would be \nto waste at least 450 million more barrels of oil than we need to. That \nis wrong.\n  We also would like to finish two important conference reports. One, \nwe have the supplemental war appropriations bill that will give our \ncommanders and troops the equipment and resources they need to succeed \nand fund disaster assistance in the parts of the world that need it the \nmost. Our military is about to undertake the most important mission of \nthe war in Afghanistan, the largest operation since the war started. We \nhave given them this mission, and now we have to give them what they \nneed to accomplish the mission. Two, we have to finish the Wall Street \nreform bill. This is legislation that protects families' life savings \nand seniors' pensions. The bills both the House and Senate passed will \nenforce the toughest protections ever against Wall Street greed and \nwill guarantee taxpayers they will never again be asked to bail out a \nbig bank and will make sure no bank will become too big to fail. We \nhope to send our bill to the President this month, after the conference \nis completed.\n  There are other items on our agenda as well. We must protect voters \nand ensure our elections are being decided by the people, not by the \nrichest corporations with the most money to spend. We want to empower \npublic safety employees, such as firefighters, police officers, and \nparamedics, with a voice in decisions that affect their lives and their \nlivelihoods. We want to ensure they have the same rights in the \nworkplace as everyone else. We have a food safety and child nutrition \nbill to consider. We have a Defense authorization bill to pass. The \nJudiciary Committee will start its hearings this month on President \nObama's tremendous nominee for the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan.\n  Although we may not get to it in this short work period, the Senate \nmust take definitive action to hold companies such as BP more \naccountable for disasters such as the one that is poisoning our waters \nand shores more and more every day.\n  About that oilspill. Oil has gushed into the gulf for more than a \nmonth and a half now, but we have finally started to see a trickle of \ngood news. BP managed to control some of the spill this weekend, and it \nis estimated that from 50 to 80 percent of the oil that is bubbling out \nof the middle of the Earth is being captured. That still leaves a leak \nof too many barrels every day. That is an enormous and unacceptable \namount of pollution harming our water, wildlife, beaches, and \nbusinesses. As much as 35 million gallons has already leaked, and that \noil is now making its way to the south of Florida, up the eastern \nseaboard. It is estimated that the Exxon Valdez, which was an awful \nmess, was only one-third as big as the BP spill currently is.\n  Beyond the immediate damage and our anger at those whose \nirresponsibility allowed it to happen in the first place, this bill \nunderscores our need for a new energy policy. We need a policy that \nfully recognizes the obvious costs of the way we produce and consume \nenergy today. We need to confront and limit the risks of future \ncatastrophes. We cannot wait to act until after more tragedies and \ndisasters happen.\n  A new energy policy must strongly encourage companies to invest \nrapidly in technology that makes us safer, more competitive, and more \nenergy independent. That means immediately refocusing our efforts on \nclean and renewable energy, such as the Sun, the wind, and geothermal \nenergy, and improving energy efficiency and using more biofuels. We \nneed better options than oil, and we need it done yesterday.\n  Finally, I wish to say a word about the biggest story in sports over \nthis past week; that is, the near-perfect game thrown by Detroit Tigers \npitcher Armando Galarraga. It would have been just the 21st time in 150 \nyears--although, remarkably, already the third time in this young \nseason--that a pitcher had retired every opposing batter over nine \ninnings--no hits, no walks, no errors. The perfect game is one of the \nmost special, most difficult, most coveted accomplishments in sports. \nIt is exceedingly rare, which, by the way, makes it all the more \nincredible that one of our own colleagues, the junior Senator from \nKentucky, Jim Bunning, himself once a Detroit Tiger like Galarraga, \nachieved the feat for the Philadelphia Phillies on Father's Day in \n1964.\n  A perfect game means 27 men up, 27 men down. Galarraga had taken care \nof 26. We all know what happened to the 27th. The play was made, the \nrunner was out, the game should have been over. Galarraga's name should \nhave been added to an elite list that includes giants of the game such \nas Cy Young, Sandy Koufax, and Randy Johnson. But it didn't end that \nway. The first base umpire, Jim Joyce, badly blew the call. In an \ninstant, a superhuman success story was spoiled by an all-too-human \nerror.\n  Yet what makes this story so significant is not what happened in the \nsplit second between the pitcher getting the out and the umpire yelling \n``safe.'' It is what happened right after that. First of all, the \numpire, Jim Joyce, admitted he was wrong. He apologized to the pitcher, \nthe players, and the fans he let down. He didn't make any excuses. This \numpire didn't hire a PR firm or run television ads defending the \nindefensible or try to spin his mistake; he just owned up to it.\n  Armando Galarraga graciously accepted the apology and moved on. He \ndidn't raise his voice or point his finger. When every sports fan in \nAmerica pitied the pitcher, the pitcher pitied the umpire. The 28-year-\nold player summoned the strength to throw the game of his life but then \nsomehow summoned the grace not to throw the tantrum some say he was \nentitled to. It\n\n[[Page S4590]]\n\nwas an incredible act of class and compassion, an incredible display of \nperspective and sympathy. It was, appropriately enough, perfect.\n  In recent days, we have seen insurance companies try to avoid \nresponsibility for denying health care to the sick. We have seen Wall \nStreet executives try to avoid responsibility for millions of layoffs \nand millions more foreclosed homes. We have seen oil companies try to \navoid responsibility for environmental disasters of historic \nproportions. We have seen too many fail to own up to their own mistakes \nor take responsibility for their own actions. But more than that, we \nhave seen too many actively turn away when others have tried to hold \nthem to account. In that context, what Jim Joyce did was as exceptional \nas the perfect game itself.\n  One call may be just one of hundreds that an umpiring crew makes each \nday. A single game may be just one of 162 each team will play each \nyear. And even though baseball is the national pastime, it is merely \nthat--a diversion.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe way in which the Senate discharges its constitutionally assigned \nresponsibility to consent to the appointment of Justices to the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  With almost 30 years of experience, my thinking on this subject has \nevolved and changed. At the outset, I thought the President was \nentitled to considerable deference, providing the nominee was \nacademically and professionally well qualified, under the principle \nthat elections have consequences. With the composition of the Supreme \nCourt a Presidential campaign issue, it has become acceptable for the \nPresident to make ideological selections. As the Supreme Court has \nbecome more and more of an ideological battleground, I have concluded \nthat Senators, under the doctrine of separation of power, have equal \nstanding to consider ideology.\n  For the most part, notwithstanding considerable efforts by Senators, \nthe confirmation process has been sterile. Except for Judge Bork, whose \nextensive paper trail gave him little choice, nominees have danced a \ncarefully orchestrated minuet, saying virtually nothing about ideology.\n  As I have noted in the past, nominees say only as much as they think \nthey have to in order to be confirmed. When some nominees have given \nassurances about a generalized methodology, illustrated by Chief \nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito, their decisions have been markedly \ndifferent. In commenting on those Justices, or citing critical \nprofessorial evaluations of their deviations, I do not do so to \nchallenge their good faith. There is an obvious difference between \ntestimony before the Judiciary Committee and deciding a case in \ncontroversy. But it is instructive to analyze nominees' answers for \nSenators to try to figure out how to get enough information on judicial \nideology to cast an intelligent vote.\n  In seeking to determine where a nominee will go once confirmed, a \ngreat deal of emphasis is placed on the nominee's willingness to commit \nto, and in fact follow, stare decisis. If the nominee maintains that \ncommitment, then there are established precedents to know where the \nnominee will go. But, as has frequently been the case, the assurances \non following stare decisis have not been followed. I use the \nillustrations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito as two recent \nconfirmation processes--in 2005 and 2006--as illustrative.\n  Chief Justice Roberts testified extensively about his purported \nfidelity to stare decisis. For example, during his confirmation \nhearing, he said:\n\n       I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you \n     overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in \n     promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough--and \n     the Court has emphasized this on several occasions. It is not \n     enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongfully \n     decided. . . . I think one way to look at it is that the \n     Casey decision itself, which applied the principle of stare \n     decisis to Roe v. Wade, is itself a precedent of the Court, \n     entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Well, I think people's personal views on this issue derive \n     from a number of sources, and there's nothing in my personal \n     views based on faith or other sources that would prevent me \n     from applying the precedents of the Court faithfully under \n     principles of stare decisis.\n\n  Less than a year later, Justice Alito was no less emphatic. He \ntestified:\n\n       I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important \n     doctrine. It's a fundamental part of our legal system, and \n     it's the principle that courts in general should follow their \n     past precedents. . . . It's important because it protects \n     reliance interests and it's important because it reflects the \n     view that courts should respect the judgment and the wisdom \n     that are embodied in prior judicial decisions.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       There needs to be a special justification for overruling a \n     prior precedent.\n\n  Of consequence, along with adhering to the principle of stare \ndecisis, is the Justices' willingness to accept the findings of fact \nmade by Congress through the extensive hearing processes in evaluating \nthe sufficiency of a record to uphold the constitutionality of \nlegislative enactments. Here again, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \nAlito gave emphatic assurances that they would give deference to \ncongressional findings of fact.\n  Chief Justice Roberts testified as follows:\n\n       The Court can't sit and hear witness after witness after \n     witness in a particular area and develop a kind of a record. \n     Courts can't make the policy judgments about what kind of \n     legislation is necessary in light of the findings that are \n     made. . . . We simply don't have the institutional expertise \n     or the resources or the authority to engage in that type of a \n     process. . . . The courts don't have it. Congress does. It's \n     constitutional authority. It's not our job. It is your job. \n     So the deference to Congressional findings in this area has a \n     solid basis.\n\n  Chief Justice Roberts went on to say:\n\n       [A]s a judge, you may be beginning to transgress into the \n     area of making a law . . . when you are in a position of \n     reevaluating legislative findings, because that doesn't look \n     like a judicial function.\n\n  But what happened in practice was very different, illustrated by the \ndecision where the Chief Justice, in discussing McConnell v. Federal \nElection Commission, did not say whether McConnell was correctly \ndecided. But the Chief Justice did acknowledge, as the Court emphasized \nin its decision, that the act was a product of an ``extraordinarily \nextensive [legislative] record. . . . My reading of the Court's \nopinion,'' said Chief Justice Roberts in his testimony, ``is that that \nwas a case where the Court's decision was driven in large part by the \nrecord that had been compiled by Congress. . . . [T]he determination \nthere was based . . . that the extensive record carried a lot of weight \nwith the Justices.''\n  When the issue of campaign finance reform came up later before the \nCourt,\n\n[[Page S4591]]\n\nChief Justice Roberts took a very different view of the weight to be \ngiven to congressional findings of fact. On the issue of the deference \nto be given to congressional findings of fact, Justice Alito's \ntestimony was equally emphatic. He testified as follows:\n\n       [The] judiciary is not equipped at all to make findings \n     about what is going on in the real world, not this sort of \n     legislative findings. And Congress, of course, is in the best \n     position to do that. . . . Congress can have hearings and \n     examine complex social issues, receive statistical data, hear \n     testimony from experts, analyze that and synthesize that and \n     reduce that to findings. . . . I have the greatest respect \n     for [Congressional] findings. This is an area where Congress \n     has the expertise and where the Congress has the opportunity \n     to assemble facts and assess the facts. We on the appellate \n     judiciary don't have that opportunity.\n\n  In practice, there was very material deviation by both Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justice Alito, when it came to evaluating legislation with \nthe point being what deference would be given to congressional \nfactfinding. The commentators have been very critical of both of the \nJustices. For example, Prof. Geoffrey Stone, the Edward H. Levi \nDistinguished Service Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law \nSchool, had this to say, referring to the testimony just referred to, \ngiven by Chief Justice Roberts in his confirmation hearing. Professor \nStone wrote that their records on the Court `` . . . speak much louder \nthan their words to Congress.'' Their ``abandon[ment] of stare \ndecisis'' in ``case after case'' has required Chief Justice Roberts to \n``eat'' his words.\n  Professor Stone has written that the two Justices have:\n\n       . . . abandoned the principle of stare decisis in a \n     particularly insidious manner, and their approach to \n     precedent has been ``dishonest.''\n\n  A similar judgment was rendered by Prof. Ronald Dworkin of the New \nYork University School of Law. Professor Dworkin said Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justice Alito, ``who . . . promised fidelity to the law'' \nduring their confirmation hearings, have ``brazenly ignore[d] past \ndecisions.''\n  None of the decisions of the Roberts Court speaks more directly to \nthese issues than the case of Citizens United v. the Federal Election \nCommission. In that case, the Supreme Court overruled two decisions--\nMcConnell v. Federal Election Commission, decided in 2003, where \nJustices had, just 7 years earlier, upheld section 203 against a facial \nchallenge to constitutionality; and Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \nCommerce, a 1990 decision where the Supreme Court upheld the \nconstitutionality of even a broader State statute regulating corporate \ncampaign-related expenditures. Overruling Austin was especially \nsignificant because Congress had specifically relied on that decision \nin drafting the McCain-Feingold Act.\n  Justice Stevens said about that decision, in dissent, that ``pulling \nout the rug beneath Congress,'' in this manner, ``shows great \ndisrespect for a coequal branch.''\n  Justice Stevens emphasized the deviation from the kinds of \ncommitments which had been made to deference to congressional findings, \nnoting that in that decision the Court, with the backing of Chief \nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito, can't decide the ``virtual mountain \nof evidence'' establishing the corrupting influence of corporate money \non which Congress relied in drafting section 203.\n  So there you have a much heralded recent decision in Citizens United, \nwhich has put the campaign finance area upside down; really on its \nhead. In the context of the extensive congressional hearings, the \nfinding of the corrupting influence of money and politics, the forceful \nassurance given by those two Justices to have it so cavalierly set \naside, is a factor which has to be taken into account in how we \nevaluate the testimony of the nominees.\n  Where, then, are Senators to look to try to make an evaluation of \nwhat is the judicial ideology of the nominee? I suggest there may be a \nway, looking into the earlier writings of the nominee, paying \nrelatively little if any attention to the testimony on confirmation, to \nfind out what the nominees believe, where they stand on the ideological \nspectrum.\n  Some indicators as to where Chief Justice Roberts stood can be \ngleaned from views he expressed on the remediation of racial \ndiscrimination while serving in a political capacity as a member of the \nReagan administration, much earlier in his career. His views attracted \na great deal of attention when he commented on the 1982 reauthorization \nof the Voting Rights Act. He then wrote more than two dozen documents \nurging the administration to reject a provision of the then-pending \nHouse bill that would have allowed plaintiffs to establish a violation \nof the act, not only by establishing that a voting practice was \nimpermissibly motivated, but also by establishing that it had a \ndiscriminatory effect.\n  He claimed the so-called ``effects test'' would establish a quota \nsystem in elections and, more disturbingly still in light of the \nextensive record of voting rights amassed by congressional committees, \nhe said that ``there was no evidence of voting abuses nationwide.'' \nHardly consistent with the factual record which had been amassed giving \nsome indication as to this predilections at that time.\n  He then made the comment in a memorandum on the same subject: \n``Something must be done to educate the Senators on the seriousness of \nthis problem.'' Another example in the race discrimination context was \na 1981 memorandum that Roberts wrote to the Attorney General \nquestioning the legality of regulations promulgated by the Department \nof Labor to enforce Executive Order 11246.\n  Issued in 1965, that order requires private-sector employers to \ncontract with the Federal Government to evaluate whether qualified \nminorities and women are underutilized in their workforce; that if so, \nto adopt roles to increase their representation by encouraging women \nand minorities to apply for positions. It does not require or authorize \nemployers to give any racial or sex-based preference. In fact, its \nimplementing regulations expressly prohibit such preferences.\n  Roberts then attacked the regulations on the ground that they \nconflicted with the color blindness principle of Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 and used ``quota-like concepts.'' In that context \nonly the most extreme conservatives have questioned the legality of \nthat Executive order.\n  Roberts, as a younger man, working in the Federal Government, wrote \ndespairingly about ``so-called fundamental rights,'' including the \nright to privacy.\n  Similar traces may be found in examining Justice Alito's earlier \nwritings. Among them was his characterization of Judge Bork as ``one of \nthe most outstanding nominees of this century.''\n  Justice Alito shared Bork's antipathy, in particular, to the abortion \nright first recognized in Roe v. Wade. While Justice Alito was serving \nas assistant to Solicitor General Charles Fried in 1985, he took it \nupon himself to outline, in the words of Prof. Lawrence Tribe, ``a \nstep-by-step process toward the ultimate goal of overruling Roe.''\n  That year, when applying for a position as Assistant Attorney General \nin the Office of Legal Counsel, Judge Alito unequivocally stated in his \ncover letter that the Constitution does not provide for a right to \nterminate a pregnancy.\n  Justice Alito's extrajudicial writings also evidence an expansive \nview of executive power. Among them, in 1989, was a speech defending \nJustice Scalia's lone dissent in Morrison v. Olson. There the Court \nupheld the constitutionality of the independent counsel law passed by \nCongress in the wake of Watergate.\n  Justice Scalia was the lone dissenter. He also expressed his \nagreement with the ``unitary'' executive theory around which Justice \nScalia had framed that dissent. Justice Alito's conservative views were \nagain evidenced in his support of the expansion of executive power at \nthe expense of Congress reflected in the memorandum he wrote supporting \nthe use of Presidential signing statements to advance a President's \ninterpretation of a Federal statute. So that in seeking to make a \ndetermination of ideology, we have seen from the analysis, the \nextensive testimony of both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito on \ntwo core issues--stare decisis and the deference to be afforded to \ncongressional factfinding--a disregard of the platitudes of the \ngeneralizations of the methodology so emphatically testified to before \nthe Judiciary Committee, and requiring a\n\n[[Page S4592]]\n\nsearch into their views as expressed in other contexts where there is \nnot the motivation for Senate confirmation.\n  The kinds of answers given by other nominees require similar \nscrutiny. The Judiciary Committee, for example, should no longer \ntolerate the sort of answer which Justice Scalia gave during his \nconfirmation hearing when I asked him whether Marbury v. Madison was \nsettled precedent. One would think that that would be about the easiest \nkind of questions to answer.\n  In 1986, in the so-called courtesy hearing, I asked Justice Scalia, \nthen Judge Scalia, about a bedrock case like Marbury v. Madison. As \nevidenced during the hearing, he refused to answer with a yes or no on \nthe question. He acknowledged only that Marbury was a ``pillar of our \nsystem'' and then said:\n\n       Whether I would be likely to kick away Marbury v. Madison, \n     given not only what I just said, but also what I have said \n     concerning my respect for the principle of stare decisis, I \n     think you will have to judge on the basis of my record as a \n     judge in the Court of Appeals, in your judgment as to whether \n     I am, I suppose on that issue, sufficiently intemperate or \n     extreme.\n\n  In effect, he was saying that a nominee who kicks the legs out from \nunder Marbury v. Madison should be considered ``intemperate or \nextreme,'' and hence presumably denied appointment to the Court. Yet he \nwould not forthrightly rule out a possible overturning of Marbury v. \nMadison. And so went the balance of the testimony Justice Scalia gave \nin his confirmation hearing. It is my suggestion that that kind of \nresponse ought no longer to be tolerated. There is an abbreviation for \nJustice Scalia's testimony of the famous limitation of comment by \nsomeone arrested in a time of war to give only name, rank, and serial \nnumber. I think, by any fair standard, Justice Scalia would only give \nhis name and rank, and we ought to be looking for something \nsubstantially more.\n  Nor can the committee, in my judgment, any longer accept a statement \ngiven by Justice Clarence Thomas in 1991 that he did not have an \nopinion as to whether Roe was properly decided, and, more remarkably \nstill, could not recall ever having had a conversation about it.\n  In searching for some of the bedrock principles which I would suggest \nthe Senators ought to look for in the confirmation process, I would \nenumerate five. First, I believe a nominee should accept that the 14th \nand 15th amendments confer substantial power on Congress to enforce \ntheir substantive provisions.\n  In the past 13 years since the case in the City of Boerne v. Flores, \nthe Court has adopted a concept of proportionality and congruence, a \nstandard which is impossible to understand, certainly impossible for \nCongress to know on our legislative findings and our legislative \nenactments as to what will satisfy the Supreme Court of the United \nStates on what they may, at some later day, consider to be \n``proportional and congruent.''\n  I suggest that Justice Breyer has the correct standard when he said \nthe courts should ask no more than whether ``Congress could reasonably \nhave concluded that a remedy is needed and that the remedy chosen \nconstitutes an appropriate way to enforce the amendments.''\n  A second guiding principle I would suggest is, a nominee should \naccept that the Constitution, and in particular the due process clause \nof the 14th amendment, protects facets of individual liberty not yet \nrecognized by the Court. The Court has repeatedly held, through the due \nprocess clause of the 14th amendment, the Constitution protects facets \nof liberty, a realm of personal liberty which the government may not \nenter, and in accordance with the shifting values of our society has \nexpanded the reach of the due process clause.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4592, June 7, 2010, the Record reads: . . . a nominee \nmust . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . a nominee \nshould . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  A third principle which I suggest the Senate should adopt is a \nnominee should accept that liberty protected by the Constitution's due \nprocess clause includes the right to terminate a pregnancy before the \npoint of viability. I recognize that abortion remains a divisive moral \nand social issue. But the constitutional status of abortion rights has \nbeen settled. The Court has declined the opportunity to overrule Roe v. \nWade in nearly 40 cases. In Casey v. Planned Parenthood, three \nRepublican nominees to the Court joined two other Justices in affirming \nRoe's central holding.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4592, June 7, 2010, the Record reads: . . . a nominee \nmust . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . a nominee \nshould . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Even conservative Federal Judge Michael Luttig has characterized \nCasey as ``super stare decisis.''

At the outset, I thought the \n     President was entitled to considerable deference providing \n     the nominee was academically and professionally well \n     qualified. Under the principle that elections have \n     consequences with the composition of the Supreme Court a \n     presidential campaign issue, it has been accepted for the \n     President to make ideological selections. As the Supreme \n     Court has become more and more of an ideological \n     battleground, I have concluded that Senators, under the \n     doctrine of separation of power, have equal standing to \n     consider ideology.\n       For the most part, notwithstanding considerable effort by \n     Senators, the confirmation process has been sterile. Except \n     for Judge Bork, whose extensive paper trail gave him little \n     choice, nominees have danced a carefully orchestrated minuet, \n     saying virtually nothing about ideology. Nominees say only as \n     much as they think they have to in order to be confirmed. \n     When some nominees have given assurances about a generalized \n     methodology, illustrated by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \n     Alito, their decisions have been markedly different.\n       In commenting on those Justices or citing critical \n     professorial evaluations of their deviations, I do not do so \n     to challenge their good faith. There is an obvious difference \n     between testimony before the Judiciary Committee and deciding \n     a case in controversy. But it is instructive to analyze \n     nominees answers for Senators to try to figure out how to get \n     enough information on judicial ideology to cast an \n     intelligent vote.\n       I. As a member of the Committee on the Judiciary since \n     entering the Senate, I have participated in the confirmation \n     hearings of eleven nominees to the Court (Sandra Day \n     O'Connor, Antonin Scalia, Robert Bork, Anthony Kennedy, David \n     Souter, Clarence Thomas Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, \n     John Roberts, Samuel Alito, and Sonya Sotomayor) and the \n     nomination of then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist to \n     serve as Chief Justice. I chaired the confirmation hearings \n     on two of these nominees, John Roberts and Samuel Alito.\n       I voted to confirm all but one of the nominees, Judge \n     Robert Bork. His own testimony placed him well outside the \n     judicial mainstream. Judge Bork made clear his view, for \n     instance, that the Fourteenth Amendment's due process clause \n     imposes no substantive limits on governmental actions that \n     infringe upon fundamental rights to conduct one's intimate \n     relations in private, to control one's reproduction, to \n     choose one's spouse, and so forth. Not even Justice Scalia, \n     who reads the due process clauses narrowly, has taken that \n     position. Nor have the Court's newest conservative members, \n     Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito.\n       Still more troubling were Judge Bork's extreme views on the \n     constitutionality of racial discrimination. He went so far as \n     to say that the Court wrongly decided Bolling v. Sharpe \n     (1954), which held unconstitutional racial segregation in \n     Washington, DC's public education system; and Shelly v. \n     Kraemer (1948), which held unenforceable race-based \n     restrictive covenants in residential housing. Both were \n     unanimous decisions joined by conservative justices.\n       It was not his mere criticism of these and many other \n     important decisions alone that led me to vote against Judge \n     Bork. It was\n\n[[Page S4593]]\n\n     the very real possibility that he would vote to overturn or \n     resist the application of bedrock precedents of the Court. \n     (Arlen Specter, Why I Voted Against Bork, New York Times, \n     Oct. 9, 1987.) So objectionable was Judge Bork's judicial \n     ideology that it drew rebukes even from some prominent \n     Republicans. Among them was William Coleman, Jr., one of \n     America's leading lawyers of the twentieth century, and along \n     with Justice Scalia, a member of the Ford Administration.\n       My vote on Judge Bork proved the right decision. Judge \n     Bork's post-hearing writings beginning with the The Tempting \n     of America: The Political Seduction of the Law in 1988 left \n     no doubt that his testimony was but a preview of the \n     extremism he would have brought to the Court.\n       II. I have never demanded that a nominee satisfy an \n     ideological litmus test whether liberal or conservative much \n     less demanded that a nominee commit to reaching a particular \n     certain outcome in any given case. What I have demanded is \n     that a nominee, first, affirm his or her commitment to the \n     doctrine of stare decisis (the policy of following precedent \n     rather than interpreting constitutional and statutory \n     provisions anew in each case, unless compelling reasons \n     demand otherwise); and, second, pledge to honor the \n     legislative powers the Constitution assigns to the Congress, \n     especially its remedial powers to enforce the Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments.\n       Nominees committed to stare decisis and respectful of \n     Congress' lawmaking powers are much less likely to indulge \n     their ideological preferences whether left or right in \n     interpreting the open-ended provisions of the Constitution \n     and federal statutes to which very different meanings could \n     be ascribed. They are, in short, less likely to become \n     activists. Noted Court commentator Jeffrey Rosen made just \n     that point soon before the Roberts confirmation hearing. He \n     said that the best way to find out whether Chief Justice \n     Roberts was a conservative activist (in the mold of Justices \n     Scalia and Thomas) or a moderate, cautious, and restrained \n     conservative (in the mold of Justice O'Connor) would be to \n     explore Judge Roberts's view of precedents, which the lawyers \n     call stare decisis, or let the decision stand. (In Search of \n     John Roberts, The New York Times, July 21, 2005.)\n       That is why when I questioned Roberts and Alito in 2005 and \n     2006, respectively, I focused heavily on the issue of stare \n     decisis. Several other Senators did as well. Both Chief \n     Justice Roberts and Justice Alito provided extensive \n     testimony on the subject. Their testimony warrants extensive \n     quotation.\n       Chief Justice Roberts testified:\n       Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules, they \n     apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is critical. \n     They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it is a \n     limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the \n     umpire. Judges have to have the humility to recognize that \n     they operate within a system of precedent shaped by other \n     judges equally striving to live up to the judicial oath. . . \n     .\n       [T] importance of settled expectations in the application \n     of stare decisis is a very important consideration.\n       I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you \n     overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in \n     promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough and \n     the Court has emphasized this on several occasions. It is not \n     enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongly \n     decided.\n       Well, I think people's personal views on this issue derive \n     from a number of sources, and there's nothing in my personal \n     views based on faith or other sources that would prevent me \n     from applying the precedents of the Court faithfully under \n     principles of stare decisis.\n       I think one way to look at it is that the Casey decision \n     [Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania \n     (1992)] itself, which applied the principles of stare \n     decisis to Roe v. Wade [1973], is itself a precedent of \n     the Court, entitled to respect under principles of stare \n     decisis. And that would be the body of law that any judge \n     confronting an issue in his care would begin with, not \n     simply the decision in Roe v. Wade but its reaffirmation \n     in the Casey decision. That is itself a precedent. It's a \n     precedent on whether or not to revisit the Roe v. Wade \n     precedent. And under principles of stare decisis, that \n     would be where any judge considering the issue in this \n     area would begin.\n       Testifying a year later, Justice Alito was no less \n     emphatic. He testified:\n       I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important \n     doctrine. It's a fundamental part of our legal system, and \n     its the principle that courts in general should follow their \n     past precedents, and its important for a variety of reasons. \n     Its important because it limits the power of the judiciary. \n     Its important because it protects reliance interests, and its \n     important because it reflects the view of the courts should \n     respect the judgments and the wisdom that are embodied in \n     prior judicial decisions. It's not an inexorable command, but \n     it's a general presumption that courts are going to follow \n     prior precedents.\n       I agree that in every case in which there is a prior \n     precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare decisis, and \n     the presumption is that the Court will follow its prior \n     precedents. There needs to be a special justification for \n     overruling a prior precedent.\n       I don't want to leave the impression that stare decisis is \n     an inexorable command because the Supreme Court has said that \n     it is not, but it is a judgment that has to be based, taking \n     into account all of the factors that are relevant and that \n     are set out in the Supreme Court's cases.\n       It was not only the nominees themselves who testified that \n     they would follow stare decisis. Numerous hearing witnesses \n     made that claim on their behalf. One prominent practitioner \n     before the Court (Maureen E. Mahoney) told the Committee that \n     Chief Justice Roberts had the deepest respect for legal \n     principles and legal precedent. Charles Fried, the \n     conservative Solicitor General during the Reagan \n     Administration, testified that he did not believe that Chief \n     Justice Roberts would vote to overturn Roe v. Wade (1973). \n     Commenting in 2007, federal circuit judge Diane Sykes wrote \n     that Chief Justice Roberts's and his supporters hearing \n     testimony portrayed a cautious judge who would be attentive \n     to the discretion-limiting force of decisional rules and \n     precedent (Of a Judiciary Nature: Observations on Chief \n     Justice's First Opinions, 34 Pepperdine Law Review 1027 \n     (2007)). In the case of Justice Alito, the late Edward \n     Becker, the former Chief Judge of and Justice Alito's \n     colleague on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit, a \n     nationally acclaimed judicial centrist, testified that as \n     circuit court judge Justice Alito scrupulously adhere[d] to \n     precedent. A group of Third Circuit judges backed Judge \n     Becker by speaking out in favor of Justice Alito's \n     confirmation.\n       Numerous liberal commentators also noted Chief Justice \n     Roberts's and Justice Alito's professed respect for precedent \n     despite their apparent ideological conservatism. New York \n     Times Court reporter Linda Greenhouse, for instance, noted \n     that [b]oth Chief Justice John G. Roberts, Jr. and Justice \n     Samuel Alito, Jr., assured their Senate questioners at their \n     confirmation hearing that they . . . respected precedent \n     (Precedents Begin to Fall for Roberts Court, The New York \n     Times, July 21, 2007). Chief Justice Roberts's commitment to \n     stare decisis even earned him the support of some noted \n     liberal constitutional scholars. Among them was Laurence \n     Tribe, the renowned professor of constitutional law at \n     Harvard Law School, and Geoffrey Stone, the Edward H. Levi \n     Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago \n     Law School. Professor Stone wrote in an op-ed that Chief \n     Justice Roberts is too good of a lawyer, too good a \n     craftsman, to embrace . . . a disingenuous approach to \n     constitutional interpretation. Everything about him suggests \n     a principled, pragmatic justice who will act cautiously and \n     with a healthy respect for precedent (President Bush's Blink, \n     Chicago Tribune, July 27, 2005, at 27). He noted in a \n     subsequent law review article that [b]ased largely on Chief \n     Justice Roberts's testimony on stare decisis, I publicly \n     supported his confirmation. (The Roberts Court, Stare Decisis \n     and the Future of Constitutional Law, 82 Tulane Law Review \n     1533 (2008).) Professor Cass Sunstein of Harvard Law School, \n     who now heads the Obama Administration's Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), likewise supported \n     Chief Justice Roberts's confirmation for this reason. \n     (Minimalist Justice, The New Republic, Aug. 1, 2005 [check].) \n     So, too, did Court commentator Jeffrey Rosen. (Jeffrey Rosen, \n     In Search of John Roberts, The New York Times, July 21, \n     2005.)\n       In addition to stare decisis, the confirmation hearings \n     also addressed what I bluntly referred to during the Roberts \n     hearing as the denigration by the Court of Congressional \n     authority. I noted several important cases in which the Court \n     had disregarded legislative fact-findings made incidental to \n     Congress's constitutionally assigned legislative powers.\n       The issue has taken on particular importance with respect \n     to two of the civil rights amendments: the Fourteenth, which \n     forbids a state from (among things) abridging the right of \n     any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of \n     the laws, and the Fifteenth, which forbids the states and the \n     federal government from denying any citizen the right to vote \n     on account of race. Both amendments give Congress the power \n     to enforce their prohibitions by appropriate legislation. \n     Difficult questions have arisen as to the contours of \n     Congress's powers under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth \n     Amendments. This much, though, should be beyond debate: \n     Congress alone has the institutional fact-finding capacity to \n     investigate whether state practices result in systemic \n     deprivations of the rights guaranteed by these amendments \n     and, having found such deprivations, to fashion appropriate \n     measures to remediate them.\n       Just as they did on the subject of stare decisis, both \n     Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito gave the Committee \n     assurances that they would defer to Congressional findings of \n     fact that underlay the exercise of Congress's powers not only \n     under the civil rights amendments but also the Commerce \n     Clause. Chief Justice Roberts testified:\n       The reason that congressional fact finding and \n     determination is important in these cases is because the \n     courts recognize that they can't do that. Courts can't have, \n     as you said, whatever it was, the 13 separate hearings before \n     passing particular legislation. . . . [The Supreme] Court \n     can't sit and hear witness after witness after witness in a \n     particular area and develop that kind of a record. Courts \n     can't make the policy judgments about what type of \n     legislation is necessary in light of the findings that are \n     made . . . We simply don't have the institutional expertise \n     or the resources or the authority to engage in that type of a \n     process. So that is sort of the basis for the deference to \n     the\n\n[[Page S4594]]\n\n     fact finding that is made. It's institutional competence. The \n     courts don't have it. Congress does. It's constitutional \n     authority. It's not our job. It is your job. So the deference \n     to congressional findings in this area has a solid basis.\n       I appreciate very much the differences in institutional \n     competence between the judiciary and the Congress when it \n     comes to basic questions of fact finding, development of a \n     record, and also the authority to make the policy decisions \n     about how to act on the basis of a particular record. It's \n     not just disagreement over a record. It's a question of whose \n     job it is to make a determination based on the record . . . \n     [A]s a judge, you may be beginning to transgress into the \n     area of making a law . . . when you are in a position of re-\n     evaluating legislative findings, because that doesn't look \n     like a judicial function.\n       Chief Justice Roberts also addressed the issue of \n     legislative fact-finding when discussing the Court's decision \n     in McConnell v. Federal Election Commission (2003). There the \n     Court rejected a First Amendment facial challenge to a \n     provision of the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (commonly \n     known as McCain-Feingold Act) that bars corporations and \n     labor unions from funding advertisements in support of or \n     opposition to a candidate for federal office soon before an \n     election. Although he would not say whether McConnell was \n     correctly decided, Chief Justice Roberts did acknowledge, as \n     the Court emphasized in its decision, that the Act was the \n     product of an extraordinarily extensive [legislative] record. \n     . . . My reading of the Court's opinion . . . is that that \n     was a case where the Court's decision was driven in large \n     part by the record that had been compiled by Congress. . . . \n     [T]he determination there was based . . . that the extensive \n     record carried a lot of weight with the Justices.\n       On the subject of legislative fact-finding, Justice Alito's \n     testimony was in accord. Justice Alito testified:\n       I think that the judiciary should have great respect for \n     findings of fact that are made by Congress. . . .\n       [The] judiciary is not equipped at all to make findings \n     about what is going on in the real world, not this sort of \n     legislative findings. And Congress, of course, is in the best \n     position to do that.\n       Congress can have hearings and examine complex social \n     issues, receive statistical data, hear testimony from \n     experts, analyze that and synthesize that and reduce that to \n     findings.\n       I have the greatest respect for [Congressional] findings. \n     This is an area where Congress has the expertise and where \n     Congress has the opportunity to assemble facts and to assess \n     the facts. We on the appellate judiciary don't have that \n     opportunity.\n       And when Congress makes findings on questions that have a \n     bearing on the constitutionality of legislation, I think they \n     are entitled to great respect.\n       III. The record of the newly constituted Roberts Court and, \n     in particular, that of Chief Justice Roberts and Samuel Alito \n     raises serious questions as to the adequacy of the prevailing \n     standard for evaluating nominees to the Court. Although \n     barely four years old, the Roberts Court has already amassed \n     a record of conservative judicial activism that the country \n     has not seen since the early New Deal era. This has \n     manifested, most significantly, in the Court's willingness to \n     overrule precedent and usurp the lawmaking powers of Congress \n     in service of conservative political objectives.\n       Numerous commentators have highlighted the contradiction \n     between Chief Justice Roberts's and Justice Alito's \n     testimony, and their actions on the Court. Professor Stone, \n     whose words in support of Chief Justice Roberts I just \n     quoted, has written that their records on the Court speak \n     much louder than their words to Congress. Their abandon[ment] \n     of stare decisis in case after case has required Chief \n     Justice Roberts to eat his words about commitment to \n     precedent. (The Roberts Court, Stare Decisis, and the Future \n     of Constitutional Law, 82 Tulane Law Review 1533 (2008).) \n     Another prominent academic lawyer, Professor Ronald Dworkin \n     of New York University Law School, has said that Justices \n     Roberts and Alito had both declared their intention to \n     respect precedent in their confirmation hearings, and no \n     doubt they were reluctant to admit so soon how little those \n     declarations were worth. (Quoted in Linda Greenhouse, \n     Precedents Begin to Fall for Roberts Court, The New York \n     Times, June 21, 2007). Professor Dworkin later said that \n     Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, who . . . promised \n     fidelity to the law during their confirmation hearings, have \n     brazenly ignore[d] past decisions (Justice Sotomayor: The \n     Unjust Hearing, The New York Review of Books, Sept. 24, \n     2009). And Jeffrey Rosen of The New Republic recently asked \n     in an article, and later in a hearing before the Judiciary \n     Committee, whether the John Roberts who testified before the \n     Senate was the same John Roberts who now sits on the Court \n     (Roberts Versus Roberts: How Radical is the Chief Justice? \n     The New Republic, Feb. 17, 2010).\n       No decision of the Roberts Court supports these assessments \n     more powerfully than Citizens United v. Federal Election \n     Commission (2010). A five-four majority of the Court struck \n     down as facially unconstitutional section 203 of the \n     Bipartisan Campaign Act of 2002 (commonly known as the \n     McCain-Feingold Act), which prohibits corporations and unions \n     from making independent campaign expenditures (independent \n     because they are not coordinated with a campaign) to fund any \n     broadcast, cable, or satellite communication that refers to a \n     clearly identified candidate for federal office and is made \n     within 30 days of a primary or 60 days of a general election. \n     (Federal law leaves corporations free to finance television \n     ads, during a campaign or otherwise, addressing whatever \n     political issues they wish and to engage in express advocacy \n     for or against a candidate in print or through other mediums \n     of communication not covered by the statute. It also leaves \n     them free to engage freely in political advocacy, as they \n     often do, through PACs.)\n       The upshot is that election-related speech by corporations \n     including foreign corporations now apparently enjoys the same \n     constitutional protection as campaign-related speech by \n     citizens. It is little wonder that even three-fourths of \n     Republicans polled have expressed disagreement with the \n     Court's decision.\n       The much-discussed rebuke of the Court by the President \n     during the last state-of-the-union address was deserved. For \n     the Court's decision did not merely reflect an erroneous, but \n     reasonable, interpretation of the First Amendment. It \n     reflected five Justices willingness to repudiate precedent, \n     history, and Congressional findings to an extraordinary \n     degree. To highlight: (1) The Court went out of its way to \n     overrule two decisions: McConnell v. Federal Election \n     Commission (2003), where six Justices (including most notably \n     Chief Justice Roberts's and Justice Alito's predecessors, \n     Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice O'Connor) had just seven \n     year earlier upheld section 203 against a facial challenge to \n     its constitutionality, and Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \n     Commerce (1990), where the Court upheld the constitutionality \n     of even broader state statute regulating corporate campaign-\n     related expenditures. Overruling Austin was especially \n     significant because Congress specifically relied on that \n     decision in drafting the McCain Feingold Act. Pulling out the \n     rug beneath Congress in this manner, Justice Stevens noted in \n     dissent, shows great disrespect for a coequal branch. (2) The \n     Court eschewed a number of narrower grounds (both \n     constitutional and statutory) for ruling in favor of the \n     corporate litigant. (3) The Court, in Justice Stevens's \n     words, rewr[ote] the law relating to campaign expenditures by \n     for-profit corporations and unions (emphasis) by putting for-\n     profit corporations on the same constitutional footing as \n     individuals, media corporations, and non-profit advocacy \n     corporations, and made a dramatic break from our past by \n     repudiating a century's history of federal regulation of \n     corporate campaign activity. (4) And the Court, to quote \n     Justice Stevens once more, cast aside the virtual mountain of \n     evidence establishing the corrupting influence of corporate \n     money on which Congress relied in drafting ' 203. Recall the \n     words I quoted earlier of the Chief Justice during his \n     confirmation hearing as to the extensive legislative record \n     on which McConnell was based.\n       Citizens United is the most visible demonstration of Chief \n     Justice Roberts' and Justice Alito's troubling disregard of \n     precedent and usurpation of Congress' constitutionally \n     assigned powers. It is not the only. Let me offer some \n     additional examples first in cases interpreting the \n     Constitution and then in cases interpreting federal statutes.\n       Especially troubling is Parents Involved in Community \n     Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1 (2007). The Court \n     struck down narrowly tailored race-conscious remedial plans \n     adopted by two local boards designed to maintain racially \n     integrated school districts. In his opinion for the Court, \n     Chief Justice Roberts concluded that only upon establishing \n     that it had intentionally discriminated in the assignment of \n     students may a school district voluntary adopt such a plan \n     that is to say, only when the Fourteenth Amendment's equal \n     protection clause would actually require race-conscious \n     remedial efforts. But as Justice Breyer emphasized in his \n     dissenting opinion, a longstanding and unbroken line of legal \n     authority tells us that the Equal Protection Clause [of the \n     Fourteenth Amendment] permits local school boards to use \n     race-conscious criteria to achieve positive race-related \n     goals, even when the Constitution does not compel it. The \n     majority's disregard of that precedent, Justice Breyer wrote \n     in dissent, threatens to substitute for present calm a \n     disruptive round of race-related litigation, and . . . \n     undermines Brown's promise of integrated . . . education that \n     local communities have sought to make a reality. Justice \n     Breyer pointedly asked: What has happened to stare decisis? \n     [S]o extreme was Chief Justice Roberts position, New York \n     Times Court reporter Linda Greenhouse has written, that \n     concurring Justice Anthony Kennedy, himself a conservative on \n     the equal protection clause, refused to sign it (Op-ed, The \n     Chief Justice on the Spot, The New York Times, Jan. 9, 2009).\n       Hein v. Freedom from Religion Foundation, Inc., 127 S. Ct. \n     2553 (2007), written by Justice Alito, and Morse v. \n     Frederick, 127 S. Ct. 1610 (2007), written by Chief Justice \n     Roberts, present two additional examples in the area of \n     constitutional law. Hein held that an individual taxpayer did \n     not have standing to challenge the constitutionality of \n     government expenditures to religious organizations under the \n     Bush administration's faith-based initiatives program. That \n     conclusion ran counter to a four-decade-old precedent holding \n     that taxpayers have standing to challenge federal \n     expenditures as violative of the\n\n[[Page S4595]]\n\n     Establishment Clause (Flast v. Cohen (1968)). Justice Alito \n     distinguished the precedent on the ground that it involved a \n     program authorized by the legislative branch rather than the \n     executive branch. But as Justice Souter explained in dissent, \n     Justice Alito's distinction has no basis in either logic or \n     precedent.\n       The second case, Morse, held that the suspension of high \n     school students for displaying a banner across the street \n     from their school that read BONG Hits 4 JESUS did not violate \n     the First Amendment. That holding ran counter to another \n     long-standing precedent, Tinker (1969), which held \n     unconstitutional the discipline of a public-school student \n     for engaging in First Amendment-protected speech unless it \n     disrupts school activities. Chief Justice Roberts attempted \n     to distinguish Tinker on the ground that the banner in the \n     case before him could be read to encourage illegal drug use. \n     That distinction is unpersuasive. The communicative display \n     held protected in Tinker the wearing of an arm band \n     protesting the Vietnam war might just as plausibly be \n     interpreted to encourage illegal activity, i.e., draft \n     dodging.\n       Nowhere has Chief Justice Roberts's and Justice Alito's \n     disrespect for precedent manifested itself more consistently, \n     perhaps, than in their statutory decisions favoring business \n     and corporate interests over consumers, employees, and civil \n     rights plaintiffs. During the Court's last Term alone, Chief \n     Justice Roberts and Justice Alito voted in three five-to-four \n     decisions to upend precedent in favor of business interests, \n     twice ruling against civil rights claimants. The most recent \n     such case upended the Court's unanimous 1974 decision in \n     Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co. (1974), which held that an \n     employee cannot be compelled to arbitrate a statutory \n     discrimination claim under a collectively bargained-for \n     arbitration clause to which he did not consent. The Court \n     held otherwise in 14 Penn Plaza, LLC v. Pyett (2009), thereby \n     depriving many employees of their right to bring statutory \n     discrimination claims in federal court. Rather than \n     acknowledge that it was overruling Gardner-Denver, however, \n     the Court cast that decision's holding in implausibly narrow \n     terms. This prompted the dissenters to lament the Court's \n     subversion of precedent to the policy favoring arbitration. \n     Other examples are cataloged in the record of a 2008 \n     Judiciary Committee hearing on the subject of decisions \n     favoring big business. (Courting Big Business: the Supreme \n     Court's Recent Decisions on Corporation Misconduct and Laws \n     Regulating Corporations, Hearing Before the S. Comm. on the \n     Judiciary, July 23, 2008.)\n       During the Court's 2006 Term, Chief Justice Roberts and \n     Justices Alito and Thomas joined the majority in two major \n     cases (also decided by bare five-four majorities) overruling \n     precedents so as to favor large corporate interests: Leegin \n     Creative Leather Products, Inc. v. PSKS (2007), where the \n     Court overturned a century-old precedent holding that \n     vertical price-fixing agreement per-se violate the federal \n     antitrust laws; and Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009), where the \n     Court, drawing on Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. \n     544 (2007), changed the long-standing rules governing what a \n     plaintiff must allege at the outset of his or her case in \n     order to get into federal court. One reporter has noted that \n     Iqbal gives corporate defendants a gift that keeps on giving. \n     (Tony Mauro, Plaintiffs Groups Mount Effort to Undo Supreme \n     Courts Iqbal Ruling, The National Law Journal, Sept. 21, \n     2009.)\n       It is not just that Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito \n     have disregarded precedent. It is the matter in which they \n     have done it by distinguishing it on unpersuasive grounds or \n     outright ignoring it without forthrightly overruling it. \n     Professor Stone has written that the two Justice have \n     abandoned the principle of stare decisis in a particularly \n     insidious manner and that their approach to precedent has \n     been dishonest (Geoffrey Stone, The Roberts Court, Stare \n     Decisis, and the Future of Constitutional Law, 82 Tulane Law \n     Review 1533 (2008)). Another notes that [t]his may be a long-\n     term characteristic of the Roberts Court, changing the law, \n     even dramatically, but without expressly overruling \n     precedent. But this may also be a short-term phenomena and \n     reflective of the recent confirmation hearings of John \n     Roberts and Samuel Alito. At both, there was considerable \n     discussion of precedent and even super precedent. Perhaps \n     with these confirmation discussions still fresh in mind, \n     these Justices did not want to expressly overrule recent \n     precedent. But as time passes, the hesitancy may disappear . \n     . . . (Erwin Chemerinsky, Forward, Supreme Court Review, 43 \n     Tulsa L. Rev. 627 (2008).)\n       Even fellow conservative Justices Scalia and Thomas have \n     criticized Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito for the \n     way in which they dispense with precedent without \n     forthrightly overruling it. In Federal Election Commission v. \n     Wisconsin Right to Life (2007), for instance, Justice Scalia \n     went so far as to accuse Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \n     Alito of practicing what he called faux judicial restraining \n     by effectively overruling McConnell v. Federal Election \n     Commission without expressly saying so.\n       Numerous distinguished academics have criticized the \n     Roberts's Courts record with respect to stare decisis. \n     Professor Stone has even said that Chief Justice Roberts's \n     and Alito's conduct during the first term during which they \n     both sat on the Court was the most disheartening judicial \n     performances he has ever witnessed. (The Roberts Court, \n     Stare Decisis, and the Future of Constitutional Law, 82 \n     Tulane Law Review 1533 (2008).) Similarly, Professor \n     Dworkin has charged Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \n     Alito with leading a revolution Jacobin in its disdain for \n     tradition and precedent, and said of their testimony \n     before the Judiciary Committee that it was actually a \n     coded script for the continuing subversion of the American \n     constitution. (The Supreme Court Phalanx, New York Review \n     of Books, Sept. 27, 2007, at 92.) And Dean Erwin \n     Chemerinsky has noted the Roberts Court's pronounced \n     willing[ness] to depart from prior rulings, even recent \n     precedents. (Forward, Supreme Court Review, 43 Tulsa L. \n     Rev. 627 (2008).)\n       As for the Roberts Court's denigration of Congressional \n     power, its record is not as extensive as it is with respect \n     to stare decisis, but it is troubling nonetheless. I have \n     already discussed Citizens United, where the Court overturned \n     a precedent (Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce (1990)) \n     on which Congress relied in drafting the McCain-Feingold Act \n     and disregarded a record of legislative fact-finding \n     establishing the corruption of our electoral system by the \n     influx of independent corporate campaign-related \n     expenditures. Two other cases support that assessment.\n       The first is Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District v. \n     Holder (2009). At issue was the constitutionality of '5 of \n     the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Section 5 prohibits changes in \n     the election procedures of states with a history of racial \n     discrimination in voting unless the Attorney General or a \n     three judge district court determines that the change neither \n     has the purpose nor will have the effect of denying or \n     abriding the right to vote on account of race or color. \n     Congress passed the Act under the express power conferred on \n     it by article 2 of the Fifteenth Amendment to enforce the \n     Amendments first section which prohibits racial \n     discrimination in voting by appropriate legislation. Congress \n     reauthorized the Act in 1970 (for five years), in 1975 (for \n     seven years), in 1982 (for twenty-five years), and in 2006 \n     (for another twenty five years). The Court upheld the first \n     three extensions. At issue in Austin was whether the 2006 \n     extension was supported by an adequate legislative record.\n       There was no question that it was. Writing for the Court in \n     Northwest Austin, Chief Justice Roberts himself conceded that \n     '2 of the Fifteenth Amendment empowers Congress, not the \n     Court, to determine in the first instance what legislation is \n     needed to enforce it and that Congress amassed a sizeable \n     record [over ten months in 21 hearings] in support of its \n     record to extend ['5s] preclearance requirements, a record \n     the District Court determined document[ed] contemporary \n     racial discrimination in covered states. Ultimately the Court \n     avoided the constitutional question in Austin by deciding the \n     case on a narrow statutory ground. But during oral argument \n     in the case, Chief Justice Roberts made clear that he was \n     disinclined to accept Congress' legislative finding as to the \n     need for '5. He said that, in extending '5s so-called \n     preclearance requirements, Congress was sweeping far more \n     broadly than they need to, to address the intentional \n     discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment. Numerous Court \n     commentators have suggested that it was only because Chief \n     Justice Roberts could not muster a majority for striking down \n     '5 that he agreed to decide the case on narrow statutory \n     grounds. (E.g., Linda Greenhouse, Down the Memory Hole, The \n     New York Times, Oct. 2, 2009.) It is difficult to resist that \n     conclusion. There was no reason for four Justices to have \n     granted certiorari in the case unless they wanted to strike \n     down '5. The statutory issue the Court decided was \n     unimportant.\n       Another example is Ashcroft v. Iqbal (2009). Building on \n     its earlier decision in Bell Atlantic v. Twombly (2007), the \n     Court there changed the long-standing rules of pleadings the \n     rules governing what a plaintiff must allege in a complaint \n     to have his case heard in federal court under the Federal \n     Rules of Civil Procedure. Until Twombly and Iqbal, the \n     Federal Rules required no more of a complaint than that it \n     provide a short and plain statement of the claim, sufficient \n     to give the defendant fair notice of what the plaintiffs \n     claim is and the grounds upon which it rested. Conley v. \n     Gibson (1957) (quoting Rule 8(a)(2)). A plaintiff was not \n     required to plead the specific facts underlying his \n     allegations. Only if a complaints allegations, accepted as \n     true, failed to support a viable theory of relief that is, \n     fail[ed] to state a claim upon which relief can be granted \n     (Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6)) could the complaint be dismissed. \n     That rule makes eminent sense: not until receiving a \n     plaintiff's post-discovery evidentiary submission can the \n     court evaluate the sufficiency of his factual allegations. \n     Twombly jettisoned notice pleading by requiring that a \n     complaint include sufficiently detailed factual allegations \n     to render its key allegations plausible. Iqbal went a \n     substantial distance beyond Twombly by requiring courts to \n     draw on [their] judicial experience and common sense in \n     effect, to indulge their subjective judgments without the \n     benefit any evidence in evaluating a complaint's \n     plausibility. No one yet knows the extent to which these new \n     rules will limit Americans' access to the courts. But so far \n     the signs especially in civil rights cases are not \n     encouraging.\n       The significance of the two decisions, apart from whatever \n     effect they may have on access to the federal courts, is that \n     the Court end ran the Congressionally established\n\n[[Page S4596]]\n\n     process for changing the rules of civil procedure. In the \n     Rules Enabling Act of 1938, Congress delegated to the federal \n     judiciary its power to promulgate procedural rules for cases \n     in the federal courts, but not through the normal mechanism \n     of case-by-case adjudication. Congress recognized that \n     establishing procedural rules is not a judicial function; it \n     is a legislative function. Therefore, Congress required that \n     any proposed rule change be noticed and subjected to public \n     comment (much as a proposed rule by a administrative agency \n     is subjected to notice-and-comment rulemaking procedures), \n     carefully reviewed by the relevant committees of the Judicial \n     Conference in open proceedings that allows for public \n     participation, and then approved by the Conference. The rule \n     must then be presented to the Supreme Court for approval and, \n     if approved, sent to Congress, which has six months to review \n     and disapprove the rule. Twombly and especially Iqbal \n     represent a brazen disregard for these Congressionally \n     established procedures. No one should let the technical \n     nature of the issues in these cases obscure that fact.\n       IV. Where does all this leave us? It is clear that we can \n     no longer content ourselves with assurances from a nominee \n     that he or she will respect precedent a promise all nominees \n     now seem to employ, in Laurence Tribe's words, as a magic \n     elixir [citation] and defer to the legitimate exercise of \n     Congressional power (including legislative factfinding). \n     Chief Justice Roberts' and Justice Alito's performance on the \n     Court demonstrate how little those promises tell us about how \n     a nominee will decide particular cases once seated on the \n     Court. Still less can we content ourselves with vague \n     promises of the sort that we have heard repeatedly from \n     nominees of both Democratic and Republican Presidents in the \n     post-Bork era that they will decide cases according to the \n     law, honor the rule of law, approach each case with an open \n     mind, put aside personal policy preferences when donning \n     their robes, and so on. None of these promises tells us \n     anything meaningful about how a Justice will decide cases.\n       Nor will a nominees testimony about what interpretative \n     methodologies he or she will employ in deciding cases or what \n     role he or she envisions for judicial review in our system \n     usually tell us much, if anything useful, about what sort of \n     voting record he or she will have on the Court. As one \n     academic who has carefully studied the confirmation \n     hearing of every nominee beginning with Justice O'Connor \n     in 1982 observes, most Supreme Court nominees say more or \n     less the same thing when answering inquiries about the \n     nominee's general approach to constitutional philosophy or \n     interpretation. (Lori A. Ringhand, I'm Sorry, I Can't \n     Answer That: Positive Scholarship and the Supreme Court \n     Confirmation Process, University of Pennsylvania Journal \n     of Constitutional Law 331 (2008).) Solicitor General Kagan \n     made much the same point in 1995 when, in a law review \n     article whose key arguments she still stands by, wrote \n     that a nominee's statements of judicial philosophy may be \n     so abstract as to leave uncertain, especially to the \n     public, much about their real-world consequences. (Elena \n     Kagan, Confirmation Messes, Old and New, University of \n     Chicago Law Review, 62 University of Chicago Law Review \n     919, 935 (1995).)\n       Consider one interpretative methodology that, beginning \n     with Robert Bork, has taken on special prominence in the \n     confirmation process: original intent, sometimes called \n     original meaning. Conservatives claim that only by \n     interpreting the Constitution according to its original \n     intent can judges avoid reading their personal ideological \n     views into the Constitution. But as Christopher Eisgruber, \n     the Provost of Princeton University and a former law \n     professor at New York University School of Law, has observed \n     in an important book, originalist accounts of constitutional \n     meaning . . . reflect the ideological values of the judges \n     who render them, no less than do other interpretations of the \n     Constitution.\n       Original intent is not the exclusive province of \n     conservatives. Both liberal and conservatives regularly \n     appeal to original intent to justify their positions. One \n     prominent liberal academic lawyer, paraphrasing another, \n     claims that w[e] are all originalists now. (Laurence H. \n     Tribe, Comment in Antonin Scalia, A Matter of Interpretation \n     (1997), p. 67.) It is not surprising that during their \n     confirmation hearings both Judge Bork and Justice Souter \n     Republican nominees who, we later learned, shared very \n     different judicial ideologies subscribed to original intent \n     as an interpretative methodology. The problem is that \n     liberals and conservatives reach competing conclusion as to \n     what the original intent requires with respect to contested \n     constitutional provisions. Sometimes even conservatives \n     disagree among themselves about original intent in particular \n     cases. Professor Eisgruber notes: The originalist Justice \n     Antonin Scalia insists that the framers intended for the free \n     speech clause to establish a principle that protects flag \n     burning; the orignalist former judge . . . Robert Bork says \n     that they did not. Scalia says that the framers did not \n     intend the free exercise clause to provide religious \n     believers with exemptions from generally applicable laws; the \n     originalist scholar and federal judge Michael McConnell says \n     that they did. John Paul Stevens and four other moderate-to-\n     liberal justices say that the framers intended to provide \n     term limits for federal legislators; four more conservative \n     justices say that they did not. (The Next Justice (2007), p. \n     40.) Another of many more recent examples relates to gun \n     rights. Two years ago in District of Columbia v. Heller \n     (2008), the Supreme Court was presented with the question \n     whether the Second Amendment guarantees an individual right \n     to bear arms unconnected with service in a state militia. The \n     Court's five conservative Justices answered definitively yes; \n     the Court's four more liberal members answered definitively \n     no. Both relied on the framers' original understanding of the \n     Second Amendment to reach their conclusions. Here, as in many \n     cases where original is invoked, to quote Professor Eisgruber \n     again, the judges' conclusions about the framers wanted align \n     with their own constitutional values.\n       One reason that neither originalism nor any other neutral \n     interpretative approach will dictate the result in the \n     difficult cases that come before the Court is that the \n     Constitution's most contested provisions set forth general \n     principles using abstract language. The First Amendment \n     prohibits Congress from making a law that respecting an \n     establishing of religion or abridging the freedom of speech. \n     The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments prohibit the federal \n     government and the states, respectfully, from depriving any \n     person of life, liberty, or property without due process of \n     law. The Eighth Amendment prohibits the imposition of cruel \n     and unusual punishment. And the Fourteenth Amendment \n     prohibits the states from depriving any person within their \n     jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Many statutes \n     are similarly open-ended and no less demanding of judicial \n     interpretation. Think, for instance, of the Sherman Antitrust \n     Act, whose main provision declares only that [e]very \n     contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or \n     conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce among the \n     several States, or with foreign nations, is declared to be \n     illegal.\n       What meaning a Justice gives to such open-ended provisions \n     in particular cases will depend on a judge's ideology his or \n     her understanding of what these provisions mean when applied \n     to the types of governmental actions that regularly come \n     before the Court. Consider, for example, the Fourteenth \n     Amendment's equal protection clause, perhaps the most open-\n     ended of the open-ended provisions to which I have referred. \n     Does it forbid all (or nearly all) state action based on \n     racial classifications? Does it, that is, always require the \n     state to be color-blind? Or does it allow states to take race \n     into account and sometimes even prefer a person over one race \n     over a person of another in order to diminish inequality, \n     promote diversity, render public institutions more \n     representative of the population (and thereby more \n     legitimate), or otherwise? The text of the equal protection \n     clause cannot answer these questions. Nor, in many cases, can \n     precedent. Only the judges ideology or, if you will, his or \n     her understanding of the clause's purpose can.\n       The situation is no different when it comes to the \n     interpretation of statutes. On the subject of affirmative \n     action, consider Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964's \n     seemingly straightforward prohibition on employment \n     discrimination because of race. Does this prohibition extend \n     to every sort of differential treatment based on race, in \n     which case affirmative action programs nearly always violate \n     Title VII, or does it just extend to invidious forms of \n     discrimination, in which case at least some carefully drawn \n     affirmative action programs do not violate Title VII? The \n     text of the statute does not answer these questions. Again, \n     only a judge's views of what discrimination means can. That \n     is why, more than forty five years after Title VII's \n     enactment, the Justices have not reached a consensus as to \n     the legality of affirmative action.\n       The inescapable conclusion I draw from all this that, in \n     future confirmation hearings, the Senate should consider a \n     nominee's substantive judicial ideology or, to use Solicitor \n     General Kagan's words in the article to which I just \n     referred, a nominee's constitutional views and commitments. \n     (Elena Kagan, Confirmation Messes, Old and New, 62 University \n     of Chicago Law Review 919, 942 (1995).) I say judicial rather \n     than political ideology because a judge may hold subscribe to \n     a judicial ideology that dictates substantive results he or \n     she would not vote for if sitting as a legislator. A judge \n     may, for instance, be opposed to affirmative action as a \n     political matter but believe that the Constitution cuts a \n     wide swath for Congress to pass raced-based remedial measures \n     (as the framers of the Reconstruction Amendments may well \n     have believed). Or a judge may believe legislatures should \n     not ban abortions but that the constitution allows them to do \n     so. Of course, there will often be substantial overlap \n     between a judge's political and legal ideologies, and it may \n     sometimes be difficult to distinguish between the two.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4596, June 7, 2010, in the Record reads: . . .

Christopher Eisgruber notes in The Next Justice \n     that when people discuss Supreme Court nominations, they \n     usually focus on the Senates role . . . Much less \n     attention gets paid to the process by which presidents \n     nominate justices. . . . However understandable this focus \n     may be, it produces a distorted picture of how Supreme \n     Court Justices get chosen. Handwringing polemics about \n     [Senate] confirmation wars presuppose that presidents \n     choose nominees on apolitical grounds and\n\n[[Page S4597]]\n\n     that partisanship enters only at the confirmation stage. \n     That is nonsense. Ideological and political considerations \n     have always figured in presidential decisions about whom \n     to nominate to the Court. If the President may consider a \n     nominees ideology, why may not the Senate do so? Then-\n     Senator Obama made just that point during his well-known \n     floor statement on then-Judge Alitos nomination when he \n     said that the Senates advice-and-consent function, like \n     the Presidents nominating function, requires an \n     examination of a judges philosophy, ideology, and record \n     (January 26, 2006).\n       This raises two questions: First, to what substantive \n     ideological principles should we be confident a nominee \n     subscribes before confirming him or her? And second, how \n     should the Senate ascertain a nominees position on these \n     matters during a confirmation hearing?\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S4597, June 7, 2010, the Record reads: . . . principles \nmust we . . .\n  \n  The online version has been corrected to read: . . . principles \nshould we . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n       As for the first question, I would be reluctant to suggest \n     a definitive list. Many commentators have offered suggestions \n     as to how the Senate should go about ascertaining a nominees \n     judicial ideology, but few have offered any specific \n     suggestions as to what that ideology should be, except to say \n     that we should generally prefer ideological moderates. (E.g., \n     Christopher Eisgruber, The Next Justice (2007).) The \n     objective would be to identify certain important principles \n     that are specific enough to tell us something about what \n     outcomes a nominee is likely to reach in broad categories of \n     cases, but not too specific as to require the nominee to \n     prejudge the outcome of particular cases. Let me suggest a \n     tentative list:\n       (1) A nominee should accept that the Fourteenth and \n     Fifteenth Amendments confer substantial power on Congress to \n     enforce their substantive provisions. Over the last fifteen \n     years, considerable attention has been given to Congress's \n     express power to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth \n     Amendment by appropriate legislation. The Court has \n     significantly limited Congress's remedial powers under those \n     amendments. The main issue in these cases is how much \n     deference the Courts should accord Congress in deciding \n     whether remediation is necessary and, if so, what remedies \n     are appropriate. The Courts conservatives have accorded \n     Congress virtually none. But the drafters of the Fourteenth \n     and Fifteenth Amendment did not make the Court Congress's \n     taskmaster. The Court should ask no more than whether, in \n     Justice Breyer's words, Congress could reasonably have \n     concluded that a remedy is needed and that the remedy chosen \n     constitutes an appropriate way to enforce the amendments. \n     (Board of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett \n     (2001) (Breyer, J., dissenting).) The Senate should look \n     askance at any nominee who does not share Justice Breyer's \n     view.\n       (2) A nominee should accept that the Constitution and, in \n     particular, the due process clause of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment protects facets of individual liberty not yet \n     recognized by the Court. The Court has held repeatedly that, \n     through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, \n     the Constitution protects facets of personal liberty a realm \n     of personal liberty which the government may not enter (Casey \n     v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania (1992)) \n     not tethered to any of the rights expressly enumerated in the \n     Constitution's other amendments. These rights include the \n     right to terminate a pregnancy (Roe v. Wade (1973), Casey)), \n     the right to marry (Loving v. Virginia (1967) (alternative \n     holding)), and the right to enter into intimate personal \n     relationships (Lawrence v. Texas (2003). No nominee since \n     Robert Bork has taken the position that the due process \n     clause is limited to procedure. Not even Justice Scalia has \n     taken that position on the Court. Some Justices, though, have \n     taken an unduly restrictive view of the liberty interests \n     protected by the due process clause so restrictive as to \n     drain it of any meaningful content. Justice Scalia, for \n     instance, has demanded that a personal liberty interest not \n     only be fundamental before it is given constitutional \n     protection but also that it can be shown have been protected \n     against government interference by other rules of the law \n     when the Fourteenth Amendment was ratified. Justice Thomas \n     may have an even more restrictive view. We should ask of \n     nominees that they embrace the proposition that the due \n     process clause protects facets of personal liberty whether \n     involving privacy or otherwise not yet recognized by the \n     Court. This is important because no one can predict what \n     future government actions will infringe on facets of liberty \n     yet unaddressed by the Court.\n       (3) A nominee should accept that the liberty protected by \n     the Constitutions due process clauses includes the right to \n     terminate a pregnancy before the point of viability. I \n     realize that abortion remains a divisive moral and social \n     issue. But the constitutional status of abortion rights has \n     been settled. The Court has declined the opportunity to \n     overrule Roe v. Wade (1973) in nearly forty cases. In Casey \n     v. Planned Parenthood (1992), three Republican nominees to \n     the Court (Justices Kennedy, O'Connor, and Souter) joined two \n     other Justices in affirming Roe's central holding. Even \n     conservative federal judge Michael Luttig, a former clerk of \n     Justice Scalia, has characterized Casey as super stare \n     decisis. (Richmond Medical Center for Women v. Gilmore (4th \n     Cir. 1998). Roe should now be taken off the table as a \n     candidate for overruling, just as Brown v. Board of Education \n     (1954), Griswald v. Connecticut (1965), and other bedrock \n     precedents have been taken off the table by recent nominees \n     to the Court (including Justice Alito) in their confirmation \n     testimony. Even some of Roe's most vociferous critics \n     including President Reagan's Solicitor General, Charles \n     Fried, who urged the Court in the 1980s to overturn the \n     decision, and the late John Hart Ely, perhaps Roe's most \n     prominent academic critic, have said that the Supreme Court \n     should not, at this late date, overrule Roe.\n       (4) A nominee should accept that the equal protection \n     clause of the Fourteenth Amendment does not prohibit narrowly \n     tailored race-based remedial measures that is, does not \n     mandate color-blindness so long as they do not amount to \n     quotas. Two of the Courts conservative Justices Scalia and \n     Thomas have adopted the extreme and a historical \n     interpretation of the equal protection clause that denies the \n     government any ability to adopt any race-based preferences to \n     remedy past discrimination, no matter how narrowly drawn. \n     Neither Justice has justified this position, ironically, by \n     reference to the views of the Fourteenth Amendment's framers. \n     Their position is based, rather, on their nakedly political \n     position that, in Justice Scalia's words, affirmative action \n     reinforce[s] and preserve[s] . . . the way of thinking that \n     produced race slavery, race privilege, and race hatred, and \n     in Justice Thomas's words, that affirmative action \n     undermine[s] the moral basis of the equal protection \n     principle. (Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Pena (1995).) \n     Language in Chief Justice Roberts's opinion in Parents \n     Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. \n     1 (2007) suggests that he may well share this strong \n     antipathy to race-based remedies.\n       (5) A nominee should accept the constitutionality of \n     statutory restrictions on campaign contributions to \n     candidates for office. In Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 \n     (1976), the Supreme Court upheld limits on contributions by \n     individuals, even as it struck down a provision of federal \n     law prohibiting independent expenditures in support of \n     candidates for office. The Court accepted Congress finding \n     that allowing large individual financial contributions \n     threatens to corrupt the political process and undermine \n     public confidence in it. Id. at 26. Buckley's holding on \n     this point has been well-settled law for nearly 35 years.\n       Let me be clear about what we should not demand of \n     nominees. We should not demand that they promise to reach \n     particular outcomes in particular cases before the Court or \n     likely to come before the Court, or even require that they to \n     state their views on issues with so much specificity that we \n     know how they will probably rule in particular cases. We \n     should not demand, for instance, that a nominee promises to \n     recognize a right to engage in assisted suicide, or to uphold \n     ' 5 of the Voting Rights Act, or to recognize that a \n     particular state regulation imposes an undue burden on the \n     right to an abortion under Casey. Nor should we condition a \n     nominees confirmation on passing a single-issue litmus test. \n     We should not demand ideological purity of nominees. Some \n     ideological diversity on the Court is a good thing.\n       The second question I have asked how do we ascertain a \n     nominees judicial ideology? is more easily answered. I would \n     first carefully evaluate the nominees pre-hearing record for \n     clues to his or her ideology, much as the Presidents staff \n     does. They may provide important clues about a nominees \n     ideology, especially if the nominee has a limited judicial \n     record on which to draw, as did Chief Justice Roberts, or, \n     also like the Chief Justice, avoided writing law review \n     articles of the sort condemned Robert Bork during his \n     confirmation hearing.\n       Chief Justice Roberts's and Justices Justice Alito's \n     statements before becoming lower court judges at least raised \n     serious questions (admittedly with the benefit of some \n     hindsight) as to whether they were conservative judicial \n     ideologues. Let me offer some examples.\n       Most revealing in Chief Justice Roberts's record, perhaps, \n     were the views he expressed on the remediation of racial \n     discrimination while serving in a political capacity as a \n     member of the Reagan administration. None attracted more \n     attention than his views on the 1982 reauthorization of the \n     Voting Rights Act. The Chief Justice wrote more than two \n     dozen documents urging the administration to reject a \n     provision of the then-pending House bill that would have \n     allowed plaintiffs to establish a violation of the Act not \n     only by establishing that a voting practice was impermissibly \n     motivated, but also by establishing that it had a \n     discriminatory effect. Roberts claimed that the so-called \n     effects test would establish a quota system in elections and, \n     more disturbingly still in light of the extensive record of \n     voting-rights abuses amassed by Congressional committees, \n     claimed that there was no evidence of voting abuses \n     nationwide. In one memorandum, for instance, he wrote that \n     something must be done to educate the Senators on the \n     seriousness of this problem. Roberts's position did not \n     prevail. Congress passed a reauthorization bill that included \n     an effects test, and President Reagan signed into law. The \n     law has worked well to prevent discrimination in voting. No \n     one has seriously contended that the reauthorization \n     established an electoral quota system.\n       Another example in the race discrimination context (this \n     one not, unfortunately, raised at the confirmation hearing) \n     was a 1981 memorandum that Roberts wrote to the Attorney \n     General questioning the legality of regulations promulgated \n     by the Department of Labor to enforce Executive Order 11246. \n     Issued in 1965, that order requires private-\n\n[[Page S4598]]\n\n     sector employers that contract with the federal government to \n     evaluate whether qualified minorities and women are \n     underutilized in their workforces and, if so, to adopt goals \n     to increase their representation by encouraging women and \n     minorities to apply for positions. It does not require or \n     authorize employers to give any racial or sex-based \n     preferences; in fact, its implementing regulations expressly \n     forbid such preferences. Roberts attacked the regulations on \n     the ground that they conflicted with the color-blindness \n     principle of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and \n     use quota-like concepts. Only the most hardened conservatives \n     have questioned the legality of Executive Order 11246 in this \n     manner.\n       That is not all. For example, Roberts wrote disparagingly \n     about so-called fundamental rights (including the right to \n     privacy) recognized by the courts, in his view, to arrogate \n     power to themselves; questioned whether Congress had the \n     authority to terminate an overseas military engagement by \n     joint resolution without treading on the Presidents inherent \n     executive powers; and, in one case involving alleged systemic \n     gender discrimination at a prison, urged the Attorney General \n     to reject the advice of the Civil Rights to intervene in the \n     case because, among things, gender classifications should not \n     receive any heightened constitutional scrutiny.\n       Justice Alito's extra-judicial statements while serving in \n     the Reagan Administration were more even revealing than Chief \n     Justice Roberts's. Among them was his characterization of \n     Robert Bork as one of the most outstanding nominees of this \n     century. Alito shared Borks antipathy, in particular, to the \n     abortion right first recognized in Roe v. Wade (1973). While \n     serving as an assistant to Solicitor General Charles Fried in \n     1985, Alito took it upon himself to outline, in the words of \n     Professor Laurence Tribe, a step-by-step process toward the \n     ultimate goal of overruling Roe. That same year, when \n     applying for a position as the Assistant Attorney General in \n     the Office of Legal Counsel, Judge Alito unequivocally stated \n     in his cover letter the Constitution does not provide for the \n     right to terminate a pregnancy.\n       Justice Alito's extra-judicial writings also evidenced an \n     expansive view of executive power. Among them was 1989 speech \n     defending Justice Scalias lone dissent in Morrison v. Olson \n     (1988). There the Court upheld the constitutionality of the \n     independent counsel law passed by Congress in the wake of \n     Watergate. Justice Scalia was the lone dissenter. Justice \n     Alito expressed his agreement with the unitary executive \n     theory around which Justice Scalia framed his dissent. Alito \n     did so again in 2000 during a speech to the Federalist \n     Society. Justice Alito's support for the expansion of \n     executive at the expense of Congressional power was also \n     reflected in memoranda he wrote supporting the use of \n     presidential signing statements to advance a presidents \n     interpretation of a federal statute. Such statements, Justice \n     Alito contended, could serve as part of a statute's \n     legislative history to compete with floor statements, \n     committee reports, and other expressions of Congressional \n     intent. Professor Erwin Chemerinsky testified that Alitos \n     objective was to shift power from the legislature . . . to \n     the executive. Justice Alito's views on the subject surfaced \n     soon after he was seated on the Court. In Hamdan v. Rumsfeld \n     (2006), Justice Alito joined a dissenting opinion by Justice \n     Scalia chiding the majority for relying on legislative \n     history without also consulting President Bush's signing \n     statement.\n       Another oft-neglected source of information about a \n     nominees ideology that should be taken for granted are those \n     made by the nominating Presidents. Presidents often promise \n     the public to select candidates of particular ideological \n     stripe. President George W. Bush, for instance, said that he \n     would nominate Justices in the mold of Justices Scalia and \n     Thomas. Maybe we should take presidents at their word. \n     Presidents, after all, select nominees to the Court for \n     ideological reason, and presidents, notes Christopher \n     Eisgruber in The Next Justice, have numerous opportunities to \n     gather information from Washington insiders about a potential \n     nominee before nominating him or her information to which \n     Senators are often not privy. Professor Eisgruber reports, \n     for example, that Clarence Thomas told White House counsel C. \n     Boyden Gray that he was opposed to affirmative action. That \n     important piece of information did not surface during Justice \n     Thomas's confirmation hearing. (Christopher L. Eisgruber, The \n     Next Justice (Princeton, 2007), p. 146.) It is no surprise \n     that Justice Thomas has turned out to be the Court's most \n     unyielding opponent of affirmative action.\n       What, if any, weight should we give to a nominees own \n     testimony? A few commentators have suggested that the Senate \n     should return to the practice that prevailed before the mid-\n     1950s and dispense with testimony from the nominee \n     altogether. (E.g., Richard Brust, No More Kabuke \n     Confirmations, ABA Journal, Oct. 2009.) They say that the \n     nominees reveal nothing important about a nominee's judicial \n     ideology. I have made that complaint myself. At the outset of \n     the Roberts confirmation hearing, I said: It has been my \n     judgment . . . that nominees answer about as many questions \n     as they think they have to in order to be confirmed. It is a \n     subtle minuet . . . Nominees of both parties do the dance. In \n     fact Justice Sotomayor, whose nomination I supported, took \n     the dance to a new level. She said repeatedly that her \n     judicial philosophy was fidelity to the law. That told us \n     nothing about Judge Sotomayor. It is unfathomable to think \n     that any nominee no matter how liberal or conservative would \n     testify that he or she would be unfaithful to the law.\n       I do not agree, however, that we should dispense with a \n     nominee's testimony. It can be an important and, if the \n     nominee has a limited paper record, critical source of \n     information about the nominee's ideology. It is also \n     important to allow nominees to explain whether positions \n     imputed to her in fact reflected her views and, if so, \n     whether they still do. Perhaps a position a nominee once took \n     was really not his own, but instead his clients. Or perhaps a \n     nominee has abandoned a once-held position. Nominees should \n     be given the opportunity to explain their records. Senators \n     can judge the sincerity of their testimony. Moreover, \n     dispensing with a nominee's testimony would deprive members \n     of the public of an important opportunity to evaluate the \n     nominee while watching live on television.\n       Instead, the Judiciary Committee should insist that a \n     nominee actually provide meaningful testimony. Repetitiously \n     reciting platitudes such as I will follow the law or apply \n     the law to the facts or address each case on its merits or \n     approach each case with an open mind can no longer do. They \n     tell us nothing about a nominee's ideology or judicial \n     philosophy. One type of question the Senate might make better \n     use of is to ask the nominee for his opinion on cases already \n     decided by the Court. As Robert Post of Yale Law School has \n     argued, this sort of question, if answered, will reveal \n     information about the nominee's ideology that vague questions \n     about his or her approach to interpretation cannot. (Robert \n     Post & Reval Siegel, Questioning Justice: Law and Politics in \n     Judicial Confirmation Hearings, Yale L.J. (The Pocket Part), \n     Jan. 2006.) Senators have asked that sort of question before, \n     but often without adequate follow-up or without demanding \n     answers. A nominee who answers such a question is no more \n     guilty of prejudging a case that may come before the Court \n     than a sitting Justice who decided the particular case in \n     question. Recall that, during Justice Ginsburg's confirmation \n     hearing, she testified that she believed that the Court \n     reached the right result in Roe, although she disagreed with \n     its reasoning, just as she had previously done in her \n     academic writings. We need more testimony like that.\n       Whatever particular mode of questioning is employed, the \n     important point is that, when the Senate cannot ascertain the \n     nominee's judicial ideology from his or her pre-nomination \n     record, the Senate must insist that the nominee be \n     forthcoming with it. The Judiciary Committee should no longer \n     tolerate the sort of answer Justice Scalia gave during his \n     confirmation hearing when I asked him whether Marbury v. \n     Madison, the 1803 case holding that the Court has the \n     authority to pass on the constitutionality of a federal law, \n     was a settled precedent not subject to reconsideration. \n     Justice Scalia refused to answer with the yes or no my \n     question deserved. He acknowledged only that Marbury was a \n     pillar of our system and then said: Whether I would be likely \n     to kick away Marbury v. Madison given not only what I just \n     said but also what I have said concerning my respect for the \n     principle of stare decisis, I think you will have to judge on \n     the basis of my record as a judge in the court of appeals, \n     and your judgment as to whether I am, I suppose, on that \n     issue sufficiently intemperate or extreme. In effect, Justice \n     Scalia was saying that a nominee who kicked the legs out from \n     under Marbury should be considered intemperate or extreme and \n     hence presumably denied appointment by the Senate and yet he \n     would not forthrightly rule out the possibility of \n     overturning Marbury. Nor can the Committee accept a statement \n     like Clarence Thomas's in 1991 that he did not have an \n     opinion as to whether Roe was properly decided and, more \n     remarkably still, could not recall ever even having a \n     conversation about it.\n       It is not just the nominees of Republican Presidents, of \n     course, who have withheld their substantive views from the \n     Judiciary Committee. Every nominee since Robert Bork has done \n     so. In her 1995 law review article on the confirmation \n     process, the current nominee to the Court, Elena Kagan, \n     highlighted the testimony of President Clinton's two Supreme \n     Court appointments, Justices Ginsburg and Breyer to show what \n     was wrong with confirmation hearings. (Elena Kagan, \n     Confirmation Messes, Old and New, University of Chicago Law \n     Review, 62 University of Chicago Law Review 919, 935 (1995)). \n     Justice Ginsburg refused to answer even as simple a question \n     as to whether the Korean War was, in fact, a war, just as \n     Justice Souter had done over a decade earlier. Justice \n     Breyer, to quote Solicitor General Kagan, declined to answer \n     not merely questions concerning pending cases, but questions \n     relating in any way to any issue that the Supreme Court might \n     one day face. And as I have already noted, Justice Sotomayor, \n     whose confirmation I supported, was even less forthcoming \n     with her views than her two immediate predecessors Chief \n     Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. Numerous commentators \n     supportive of her nomination share my assessment.\n       And of course, a nominee's testimony must not be the final \n     word. A nominee's testimony should be evaluated, as Professor \n     Laurence Tribe testified during the Alito confirmation \n     hearing, not as though it were burned onto a blank CD to be \n     evaluated on its own, but\n\n[[Page S4599]]\n\n     against an extensive backdrop of the nominee's pre-hearing \n     record.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on a subject that has \ncertainly had a lot of press coverage, and that is the trip by the \nArizona Governor to Washington to speak with the President about the \nimmigration issue in Arizona, recent legislation that was passed, and \nwhat we can do to secure the border. Something caught my eye in the \nCongress Daily which I want to quote and discuss.\n  The article is entitled ``Arizona Gov. Pushes for Obama's Help.'' It \nwas dated Thursday, June 3, and it talked about the meeting between the \nGovernor and the President. It says they didn't appear to come to any \nagreements, and then it reads:\n\n       White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said that both \n     sides expressed their viewpoints, with Obama stressing that \n     border security must be coupled with comprehensive \n     immigration reform.\n\n  Why is that? Why is securing the border being held hostage to \ncomprehensive immigration reform? The President has a responsibility \nand we have a responsibility to enforce our laws. That includes \nsecuring our border. So why does the President insist we are not going \nto secure the border until we have comprehensive immigration reform?\n  The reality is, if we do secure the border, it will be easier for \nCongress to pass comprehensive reform, because people will then \nunderstand that the Federal Government is serious about securing the \nborder. They don't believe that today. With articles such as this, why \nshould they? In effect, the President is saying: We are not going to \nsecure the border until we have comprehensive reform.\n  We don't need comprehensive reform to secure the border, and I submit \nwe do need to secure the border for comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I have talked a lot on this floor--and so has Senator McCain--about \nefforts to secure the border and the different segments of the border. \nIn the State of Arizona, there are two segments. One is called the Yuma \nsector and the other is called the Tucson sector. The Yuma sector has \nbasically been secured in terms of illegal immigration. There is still \na lot of illegal drugs crossing in that sector. They are working on \nthat. The Tucson sector is not secure in terms of illegal immigration \nor drug smuggling. In fact, about half of all illegal immigration comes \nthrough the Tucson sector.\n  Why is the Yuma sector pretty well secured and the Tucson sector not? \nThere are a variety of reasons. First, the Yuma sector pretty much \ncompleted the fencing, particularly in the urban area there, the double \nfencing that has enabled the Border Patrol to apprehend illegal \nimmigrants who try to cross. Secondly, there is an adequate number of \nBorder Patrol agents. Third, in the Yuma sector, there is a program \ncalled Operation Streamline, the essence of which is, instead of catch \nand release, where illegal immigrants are apprehended and then returned \nto the border in a bus, these illegal immigrants are taken to court and \nprovided a lawyer. But the reality is, almost all of them end up \npleading to having crossed the border illegally, and they spend at \nleast 2 weeks in jail. About 17 percent of the people are criminals. \nObviously, they don't want to do this so they don't cross in that area \nanymore. The rest want to come work and make money so they can send it \nback to their families. They obviously can't do that while they are \nserving time in jail. The net result is that there is a big deterrent \nto crossing in the Yuma sector. If they cross there, they go to jail. \nSo they cross somewhere else.\n  If we had a similar operation in other segments of the border, it \nappears to me we could go a long way toward having operational control \nof the border.\n  The reality is, we can secure the border. I know there are some on \nthe other side who believe if we secured the border, then there would \nbe less incentive for Republicans to support comprehensive immigration \nreform. Think of that. That is holding national security, border \nsecurity, hostage to passing a bill in Congress. That should not be. We \nhave a job to secure the border. We should do that irrespective of \nwhether Congress then passes comprehensive reform.\n  I remind my colleagues that in 2007, I helped to draft, along with \nSenator Kennedy, the legislation we brought to the floor. \nUnfortunately, it was not successful. It was opposed by both \nRepublicans and Democrats. It was supported by both Republicans and \nDemocrats. In the end, it didn't have the votes to pass. The point is, \nthere were many on our side of the aisle as well as the other side who \nwere willing to draft and support legislation for comprehensive reform. \nIt is not true to say that if we secure the border, many of us will, \ntherefore, not have an incentive to support comprehensive reform.\n  The American people don't believe the Federal Government is serious \nabout securing the border. They are not going to support comprehensive \nreform until they see some seriousness on the part of the Federal \nGovernment. When we hear comments such as those from Robert Gibbs, who \nsays the President stressed that border security must be coupled with \ncomprehensive immigration reform, I say the American people are \napparently right. The Federal Government--at least the President--does \nnot appear to be serious about enforcing the laws at the border and \nsecuring the border. Otherwise, he wouldn't couple that with a \nrequirement that we have to pass comprehensive reform. We are not going \nto pass comprehensive reform this year for a variety of reasons. That \nis a fact. But that doesn't mean we can't secure the border. Indeed, we \nshould.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4599-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4599-S4600]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOB CREATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an editorial in the \nWall Street Journal. I ask unanimous consent that this June 4 editorial \ntitled ``Employers on Strike'' be printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. It begins with this comment which caught my eye:\n\n       It's too bad we can't do the Census every year, because \n     maybe the U.S. economy would then show some jobs growth.\n\n  That is pretty interesting. The reason is because of the news last \nweek that was greeted with some degree of concern by folks on Wall \nStreet and elsewhere. Despite the fact that we created a net total of \n431,000 jobs in May, 411,000 of those were temporary Census hires. Yes, \nwe created a lot of jobs by hiring temporary Census workers, but those \nare not private-sector, permanent jobs. That is what we should be \ndoing.\n  This article notes that:\n\n       The private economy--that is, the wealth creation part, not \n     the wealth redistribution part--gained only 41,000 jobs, down \n     sharply from the encouraging 218,000 in April, and 158,000 in \n     March.\n\n  The point being that these temporary Census jobs are not our ticket \nto economic recovery. These are temporary, government, and they do not \nadd to the employment base that produces wealth.\n  It is interesting that those who supported the stimulus package, \nwhich cost $862 billion, said there was an economic factor here called \nthe Keynesian multiplier effect, that somehow a dollar in government \nspending was supposed to produce a dollar and a half in economic \noutput. This is truly the creation of something out of nothing or, more \naccurately, taking a dollar out of the private sector and somehow \ncreating a dollar and a half worth of value. It turns out it didn't \nhappen. It never does. This is very fuzzy thinking. We cannot take \nmoney out of the private sector and expect that it is going to somehow \nmultiply an economic output or job creation factor, when the government \nspends the money. That is $862 billion that has been taken out of the \nproductive private sector.\n  What happens? We either have to borrow it, which makes it harder for \nthe\n\n[[Page S4600]]\n\nprivate sector to borrow money, or we have to tax the private sector, \nthereby reducing the private sector's ability to create jobs in the \nfuture. The bottom line, as this editorial notes:\n\n       Almost everything Congress has done in recent months has \n     made private businesses less inclined to hire new workers.\n\n  That problem is exacerbated by the bill which we take up tomorrow. \nThis is the so-called jobs bill. It is a bill which will cost $116 \nbillion. It will add $54 billion to our national debt. It will further \nweaken the private sector's ability to create jobs.\n  As this Wall Street Journal editorial notes:\n\n       It's too bad we can't do the Census every year, because \n     maybe the U.S. economy would then show some job growth.\n\n  That is being facetious, obviously. Those are not the kind of jobs \nthat will productively create economic growth, because they are not in \nthe private sector. They are simply temporary. I hope as we debate the \nbill over the course of the next several days, the so-called stimulus, \nwe can get away from this notion that somehow or other if we take money \nout of the productive part of our economy and have the government spend \nit, that somehow or other, magically, that is going to help engineer \neconomic recovery. It doesn't. Instead what we have is an economic \nrecovery that is exceedingly slow and will be more so, the more \nregulation and taxation we impose on our private sector.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, June 4, 2010]\n\n                          Employers on Strike\n\n       It's too bad we can't do the Census every year, because \n     maybe the U.S. economy would then show some jobs growth. That \n     quip was one of the rueful asides we heard yesterday as \n     Americans learned that the economy created a net total of \n     431,000 new jobs in May, including 411,000 temporary Census \n     hires.\n       The private economy--that is, the wealth creation part, not \n     the wealth redistribution part--gained only 41,000 jobs, down \n     sharply from the encouraging 218,000 in April, and 158,000 in \n     March. The unemployment rate did fall to 9.7% from 9.9%, but \n     that was mainly because the labor force contracted by \n     322,000. Millions of Americans, beyond the 15 million \n     Americans officially counted as unemployed, have given up \n     looking for work.\n       Worst of all, nearly half of all unemployed workers in \n     America today (a record 46%) have been out of work for six \n     months or more. Normally job growth accelerates during the \n     early stages of an economic rebound, but this dismal report \n     suggests that the recovery remains well short of becoming a \n     typical expansion.\n       There were some slivers of good news in the May jobs \n     report. For those who have jobs, the average work week rose \n     by 0.1 hours to 34.2 hours and earnings nudged upward by \n     0.3%. Manufacturers added 29,000 workers, and their hours \n     worked jumped 5.1%, the best since 1983.\n       Perhaps this is what White House chief economist Christina \n     Romer was looking at yesterday when she cited ``encouraging \n     developments'' in the jobs market and ``continuing signs of \n     labor market recovery.'' We doubt this was the private \n     reaction in the Oval Office, whose occupant was told by Ms. \n     Romer and economic co-religionist Jared Bernstein that the \n     February 2009 stimulus would kick start a recovery in growth \n     and jobs. Whatever happened to the great neo-Keynesian \n     ``multiplier,'' in which $1 in government spending was \n     supposed to produce 1.5 times that in economic output?\n       Imagine if Ms. Romer had instead promised in 2009 that \n     Congress could spend nearly $1 trillion, and 16 months later \n     the unemployment rate would be nearly 10% and that more than \n     2.5 million additional Americans would be without jobs. Would \n     Congress have still spent the cash? Well, sure, Congress will \n     always spend what it can get away with, but the American \n     public would have turned against the stimulus even faster \n     than it has.\n       The multiplier is an illusion because that Keynesian $1 has \n     to come from somewhere in the private economy, either in \n     higher taxes or borrowing. Its net economic impact was \n     probably negative because so much of the stimulus was handed \n     out in transfer payments (jobless benefits, Medicaid \n     expansions, welfare) that did nothing to change incentives to \n     invest or take risks. Meanwhile, that $862 billion was taken \n     out of the more productive private economy.\n       Almost everything Congress has done in recent months has \n     made private businesses less inclined to hire new workers. \n     ObamaCare imposes new taxes and mandates on private \n     employers. Even with record unemployment, Congress raised the \n     minimum wage to $7.25, pricing more workers out of jobs. The \n     teen unemployment rate rose to 26.4% in May, and for those \n     between the ages of 25 and 34 it rose to 10.5%. These should \n     be some of the first to be hired in an expansion because they \n     are relatively cheap and have the potential for large \n     productivity gains as they add skills.\n       The ``jobs'' bill that the House passed last week expands \n     jobless insurance to 99 weeks, while raising taxes by $80 \n     billion on small employers and U.S-based corporations. On \n     January 1, Congress is set to let taxes rise on capital \n     gains, dividends and small businesses. None of these are \n     incentives to hire more Americans.\n       Ms. Romer said yesterday that to ``ensure a more rapid, \n     widespread recovery,'' the White House supports ``tax \n     incentives for clean energy,'' and ``extensions of \n     unemployment insurance and other key income support programs, \n     a fund to encourage small business lending, and fiscal relief \n     for state and local governments.'' Hello? This is the failed \n     2009 stimulus in miniature.\n       It's always a mistake to read too much into one month's \n     jobs data, and we still think the recovery will lumber on. \n     But if Ms. Romer wants this to be more than a jobless \n     recovery, she and her boss should drop their government-\n     creates-wealth illusions and start asking why so many private \n     employers remain on strike.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nArizona. There is no one more thoughtful on finance matters and job \ncreation than he. He has made a very important point. It was a well-\nintentioned effort by the administration to say: We have an economic \nrecession so we need to stimulate the economy through some government \nspending. There were proposals on the Republican side to do that to a \nmuch lesser extent. But what has happened is, as the Senator has \npointed out, the focus has been much too heavily on creating more \ngovernment jobs, when what we need is an environment for job growth in \nthe private sector. In fact, as the Senator from Arizona pointed out, \nthe actions the government has taken over the last year during this \ngreat recession too often make it harder to create jobs in the private \nsector.\n  The health care bill taxes job creators and investors. Those are the \nones who create the jobs. The stimulus package runs up the debt. The \nhigher the debt goes, the more money it sucks out of the system, and \nthe harder it is to get money and to create jobs. The financial \nregulation bill makes credit harder to get on Main Street, as we now \nsee it going through the Congress. If you can't get credit, you can't \ncreate a job.\n  Jobs are at the front of everyone's mind. Our friend, the former \nGovernor from Virginia, is here. He knows this very well. The Governor \nof Tennessee, Phil Bredesen, said the other day that in my State, if he \nhad 100 conversations, 95 would be about jobs. I agree. But clearly a \nfundamental difference of opinion we seem to have in the Senate is our \nfocus on creating an environment for job growth in the private sector. \nThe Democratic focus seems to me to be much more focused on creating \nmore government jobs. That is not working. Because if the economy \ncontinues to grow for the rest of the year at approximately the rate it \nhas grown for the first part of the year, we will end the year with 10 \npercent unemployment. As we all know, that burden falls most heavily on \nlower income Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4600-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4600-S4601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OILSPILL RESPONSE\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on what I call an \noilspill response for grownups. The tragic gulf oilspill has produced \noverreaction, demagoguery, and bad policy. I would cite ``Obama's \nKatrina, end offshore drilling, produce 20 percent of our electricity \nfrom windmills'' as three examples of overreaction, demagoguery, and \nbad policy. None of these options helps clean up and move forward a \ncountry using 25 percent of the world's energy, as the United States \ndoes year-in and year-out.\n\n  If we Americans want both clean energy and a high standard of living, \nthen here are 10 steps for thoughtful grownups:\n  No. 1, figure out what went wrong and make it unlikely to happen \nagain. We do not stop flying after a terrible airplane crash, and we \nare not going to stop drilling offshore after this terrible spill. \nThirty percent of U.S. oil production and 25 percent of our natural gas \nproduction come from thousands of active wells in the Gulf of Mexico. \nWithout it, gasoline prices would skyrocket, and we would depend more \non tankers from the Middle East with worse safety records than American \noffshore drillers.\n  No. 2, learn a safety lesson from the U.S. nuclear industry. That \nlesson is accountability. For 60 years, reactors\n\n[[Page S4601]]\n\non U.S. Navy ships have operated without killing one sailor. Why? The \ncareer of a ship's commander can be ended by one mistake. Incidentally, \nthe number of deaths from nuclear accidents at U.S. commercial reactors \nis also zero.\n  No. 3, what was the President's cleanup plan and where were the \npeople and equipment to implement it? In 1990, after the Exxon Valdez \nspill, a new law passed by Congress required that the President \n``ensure'' the cleanup of a spill and have the people and equipment to \ndo it. That is what the law has said since 1990. President Obama \neffectively delegated this job to the spiller, BP. Is that the \nPresident's only real option today? If so, what should future \nPresidents have on hand for backup if the spiller of oil cannot \nperform?\n  No. 4, put back on the table more onshore resources for oil and \nnatural gas. Drilling in a few thousand acres along the edge of the 19 \nmillion-acre Alaska National Wildlife Refuge and at other onshore \nlocations would produce vast oil supplies. A spill on land could be \ncontained much more easily than 1 mile deep in water.\n  No. 5, electrify half our cars and trucks. This is an ambitious goal, \nbut it is the single best way to reduce U.S. oil consumption. \nElectrifying half our cars and trucks could cut our oil consumption by \nabout one-third, to about 13 million barrels of petroleum product a \nday. A Brookings Institution study says we can electrify half our cars \nand trucks without building one single new powerplant if we plug in our \ncars at night. Last week, Senator Dorgan, Senator Merkley, and I \nintroduced legislation to jump-start America's effort to electrify half \nour cars and trucks. This is a subject about which Republicans and \nDemocrats in the Senate agree.\n  No. 6, invest in energy research and development. This is another \nsubject about which Republicans and Democrats in the Senate agree. A \ncost-competitive 500-mile battery would virtually guarantee eventual \nelectrification of half our cars and trucks. While we are at it, \nreducing the cost of solar power by a factor of 4 would be a good \nresponse to a clean energy challenge, as would finding a way for \nutilities to actually make money from the CO2 their coal \nplants produce.\n  No. 7, stop pretending wind power has anything to do with reducing \nAmerica's dependence on oil. Windmills generate electricity, not \ntransportation fuel. Wind has become the energy pet rock of the 21st \ncentury, as well as a taxpayer ripoff. According to the Energy \nInformation Administration, wind produces only 1.3 percent of U.S. \nelectricity but receives Federal taxpayer subsidies 25 times as much \nper megawatt hour as subsidies for all other forms of electricity \nproduction combined. Wind can be a useful energy supplement, but it has \nnothing to do with ending our dependence on oil.\n  No. 8, if we need more green electricity, build nuclear plants. This \nis another subject upon which Republicans and Democrats agree. The 100 \ncommercial nuclear plants we already have produce 70 percent of our \npollution-free, carbon-free electricity. Yet the United States has not \nbroken ground on a new reactor in 30 years, while China starts one \nevery 3 months and France is 80 percent nuclear. We would not put our \nnuclear navy in mothballs if we were going to war. We should not put \nour nuclear plants in mothballs if we want low-cost, reliable green \nenergy.\n  Finally, Nos. 9 and 10.\n  No. 9, focus on conservation. In the region where I live, the \nTennessee Valley Authority could close four of its dirtiest coal plants \nif we residents of the TVA region reduced our per capita use of \nelectricity just to the national average.\n  No. 10, make sure liability limits are appropriate for spill damage. \nThe Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, funded by a per-barrel fee on \nindustry, should be adjusted to pay for cleanup and to compensate those \nhurt by spills. An industry insurance program like that of the nuclear \nindustry is also an attractive model to consider.\n  So I offer this afternoon these 10 grownup steps--grownup steps \nforward that could help turn a tragic event into a stronger America.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4601-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4601-S4602]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           OILSPILL CLOSES IN\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, my worst fears are coming true. \nThe wind that had so blessed us in our State of Florida for going on 7 \nweeks now shifted a few days ago, and this big spill of oil is moving \nto the east and to the northeast, and it is closing in on the gulf \ncoast, the northwest gulf coast of Florida.\n  Thus far, most of the more concentrated oil is well off shore. Under \nthe command of the Coast Guard, there are skimmers 25 to 50 miles out \nfrom the coast that have a boom that goes out from a fairly decently \nsized ship that then scoops up that oil into a concentrated area. Then \nthey have what is kind of like a vacuum pump. It is almost like a \nvacuum cleaner. It sits and floats on top of the water, on top of the \noil, and it sucks it up into a pipe, and that goes into a tank or a \nrubber bladder on top of the ship. Thus far, they have been able to \ntake care of a good bit of that oil.\n  Of course, that is the strategy--to keep the oil offshore; don't let \nit get to shore because when it does, it messes up your beach and, even \nworse, it messes up the wetlands. As a matter of fact, when oil gets \ninto wetlands, into marsh grass, into mangroves, you have a problem. \nMore than likely, it is going to take a while for that marsh grass to \ncome back. Mangroves and oil do not mix. Of course, then we are talking \nabout these unique estuaries that spawn so much of our marine life in \nthe Gulf of Mexico. So what we have is a nightmare that potentially is \ncoming to reality.\n  There are a lot of people who are working awfully hard. The Coast \nGuard is working hard, but right now the Coast Guard is stretched to \nthe limit. There are only so many Coastguardsmen. They still have to do \nall the things the Coast Guard has to do all over the world, including \nthe gulf coast. They still have to do rescue. They still have to do \nsearch missions. Down in south Florida, we still have to have the Coast \nGuard there going after the drug runners. So there is a limited amount \nwe can have. As good as those men and women are, they are stretched to \nthe limit. They are going around the clock.\n  As the oil continues to gush, this problem is going to become more \nand more acute. It could become acute in a number of ways. We are being \ntold--and I can certainly say this Senator has become a skeptic about \nwhat is correct information. Remember when we were told it was only \n1,000 barrels of oil a day that was gushing into the gulf? A couple of \nweeks later, that was revised to 5,000 barrels of oil a day, and then \nthat was revised to 12,000, but the report was omitted that said it \ncould be as high as 25,000.\n  Now we are told that this attempt called the top hat; that is, an \nattempt to put a cap on the top of that blowout preventer where they \ncut off the riser pipe, and the oil is going up to the surface to a \ntanker--they are saying that is now 10,000 barrels a day, but look at \nthe live video and see how much of it is still gushing outside of that \ntop hat.\n  So how much is going into the gulf? Well, if it is 25,000 barrels a \nday, if that is the accurate figure, there is still 15,000 barrels of \noil a day going into the gulf. And if it keeps going--and the Coast \nGuard admiral said yesterday it is going to go until September, until \nthey can get the relief wells down and try to plug it with cement down \nnear the oil reservoir, which is some 18,000 feet below the seabed. If \nit keeps gushing that amount all the way to September, it will be close \nto the largest oilspill there has ever been on planet Earth in the sea, \nwhich was the Ixtoc in the Bay of Campeche spill that spewed for 10 \nmonths. By the way, it was only in 150 feet of water, and they couldn't \nget it stopped. This is in 5,000 feet of water.\n\n[[Page S4602]]\n\n  If I sound a little distressed and frustrated, it is that I am \nbecause this Senator is reflecting the feelings of his people.\n  What about the fishermen--those fishermen who have offered to use \ntheir boats for BP but have not been contracted to use them, but they \ncan't use their boats because the waters are closed or even if the \nwaters are not closed, the fish houses won't buy their fish because \nfish houses from all over the country are calling in and saying: We \ndon't want your gulf fish; we think it is tainted.\n  What about those charter boat captains, in the height of the season, \nsummer, on the gulf coast of Florida? Those boat captains don't have \nthe recreational fishermen coming and chartering their boats to go out \nbecause over a third of the gulf is closed, and for the same reasons--\nthey are worried about the fish. Are they getting hired by BP? Why are \nthey hiring people from Tennessee and Arkansas and North Carolina with \nboats? Why aren't they hiring the Florida fishermen whose livelihoods \nhave vanished?\n  I am expressing some of the frustration my people are expressing to \nme.\n  What about the poor hotel owners? They are at the height of the \nseason. It starts Memorial Day and goes all the way to Labor Day. What \nabout them? What about the restaurants that are in the height of the \nseason? We hope people will come, because the beaches are still some of \nthe most beautiful in the world. But the fact that they now see these \nsilver-dollar-size tar balls--in some cases, hamburger-patty-size tar \nballs--that are all over the beach, are they still going to come and \nhonor their reservation at the hotel? Will they go to the local \nrestaurant? And if they do go there, will they order the local seafood?\n  There are a lot of frustrated folks. By the way, Mr. President, the \nPresiding Officer is the former chief executive of his State. What \nabout the local and State revenues? The State of Florida doesn't have \nan income tax. The State of Florida has a sales tax. The sales tax--if \npeople are not staying in hotel rooms, and they are not buying meals in \nrestaurants, and if they are not buying down at the local stores, the \nrevenue is starting to dip. What is going to happen to the budgets of \nthe local and the State governments and the revenues they come to \nexpect?\n  In the midst of all of this, we hear that BP says it will be \naccountable. Yet, we come out here on this floor--Senator Menendez, \nSenator Lautenberg, and I--and ask unanimous consent that in order to \neliminate the artificially low cap of $75 million on liability for \neconomic losses, there is always an oil State Senator who will stand up \nand object to our consent request to raise this artificially low cap. \nBP says it is going to, in fact, take care of legitimate expenses. But \nat the same time, BP was quick to point out in hearings that have gone \non for several weeks--and certainly the nine hearings this week will go \non--it will point out that there is a certain responsibility of the \noperator of the rig, Transocean, and the operator of putting the cement \ndown into the well, around the casing that was supposed to be set, but \nobviously was imperfect--that operator was Halliburton.\n  So, in effect, what we are going to have, and already have, is people \npointing both ways. There are going to be so many lawsuits that will go \non by the time they get to the bottom of this. And the investigation is \ngoing to go on for so long. In the meantime, what about our people and \ntheir livelihoods? What are they going to do?\n  I was told by the fishermen that you have to have 14 days in which to \nactually send in the requisition after you have done your work, once \nyou have been signed up, and you then expect to be paid within 14 days \nafter you submitted your request for payment. Plus 14 is 28, so where \nis the fisherman going to get any money within that month in order to \npay his deckhands, his assistants, and to pay his bills? It can \ncontinue to multiply. You wonder why I sound frustrated? There is so \nmuch uncertainty and people are scared.\n  In the meantime, BP indeed has given some money for an advertising \ncampaign--and that is a good thing--for Florida to run advertisements \nto say that our beaches are open, come on. But you know the reality of \nwhat they are hearing. I hope people will, because I can tell you those \ntar balls that are there--if people will get out there and clean it \nup--oh, by the way, it has to be an appropriately recognized group to \ngo out and clean up the tar balls contracted by BP. Why can't we get \nour local governments to go out there and get those tar balls off the \nbeach, so our guests and visitors can enjoy our God-given assets?\n  All of these are questions that are still to be answered. So I am \ngoing to try several times with my colleagues to continue to get this \nartificially low cap raised so it will send a message to any oil \ncompany that in the future you better not cut corners. You better not \nhave that cozy, incestuous relationship with the government regulator \nyou have had for the last two decades. You better not think you are \ngoing to influence the government regulator as you have--as has been \nstated by the inspector general's report in 2008--with sex, drugs, \nbooze, gifts, trips. And the revolving door, as stated by the most \nrecent IG report last month--the revolving door, where they come out of \nthe industry, the door revolves, and they come in as the MMS, the \nMinerals Management Service, the government regulator; and then the \ndoor revolves and they go right back into the employ of the oil \nindustry. That is a conflict of interest. That is not government \noversight of an industry, and it has led to this circumstance, where \nthree apparatuses did not work as back-up mechanisms on the blow-out \npreventer, and it has led to the sad condition that we now have, where \noil is gushing, and has been for 49 days, into the Gulf of Mexico and \nis ruining a culture and a way of life.\n  I want to say that the Presiding Officer's State is not immune, and \nthe other Senator on the floor right now, his State--an Atlantic coast \nState as well--is not immune, because, sadly, sooner or later the winds \nare going to continue to carry this oilspill to the South. It is going \nto get in what is known as the Loop Current and some of it is already \nentrained in the Loop Current.\n  The Loop Current goes up into the northern Gulf of Mexico and loops \nback South, all the way down around the Florida Keys, and it becomes \nthe gulf stream. It then moves North as the gulf stream up the coast of \nFlorida, off the Keys. It then comes in and hugs the southeast coast of \nFlorida quite close--very close--mostly in places less than a mile off \nthe beach. It continues on up to the middle of the peninsula of \nFlorida, and then it takes a turn to the Northeast and parallels the \neast coast of the United States. It goes up to Cape Hatteras, NC, and \ndepending on winds, I would say to the two Senators who are hearing my \nwords, even though that current, called the gulf stream, that goes off \nof Cape Hatteras across the Atlantic to Scotland--depending on winds \nand wave action, it can carry some of that oil to the rest of the \nAtlantic seaboard and to the States represented by the two very \ndistinguished Senators here on the floor. So this could have profound \neffects.\n  The question is, how do we get it stopped and, thus far, nothing has \nhappened. So I think it is time for all hands on deck. I think it is \ntime to realize that we have to throw in every asset we have to try to \nkeep this oil off the coast, and especially out of the wetlands, and \ndon't let what happened to Louisiana happen to the rest of our States, \nespecially those delicate wetlands where you cannot get oil out of \nthem. Then maybe this nightmare will be over.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4602-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4602-S4603]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nominations \nconcurrently, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nominations of Audrey Goldstein \nFleissig, of Missouri, to be United States District Judge for the \nEastern District of Missouri; Lucy Haeran Koh, of California, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of California; \nand Jane E. Magnus-Stinson, of Indiana, to be United States District \nJudge for the Southern District of Indiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the nominations will \nbe debated concurrently until 5:30 p.m. with the time equally divided \nand controlled between the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy, and the \nSenator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is interesting, as the distinguished \nPresiding Officer reported, that we are going to have these nominees. I \nsay it is interesting because the Senate is being allowed to confirm \nonly 3 of 19 judicial nominations that have been reported unanimously \nby the Senate Judiciary Committee over the past several months, but \nthey have been stalled by the Republican leadership.\n  The distinguished Presiding Officer is one of the most valued members \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee. He has seen time and time again, we \nvote a nominee out, with every single Republican voting for the person \nand every single Democrat voting for the person. Then the nominee \nspends months waiting because they are being stalled by the Republican \nside of the aisle.\n  Of course, it is far more than just an annoyance to the nominees who \nare being stalled. Say, for instance, that someone receives a \nnomination from the President of the United States to become a judge. \nPerhaps they are in a law firm. The partners all come in, congratulate \nthe nominee, and say: This is absolutely wonderful. When are you \nleaving?\n  Now, as a practical matter this person cannot take on new cases, and \nthe law firm has to be hesitant about what they take on so they do not \nhave a conflict of interest later on before the Court. One can see how \nalmost childish it becomes now to hold up a nominee who, eventually, \nwhen they are finally allowed to have a vote, will be confirmed \nunanimously or close to unanimously.\n  In the meantime, their lives have been disrupted, the judiciary \nitself is put in disarray, people question our judiciary which is \nsupposed to be nonpolitical, nonpartisan, and all of a sudden, looks as \nthough it is ping pong.\n  The nominees we have here, these three women, were confirmed in early \nMarch. The distinguished Presiding Officer and I were there. They all \nwere reported out without a single objection from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, in early March. Three exceptional women. And these three \nwomen have been delayed for this considerable period of time by the \nRepublican objections. There is no explanation; no excuse; no reason \nfor these months of delay of these women, especially when all members \nof the Senate Judiciary Committee, Democratic and Republican, voted for \nthese three women.\n  But they are just 3 of the backlog of 26 judicial nominees awaiting \nfinal Senate action, and 19 of the 26 were reported by the Judiciary \nCommittee without a single negative vote from any Republican or \nDemocratic Senator on the committee. This is not fair to the nominees, \ncertainly not fair to these three women. It is not fair to any of the \nother nominees. In addition, 6 of the 7 Republicans on the Committee \nvoted in favor of nominee Judge Wynn to the Fourth Circuit, and nearly \nhalf of the Republicans on the Committee supported the nomination of \nJane Stranch to the Sixth Circuit. It is not fair to these nominees and \nit is not fair to the Federal judiciary. Still Republicans refuse to \nenter into time agreements on these nominations. This stalling and \nobstruction is unprecedented.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace I set for President Bush's \njudicial nominees in 2001 and 2002. By this date in President Bush's \npresidency--and I was chairman at that time--the Senate had confirmed \n57 of his judicial nominees, both district court judges and courts of \nappeal.\n  Even after the three today will all be confirmed unanimously, the \ncomparison will stand at 28 to 57. That is still less than half of what \nwe were able to achieve by this date in 2002. I mention that because we \nhad a Democratic majority and a Republican President, and we were \ntreating President Bush's nominees far more fairly than they are \ntreating President Obama's nominees.\n  What makes it even worse than playing politics with the independent \njudiciary is that Federal judicial vacancies around the country hover \naround 100. It has been nearly a month since the Senate confirmed a \njudicial nominee. None of the more than two dozen available for \nconsideration before the Memorial Day recess were considered. This \nRepublican obstruction is unprecedented. This is not how the Senate \nshould act, nor how the Senate has conducted its business in the past. \nThis is new and this is wrong.\n  In May, just before the last recess, the Republican leader implied in \na statement before this body that the Republican obstruction is merely \na ``sequencing'' of judicial nominations that ``is acceptable to both \nsides''. That is not true.\n  Over the recess, I sent a letter to Senator McConnell and to the \nmajority leader concerning these matters. In that letter, I urge as I \nhave since last December, that the Senate schedule votes on judicial \nnominees without further obstruction and delays; vote them up or vote \nthem down. I called on Republican leadership to work with the majority \nleader to schedule immediate votes on consensus nominations--many of \nwhich I expect will be confirmed unanimously--and consent to time \nagreements on those which debate is requested. As I said in the letter, \nif there are judicial nominations that Republicans truly wish to \nfilibuster--after they argued during the Bush administration that such \nactions would be unconstitutional and wrong--then they should so \nindicate to allow the majority leader to seek cloture to end the \nfilibuster. Otherwise it is time to vote.\n  I would think that there should also be some respect for the \ncommittee where every single Republican and every single Democrat voted \nfor them. Vote for them. Vote up or vote down. We are not elected to \nvote ``maybe.'' There are only 100 of us for 300 million Americans, and \nthe American people expect us to say ``yes'' or say ``no,'' not \n``maybe.'' This delay is a big ``maybe.'' It is wrong. It is unfair to \nthese judicial nominees. It is unfair to the independence of the \nFederal judiciary. It is unfair to the people of America. It is \ncertainly unprecedented in my 36 years here. I have never seen anything \nsuch as this.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of that letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Judiciary Committee unanimously reported the \nnomination of Judge Fleissig to the Eastern District of Missouri more \nthan three months ago, on March 4. She is currently a Federal \nmagistrate judge in that district, previously serving as that \ndistrict's U.S. Attorney, as an Assistant U.S. Attorney, and a civil \nlitigator. Judge Fleissig earned the highest possible rating--\nunanimously well qualified--from the ABA Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary. She has the support of both of her home state \nSenators, Republican Senator Kit Bond and Democratic Senator Claire \nMcCaskill.\n\n[[Page S4604]]\n\n  Judge Lucy Koh is nominated to fill a vacancy on the Northern \nDistrict of California determined by the Administrative Office of the \nU.S. Courts to be a judicial emergency. Judge Koh's nomination was \nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee by voice vote with no \ndissent on March 4, more than three months ago. If confirmed, she will \nbe the first Korean American woman in the Nation to serve as a Federal \njudge. In addition, she would become the first Asian American to serve \non the district court bench in the 150-year history of the Northern \nDistrict of California. Currently a judge on the Santa Clara County \nSuperior Court, Judge Koh previously practiced law at two Northern \nCalifornia firms and worked as a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles. She \nalso served in the U.S. Department of Justice and she worked for one \nyear as a fellow on the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee. Judge Koh has \nthe strong support of both her home state Senators, Senator Feinstein \nand Senator Boxer.\n  Judge Jane E. Magnus-Stinson has been nominated to the Southern \nDistrict of Indiana. If confirmed, Judge Magnus-Stinson will be the \nthird female district court judge in Indiana history. The Judiciary \nCommittee favorable reported her nomination, by unanimous consent, on \nMarch 11, nearly three months ago. Judge Magnus-Stinson is currently a \nFederal magistrate judge on the court to which she is now nominated. \nShe has 15 years of judicial experience, including 12 years as a judge \nin the major felony division of the Marion Superior Court in \nIndianapolis. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the \nFederal Judiciary unanimously rated Judge Magnus-Stinson well qualified \nto serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of \nIndiana. Judge Magnus-Stinson has the support of both home state \nSenators, Republican Senator Lugar and Democratic Senator Bayh.\n  I congratulate the three nominees who will finally be considered and \nconfirmed today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 2, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n\n       Dear Senate Leaders: I was very disappointed that in his \n     statement last Thursday evening about the lack of progress on \n     filling judicial vacancies Senator McConnell left the \n     impression that the halting pace of Senate consideration of \n     President's Obama's judicial nominations is merely a \n     ``sequencing'' of judicial nominations that ``is acceptable \n     to both sides.'' I do not think that is an accurate \n     description of what has led to only 12 Federal circuit and \n     district court nominees being considered all last year and \n     only 13 so far this year.\n       As you know, I have spoken to these matters a number of \n     times over the last several months and have since last \n     December been urging the Republican leadership to agree to \n     consider and approve the noncontroversial nominees and enter \n     into time agreements to debate those they believe require \n     Senate discussion, but to end the obstruction and unnecessary \n     delays.\n       As the Senate recessed for Memorial Day, there remained a \n     backlog of 26 judicial nominees awaiting final Senate action. \n     Nineteen of the 26 were reported by the Judiciary Committee \n     without a single negative vote from any Republican or any \n     Democratic Senator on the Committee. In my view the cause of \n     that backlog is Republican refusal to agree to consider these \n     nominations in a timely fashion. In addition, six of the \n     seven Republicans on the Committee voted in favor of Judge \n     Wynn to the Fourth Circuit, and nearly half the Republicans \n     on the Committee supported Jane Stranch's nomination to the \n     Fourth Circuit. I have been supporting Senator Alexander's \n     efforts to get Senate consideration of the Stranch nomination \n     for months.\n       The same is true of the two North Carolina nominees to the \n     Fourth Circuit supported by Senators Hagan and Burr. It is \n     Republican refusal to enter into time agreements on these \n     nominations that has preventing their consideration and \n     confirmation by the Senate. In all, 26 judicial nominations \n     are currently being stalled from consideration and \n     confirmation of which only three have been scheduled for \n     consideration next week.\n       Senate Republicans have only allowed the Senate to consider \n     25 Federal circuit and district court nominations during the \n     entire Obama presidency. The dozen considered in 2009 was the \n     lowest confirmation total in more than 50 years. The stalling \n     and obstruction is unprecedented.\n       The Senate is well behind the pace I set for President \n     Bush's judicial nominees in the second half of 2001 and \n     through 2002. By this date in President Bush's presidency, \n     the Senate had confirmed 57 of his judicial nominees. Despite \n     the fact that President Obama began sending us judicial \n     nominations two months earlier than President Bush had, the \n     Senate has only confirmed 25 of his Federal circuit and \n     district court nominees to date. The comparison is 25 to 57--\n     and this is while Federal judicial vacancies around the \n     country remain over 100 with 40 of those vacancies \n     categorized as ``judicial emergency vacancies'' by the \n     Administrative Office of the United States Courts.\n       During the 17 months that I chaired the Judiciary Committee \n     during President Bush's first two years in office, the Senate \n     confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. Rather than continue \n     that kind of cooperation, Senate Republicans have chosen to \n     delay consideration of virtually every judicial nominee of \n     President Obama's. Judge David Hamilton was unsuccessfully \n     filibustered. The Majority Leader was forced to file cloture \n     to get votes on the nominations of Judge Barbara Keenan and \n     Judge Denny Chin. Both were then confirmed unanimously by the \n     Senate. These are a few of the more than 20 nominations on \n     which the Majority Leader has had to file cloture in order to \n     secure a vote.\n       Before the Memorial Day recess in 2002, there were only six \n     judicial nominations reported by the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee left awaiting final consideration by the Senate and \n     they had all been reported within the last week before the \n     recess began. They were each confirmed promptly in the June \n     2002 work period. This year, by contrast, Senate Republicans \n     have stalled nominations reported as long ago as last \n     November and only one of the 26 was reported close to this \n     recess. More than two dozen judicial nominees have been \n     languishing without final Senate action because of Republican \n     obstruction. This is not how the Senate should act, nor how \n     the Senate has conducted its business in the past. This is \n     new and it is wrong.\n       The judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar \n     number 26. They were each considered and favorably reported \n     by the Senate Judiciary Committee after a hearing. They are \n     each still awaiting final Senate action because the \n     Republican leadership has refused for some time to agree to \n     their consideration. As I have consistently urged since last \n     December, the Senate should vote on all of them without \n     further obstruction or delay.\n       The way to do that is for the Republican leadership to work \n     with the Majority Leader and agree to time agreements on \n     those on which debate is requested. If there are judicial \n     nominations that Republicans truly wish to filibuster--after \n     arguing during the Bush administration that such action would \n     be unconstitutional and wrong--then they should so indicate \n     and the Majority Leader can proceed to that matter and seek \n     cloture to end the filibuster.\n       I again urge the Republican leadership, as I have \n     consistently since last December, to work with the Majority \n     Leader to take up and confirm the judicial nominees that are \n     not controversial and can be confirmed without further delay \n     by voice vote or a roll call and to enter into time \n     agreements on the others so that the Majority Leader can \n     schedule their consideration by the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Patrick Leahy,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be yielded \n5 minutes from Senator Sessions' time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I come today to the floor of the Senate \nto discuss the environmental and economic disaster that is happening \nright now with the oilspill from the British Petroleum and Transocean \nrig in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  This past weekend I had the opportunity to be in Pensacola, FL, and \nto walk on the beautiful beaches. The good news is, and the news that \nis not being reported as much as it is should be by the press, our \nbeaches are open, they are beautiful, people are out there enjoying the \nSun and the surf, and it is still safe to go to the beach. It is still \nsafe to go fishing in the Gulf of Mexico off the shores of Florida and \ndo all of the other things people enjoy doing in our beautiful State.\n  Unfortunately, we are starting to see oil wash up onshore. It is \nwashing up not in the form so much as a tar ball but sort of a goopy \nsubstance. We are spotting that on the beach. I have walked on the \nbeaches, and it is distressing to see that. When you pick it up and \ntouch it, it has sort of a pudding-like consistency. It obviously has \nthe touch and feel of oil.\n  The concern we have, as this disaster approaches day 50, is, how much \ncan this ecosystem bear? How much oil can be spewed into the water \nbefore it has a tremendously damaging impact upon the beaches in \nFlorida? We have already seen what it has done to the\n\n[[Page S4605]]\n\nmarshland of Louisiana. Florida has more than 1,200 miles of coastline \naround the State. Potentially, this oil could impact up to 1,000 miles \nif the oil gets itself into the Loop Current and makes its way around \nthe southern tip of Florida up the east coast. That is everyone's worst \nnightmare.\n  The good news is the people of Florida who are working in city \ngovernment, local government, and State government are doing an \nexcellent job to prepare. I had the opportunity to meet with Mayor Mike \nWiggins of Pensacola, with commission chairman Grover Robinson of the \nEscambia County Commission, as well as Larry Newsome, county \nadministrator, who are doing a great job of preparing. There are teams \nof people on the beaches picking up the oil and debris where needed. \nThey have folks on standby, ready to go to work if needed in western \nFlorida.\n  We need to do more. There needs to be a coherent plan on how we are \ngoing to prevent the oil from coming ashore and to mitigate its impact \nif and when it does. Tourism is tremendously important to Florida. In \nFlorida, our environment and economy are inextricably linked. We cannot \nhave any more damage than the State can sustain in the marsh or beach \nareas. We do not want oil washing up on the shore all along the coast \nof Florida.\n  I have called upon this administration to be more aggressive. I want \nto see the President in Florida. I want to see him more than just a \ncouple hours there. I want to see him working through the solutions \nlike Governor Jindal is doing in Louisiana, like Governor Crist is \ndoing in Florida, like former Governor Jeb Bush did when we had 9 or 10 \nhurricanes in 2004 and 2005--on the ground, managing through the \ncrisis, pushing people for solutions. It is not enough to have the good \nwork of the Coast Guard. And they are doing good work. It is not enough \nto call on the Department of Interior or the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We need the President on the ground pushing for those \nsolutions. He is a very bright man. He is the President of the United \nStates. If he is there, working through these problems the way the \nGovernors do, we will get better solutions.\n  We need more skimmers off the coast of Florida. I am sure my other \nGulf State friends would like to see skimmers as well. They prevent the \noil from coming ashore.\n  Are we thinking outside the box? Are we looking for every other \npossible alternative? Are there skimmers that can be brought in, large \nsupertanker skimmers such as were used in the Persian Gulf when they \nhad oilspills?\n  Who is leading the effort to push for new solutions and new ideas? \nWho is vetting all of the possible opportunities presented to clean up \nthe oil? We want to see this leadership from the top, from the \nCommander in Chief. The worst-case scenario is that none of the efforts \ngoing on right now are going to stop the oil from spilling. We have \nthis cap collector BP has put on. It is having some success. That is \ngood news. Let's hope it has all the success in the world. But if we \nhave to wait until the end of the summer for the relief wells to go \ninto effect--and what if they don't work as well as intended, what if \nthere are setbacks along the way, what if it is the fall--how many tens \nof thousands of barrels of oil are going to spill into the Gulf of \nMexico? What is the plan? What is being prepared?\n  We need to see the President show more leadership. The people of \nLouisiana, Texas, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida need that. While BP \nis at fault, this is not a BP problem; this is an American problem. We \nneed to see the President more thoroughly involved. The claims process \nhas already started. British Petroleum has paid out about $48 million. \nThere is now a claims process center in Pensacola. Senator Vitter and I \nhave put together a piece of legislation to expedite claims. That \nshould get passed by this body. There is a lot we can do here in \nWashington to help relieve the pain of our fellow Floridians and others \nin the gulf. Ultimately, job 1 is to stop the oil from spilling. Job 2 \nis to mitigate and prevent the oil from coming ashore. We want to see \nthe President of the United States leading the effort.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to spend a couple minutes \ntalking about Judge Audrey G. Fleissig, one of the nominees we will \nhopefully be voting on within the hour. This is a woman I have known \nfor many years who has an outstanding career in the legal community in \nMissouri. She was an assistant U.S. attorney in the Eastern District of \nMissouri and went on to be the first woman to hold the position of U.S. \nattorney in the Eastern District of Missouri. Currently, she serves as \nU.S. magistrate judge in the Eastern District.\n  I could go on about her background as a litigation attorney for 11 \nyears in one of the most respected law firms in Kansas City. I could \nspend some time talking about how much she loves to teach and how she \nhas been a trial advocacy teacher for a good deal of the last 20 years. \nShe has taught pretrial practice, trial advocacy, and now evidence at \nthe Washington University School of Law, one of the finest universities \nin the country. She was also a student intern to the Honorable Edward \nFilippine, who was a U.S. district judge in the Eastern District of \nMissouri 30 years ago. She has a J.D. degree, a Dean's Honor Scholar \nand an Order of the Coif from Washington University Law School and was \nmagna cum laude from Carleton College for her undergrad years.\n  She has been one of the stars of the legal community in Missouri, but \nshe has also been a mom. She has managed her career while she raised \nchildren, and her children are now in their twenties. I have such deep \nrespect for someone who has done well with the demands of a legal \ncareer and a judicial career and also done very well on the family \nfront.\n  She is somebody who believes very much that putting on a robe does \nnot mean one exits the community. We have a lot of judges who take that \nparticular attitude, especially on the Federal bench, that once they \nbecome a Federal judge, then they no longer participate in community \nactivities that are so important to the health and vibrancy of our \ncountry, our States, and certainly of our metropolitan areas.\n  When she worked with her children as they were growing up, she was \nvery active in their schools and tried to instill in them a love of \nreading. Now that her children are grown, she has for the last 10 years \nworked with Ready Readers, a charitable organization that works with \nlow-income preschool children, ages 3 to 5, to inspire them to want to \nread. Think about that. She is a U.S. magistrate with a full-time job, \nwith a prestigious black robe. With that kind of career, anyone could, \nfrankly, take a deep breath and say: I am here. Instead, she has spent \nthe last 10 years continuing to volunteer with a charitable \norganization that tries to inspire young children to love to read.\n  I have to tell the truth--this is the kind of person we need on the \nFederal bench. Will she be respectful to litigants? Of course. Will she \nunderstand the rules of evidence? She teaches them at one of the best \nlaw schools in the country. Does she understand the pressures of \nlitigation? Yes. She has been one. But most importantly, does she \nunderstand there are other needs in the community outside of what goes \non in the courtroom, and does that inform her as a judge? She will be \nfair. She will work extremely hard. She is known as one of the hardest \nworkers in the Federal courthouse in St. Louis.\n  It was an honor to recommend her to the President. I am so pleased \nthat she reaches this moment in her career where she can become a U.S. \nFederal district judge and provide the kind of atmosphere for justice \nthat we hold so dear in this Nation. I know she will be impartial. I \nknow she will never let politics dictate a decision. I know the law \nwill be her master and that she will listen carefully to the evidence \nand never think she knows best--let the litigants try their cases and \nlet the law reign supreme.\n  I am proud of her accomplishments. I am proud to support her. I have \na feeling she will be confirmed by a very wide margin. Don't ask me why \nshe\n\n[[Page S4606]]\n\nhad to sit around on the calendar for 60 days. I won't go into one of \nmy rants about secret holds. I will save that for another day. Today, I \nwill say it is time that we take this vote, and I make a prediction it \nwon't even be close because there is absolutely no reason this woman \nshould not have been on the bench months ago. I look forward to her \nconfirmation today.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor 5 minutes at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, there are so many issues on our plate this week: do \neverything in our power to work with our President to stop the oilspill \nin Louisiana, to rescue the fish and wildlife, to try to help the \nfishermen and the people who are so economically hurt by this, in my \nview, unnecessary tragedy. We are also working on jobs and the tax \nextenders bill which is so important so businesses can create jobs. So \nwe know we have a lot on our plate.\n  I take a couple of minutes to rise in support of a wonderful judicial \nnominee we will be voting on, Judge Lucy Koh. She has been nominated by \nthe President to the Northern District Court of California.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy and his committee for their work in approving \nthis highly qualified nominee, who will be an outstanding addition to \nthe Federal bench. I also thank my dear friend, Senator Feinstein, for \nher support of Judge Koh.\n  I was so proud to have recommended this nominee to President Obama. \nThis nominee was interviewed by my Northern District Judicial Advisory \nCommittee, and you can see, after you hear about her, why they were so \nclear she would make a great Federal judge.\n  Judge Koh is the daughter of two proud parents who risked much to \ncome to this country and provide for their children. Her mother escaped \nfrom North Korea at the age of 10 by walking for 2 weeks into South \nKorea--a dangerous trek that required her to hide from North Korean \nsoldiers along the way. Her father fought against the Communists in the \nKorean war and later immigrated to the U.S. of A. Her dad worked as a \nbusboy and a waiter in Maryland while attending Johns Hopkins \nUniversity, later bringing the rest of the family here.\n  Judge Koh is the first member of her family to be born in the United \nStates of America. It is a fantastic example of the great American \ndream that we try to protect here, hopefully, every day. Her family \nmoved to Mississippi, where her mother taught at Alcorn State \nUniversity--the Nation's first historically African-American land-grant \ncollege. During this time, Judge Koh was bused to a predominantly \nAfrican-American public school, where many of her classmates lived in \npoverty. Her childhood experiences provided inspiration for her to \npursue a career in the law and work for the NAACP Legal Defense Fund \nduring law school.\n  She attended Harvard-Radcliffe Colleges as a Harry S. Truman Scholar, \ngraduating magna cum laude. After college, she attended Harvard Law \nSchool, where she was awarded Best Brief in the school's moot court \ncompetition.\n  Judge Koh has had a diverse career in the practice of law that makes \nher uniquely qualified to serve as a Federal judge. She has worked in \npolicy, serving as a fellow for a subcommittee of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, and in policy positions at the Justice Department. She \nserved as a Federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, where she handled \nfinancial fraud, narcotics, public corruption, and violent crime cases. \nShe received awards for her work as a prosecutor, including a Sustained \nSuperior Performance Award and an award from then-FBI Director Louis \nFreeh for her prosecution of a $54 million securities fraud case.\n  She was a litigator in private practice prior to becoming a State \ncourt judge. During her time in private practice, Judge Koh worked on \ncomplex litigation matters involving securities and intellectual \nproperty, primarily appearing in Federal court. She led the trial and \nappellate team in the landmark intellectual property case In re \nSeagate, where a new legal standard was established.\n  With these credentials, it is easy to see why Governor Schwarzenegger \nappointed her to the California Superior Court in 2008, where she once \nagain excelled as a judge, handling a docket of both criminal and civil \ncases.\n  Today, she is poised to become the first Asian-American judge in the \nhistory of the Northern District of California. She will also become \nthe first Korean-American woman in U.S. history to serve as a Federal \njudge. A family's dream is poised to become a part of American history \nthis very day.\n  To Judge Koh and to her family, I extend my most heartfelt \ncongratulations on this important and historic day. I know I speak for \nmany Californians, especially those in the Korean and Asian-American \ncommunities, in expressing our great pride in her.\n  Support for Judge Koh is diverse. She has been endorsed by a wide \ngroup of supporters, such as our Governor and former Massachusetts \nRepublican Governor William Weld; former Presiding Judge Priscilla \nGallagher of the Santa Clara County Court; Santa Clara County District \nAttorney Delores Carr, Santa Clara County Sheriff Laurie Smith; former \nBush Office of Legal Policy Director Viet Dinh; the National Asian \nPacific American Bar Association; and the Asian American Justice \nCenter.\n\n  I close by congratulating Judge Koh and the other nominees and their \nfamilies, and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to vote to confirm \nthese nominees to the Federal bench.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to speak in favor of the \nnomination of Magistrate Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson. I joined together \nwith Senator Lugar to recommend Judge Magnus-Stinson because I know \nfirsthand that she is a highly capable lawyer who understands the \nlimited role of the Federal judiciary.\n  Before I speak to Judge Magnus-Stinson's qualifications, I would like \nto comment briefly on the state of the judicial confirmation process \ngenerally. In my view, this process has too often been consumed by \nideological conflict and partisan acrimony. This is not, I believe, how \nthe framers intended us to exercise our responsibility to advise and \nconsent.\n  During the last Congress, I was proud to work with Senator Lugar to \nrecommend Judge John Tinder as a bipartisan, consensus nominee for the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Tinder was nominated by \nPresident Bush and unanimously confirmed by the Senate by a vote of 93 \nto 0. It was my hope that Judge Tinder's confirmation would serve as an \nexample of the benefits of nominating qualified, nonideological jurists \nto the Federal bench.\n  In selecting Jane Magnus-Stinson, President Obama has demonstrated \nthat he also appreciates the benefits of this approach. I was proud to \nonce again join with Senator Lugar to recommend her to the President, \nand I hope that going forward other Senators will adopt what I call the \n``Hoosier approach'' of working across party lines to select consensus \nnominees.\n  I would also like to personally thank Senator Lugar for his \nextraordinary leadership and for the consultative and cooperative \napproach he has taken to judicial nominations. During my time in \nCongress, it has been my great privilege to forge a close working \nrelationship with Senator Lugar across many issues. This has been \nespecially true on the issue of nominations--when a judicial nominee \nfrom Indiana comes before the Senate, our colleagues can be confident \nthat the name is being put forward with bipartisan support, regardless \nof which political party is in the White House or controls a majority \nin the United States Senate.\n  On the merits, Jane Magnus-Stinson is an accomplished jurist who is \nwell-\n\n[[Page S4607]]\n\nqualified for a lifetime appointment to the federal judiciary. She has \nextensive trial experience, having served as a Judge on the Marion \nSuperior Court from 1995 to 2007. Judge Magnus-Stinson also has \nvaluable experience presiding in federal court, having served as a \nfederal Magistrate Judge in the Southern District of Indiana since \n2007.\n  During this time, she has been recognized as a leader among Indiana \njurists, serving on the Board of Directors of the Indiana Judicial \nConference and the Board of Managers of the Indiana Judges Association.\n  Judge Magnus-Stinson's devotion to the fair and efficient \nadministration of justice has been recognized by her fellow Hoosiers. \nShe has been honored as ``Judge of the Year'' by the Indiana Coalition \nAgainst Sexual Assault and as an ``Outstanding Judge'' by the Indiana \nCoalition Against Domestic Violence.\n  Judge Magnus-Stinson has also shown that she is deserving of the \npublic trust. She has demonstrated the highest ethical standards and a \nfirm commitment to applying our country's laws fairly and faithfully.\n  In recommending Judge Magnus-Stinson, I have the benefit of being \nable to speak from personal experience, as she served as my Counsel \nwhile I was Governor of Indiana.\n  If you ask Hoosiers about my eight years as Governor, you will find \nwidespread agreement that we charted a moderate, practical, bipartisan \ncourse. As my counsel, Jane Magnus-Stinson helped me craft bipartisan \nsolutions to some of the most pressing problems facing our state.\n  In addition to her insightful legal analysis, I could always count on \nJane for her sound judgment and her common-sense Hoosier values. Like \nmost Hoosiers, she is not an ideologue.\n  During her service in state government, Judge Magnus-Stinson also \ndeveloped a deep appreciation for the separation of powers and the \nappropriate role of the different branches of government. If confirmed, \nshe will also bring to the federal bench a special understanding of the \nimportant role of the States in our federal system and will be ever \nmindful of the proper role of the federal judiciary. She understands \nthat the appropriate role for a judge is to interpret our laws, not to \nwrite them.\n  As someone who personally knows and trusts Judge Magnus-Stinson, I \nsay to my colleagues that she is the embodiment of good judicial \ntemperament, intellect, and even-handedness. If confirmed, she will be \na superb addition to the federal bench. I am pleased to give her my \nhighest recommendation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me--and Senator Lugar--in supporting \nthis extremely well-qualified and deserving nominee.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support \nfor the nomination of California Superior Court Judge Lucy Koh to be a \nU.S. district judge for the Northern District of California.\n  Judge Koh is a well-respected lawyer and judge in California. Over \nthe course of her career, she has been a State trial judge, an \nintellectual property lawyer, a Federal prosecutor, and a counsel in \nCongress and the Justice Department.\n  For the last 2 years, she has been a superior court judge for Santa \nClara County and has adjudicated cases ranging from criminal \nprosecutions to commercial litigation matters to family law disputes.\n  She spent 8 years representing business clients as an intellectual \nproperty litigator at private law firms in Silicon Valley.\n  She spent 3 years prosecuting bank robberies, securities fraud, and \nother Federal crimes as an assistant U.S. attorney in southern \nCalifornia.\n  And she spent 4 years working in Washington as a special assistant to \nthe Deputy Attorney General and a counsel to the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  She has received the FBI Director's Award for demonstrated excellence \nin prosecuting a major criminal case and has been named one of the \n``Top 40 lawyers under 40'' by the Silicon Valley/San Jose Business \nJournal.\n  As a Judge, the reviews have been equally positive. California \nGovernor Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example, has called her ``an \nexemplary jurist with an unparalleled track record,'' and described her \napproach as ``careful and balanced.''\n  She is a talented woman with a solid background in the law. I commend \nSenator Boxer for recommending her for the district court and the \nPresident for nominating her. I have the utmost confidence that she \nwill serve the Northern District of California with distinction as a \nU.S. district judge.\n  Judge Koh's confirmation will also be a historic one for our Federal \ncourts.\n  If confirmed, Judge Koh will be the first Korean American woman ever \nto serve the United States as a Federal district judge, and she will be \nthe first Asian-American district judge appointed to the U.S. District \nCourt for the Northern District of California. This is a district that \nserves one of the Nation's largest populations of Asian Pacific \nAmericans, but for over 150 years there has not been a district judge \nof Asian Pacific descent on the court. Judge Koh will be the first, and \nher appointment is one for us all to celebrate. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport her.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I want to call attention to another \nnominee for this district court whom we unfortunately are not voting on \ntoday.\n  Magistrate Judge Edward Chen has also been nominated to be district \njudge for the Northern District of California. Here is the timeline:\n  The President first nominated Magistrate Judge Chen on August 6, \n2009. That was over 300 days ago.\n  The Judiciary Committee reported his nomination to the floor on \nOctober 15, 2009.\n  Although the nomination was pending for 70 days, it was never acted \non and there was not consent to allow the nomination to be carried over \ninto 2010.\n  On January 20, 2010, the President renominated Chen, and on February \n4, his nomination was reported out of the Judiciary Committee once \nagain. That was over 120 days ago. Still, he has not received a vote.\n  I find this extremely disappointing. In my 17 years on the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, I have voted against only one district court \nnominee. That was Leon Holmes. I had serious concerns about his views \non the role of women in society, and I explained my concerns in detail \nin a statement on the floor. I have not voted against any other \ndistrict court nominee.\n  Yet in just 17 months of the Obama administration, not one, not two, \nnot three, but four district court nominees have come out of committee \non straight party-line votes. And they are all still pending on the \nfloor. I think that is a very unfortunate direction for us to go in.\n  Look at the merits of the Chen nomination. I understand that some \nhave concerns because he spent time working for the American Civil \nLiberties Union before he became a magistrate judge. But this is a \nnominee with a proven track record. There is no need to ask how he will \nbe as a judge--the evidence is in.\n  Chen has spent 9 years as a magistrate judge and written over 200 \npublished opinions. There has not been a single objection in committee \nor on the floor to even one of his decisions.\n  In 2008, an impartial Federal Magistrate Judge Merit Selection Review \nPanel reviewed his full record. The Panel unanimously recommended him \nfor reappointment.\n  Federal prosecutors were ``uniformly positive'' about Chen and called \nhis rulings ``balanced'' and ``well reasoned.'' The local civil bar \ncalled him ``well prepared,'' ``very intelligent,'' and ``decisive.'' \nThe judgment was made--he is a very good judge.\n  I asked Republican-appointed U.S. district judges who work with Judge \nChen for their opinions. Again the comments were uniformly positive.\n  District Judge Lowell Jensen served as the No. 2 official in the \nReagan Justice Department. He called Chen ``an excellent jurist and a \nperson of high character'' and said Chen's decisions ``reflect not only \ngood judgment, but a complete commitment to the principles of fair \ntrial and the application of the rule of law.''\n  My own bipartisan selection committee in the Northern District \nreviewed Chen at length. He was their consensus choice for the district \ncourt. A bipartisan selection committee under the Bush administration \nalso recommended him. And the American Bar Association has unanimously \nrated him ``well qualified.''\n  So this is a nominee with a solid and publicly available track \nrecord. He has\n\n[[Page S4608]]\n\nstrong bipartisan support in the community he has been nominated to \nserve. And he has the support of his two home State Senators.\n  It is long past time for an up-or-down vote on his nomination.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote yes on the nomination of Judge Lucy Koh, \nand I also urge consent on a time agreement to let us move forward on \nthe nomination of Magistrate Judge Edward Chen.\n  Thank you so very much. I yield the floor, and I note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska.

All of us have just come back to the Senate after \na Memorial Day work period, where most of us were traveling our States, \nmeeting with people. I was in Toledo, Youngstown, Cleveland, and around \nmuch of my State.\n  While we have seen signs of recovery in Youngstown, in part because \nof the Recovery Act, in part because of where those dollars were \nabsolutely well spent on infrastructure, making this expansion \npossible, in part because of a\n\n[[Page S4609]]\n\ntrade decision the President of the United States made on the dumping \nof Chinese steel. In real terms--in real English--the dumping of \nChinese steel meant the Chinese were cheating. Now we have restored \ncompetitiveness to the market so that American companies, with very \nproductive American workers, can make steel and sell that steel at \ncompetitive prices.\n  We have seen an announced expansion and beginning of hiring in the \nauto industry, into the whole supply chain that leads into the \nautomotive industry that makes the components--the so-called Tier I and \nTier II suppliers. We have seen those signs of recovery. But if you are \nnot working or your cousin is not working or your wife has lost her job \nor your sister or brother isn't working, you know there are still too \nmany people who are hurting. We have not recovered, and we are not \nclose to it, but we are making progress, while those families continue \nto struggle.\n  Too many Americans are waiting for us to act and extend the \nunemployment insurance they earned and the COBRA insurance they need \nwhile they look for work. Let me talk about unemployment insurance for \na moment. It is not a vacation. It is not a whole lot of money people \nget. It is people who have lost their jobs and are looking for work. \nThey have to continue to look for work. They have to show the \nemployment bureau in their States--in new Hampshire, Ohio, wherever--\nthat they are continuing to look for work.\n  Unemployment insurance is insurance. It is not welfare. You pay in \nwhen you are working and you get some help when you are not working. \nBecause of the persistent unemployment caused by several years of bad \neconomic policy, tax cuts for the rich, deregulation of Wall Street, a \nwar that was not paid for--all the things that happened in the last \ndecade which led us to this terrible economy--we have to help those \nworkers who have lost their job through no fault of their own.\n  We have to help pay for COBRA; that is, helping to keep their health \ninsurance. It is more expensive than a mortgage for most people. How \nCOBRA works is, if you lose your job, you can keep your insurance if \nyou pay for your side of the insurance--the employee's side--and you \npay for the employer's contribution to your insurance. You have to pay \nboth. That is clearly expensive. If you lost your job, how would you do \nthat? You are going to be able to do that because of the Recovery Act.\n  The Congress and the President made a decision--with very few \nRepublicans voting for it, for whatever reason. They do not think these \npeople who are trying to keep their health insurance should be able to \nget help. But we were able to provide enough subsidy so that in my \nState tens of thousands of people--and I have met several dozen of \nthem--have been able to keep their health insurance as a result.\n  A laid-off mechanic, factory worker, electrician, engineer--ask them \nhow it feels to be out of a job. When I see my colleagues voting \nagainst unemployment benefits, the question I really want to ask is, Do \nyou know anybody who lost their job? Do you know anybody who really \nneeds this unemployment insurance? Have you really talked to somebody \nwho lost their health insurance and, with a little bit of help, could \ncontinue to keep their insurance through COBRA? Ask people in Ohio. Ask \nsomebody in Dayton who has lost a job in the auto industry. Ask \nsomebody in Chillicote who lost their job at a paper company. Ask \nsomebody in Springfield who lost their job at DHL, the cargo company--\nhow they live with the stress of job loss, compounded by the small \nnumber of job openings, if they exist at all, in or around their \ncommunities.\n  Unemployment insurance, as I said, is just that--it is insurance. \nWorkers pay into an insurance fund while they are working. They have a \nsafety net if they are unemployed, and there are requirements. Those \ncollecting unemployment checks are required to actively seek work.\n  I know people in my State. They come up to me when I do a townhall or \nroundtable meeting. Whether I am in Galion or Lima or St. Clairsville \nor Zanesville, people come up to me and say they send out 10 or 20 or \n30 resumes a week. Most of these resumes are not even answered because \nthe economy is far from fully recovered. We are making progress. We are \non track to recovery. We are not there yet. People are still out of \nwork in huge numbers.\n  I hear lectures from those who believe emergency spending should not \nbe used to help out-of-work Americans who lose their unemployment \ninsurance. Yet many people in this body have no problem giving away--\nextending tax credits, tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, \nsubsidizing the insurance companies, the drug companies, in the name of \nMedicare privatization, voting for a war. None of that was paid for. I \ndidn't hear my Republican colleagues saying: We can't do that; it is \ngoing to add to the deficit. We can't go to war. We can't raise taxes \nto pay for the war; it is going to contribute to the deficit.\n  They will vote for the Medicare privatization bill President Bush \nhad--a giveaway to the drug insurance companies. They didn't say: How \ndo you pay for it? They didn't say that. They didn't say we couldn't do \nthose things. It is only when it is unemployment insurance and COBRA, \nthings extending health insurance to people--it is only those things, \nand all of a sudden they are all concerned about the budget deficit.\n  I am concerned about the budget deficit too. One of the reasons I \nvoted against the Medicare giveaway to the drug insurance companies was \nbecause of the deficit. One of the reasons I voted against the Iraq \nwar--the primary reason was it was the wrong thing to do, but I was \nvery concerned about the fact that we were not paying for it.\n  The tax cuts that went to the richest Americans--I didn't hear any \nRepublicans saying we should not do this, with the exception of George \nVoinovich from my State, who raised that issue. I didn't hear any of \nthem say we should not give those benefits because they are not paid \nfor. Now that it is unemployed workers, people who have lost their \ninsurance, all of a sudden they have some kind of deficit reduction \nissue in their minds. Lavishing goodies on the drug and insurance \ncompanies I guess does not qualify. That qualifies as emergency \nspending. That is OK. But helping working families stay afloat in a \nfloundering economy is not OK.\n  Every day that people do not receive their unemployment insurance is \nanother day more American workers and families will slip into poverty. \nDo you know what happens if they can't get their unemployment checks, \nif they are cut, if they no longer get unemployment insurance? We are \ngoing to see more home foreclosures. How are you going to have economic \nrecovery when somebody's home is foreclosed on, it is then vandalized, \nit then plummets in value, then infects houses in the neighborhood, and \nso they have the same problems and the value of their home gets lower \nand lower. How is that going to help us with economic recovery? It is a \nhuman tragedy, and it is an economic blow our country cannot afford. \nPoverty reduces consumer spending, and it increases the need for public \nassistance. That is two steps back.\n  Not only is unemployment insurance a poverty prevention tool, it is a \nproven economic stimulus. Senator McCain, who ran, as we know, as \nRepublican nominee for President--his chief economic adviser said \nunemployment insurance is the single best economic stimulus. Every \ndollar in jobless benefits, which were earned, as I said--you pay in as \ninsurance, you get out--every dollar in unemployment benefits produces \n$1.64 in economic growth. Why is that? It is because they don't take \ntheir dollar and put it in their pocket; they spend it on their kids or \nspend it on the necessities of life. It goes right back into the \ncommunity. That is why it supports and produces $1.64 in economic \ngrowth.\n  In the first 6 months following passage of the Recovery Act--and we \nknow that almost every economist, except for those who have their own \nideological game going, will say that without the Recovery Act we would \nbe in a much higher unemployment situation today. Frankly, we would \nhave a higher budget deficit as a result because so many more people \nwould be out of work. Unemployment insurance pumped $19 billion into \nthe economy.\n  Let me close with a couple of letters from Ohioans. Richard from \nCuyahoga County--the northern part of the State\n\n[[Page S4610]]\n\non Lake Erie, just east of where I live--writes:\n\n       People like me are trying hard to find a job but this \n     economy is presenting challenges for unemployed workers. To \n     those who object to the cost of unemployment insurance--what \n     about the cost of not helping the folks looking for a job and \n     trying to get by? Not helping us means the loss of a strong \n     multiplier effect--\n\n  This guy obviously gets it--\n\n     spending on necessities like mortgage and rent and food and \n     car payments, which stays in the community where we live.\n\n  That is exactly right. It is another one of the things government \ndoes sometimes. When you help one person, you are helping society. Look \nback at what happened in the 1940s when Franklin Roosevelt signed the \nGI bill. About 7 million, I believe, veterans used GI benefits. So \nthose 7 million people were helped personally, one at a time. They got \nhealth care benefits, they got education benefits, they bought homes--\nwhatever. But the GI bill didn't just help those millions of veterans. \nIt created a prosperity like none the world has ever seen, postwar \nAmerica, where everyone was lifted up. All of society was more \nprosperous because of this government program that helped one person at \na time.\n  So is unemployment insurance. When you do unemployment insurance, you \nsend a life preserver, if you will, to those individuals, tens of \nthousands in my State. But you also create prosperity so your next-door \nneighbor does better because the guy down the street is getting \nunemployment insurance because he might work at the hardware store or \nmight work in the grocery store where the laid-off worker goes to shop \nfor her food. He is able to keep a job because there is some prosperity \ncreated.\n  The last letter I would like to share for a moment is from David from \nFranklin county.\n\n       Many people like me who are looking for a job are well \n     educated, white collar workers with long work histories. As \n     we continue to look for jobs, we hope businesses will hire \n     again. Unemployment insurance benefits have been a lifeline. \n     I have been able to pay my mortgage, feed my family, and \n     clothe my children. Without these benefits--\n\n  This is really key--\n\n     I will lose my home, be forced to go on welfare, and see my \n     children go hungry and my family possibly destroyed. Please \n     urge your colleagues to support an unemployment insurance \n     extension. In the richest, most productive country in the \n     world, please do the right thing and stand up for us during \n     our time of need.\n\n  Forget about the statistics, forget about the economics of it. Think \nabout somebody like David who knows that without these unemployment \nbenefits--and he is not getting rich; he is barely getting along with a \nfew hundred dollars. What it means is he can pay his mortgage. What it \nmeans is he can feed his family. What it means is he will go back, as \nhe keeps looking for work, to being a productive member of society.\n  We need to act now--not tomorrow, not next week, not next month--now. \nWe must act now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, 3 weeks from now the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will hold the confirmation hearing for President Obama's \nnomination of Elena Kagan to succeed Justice John Paul Stevens as an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Last year, after reviewing her record, a bipartisan majority of the \nSenate voted to confirm Elena Kagan to be the Solicitor General of the \nUnited States, actually the first woman in America's history to serve \nas Solicitor General. As the distinguished Presiding Officer knows, \noftentimes the Solicitor General is referred to as the ``Tenth \nJustice''. Not only are we familiar with Elena Kagan from our review of \nher nomination last year, but we have already received an extraordinary \namount of information about her in connection with this nomination.\n  Last week we received nearly 50,000 pages of documents from the \nClinton Library related to Elena Kagan's service and her significant \nrole in the Clinton White House. My initial review of these documents \nshows her to have been a pragmatic and thoughtful adviser to President \nClinton as she helped him to advance the goals of his administration.\n  As a law clerk to Justice Thurgood Marshall, as a professor, as a \npolicy adviser to the President, and dean of Harvard Law School, and as \nSolicitor General of the United States, she appeared to have a clear \ngrasp of how to apply her abilities to meet the challenges of each of \nthese varied positions. I point out in that regard not only is she the \nfirst woman to become Solicitor General, she was the first woman to \nbecome dean of the Harvard Law School.\n  I went back and I doublechecked with my staff, Bruce Cohen, Jeremy \nParis, and others on my staff, and I said: How does the information we \nhave received on this nomination compare with the Roberts or Alito \nnominations when there was a Republican President? I am told the \ncommittee has received more information from the administration than \nwas made available at this point in the confirmation process for either \nthe Roberts or Alito nominations.\n  Last year we considered President Obama's nomination of Justice Sonia \nSotomayor. Although she was confirmed with 68 votes, I was disappointed \nthat so many chose to oppose her historic nomination, the first \nHispanic to the Supreme Court, only the third woman.\n  I suspected and do suspect that many of those who voted against her \nconfirmation will come to regret their action, if they do not already. \nRegrettably, many of the Senate Republicans, now that President Obama \nis in the White House, seem to want to apply a different standard from \nwhen they were considering President Bush's nominees to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  As we begin the process of considering a new nominee to the Supreme \nCourt, I candidly admit that after watching the unfounded opposition to \nthe Sotomayor nomination last year, I would not be surprised if a \nmajority of Republican Senators were to vote against Solicitor General \nElena Kagan, despite her qualifications and no matter how she answers \nquestions during the course of the hearing. I have joked that if \nPresident Obama nominated Moses, the lawgiver, or Mother Theresa, \nSenate Republicans would vote against the nomination. Such a \nwillingness of many Republican Senators to heed the extreme ideological \ntest imposed by the far right.\n  Indeed, were Justice Sandra Day O'Connor the nominee pending today, \nor Justice David Souter, or Justice John Paul Stevens, or, for that \nmatter, Justice Anthony Kennedy, it is a sad reality that a majority of \ncurrent Republican Senators would likely vote against their \nconfirmations, as well, for failing the extreme ideological litmus \ntest. Each of these Justices was nominated by a Republican President. I \nvoted in favor of each of them.\n  Each of these Justices served or are serving now with distinction, \nand all still contribute to the Nation and its courts. The American \npeople are fortunate to have had all of them serve on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Regrettably, most Senate Republicans, now that President Obama is in \nthe White House, seem to want to apply a different standard from when \nthey were considering President Bush's nominees to the Supreme Court. I \nwelcome questions to Solicitor General Kagan about judicial \nindependence. But let's be fair. Let us listen to her answers. No one \nshould presume that this intelligent woman who has excelled during \nevery part of her varied and distinguished career lacks the \nindependence to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. Indeed, many of the \njustices who are most revered in this country for their independence \ncame to the Court with a background not unlike that of the nominee.\n\n[[Page S4611]]\n\n  Not so long ago, Republicans Senators contended that a nominee's \njudicial philosophy was irrelevant. All that should matter, they \nclaimed, was that the nominee was qualified, had gone to elite schools, \nand had good character. Well, Solicitor General Kagan excelled at \nPrinceton, Oxford, and Harvard Law School. As I have mentioned, she was \nthe first woman to serve as Dean of Harvard Law School in its 193-year \nhistory, and was respected and admired for her inclusiveness. She is \nthe first woman to serve as Solicitor General of the United States in \nthat office's 140-year history. Throughout her career, no one has \nquestioned her character or her integrity. She obviously meets and \nexceeds the qualifications standard previously espoused by the Senate \nRepublicans.\n  Now they apparently want to examine something else, which they will \ncall her ``judicial philosophy'' or ``independence''. But it is not her \nphilosophy, judgment, or her independence that matters to them. What \nthey really want is assurance that she will rule the way they want so \nthat they will get the end results they want in cases before the \nSupreme Court. Lack of such assurances was why they and the \nconservative right wing vetoed President Bush's nomination of Harriet \nMiers, the third woman to be nominated to the Supreme Court in our \nhistory and the only one not to be confirmed. They forced Ms. Miers to \nwithdraw even while Democrats were preparing to proceed with her \nhearing. They do not want an independent judiciary. They demand \nJustices who guarantee the results they want, and that is their \nideological litmus test.\n  I reject the ideological litmus test that Senate Republicans would \napply to Supreme Court nominees. Unlike those on the right who drove \nPresident Bush to withdraw the nomination of Harriet Miers, and those \nwho opposed Justice Sotomayor, I do not require a Supreme Court nominee \nto swear fealty to the judicial approach and outcomes ordained by \nadhering to the narrow views of Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas. I \nexpect judges and Justices to faithfully interpret the Constitution and \napply the law, and also to look to the legislative intent of our laws \nand to consider the consequences of their decisions. Based on the \nreview I have made of Solicitor General Kagan's career, I say frankly \nthat I expect she and I will not always agree. I do not agree with \nevery decision Justice Stevens has written, but I have such enormous \nrespect for his judgment, this giant in the law.\n  I do not always agree with Justice O'Connor, nor with Justice Souter. \nI have my disagreements with some of Justice Kennedy's decisions. But I \nhave never regretted my vote in favor of their confirmation, because I \nrespect their independence.\n  I said only half facetiously when President Obama asked me: Why did \nsome come out against Elena Kagan within minutes of her nomination, \nbefore they knew anything about her? I said: You have to understand, if \nyou would have nominated Moses, the lawgiver, some of those same people \nwould oppose.\n  The former First Lady Laura Bush was asked recently about President \nObama's nomination of Elena Kagan and she said: I think it's great. I'm \nreally glad that there will be three [women serving on the Supreme \nCourt] if she is confirmed.\n  When Justice O'Connor was asked about the nomination she said that \nshe was ``pleased'' that Solicitor General Kagan seemed ``very well \nqualified academically'' and should be confirmed and that ``it's fine, \njust fine'' that she is without prior judicial experience. Over the \nweekend Justice O'Connor elaborated saying: ``There is no reason you \nshould have served on the Federal court bench'' before becoming a \nJustice. She had not. Justice Scalia went even farther on that score, \nsaying recently that he was ``happy to see that this latest nominee is \nnot a Federal judge--and not a judge at all''.\n  The American people elected the first African-American President, and \nhe is a leader who is committed to the Constitution and rule of law. \nWith his initial selection to the Supreme Court, he named Justice Sonia \nSotomayor, the first Hispanic to serve on the High Court. She was \nconfirmed last year and has been a welcome addition to the Supreme \nCourt. Now he has nominated only the fifth woman in the Nation's \nhistory to the Court, a nominee who can bring the number of women \nserving on the Court to an historic high-water mark of three from the \ntime just a little over a year ago when it was just down to one.\n  This month Justice Stevens will be leaving the Court after nearly 35 \nyears of dedicated public service. The Nation owes him a great debt. \nWhen I visited with him earlier this year, Justice Stevens shared with \nme the note from President Ford in which he recounted that he was \nprepared to allow history's judgment of his presidency to rest on his \nnomination of John Paul Stevens to the Supreme Court. I hope that \nPresident Obama can look at his Supreme Court appointments, long after \nhis presidency has ended, and feel the same way about his nominees that \nPresident Ford felt about Justice Stevens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4611-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4611-S4612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING NORTHEASTERN NEVADA HISTORICAL SOCIETY MUSEUM\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to congratulate the \nNortheastern Nevada Historical Society Museum on their acceptance to \nthe American Association of Museums' Museum Assessment Program. The \nNortheastern Nevada Historical Society has been serving Nevada for 54 \nyears, preserving its history and educating communities. Through \nparticipation in the Museum Assessment Program, MAP, the museum will \nundertake extensive improvement projects for the benefit of the entire \ncommunity.\n  The Northeastern Nevada Historical Society Museum, located in Elko, \nis the only museum in Elko County and the largest museum in \nnortheastern Nevada. The museum houses two history galleries, three art \ngalleries, archives, a theatre, a gift shop, and an extensive library \ncollection. The exhibits range from ``Murray'' the mastodon, a set of \n2-million-year-old mastodon bones discovered in northern Nevada, to \nmodern abstract paintings. Every year 18,000 people from all parts of \nthe country visit the museum. Children from five counties make field \ntrips here to learn about Nevada, wildlife, and history. The museum \nalso runs educational programming and hosts community events, making it \none of northern Nevada's most treasured establishments.\n  Last year, the Northeastern Nevada Historical Society was accepted \ninto the prestigious Museum Assessment Program, which is an intense \nyearlong improvement process with three phases. In the first phase \nmuseums receive guidance from the American Association of Museums, AAM, \nin the form of written documents to help them asses their own \neffectiveness and areas for improvement. In the second phase, the \nmuseum is peer-reviewed through a visit by a surveyor. Together, the \nmuseum staff and surveyor design an improvement plan for the museum, \nwhich is implemented in the third phase of the program.\n  The dedicated staff at the historical society worked tirelessly \nthroughout the first few months of this year to complete the self-\nassessment portion of the MAP program. Recently, they received a visit \nfrom a surveyor, with whom they developed a thorough museum improvement \nplan. Throughout this process, the historical society has shown the \nutmost dedication to meeting the highest standards in museum \nexcellence.\n  I am very thankful to the Northeastern Nevada Historical Society \nMuseum for its work preserving Nevada's history. I have lived in Nevada \nall of my life and have been deeply influenced by our unique culture \nand history. The historical society aims to capture this culture and \nhistory and share them in a way that is engaging and educational. I am \npleased to see that the American Association of Museums has recognized \nthis goal and will be supporting the Northeastern Nevada Historical \nSociety Museum in furthering it. The museum's commitment to the \ncommunities it serves is evidenced by its choice to participate in such \na rigorous improvement program. I commend the Northeastern Nevada \nHistorical Society for its dedication and look forward to its \ncontribution to Nevada's communities for many years to come.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have my letter\n\n[[Page S4612]]\n\nto the Senate minority leader regarding the Global Food Security Act, \nS. 384, printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                     May 27, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I recently objected to a unanimous \n     consent request to pass S. 384, the Global Food Security Act.\n       As you will recall, I sent a letter to the entire Senate at \n     the beginning of this Congress in which I outlined four basic \n     principles that would give me cause to object to any \n     legislation that violated them. Among them are the principles \n     that any new spending commitment authorized must be paid for \n     by reducing spending in other areas of the federal budget and \n     that any new programs or initiatives should not duplicate \n     existing ones.\n       Along these lines I have two primary concerns with S. 384. \n     First, according to the Congressional Budget Office, this \n     bill will cost taxpayers $6.5 billion; yet, the legislation \n     provides no offset to avoid increasing our national debt, \n     which recently reached $13 trillion.\n       Second, it appears several components of S. 384 may overlap \n     with existing federal programs and authority relating to \n     agricultural assistance and research. For example, S. 384 \n     creates the Higher Education Collaboration for Technology, \n     Agriculture, Research and Extension program (HECTARE), which \n     authorizes research and teaching activities for academic \n     exchanges for students, faculty, extension educators, and \n     school administrators. However, according to the \n     Congressional Research Service, this section overlaps with \n     several programs at the Department of Agriculture (USDA). \n     Specifically, USDA already has research, extension and \n     teaching activities authorized in Section 1458 of the 2008 \n     farm bill. Other farm bill programs, such as the Competitive \n     Grants for International Science and Education Programs (Sec. \n     1459A), the Borlaug International Agricultural Science and \n     Technology Fellowship Program (Sec. 1473G), and the Cochran \n     Agricultural Fellowship Program for Middle Income Countries, \n     Emerging Democracies and Emerging Markets (Sec. 1543) also \n     authorize USDA to carry out the kinds of activities that \n     would be funded by the HECTARE program.\n       Additionally, this bill adds new provisions and authority \n     for conservation farming and other sustainable agriculture \n     techniques. At the same time, USAID already operates the \n     Sustainable Agriculture and Natural Resource Management \n     Collaborative Research Support Program, which American \n     universities carry out to support sustainable agriculture \n     research and natural resource management internationally. \n     USAID also operates the Consultative Group on Program, which \n     American universities carry out to support sustainable \n     agriculture research and natural resource management \n     internationally. USAID also operates the Consultative Group \n     on International Agricultural Research (CGIAR), which is an \n     alliance of international agricultural centers that mobilizes \n     science to benefit the poor by promoting conservation and \n     sustainability of natural resources and biodiversity. \n     Further, the USDA's Natural Resources Conservation Service \n     conducts an International Technical Assistance program. \n     Through this program, the U.S. provides technical assistance \n     internationally to enhance conservation and management of \n     natural resources. Finally, one component of USDA's Foreign \n     Agricultural Service's mission is to provide food aid and \n     technical assistance in foreign countries.\n       The statutory authorities to implement these initiatives \n     already exist. Congress should conduct better management of \n     programs already authorized rather than create new ones as \n     outlined in S. 384. The past failures of Congress to \n     streamline federal programs where appropriate have resulted \n     in a vast expansion of our government, often to the detriment \n     of taxpayers and in violation of the principles set forth in \n     the U.S. Constitution.\n       During this time of national economic unrest, Congress must \n     do the hard work of paying for its commitments rather than \n     passing along debt to future generations and risking \n     financial collapse. Additionally, Congress must first \n     evaluate existing programs to eliminate or consolidate \n     overlapping functions before it creates new programs or \n     embarks on new initiatives.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions you \n     may have. Thank you for your service to our country.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tom A. Coburn,\n     U.S. Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4612-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4612]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           RECOGNIZING AMBASSADOR JEAN KENNEDY SMITH AND VSA\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to recognize VSA, the International \nOrganization on Arts and Disability. VSA is an affiliate of the John F. \nKennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and was founded in 1974 by \nAmbassador Jean Kennedy Smith--a pioneering leader in the area of \naccess and inclusion in the arts for children with disabilities. For \nover three decades, she has blazed the trail for VSA to become the \npreeminent international organization on arts and disability. As a \nresult of Ambassador Smith's tireless efforts and sustained vision, VSA \nis changing perceptions all over the world about people with \ndisabilities. Each year, 7 million people of all ages and abilities \nparticipate in VSA programs in dance, music, drama and the visual arts.\n  Ambassador Smith and VSA have created an extraordinary network of \neducational resources, programs, festivals, and services that bring the \narts into the lives of individuals of all ages--with and without \ndisabilities. VSA programs occur in schools, community centers, \nhospitals, performing arts centers, art galleries, and college and \nuniversity campuses. They involve teacher and artist training programs, \nthe development and distribution of educational resources, and \nperformance and exhibition opportunities for individuals of all ages. \nThrough the development, implementation, and dissemination of model \nprograms and initiatives, VSA helps acknowledge the importance of the \narts in academic and vocational achievement for individuals of all \nabilities. These programs operate in all 50 states and in 51 countries \naround the world.\n  From June 6 to 12, more than 2,000 people will convene in Washington, \nDC, to celebrate Ambassador Smith's vision and to share their talents \nand accomplishments with all of us.

Madam President, today I have a heavy heart to mark the \npassing and commemorate the life of SSgt Edwin Rivera, a native of \nWaterford, CT, who lost his life in Afghanistan last week at the age of \n28.\n  Staff Sergeant Rivera, the only son of middle-class Puerto Rican \nparents who came to Connecticut in the 1970s, graduated from Waterford \nHigh School in 2000. And they were proud of young Edwin, who served his \nfirst deployment in 2006, even as they missed his presence.\n  ``The center of the family shifts back to my house when Edwin is \ngone,'' his mother said.\n  He was gone for 15 months, not the promised 12. And when he came \nhome, he was changed by what he had seen. But he soon became the \nlively, committed family man, seeing his two sons, Rolando and Lorenzo, \noff to school, working at the Millstone nuclear powerplant, starting a \nnew life with his wife Yesenia.\n  Last summer, however, he told his mother that he still thought about \nthe sad faces of the children he had seen in Afghanistan, the children \nwho couldn't\n\n[[Page S4613]]\n\nenjoy the stable, safe life he was providing for his own family.\n  ``When the U.S. soldiers drive by,'' he told her, ``the children will \nscramble like mad in the dust just to get thrown a simple pencil from \nus. They don't even have pencils. I was born for this, it's my duty, to \nprotect those families over there.''\n  So Edwin went back, leaving for Afghanistan again in early January \nwith the 1st Battalion of the 102nd Infantry Regiment, a Connecticut \nNational Guard unit based in New Haven. Like Edwin, many of those who \nwent with him were not on their first deployment. But they fought with \ncourage and commitment. And when Staff Sergeant Rivera made the \nultimate sacrifice for his country, he did so in defense of his mates.\n  Staff Sergeant Rivera will be missed. But his selflessness, his \ncommitment to his family, and his love of country will not be \nforgotten; rather, they will remain as an inspiration to his two young \nsons and to all of us who honor his service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4613-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4613-S4614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SOMALIA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, once again, I wish to express my \nconcern about the situation in Somalia. To put it frankly, the \nsituation is appalling. Since the start of fighting in 2007, at least \n21,000 people have been killed and more than 1.5 million have been \ndisplaced. Thousands of refugees continue to pour into overcrowded \ncamps in Kenya, Ethiopia, Yemen, and elsewhere. For those who remain in \nSomalia, the United Nations refugee and food agencies are unable to \nreach many of them because of the insecurity and threats to \nhumanitarian staff. The terrorist group al Shebaab and other armed \ngroups continue to wage war against the Transitional Federal \nGovernment, the TFG, in Mogadishu as well as against one another in an \neffort to expand their territorial control. Al Shebaab has resorted to \nusing suicide bombings, most recently in an attack inside a mosque in \nMogadishu, which killed dozens of civilians. Meanwhile, al Shebaab is \nemploying increasingly brutal tactics to maintain its control over \ncertain areas--carrying out executions, chopping off hands and legs, \nand forcibly conscripting youth.\n  Mr. President, we should be appalled at this situation, but we should \nalso be concerned because of the direct ramifications for our national \nsecurity. Al Shebaab's leadership has links to al-Qaida, and it has \nindicated, through public statements, that it intends to provide \nsupport to al-Qaida affiliates in Yemen. Even more disconcerting, it \nhas recruited a number of Americans to travel to the region and fight \nwith it. In October 2008, a Somali-American blew himself up in Somalia \nas part of a coordinated attack by al Shebaab, reportedly becoming the \nfirst known suicide bomber with U.S. citizenship. The Justice \nDepartment has since brought terrorist charges against over a dozen \npeople for recruiting and raising funds for Americans to fight with al \nShebaab. Last September, the Director of the National Counterterrorism \nCenter, Michael Leiter, testified that ``the potential for al-Qaida \noperatives in Somalia to commission Americans to return to the United \nStates and launch attacks against the Homeland remains of significant \nconcern.'' Earlier this year, the New York Times reported that an \nAmerican from Alabama, Omar Hammami, has become a key figure in al \nShebaab. Just this past weekend, two other Americans, neither with \nfamily ties in Somalia, were arrested in New Jersey for allegedly \nplanning to fight in Somalia with al Shebaab. This is very troublesome \nnews and brings home the implications of Somalia's ongoing crisis.\n  The Obama administration has been right to refocus attention on \nSomalia--and to consider regional dynamics at the same time. I am also \npleased that the administration has been clear in its support for the \nDjibouti peace process. I am, however, concerned that this process--as \ncurrently constituted--is not sufficient to unite Somalis and mitigate \nthe ongoing crisis. As the situation there turns more dreadful, I worry \nthat the process is becoming increasingly detached from events on the \nground. Furthermore, we must acknowledge that while the administration \ncontinues to provide assistance--both materiel and diplomatic--to the \nTFG, we still do not have an overarching strategy for Somalia that ties \nour programs and policies together. As a result, we appear to be \ngrasping at straws to ``do something'' while our national security \nincreasingly hangs in the balance.\n  Under the previous administration, our approach toward Somalia lacked \ncoherence and was shortsighted. This discord gave rise to conflicting \nagendas that undermined each other and our credibility. Without clear \npolicy guidance, the current administration's efforts--however well \nintentioned--may fall into the same trap. There is great risk that by \nfocusing too narrowly on tactical decisions we will continue to operate \nwithout a larger strategy.\n  Now, I understand in the early months of the administration there was \nan interagency effort to review our policy toward Somalia and the Horn \nof Africa. However, it is also my understanding that no overarching \npolicy was established. Now is the time to renew such an effort, and as \npart of this initiative, we need some way to measure whether we are \nmaking progress. The administration has rightly pressed the TFG to \nbroaden its appeal and strength, but we have seen no major improvement \non that front. With the exception of its agreement with Ahlu Sunna wal \nJama, the TFG has done little to expand its reach and undercut its \nopposition. The TFG has not become more inclusive, and it has not \nprojected an attractive political vision to counter that of armed \nopposition groups. As a result, it is not becoming more legitimate in \nthe eyes of Somalis.\n  Going forward, we need clear guidance on what we expect to achieve \nwith our support for the TFG, the Djibouti Process, and our efforts to \nweaken al Shebaab and provide humanitarian assistance. Without such a \ncoordinated and measurable approach, we run the risk of continuing to \nfund the same initiatives with little progress made. Such an assessment \nis important not only so that American taxpayers know their money is \nbeing well spent, but also so we know our safety and security are being \nenhanced.\n  There are some thoughtful observers who believe that the best option \nfor the United States might be to just disengage altogether and let \nthis crisis play out. The stakes are too high to do that. However, \nthese observers are right that a continuation of the status quo will \nonly further entrench the crisis. The current efforts by the United \nStates and the international community are insufficient to change the \nfundamental dynamics of the situation. We need to go back to the \ndrawing board and develop a strategy with measurable goals and a clear \nplan of how we will reach them.\n  We also need to consider whether appointing a Special Envoy for the \nHorn of Africa, to help create and drive policy, is once again \nappropriate. For years I have called for the creation of such a \nposition--at a very senior level--but to no avail. I do believe that \nnow is the time for this position to be considered particularly because \nof the direct national security implications, but also because the \ncrisis in Somalia requires a regional approach. We need a senior \nofficial to regularly connect the dots between a number of countries in \nthe region including Ethiopia, Eritrea, Kenya, and Yemen in order to \ndevelop an effective strategy. In addition, having a senior envoy \nfocused on addressing this crisis can help show the people of Somalia \nthat we are finally serious about helping their efforts to achieve a \nfuture free of terror and conflict.\n  In thinking about how we fit counterterrorism concerns into a broader \nstrategy, we must be practical. Mr. President, tactical operations \nagainst individuals and networks may be justified in some cases, \nespecially if the targets have clear ties to al-Qaida and pose a direct \nthreat to the United States. But we need to think hard about the \nstrategic implications and potential risks of these operations because \nat the same time we need to reach out to, work with, and support all \nSomalis who seek a more stable and secure country. The perception that \nthe United States is only interested in tactical counterterrorism \noperations in Somalia has generated suspicion among Somalis and fueled \nanti-Americanism. Not taking that into account when planning or \nauthorizing any tactical operations is counter-productive.\n  Equally as important to our counterterrorism goals is the need to \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S4614]]\n\npressing for an inclusive and functional system of governance that can \nenforce the rule of law and provide security. In addition to supporting \nthe TFG, we should look for creative ways to work with other \ngovernments and nongovernmental actors to encourage political consensus \nand reconciliation among different groups in Somalia. We need to look \nat the grassroots and local level and see how they can be bolstered and \nexpanded. Helping Somalis to come together around a shared political \nvision and to translate that vision into a political system that makes \na tangible difference in people's lives is the surest way to address \nour national security concerns over the long term.\n  Achieving stability and restoring the rule of law in Somalia will not \nbe easy or quick--nearly two decades of dysfunction have made sure of \nthat--but we must have a strategy in place if we are to proceed. We \ncannot respond in an uncoordinated and ad hoc manner to the conditions \nthat breed and empower terrorist organizations and we cannot address \nthem on the cheap. Our national security, the fate of Somalia's people, \nand the region's stability demand nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4614-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4614-S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRESIDENTIAL RECORDS ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, recently the Obama administration \nasked the National Archives to speed up its already planned release of \nSupreme Court nominee Elena Kagan's records from her time in the \nClinton administration.\n  I applaud the administration's openness. But this speedy release of \ndocuments is not required by the current Presidential Records Act and \nmight have been impossible under an Executive order issued by former \nPresident George W. Bush. That order allowed former Presidents, Vice \nPresidents, and their heirs to withhold the release of documents \nindefinitely by claiming Executive privilege.\n  On his first day in office, President Obama repealed the Bush \nExecutive order, but a future President could just as easily change it \nback or add new impediments to the timely release of an \nadministration's records.\n  I have long championed legislation to make it clear that these \ndocuments are the property of the American people and therefore should \nbe subject to timely release.\n  But we cannot move forward with this legislation because my friend, \ncolleague, and ranking member on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Jeff \nSessions, has placed a hold on it.\n  Regarding the release of the Kagan documents, Senator Sessions \nrecently told the Washington Post:\n\n       I think all the documents that are producible should be \n     produced. The American people are entitled to know what kind \n     of positions she took, and what kind of issues she was \n     involved with during her past public service.\n\n  I agree with Senator Sessions and hope he will now release his hold \non my legislation so this kind of speedy release of documents and the \nright of the American people to view them will be the legal standard \nfor all future Presidents.\n  A little history will help explain how we got to where we are today.\n  Securing Presidential documents is a problem as old as the Republic. \nGeorge Washington had planned to build a library on his estate at Mount \nVernon to house his Presidential papers. But Washington died before he \ncould get his plan underway and his heirs were not always careful \nstewards of our Founding President's legacy.\n  Some of the documents were so badly stored they were eaten by mice. \nOthers were sold off or given away haphazardly. One of Washington's \nheirs even took to cutting the signature from Washington's \ncorrespondence and sending it to collectors.\n  In a letter, this heir wrote:\n\n       I am now cutting up fragments from old letters and \n     accounts, some of 1760 . . . to supply the call for anything \n     that bears the impress of his venerated hand. One of my \n     correspondents says, ``Send me only the dot of an i or the \n     cross of a t, made by his hand, and I will be content.''\n\n  Despite this inauspicious beginning in preserving our Nation's \nhistory, for nearly two centuries it was presumed that the papers of \nformer Presidents were their personal property to be disposed of \nhowever they or their heirs saw fit.\n  Think of all our national history that has been lost, destroyed or \nkept locked away far too long.\n  The bulk of Andrew Jackson's papers were scattered among at least 100 \ncollections. Jackson's successor, Martin Van Buren, destroyed \ncorrespondence he decided was--I quote--``of little value.''\n  The papers of Presidents Harrison, Tyler, Taylor, Arthur, and Harding \nwere destroyed in fires--sometimes by accident, sometimes intentional.\n  President Lincoln's son Todd burned his father's Civil War \ncorrespondence and threatened to burn all of his father's Presidential \npapers until a compromise was reached with the Library of Congress that \nkept most of the papers sealed until 1947. This delay helped fuel \nconspiracy theories that the papers were kept hidden because they would \nshow that members of Lincoln's Cabinet were part of the assassination \nplot--in effect, that Lincoln died in a coup.\n  Of course, when the papers were finally released, they showed that \nwasn't true, but it took 82 unnecessary years to put the rumor to rest.\n  These historical records are too valuable to be left to the judgment \nof former Presidents, the whims of their heirs, the caprice of nature \nor--as in George Washington's case--the appetite of rodents.\n  This situation finally began to change under President Franklin \nRoosevelt who, on December 10, 1938, announced he would build a library \non his estate in Hyde Park, NY, to house the papers and collections of \nhis public life that stretched back to 1910, when he was elected to the \nState Senate of New York.\n  Roosevelt set a standard for openness, asking his aides and Cabinet \nSecretaries to contribute to the collection, and almost every President \nwho followed carried on in the spirit of Roosevelt--also building \nlibraries to house their papers.\n  But this system was voluntary and began to crumble with the \nresignation of our 37th President, Richard Nixon.\n  Nixon had an agreement with the General Services Administration, GSA, \nwhich would have allowed him to keep all his records locked away, \nincluding the infamous Watergate tapes, and mandated many of them be \ndestroyed.\n  This put us right back where we started, with a former President \nchoosing what historical records the public was entitled to. Congress \npassed legislation in 1974 specifically ordering that the Federal \nGovernment take control of Nixon's records and then in 1978 passed \nlegislation declaring that Presidential papers were public property \nthat must be turned over to the National Archives at the end of an \nadministration and be open to the public after 5 years.\n  Systems, however, were put in place to allow a former President to \nreview documents--and challenge their release on the grounds of \nExecutive privilege. But the presumption was in favor of openness \nunless the former President could show the court a compelling reason to \nwithhold the documents.\n  But then, as mentioned, President Bush weakened the law with \nExecutive Order No. 13233, issued on November 1, 2001. Just to repeat, \nunder this order, not only former Presidents and their heirs, but Vice \nPresidents and their heirs as well, could withhold the release of \ndocuments by claiming Executive privilege.\n  The order also required those challenging claims of Executive \nprivilege to prove in court that they have a ``demonstrated, specific \nneed'' for the documents--an impossibly high standard since only the \ndocument's author can know precisely what a document contains.\n  And since the Executive order also allowed for an indefinite review \nperiod, these records--housed in Presidential libraries maintained by \nthe taxpayers--could be locked away for indefinite periods of time, \nmaking them about as useful as the ashes of Lincoln's letters.\n  In reversing Bush's Executive order, President Obama made clear that \nonly the sitting President can claim Executive privilege--not their \nheirs, and not their Vice Presidents or the Vice Presidents' heirs.\n  In signing the new Executive order, President Obama said:\n\n       Going forward, anytime the American people want to know \n     something that I or a former President wants to withhold, we \n     will have to consult with the Attorney General and the White \n     House Counsel, whose business\n\n[[Page S4615]]\n\n     it is to ensure compliance with the rule of law. Information \n     will not be withheld just because I say so. It will be \n     withheld because a separate authority believes my request is \n     well grounded in the Constitution.\n\n  This is wise public policy and should be the law of the land--subject \nto repeal only by Congress, not by Executive order.\n  When President Roosevelt dedicated his library and began opening up \nhis records and other artifacts to public view, he made it clear that \nthis kind of openness is good for a democracy. ``The dedication of a \nlibrary,'' Roosevelt said, ``is in itself an act of faith. To bring \ntogether the records of the past and to house them in buildings where \nthey will be preserved for the use of men and women in the future, a \nNation must believe in three things. It must believe in the past. It \nmust believe in the future. It must, above all, believe in the capacity \nof its own people so to learn from the past that they can gain in \njudgment in creating their own future.''\n  This Congress can now reassert Roosevelt's faith in our democracy. \nThat is why I urge my colleague, Senator Sessions, to release his hold \non H.R. 35 so we can pass it, get it to the President, and make history \nnow by preserving Presidential history as an open resource for \nAmericans to learn from in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4615-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NATIONAL CANCER SURVIVOR'S DAY\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today in recognition of the 23rd \nannual National Cancer Survivor's Day and to celebrate those who have \nwon the battle against this devastating disease.\n  My wife Barbara is a breast cancer survivor, and I am a prostate \ncancer survivor. My family and I are well aware of the difficulties \nthat come with seeing a loved one diagnosed with a serious illness such \nas cancer and are equally aware of the life-affirming joys that \naccompany survival.\n  Cancer affects millions of individuals and families worldwide. \nFortunately, more people are expected to survive cancer today than in \nthe past, thanks to advancements in screening, diagnosing, and treating \nvarious forms of the disease. The National Cancer Institute estimates \nthat approximately 11.4 million Americans with a history of cancer were \nalive in 2006.\n  Saving lives means preventing cancer, finding it early, and \ncontinuing the search for a cure. Throughout my career in the U.S. \nHouse and Senate, I have strongly supported proposals that would \nadvance research, funding, and education about all forms of cancer, \nsuch as those conducted at the National Institutes of Health, the \nCancer Research Institute, as well as the Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention. Improved understanding of the biological and \nenvironmental causes of cancer will bring us ever closer to more \neffective treatments and eventually a cure.\n  Today, however, cancer remains the second leading cause of death in \nthe United States. The disease is expected to claim more than half a \nmillion lives in 2010, and the American Cancer Society estimates an \nadditional 1.5 million new cases will be diagnosed this year.\n  While increasing public awareness of cancer risk factors and the \nimportance of early screening helps save lives, winning the war on \ncancer depends on access to affordable health care. Many cancers can be \nprevented or treated if caught at an early stage, but lifesaving \nscreenings and treatments remain out of reach for millions of Americans \nwith inadequate insurance or no coverage at all.\n  This year Congress passed an extensive reform of our Nation's health \ncare system that will benefit all families affected by cancer. This \nhistoric legislation emphasizes prevention, expands access to \nmeaningful coverage, ends unfair practices by health insurance \ncompanies, and improves quality of life for cancer survivors through \nbetter management of chronic diseases.\n  It is important to note that a survivor's battle does not end with \nsuccessful treatment. Cancer patients face many side effects to \ntreatment, as well as a continued risk of reoccurrence. Some treatments \ncan permanently alter a patient's well-being and cause other health \nproblems in the short and long terms. The security of meaningful and \naffordable health coverage is vital for cancer survivors to closely \nmonitor their health for the rest of their lives.\n  The millions of Americans with a history of cancer who are alive \ntoday demonstrate that the battle against this disease can be fought \nand won. National Cancer Survivor's Day provides an occasion to \nrecognize cancer survivors, as well as learn more about this illness \nand its impact on our Nation and our families. Not only does cancer \naffect the patient but their spouses, children, and other family \nmembers as well. National Cancer Survivor's Day distinguishes all those \nwho have experienced cancer in any form.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, as we near the close of the 2010 \nNational Small Business Week, I am pleased to join Senator Olympia \nSnowe in introducing the Small Business Tax Equalization and Compliance \nAct of 2010, which extends a tax credit to salon owners for FICA taxes \npaid on employees' tipped income.\n  Currently, salon owners are required to pay the employer's share of \nthe FICA taxes on tips paid to employees even though owners do not \ncontrol the amount of tips paid and do not get a share of the tips \nreceived. The Small Business Tax Equalization and Compliance Act of \n2010 would create a tax credit for employers to offset the matching \nFICA paid on employees' tips just like restaurants received. In \naddition, it includes education and reporting requirements which may \nreveal a valuable new source of tax revenues for the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The salon industry is a vital and growing sector of America's \neconomy. Not only will extending the tip tax credit to salon owners \nallow them to reinvest in their businesses and employees, but it will \nalso grant new economic and employment opportunities in local \ncommunities. I urge my colleagues to support this bill which puts the \nprofessional beauty industry back on equal footing with the restaurant \nindustry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4615-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            RECOGNIZING FRENCHTOWN HIGH SCHOOL ACADEMIC TEAM\n\n Mr. BAUCUS.

Madam President, today I wish to honor the memory \nof Charlie Meyers.\n  For decades, Charlie Meyers spoke up for Colorado's rivers and \nwildlife on the pages of the Denver Post. An award-winning outdoors \nwriter and dedicated conservationist, Meyers shined a light on the \nthreats to our State's treasured mountains and fishing holes as only a \ntrue outdoorsman could.\n  In his final column, Meyers told his readers about ``Fairplay Beach'' \nin Park County, a ``minor marvel,'' as he called it, ``filled with \nangling delights \n. . . threatened by a variety of perils that demand attention, and \nsoon.''\n  Meyers was a native of Sicily Island, LA, and a graduate of Louisiana \nState University. He first joined the Post\n\n[[Page S4616]]\n\nstaff in 1966, and after a brief departure, he returned to stay in \n1971. Meyers was inducted into the Colorado Ski Hall of Fame in 1993 \nand won the International Ski Federation's FIS Journalist Award in \n1999.

Madam President, I wish today to take the \nopportunity to express my congratulations to the winners of the 2009-\n2010 Dick Lugar/Indiana Farm Bureau/Indiana Farm Bureau Insurance \nCompanies Youth Essay Contest.\n  In 1985, I joined with the Indiana Farm Bureau to sponsor an essay \ncontest for eighth grade students in my home State. The purpose of this \ncontest is to encourage young Hoosiers to recognize and appreciate the \nimportance of Indiana agriculture in their lives and subsequently craft \nan essay responding to the assigned theme. The theme chosen for this \nyear was ``Farmers Looking at a Bright Future.''\n  Along with my friends at the Indiana Farm Bureau and Indiana Farm \nBureau Insurance Companies, I am pleased with the annual response to \nthis contest and the quality of the essays received over the years. I \napplaud each of this year's participants on their thoughtful work and \nwish, especially, to highlight the submissions of the 2009-2010 contest \nwinners--Jordan Cadle of Orleans, Indiana, and Layne Sanders of \nGreensburg, Indiana. I submit for the Record the complete text of \nJordan's and Layne's respective essays. I am pleased, also, to include \nthe names of the many district and county winners of the contest.\n  The winning essays follow:\n\n                                Untitled\n\n                           (By Jordan Cadle)\n\n       With world population skyrocketing, farmers need to step \n     off the treadmill of slow incremental growth and jump into \n     using new revolutionary thoughts. The three main ideas for \n     future generations of farmers meeting this challenge are: \n     perennial crops, multistoried planting beds, and hover \n     robotic machinery.\n       Putting the knowledge of the crop geneticist to use, I \n     believe the world can create new perennial crops to plant in \n     more evenly balanced climates year around and in greenhouses. \n     If we had corn and soybeans that could survive the winter and \n     keep producing like a tomato plant (in proper growing \n     conditions) this would allow farmers to rarely buy seeds. \n     Also, this would maintain yield throughout the year for \n     consumption. These plants would be bred to have multiple \n     ears, pods, or heads in order to sustain a sufficient yield \n     at all times.\n       Helping to produce more of these perennial crops, they \n     could be raised on multistoried planting beds. Imagine these \n     being like large parking garages where each layer is a field. \n     Artificial lighting would be used for stories that are not \n     exposed to sunlight. Going upward with fields leaves more \n     room for people to live and natural trees to grow since we \n     will be exhausting our supply of cultivatable land on earth.\n       Tending to these crops, hover robotic machinery will be \n     used. Utilizing this machinery will allow farmers to plant \n     and tend to crops, while the ground may still be too wet for \n     standard machinery. Also, the line of machinery will be \n     equipped with laser sensors to care for each plants' \n     individual needs. This will minimize input costs. Just like \n     robots in general, one farmer will be able to control several \n     at a time.\n       I believe hover robotic machinery, multistoried planting \n     beds, and perennial crops will guide farmers running to a \n     brighter future.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Farmers Looking at a Bright Future\n\n                           (By Layne Sanders)\n\n       Farming has been and will continue to be a major part of \n     Indiana's future. Change is inevitable, and Indiana's farmers \n     will need to learn to change also. A continuing global demand \n     for high quality and economic food puts Indiana in an \n     enviable position. I think the number of farms will decline, \n     and the average size will continue to increase. Large farms \n     will take advantage of continued advancements in technology \n     to increase productivity and decrease labor. GPS systems will \n     allow tractors to drive themselves and apply fertilizers in \n     fields as needed. No-till farming will play an important role \n     in Indiana's farming future also, no-tilling requires less \n     equipment, less fuel, and is better for the soil. No-till \n     farming reduces soil erosion and saves tons of our precious \n     top soil.\n       Smaller farmers may need to be more innovative to survive \n     the changing times ahead. I feel there are real opportunities \n     for small farms in specialty markets. Organic farming holds \n     some intriguing possibilities, as Americans and the world are \n     more and more concerned about the quality of their food. \n     Certified organic meats and vegetables marketed thru a farm \n     name brand, using sources like the Internet, traditional \n     grocery stores, and farmers markets, could provide the niche \n     a smaller farm may need to survive.\n       Livestock farms will have the technology to collect waste \n     from many locations and pump the waste to a centralized \n     location. This animal waste can then be converted into \n     biogas, and used to provide energy for our farms, cities, and \n     industries. Carbon credits could be earned by the farms that \n     contribute to biomass facility, these credits could then be \n     exchanged for energy, fertilizer, or other byproducts from \n     the digester. This is a relatively new technology and the \n     future is really wide open with possibilities. Indeed the \n     future is bright.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    2009-2010 District Essay Winners\n\n\n                               District 1\n\n       Luke Kepler and Alexandra Magallon.\n\n\n                               District 2\n\n       Ashley Kain and Curtis Mourey.\n\n\n                               District 3\n\n       Pamela Kuechenmeister and Colton Underwood.\n\n\n                               District 4\n\n       Collin Saxman and Kathleen Jacobs.\n\n\n                               District 5\n\n       Deena Hesselgrave and Joe Littiken.\n\n\n                               District 6\n\n       Carson Bailey and Annie Chalfant.\n\n\n                               District 7\n\n       Hannah Kocher and Seth Black.\n\n\n                               District 8\n\n       Tyler Combs and Layne Sanders.\n\n\n                               District 9\n\n       Jordan Cadle and Jennifer Riedford.\n\n\n                              District 10\n\n       Tess Stoops and Trey Embrey.\n\n                     2009-2010 County Essay Winners\n\n\n                                 Adams\n\n       Christian Inniger and Danielle Parr, South Adams Middle \n     School.\n\n\n                                 Allen\n\n       Curtis Mourey and Cara Schaadt, Saint Joseph Hessen Cassel \n     School.\n\n\n                              Bartholomew\n\n       Tyler Combs, Central Middle School.\n\n\n                                 Benton\n\n       Josh Budreau and Carlene Widmer, Benton Central Junior/\n     Senior High School.\n\n\n                                 Brown\n\n       Elizabeth Collier, Brown County Junior High School.\n\n\n                                Carroll\n\n       Austin Meyers, Rossville Middle School.\n\n\n                                 Clark\n\n       Evan Cunliffe and Ashleigh Smith, Silver Creek Middle \n     School.\n\n\n                                  Clay\n\n       Kade Chastain and Paige Stevenson, North Clay Middle \n     School.\n\n\n                                Dearborn\n\n       Allison Hilton, South Dearborn Middle School.\n\n\n                                Decatur\n\n       Layne Sanders, Greensburg Junior/Senior High School.\n\n\n                                 Floyd\n\n       Trey Embrey and Morgan Daniel, Our Lady of Perpetual Help \n     School.\n\n\n                                Franklin\n\n       Alec Stalford and Morgan Blades, Mount Carmel School.\n\n\n                                 Gibson\n\n       Jennifer Riedford, Fort Branch Community School.\n\n\n                                 Greene\n\n       Ryan Woodward and Hannah Kocher, Linton Stockton Junior \n     High School.\n\n\n                                Hamilton\n\n       Kyle Weaver, Carmel Middle School;

Madam President, I wish to honor University of \nAlaska President Mark Hamilton on the occasion of his retirement.\n  A graduate of the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, Mark Hamilton \nserved our Nation for 31 years of Active Duty as a member of the U.S. \nArmy, retiring as major general. During his service, Hamilton helped to \nnegotiate an end to the war in El Salvador, negotiated a period of calm \nwith Somali warlords that allowed for the removal of the U.S. 10th \nMountain Division, and advised on NATO planning related to the former \nRepublic of Yugoslavia. In recognition of his distinguished service, \nHamilton is the recipient of the Distinguished Service Medal and the \nJoint Distinguished Service Medal.\n  In 1998, shortly after retiring from the military, Mark Hamilton \nchose to return to his adopted State to serve as the 12th president of \nthe University of Alaska. From the beginning, President Hamilton \narticulated a new vision for the university system a ``can-do, grow \nyour own'' philosophy based on strict accountability for results. \nUnderstanding that effective leadership needs support from all \nstakeholders, Mark traveled the State to learn more about what Alaskans \nwanted from their university system and how the university could better \nmeet the State's need for qualified graduates.\n  Turning vision into action, Mark led the University of Alaska to \nfocus on being more responsive and relevant to Alaskans' needs. \nThroughout his tenure, President Hamilton has been guided by the \nfollowing questions when making decisions for the University: Is it \ngood for the students? Is it good for the University? Is it good for \nthe State? Is it working? This brand of leadership has led to \nsignificantly increased support from donors, the business community, \nthe legislature, and the public. As a result, the University of Alaska \nsystem has been able to expand degree options for students, make long-\nneeded improvements to its facilities, increase enrollment and student \nretention, and increase the number of degree-seeking students who \ngraduate.\n  Realizing that the success of University of Alaska graduates, and \nhence the future of our State, is inextricably linked to the \npreparation students receive in our K-12 schools, Mark next turned his \nattention to entering into collaborative partnerships for teacher \nrecruitment, preparation, and mentoring programs to ``grow our own'' \nteachers. He initiated the UA Scholars Program--a full ride scholarship \nfor the top graduates from every high school in the State. Mark also \nmade it a priority to enthusiastically participate in statewide and \nlegislative discussions concerning improving Alaska's K-12 schools and \nincreasing our high school graduation rate.\n  I could go on and on describing the positive changes Mark Hamilton \nhas spearheaded and supported during his 12 years as president of the \nUniversity of Alaska. It is sufficient, I think, to say Mark Hamilton \nhas been the crucial force needed to bring the University of Alaska \ninto the 21st century and to set our public university system on a path \nto make a positive difference in the lives of individuals and the \nfuture of our State.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, I thank University of Alaska \nPresident Mark Hamilton for his many years of service to our Nation and \nto my State of Alaska, and I wish him well as he is finally able to \nspend more time with his wife Patty, his four children--Daniel, Kathy, \nClay and Doug--and his 10 grandchildren: Renee, Avery, Paige, Max, \nArchie, Henry, Aubrey, Luke, Lauryn, and Mark.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4617-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4617-S4618]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CHESTER CHARLES MOELLER, II\n\n Mr. SESSIONS.

He continued on to become \na two-time ECAC selection and a Naval Academy Athletic Association \nSword recipient. In 3 seasons with the Midshipmen, Mr. Moeller averaged \n92 tackles per season. He also served as cocaptain of the 1975 team, \nwhich won more games than any Midshipmen squad since the 1963 team that \nplayed for the national championship. He proved to be a leader in the \nclassroom as well as he was a Second Team Academic All-American.\n  Mr. Moeller's induction is no small feat. He was selected by more \nthan\n\n[[Page S4618]]\n\n12,000 National Football Foundation members and current members of the \nCollege Football Hall of Fame. The votes were submitted to the National \nFootball Federation's Honors Court, which deliberated and selected a \nclass from among the 4.72 million Americans who have played college \nfootball. To date, only 866 players have earned this prestigious honor.\n  The discipline and dedication Mr. Moeller developed on the field were \napplied as he faithfully served his country as a first lieutenant in \nthe U.S. Marine Corps. He has also served his community as a board \nmember for the Fellowship of Christian Athletes and as a deacon in his \nchurch. He is currently serving as a church elder. He and his wife \nJenny have resided in Montgomery, AL, for over 30 years. They have two \nchildren: Trey, who played football for the University of Virginia, and \nRachael, who attended Auburn University.\n  I commend Mr. Moeller for all of his accomplishments and successes.

A bill to improve the program under section 8(a) of the \nSmall Business Act and to establish a surety bond pilot program; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, along with my distinguished colleague \nSenator Benjamin Cardin of Maryland, I rise today to introduce the \nSection 8(a) Improvements Act of 2010. As the Chair of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have held a number of hearings \nand roundtables on the issues affecting small businesses that contract \nwith the Federal Government. The Committee has repeatedly heard from \nsmall businesses throughout the country that more needs to be done to \nlevel the playing field and help our small businesses win Federal \ncontracts. The legislation that I am introducing today seeks to improve \naccess to Federal contracts for small businesses, particularly for \nsocially and economically disadvantaged small businesses. It also \nrepresents the third in a series of steps that the Committee is taking \nto address the disparities and inequalities that currently exist in the \nFederal procurement process.\n  As I have explained in previous statements before this chamber, as \nthe largest purchaser in the world, the Federal Government is uniquely \npositioned to offer new and reliable business opportunities for our \nsmall firms. Government contracts are one of the easiest and most \ninexpensive ways the government can help to immediately increase sales \nfor America's entrepreneurs, leading to the creation of new jobs and \nhelping to move our economy forward. When large businesses get \ngovernment contracts, they are able to absorb that new work into their \nexisting workforce. When small businesses get government work they must \n``staff up'' to meet the increased demand. By increasing contracts to \nsmall businesses by just 1 percent, we can create more than 100,000 new \njobs. Today, we need those jobs more than ever.\n  But the reality is that small businesses need all the help they can \nget when it comes to accessing Federal contracts. Small businesses face \nsignificant challenges in competing for these opportunities, including \na maze of complicated regulations, contract bundling issues, size \nstandards with loopholes for big businesses, and a lack of protections \nfor sub-contractors. Despite the fact that Federal agencies have a \nstatutory goal to spend 23 percent of their contract dollars on \ncontracts to small firms, in recent years the government has often \nfallen short.\n  For example, according to the Federal Procurement Data System, in \nfiscal year 2007 the Federal Government missed its 23 percent \ncontracting goal by .992 percent. That .992 percent doesn't sound like \nmuch, but in reality it represents more than $3.74 billion and 93,500 \njobs lost for small businesses. In fiscal year 2008, the Federal \nProcurement Data System reported that the government missed its goal by \n1.51 percent, meaning more than $6.51 billion and 162,700 jobs lost for \nour small businesses. At a time when more than 15 million Americans are \nstill out of work, merely meeting that 23 percent goal could mean food \non the table for a family struggling to make ends meet.\n  Clearly we need to do better when it comes to helping our small \nbusinesses access Federal contracting opportunities. Even under the \nbest of circumstances our small businesses face significant challenges \nwhen seeking Federal contracting opportunities. But these challenges \nare further compounded for small businesses that face additional \nobstacles, particularly those that are socially and economically \ndisadvantaged.\n  The Section 8(a) Improvements Act of 2010 attempts to help socially \nand economically disadvantaged firms in three ways. First, it makes \nlong overdue and much needed adjustments to the average annual income \nand net worth thresholds currently in place. Since the establishment of \nthe 8(a) program over 30 years ago, these thresholds have not been \nsignificantly updated to account for inflation, placing unrealistic \nlimits on the number of small businesses that are eligible to \nparticipate in the program.\n  Additionally, this legislation requires the SBA to establish maximum \nnet worth thresholds for socially and economically disadvantaged small \nbusinesses working in the manufacturing, construction, professional \nservices, and general services industries. Small businesses working in \nthese industries simply face different business conditions as well as \nhigher business costs, which prevent them from participating in the \n8(a) program. Making this simple fix will open the program up to a wide \narray of qualified small businesses.\n  Secondly, this legislation builds upon the previously mentioned \nadjustments to the net worth and income thresholds, by extending the \namount of time under which a business can participate in the program. \nFor all of the success that many small businesses experience while \nparticipating in the program, upon graduation as many as 70 percent see \ntheir businesses fail within several years. By establishing a \ntransition period, businesses that have graduated from the program can \ncontinue receiving developmental assistance for up to 3 years after \ngraduation, providing them with much needed stability as they seek to \ntransition their business operations.\n  The third way this legislation attempts to improve contracting \nopportunities for small businesses is through the creation of a Surety \nBond Pilot Program. Under the program, the SBA can guarantee 90 percent \nof surety bonds, protecting small businesses against any loss resulting \nfrom a breach of the terms on a bond. To supplement the guarantee and \nhelp put these small businesses in a stronger position to succeed upon \ngraduation from the 8(a) program, the legislation also requires the SBA \nto provide educational training and technical assistance on a wide \nrange of topics. Finally, the legislation establishes a revolving fund \nto support the program, and also creates an advisory board to oversee \nand evaluate the effectiveness and performance of the program.\n  It is well past time to provide greater opportunities for the \nthousands of\n\n[[Page S4624]]\n\nsmall business owners who wish to do business with the Federal \nGovernment. The Section 8(a) Improvements Act of 2010 represents \nanother significant step towards opening those doors of opportunity, \nespecially for those small businesses that need a little more help. I \nthank Senator Cardin for his leadership on this issue, and I hope that \nall of my colleagues will join us in supporting this important \nlegislation as we work to bring it to the President's desk in the \ncoming months.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3458\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Section 8(a) Improvements \n     Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Despite the significant progress businesses owned by \n     socially and economically disadvantaged individuals have made \n     as a result of the business development program under section \n     8(a) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(a)), such \n     businesses remain subject to discrimination that creates \n     substantial barriers to success in the marketplace. The \n     business development program under section 8(a) of the Small \n     Business Act reflects the commitment of the Nation to \n     eradicating discriminatory barriers to the formation and \n     development of viable businesses by socially and economically \n     disadvantaged individuals.\n       (2) Recent evidence presented in Congressional hearings, \n     roundtables, and academic studies demonstrates, among other \n     things, the following:\n       (A) Significant disparities still exist between the number, \n     size, and income of businesses owned by socially and \n     economically disadvantaged individuals and other businesses. \n     These disparities remain even after controlling for factors \n     such as industry, geography, education, age, and labor market \n     status.\n       (B) Discrimination still limits the ability of socially and \n     economically disadvantaged individuals to access capital. \n     Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals are more \n     often denied loans than individuals who are not minorities, \n     and often pay higher rates of interest on small business \n     loans.\n       (C) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals who \n     own businesses often experience--\n       (i) discrimination from prime contractors and exclusion \n     from critical business networks; and\n       (ii) discrimination by bonding companies and suppliers that \n     impedes the ability of the businesses to compete equally for \n     Government contracts.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act, the terms ``Administration'' and \n     ``Administrator'' means the Small Business Administration and \n     the Administrator thereof, respectively.\n\n     SEC. 4.

EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION.\n\n       (a) 2007 Spending Bill.--For purposes of this title, the \n     term ``2007 spending bill'' means a bill that reduces outlays \n     for the fiscal year beginning in the year in which the bill \n     is considered to levels not exceeding the levels for fiscal \n     year 2007. The bill may not increase revenues.\n       (b) Expedited Consideration of 2007 Spending Bill.--\n       (1) Introduction of 2007 spending bill.--A 2007 spending \n     bill may be introduced in the House of Representatives and in \n     the Senate not later than July 12, 2010, or any time after \n     the first day of a session for any year thereafter by the \n     majority leader of each House of Congress. If 5 session days \n     after July 12 in 2010 or after the first day of session any \n     year thereafter the majority leader has not introduced a \n     bill, the minority leader of each House of Congress may \n     introduce a 2007 spending bill (during this time the majority \n     leader may not introduce a 2007 spending bill). If a 2007 \n     spending bill is not introduced in accordance with the \n     preceding sentence in either House of Congress within 5 \n     session days, then any Member of that House may introduce a \n     2007 spending bill on any day thereafter. Upon introduction, \n     the 2007 spending bill shall be referred to the relevant \n     committees of jurisdiction.\n       (2) Committee consideration.--The committees to which the \n     2007 spending bill is referred shall report the 2007 spending \n     bill without any revision and with a favorable \n     recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or without \n     recommendation, not later than 30 calendar days after the \n     date of introduction of the bill in that House, or the first \n     day thereafter on which that House is in session. If any \n     committee fails to report the bill within that period, that \n     committee shall be automatically discharged from \n     consideration of the bill, and the bill shall be placed on \n     the appropriate calendar.\n       (3) Fast track consideration in house of representatives.--\n       (A) Proceeding to consideration.--It shall be in order, not \n     later than 7 days of session after the date on which an 2007 \n     spending bill is reported or discharged from all committees \n     to which it was referred, for the majority leader of the \n     House of Representatives or the majority leader's designee, \n     to move to proceed to the consideration of the 2007 spending \n     bill. It shall also be in order for any Member of the House \n     of Representatives to move to proceed to the consideration of \n     the 2007 spending bill at any time after the conclusion of \n     such 7-day period. All points of order against the motion are \n     waived. Such a motion shall not be in order after the House \n     has disposed of a motion to proceed on the 2007 spending \n     bill. The previous question shall be considered as ordered on \n     the motion to its adoption without intervening motion. The \n     motion shall not be debatable. A motion to reconsider the \n     vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in \n     order.\n       (B) Consideration.--The 2007 spending bill shall be \n     considered as read. The previous question shall be considered \n     as ordered on the 2007 spending bill to its passage without \n     intervening motion except 50 hours of debate, equally divided \n     and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. A motion to \n     limit debate shall be in order during such debate. A motion \n     to reconsider the vote on passage of the 2007 spending bill \n     shall not be in order.\n       (C) Appeals.--Appeals from decisions of the chair relating \n     to the application of the Rules of the House of \n     Representatives to the procedure relating to the 2007 \n     spending bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (D) Application of house rules.--Except to the extent \n     specifically provided in this paragraph, consideration of an \n     2007 spending bill shall be governed by the Rules of the \n     House of Representatives. It shall not be in order in the \n     House of Representatives to consider any 2007 spending bill \n     introduced pursuant to the provisions of this subsection \n     under a suspension of the rules pursuant to clause 1 of House \n     Rule XV, or under a special\n\n[[Page S4626]]\n\n     rule reported by the House Committee on Rules.\n       (E) Amendments.--It shall be in order to offer amendments \n     to the 2007 spending bill, provided that any such amendment \n     is relevant and would not result in an overall outlay level \n     exceeding the level included in the 2007 spending bill.\n       (F) Vote on passage.--Immediately following the conclusion \n     of consideration of the 2007 spending bill, the vote on \n     passage of the 2007 spending bill shall occur without any \n     intervening action or motion and shall require an affirmative \n     vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen and sworn. \n     If the 2007 spending bill is passed, the Clerk of the House \n     of Representatives shall cause the bill to be transmitted to \n     the Senate before the close of the next day of session of the \n     House.\n       (4) Fast track consideration in senate.--\n       (A) In general.--Notwithstanding rule XXII of the Standing \n     Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 7 days of \n     session after the date on which an 2007 spending bill is \n     reported or discharged from all committees to which it was \n     referred, for the majority leader of the Senate or the \n     majority leader's designee to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the 2007 spending bill. It shall also be in \n     order for any Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the \n     consideration of the 2007 spending bill at any time after the \n     conclusion of such 7-day period. A motion to proceed is in \n     order even though a previous motion to the same effect has \n     been disagreed to. All points of order against the motion to \n     proceed to the 2007 spending bill are waived. The motion to \n     proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to a \n     motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote by which \n     the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in \n     order. If a motion to proceed to the consideration of the \n     2007 spending bill is agreed to, the 2007 spending bill shall \n     remain the unfinished business until disposed of.\n       (B) Debate.--Consideration of an 2007 spending bill and of \n     all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith \n     shall not exceed a total of 50 hours. Debate shall be divided \n     equally between the majority and minority leaders or their \n     designees. A motion further to limit debate on the 2007 \n     spending bill is in order. Any debatable motion or appeal is \n     debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally \n     between those favoring and those opposing the motion or \n     appeal. All time used for consideration of the 2007 spending \n     bill, including time used for quorum calls and voting, shall \n     be counted against the total 50 hours of consideration.\n       (C) Amendments.--It shall be in order to offer amendments \n     to the 2007 spending bill, provided that any such amendment \n     is relevant and would not result in an overall outlay level \n     exceeding the level included in the 2007 spending bill.\n       (D) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage shall occur \n     immediately following the conclusion of the debate on the \n     2007 spending bill and a single quorum call at the conclusion \n     of the debate if requested. Passage shall require an \n     affirmative vote of three-fifths of the Members, duly chosen \n     and sworn.\n       (E) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the \n     decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the \n     rules of the Senate to the procedure relating to a 2007 \n     spending bill shall be decided without debate.\n       (5) Rules to coordinate action with other house.--\n       (A) Referral.--If, before the passage by 1 House of an 2007 \n     spending bill of that House, that House receives from the \n     other House an 2007 spending bill, then such proposal from \n     the other House shall not be referred to a committee and \n     shall immediately be placed on the calendar.\n       (B) Treatment of 2007 spending bill of other house.--If 1 \n     House fails to introduce or consider a 2007 spending bill \n     under this section, the 2007 spending bill of the other House \n     shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this \n     section.\n       (C) Procedure.--\n       (i) 2007 spending bill in the senate.--If prior to passage \n     of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate, the Senate receives \n     an 2007 spending bill from the House, the procedure in the \n     Senate shall be the same as if no 2007 spending bill had been \n     received from the House except that--\n\n       (I) the vote on final passage shall be on the 2007 spending \n     bill of the House if it is identical to the 2007 spending \n     bill then pending for passage in the Senate; or\n       (II) if the 2007 spending bill from the House is not \n     identical to the 2007 spending bill then pending for passage \n     in the Senate and the Senate then passes the Senate 2007 \n     spending bill, the Senate shall be considered to have passed \n     the House 2007 spending bill as amended by the text of the \n     Senate 2007 spending bill.\n\n       (ii) Disposition of the 2007 spending bill.--Upon \n     disposition of the 2007 spending bill received from the \n     House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the 2007 \n     spending bill originated in the Senate.\n       (D) Treatment of companion measures in the senate.--If \n     following passage of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate, \n     the Senate then receives an 2007 spending bill from the House \n     of Representatives that is the same as the 2007 spending bill \n     passed by the House, the House-passed 2007 spending bill \n     shall not be debatable. If the House-passed 2007 spending \n     bill is identical to the Senate-passed 2007 spending bill, \n     the vote on passage of the 2007 spending bill in the Senate \n     shall be considered to be the vote on passage of the 2007 \n     spending bill received from the House of Representatives. If \n     it is not identical to the House-passed 2007 spending bill, \n     then the Senate shall be considered to have passed the 2007 \n     spending bill of the House as amended by the text of the \n     Senate 2007 spending bill.\n       (E) Consideration in conference.--Upon passage of the 2007 \n     spending bill, the Senate shall be deemed to have insisted on \n     its amendment and requested a conference with the House of \n     Representatives on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \n     and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part \n     of the Senate, without any intervening action.\n       (F) Action on conference reports in senate.--\n       (i) Motion to proceed.--A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the conference report on the 2007 spending \n     bill may be made even though a previous motion to the same \n     effect has been disagreed to.\n       (ii) Consideration.--During the consideration in the Senate \n     of the conference report (or a message between Houses) on the \n     2007 spending bill, and all amendments in disagreement, and \n     all amendments thereto, and debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, debate (or consideration) shall be \n     limited to 30 hours, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and minority leader or \n     their designees. Debate on any debatable motion or appeal \n     related to the conference report (or a message between \n     Houses) shall be limited to 1 hour, to be equally divided \n     between, and controlled by, the mover and the manager of the \n     conference report (or a message between Houses).\n       (iii) Debate if defeated.--If the conference report is \n     defeated, debate on any request for a new conference and the \n     appointment of conferees shall be limited to 1 hour, to be \n     equally divided between, and controlled by, the manager of \n     the conference report and the minority leader or his \n     designee, and should any motion be made to instruct the \n     conferees before the conferees are named, debate on such \n     motion shall be limited to one-half hour, to be equally \n     divided between, and controlled by, the mover and the manager \n     of the conference report.

Res. 512\n\n       Whereas aphasia is a communication impairment caused by \n     brain damage that typically results from a stroke;\n       Whereas aphasia can also occur with other neurological \n     disorders, such as a brain tumor;\n       Whereas many people with aphasia also have weakness or \n     paralysis in the right leg and right arm, usually due to \n     damage to the left hemisphere of the brain, which controls \n     language and movement on the right side of the body;\n       Whereas the effects of aphasia may include a loss of or \n     reduction in the ability to speak, comprehend, read, and \n     write, but the intelligence of a person with aphasia remains \n     intact;\n       Whereas according to the National Institute of Neurological \n     Disorders and Stroke (referred to in this preamble as the \n     ``NINDS''), stroke is the third-leading cause of death in the \n     United States, ranking behind heart disease and cancer;\n       Whereas stroke is a leading cause of serious, long-term \n     disability in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that there are about 5,000,000 \n     stroke survivors in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that people in the United \n     States suffer about 750,000 strokes per year, with \n     approximately \\1/3\\ of the strokes resulting in aphasia;\n       Whereas according to the NINDS, aphasia affects at least \n     1,000,000 people in the United States;\n       Whereas the NINDS estimates that more than 200,000 people \n     in the United States acquire the disorder each year;\n       Whereas the National Aphasia Association is a unique \n     organization that provides communication strategies, support, \n     and education for people with aphasia and their caregivers \n     throughout the United States; and\n       Whereas as an advocacy organization for people with aphasia \n     and their caregivers, the National Aphasia Association \n     envisions a world that recognizes the ``silent'' disability \n     of aphasia and provides opportunity and fulfillment for \n     people affected by aphasia: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2010 as ``National Aphasia Awareness \n     Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to increase awareness of aphasia;\n       (3) recognizes that strokes, a primary cause of aphasia, \n     are the third-largest cause of death and disability in the \n     United States;\n       (4) acknowledges that aphasia deserves more attention and \n     study in order to find new solutions for individuals \n     experiencing aphasia and their caregivers;\n       (5) supports efforts to make the voices of people with \n     aphasia heard, because people with aphasia are often unable \n     to communicate with others; and\n       (6) encourages all people in the United States to observe \n     National Aphasia Awareness Month with appropriate events and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/07/senate-section/article/S4627-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4627]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENTS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
