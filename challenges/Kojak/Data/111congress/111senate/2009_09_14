Mr. President, just a year ago today, our economy came \nprecariously close to its breaking point--as close to the brink as it \nhad in generations. One year ago today, Lehman Brothers, part of the \nfoundation of Wall Street for more than a century and a half, \ncollapsed.\n  Much is being made of this anniversary. The media is dedicating \nsignificant amounts of air time, newsprint, and bandwidth to analyzing \nwhat it means, to recording how far we have come since that day, and to \ndescribing the work we still have before us. President Obama went to \nWall Street today to reiterate the importance of strengthening the \nsystem that keeps financial firms in check.\n  But as significant as this occasion is, it is critical to remember \nthat the economic crisis was not created in a day. As dramatic as it \nmay sound, the reality is that our economy did not wake up on the \nmorning of September 14 and suddenly find itself in the emergency room. \nIn fact, this was a long time coming. The Lehman collapse was simply \nthe final straw that broke a vulnerable economy's back, the final spark \nthat ignited a highly flammable and flawed system.\n  The conditions that created this crisis had been brewing for years. A \nlethal combination of government deregulation and industrial \nirresponsibility meant Wall Street could run wild. And run wild it did. \nGreed, excess, and reckless risk ruled the day. Disdain for government \noversight--even though the singular purpose of oversight is to protect \nthe people--was in vogue. Loopholes were exploited. When the rules did \nnot offer any loopholes, those rules were broken.\n  More than a year and a half before his company's collapse, a Lehman \nexecutive told his boss how risky the mortgages that had artificially \ninflated their business were. He knew the bubble was bound to burst, \nand he knew that once the housing market fell, it would fall onto the \nnearby dominos in the banking markets and credit markets. He saw it \ncoming.\n  I repeat, he knew that once the housing market failed, it would fall \nonto the nearby dominos in the banking markets and credit markets. He \nsaw it coming.\n  Bear Stearns knew as early as 2005 that the complicated loans it \npackaged were too good to be true. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission saw the\n\n[[Page S9302]]\n\nwarning signs and started an investigation but then dropped the case. \nThey saw it coming too.\n  But the industry did not act alone. For years, the previous \nadministration put the interests of Wall Street before those of Main \nStreet. The mantra of the last 8 years was deregulation, deregulation, \nand more deregulation. The last White House refused to police lenders \nwhen they deceived and defrauded Americans looking for loans and \nnecessity to protect consumers when they were being abused.\n  The previous administration did nothing while Wall Street traders bid \nup the price of oil, took windfall profits, and left the tab for the \nrest of a Republican idea Warren Buffett called financial weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  It is interesting to note, I believe the Presiding Officer was in a \nmeeting last Thursday when Warren Buffett told us, in an effort to help \nGeneral Electric, he bought their credit division. He looked this over \nand found that some of the swaps were not due for 100 years--100 years. \nHe said he knew he couldn't help that and lost hundreds of millions of \ndollars. He said: I want nothing to do with that, even though the \noriginal investment was to help the economy. What Warren Buffett called \nfinancial weapons of mass destruction is what they were.\n  Instead, the previous administration sat and watched while the \nsubprime mortgage market sent millions into foreclosure and nowhere \nworse than in Nevada. It gave tax breaks to the wealthiest Americans \nbut gave no thought to how we would make up for the lost revenue.\n  It looked the other way while the executives who got us into this \nmess took home bonuses and golden parachutes and continued to look the \nother way while taxpayers, consumers, and investors were taken to the \ncleaners.\n  It declared war on fiscal responsibility and accountability. It said \nanything goes, but all Americans saw go were their jobs. That is all \nthey saw go. They saw their jobs, their homes, and their economic \nsecurity go down the drain.\n  The previous administration simply refused to safeguard the American \npeople from an impending crisis clearly visible on the horizon. It was \na time of blissful ignorance, at best, and willful neglect, at worst.\n  The hard-working Americans who lost everything did nothing wrong, but \ntheir leaders did nothing--period.\n  We all know what happened next. Our economy was paralyzed and credit \nwas frozen. Families and businesses were forced to make painful cuts--\ncuts that were felt in every corner of our country and every industry \nin our economy.\n\n  The stock market lost a third of its value in just a few months in \n2008. Consumer confidence was at an all-time low as the cost of living \nwent up and incomes went down. Families and financial institutions \nalike could not pay the bills. People could not get car loans, students \ncould not get college loans, and small businesses could not grow their \ncompanies.\n  Economic experts, from Nobel Prize winners to former Cabinet \nSecretaries, to Ivy League professors, said we needed to act fast to \nkeep a bad situation from getting worse.\n  Despite it all, those in the Bush White House and some Republicans in \nCongress told us the economy was fundamentally sound at a time when it \nwas fundamentally flawed.\n  The history books will tell the tale of what happened in the weeks \nand months after September 14, 2008: major investment banks that for \ndecades simply disappeared; institutions that were once synonymous with \nsuccess became synonymous with distress; and America took unprecedented \nsteps to stabilize a bleeding economy.\n  But the history books will also tell the tale of what happened before \nSeptember 14, 2008. The singular lesson from that gilded age is that we \ncannot wait until a system collapses before we act to save it.\n  Today, the system headed for its breaking point is the health \ninsurance system. We have already seen what happens when we do nothing \nabout rising health care costs and reckless health insurance policies. \nWe have already seen what happens when we let the market take care of \nitself, as some of my colleagues have urged us to do.\n  Over the past 8 years of inaction, the price of staying healthy in \nAmerica rose to record levels, and the number of Americans who cannot \nafford insurance did the same.\n  For the millions of families who file for foreclosure because they \ncannot afford both their house and their health care, not acting is not \nan option.\n  For the millions of Americans who filed for bankruptcy because their \nmedical bills grow higher and higher, not acting is not an option.\n  For the millions of Americans who skip doctor visits or treatments \nthey need to stay healthy or who never fill the prescriptions their \ndoctor gives them because health care is simply so expensive, not \nacting is not an option.\n  For the 600,000 Americans--including 46,000 from Nevada--who, we \nlearned last week, joined the ranks of the uninsured between 2007 and \n2008, not acting is not an option.\n  During that time, 600,000 Americans have lost their health insurance. \nIn Nevada, 220 families a day lose their health insurance. The number \nis much higher in densely populated States such as Virginia.\n  That is a lesson we need to hear extra loud today. We again see the \nstorm clouds gathering. This time they hover over the health care \nsystem. We again can predict the very real and very painful \nconsequences of not acting. We again see disaster but again one that is \navoidable. Again, we have a choice.\n  If we learn the lessons of the financial crisis, the choice we will \nmake is to put the future of the American people first. We will choose \nto recognize that working people, not greedy executives, are the \nbackbone of our economy, and we will choose to give them the security \nand stability they deserve.\n  We will choose to act in the short term for the sake of the long \nterm.\n  We will choose to put the American people first and fulfill our \nfundamental duty to promote their well-being.\n  We will choose to keep the insurance companies and government \nbureaucrats out of people's medical decisions.\n  We will choose to keep health care companies honest and accountable.\n  We will choose to give the American people more choices in their \nhealth care coverage.\n  And we will choose to make quality, affordable care available to \nevery single American.\n  Those in Congress who think we cannot afford health insurance reform \nsound an awful lot like those who didn't want to risk the windfall \nprofits during Wall Street's heyday.\n  Those in the health insurance business who let their profits and \nbonuses, rather than their conscience or ethics, guide their decisions \nsound an awful lot like those who got us into this mess in the first \nplace--those who saw all the warning signs and stuck their heads in the \nsand.\n  This country has no place for those who hope for failure and this \ntime has no patience for those who seek more of the same failed \npolicies.\n  George Santayana famously said:\n\n       Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat \n     it.\n\n  My response to those who want to ignore the lessons of last year is \nsimply we cannot afford to let history repeat itself.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9302-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9302]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the past months, Americans have \ngrown increasingly alarmed about the high levels of spending and debt \nwe have seen under the new administration. They have become \nincreasingly vocal about these concerns out of a growing sense that the \nWhite House does not seem to be listening to them, that it is talking \nover them.\n  Nowhere is this more apparent than in the debate over health care and \nnever more so than in the President's speech to Congress last week. For \nweeks and weeks, Americans had expressed their concerns about the \nDemocrats' health care proposals at townhall meetings across the \ncountry. Yet the President returned from the August break with a speech \nthat did not address any of them.\n\n[[Page S9303]]\n\n  Instead, he stated his intention to spend nearly $1 trillion on a \nplan he says will expand coverage without increasing costs or adding to \nthe deficit. These are precisely the claims Americans are finding so \ndifficult to square with reality. The speech itself was certainly well \ndelivered, but in the end Congress is not going to be asked to vote on \na speech. It is going to be asked to vote on specific legislation.\n  In my view, the President's speech only highlighted the concerns that \nmillions of Americans and Members of both parties in Congress continue \nto have with the Democratic plans for health care reform because when \nyou strip away the pageantry of the speech itself, what you are left \nwith is simply this: one more trillion-dollar government program and a \nwhole lot of unanswered questions about how we are going to pay for \nit. What is it going to mean for seniors and small business owners, and \nhow is it going to affect the quality and availability of care for \nmillions of Americans, the vast majority of whom are happy with the \ncare they have? These are legitimate questions, and it is unfair for \nanyone to dismiss those who ask them as either cranks or scaremongers. \nThe answers to these questions impact some of the most important \naspects of people's lives, and people just aren't getting answers.\n\n  Take the issue of cost. The President says he is going to pay for his \nplan by cutting waste, fraud, and abuse out of the system. That raises \na couple of questions. First of all, if there is such waste, fraud, and \nabuse, then why isn't the administration doing something about it \nalready? Second, if we are seeing this kind of waste, fraud, and abuse \nin an existing government program, why shouldn't we expect it to exist \nin the new government program the White House wants to create? Of \ncourse, we should root out waste, fraud, and abuse. I don't know \nanybody who is against that. But let's do it for its own sake, not to \njustify a very brandnew government program most Americans aren't even \nasking for.\n  How about Medicare? The administration plans to pay for much of its \nhealth care proposals with hundreds of billions of dollars in cuts to \nMedicare. A significant portion of this would involve cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage, a program that serves more than 11 million American seniors, \nnearly 90 percent of whom say they are satisfied with it. But faced \nwith questions about his proposed cuts to Medicare, the administration \ninsists services to seniors won't be cut. Mr. President, this is \nabsurd. How can the administration tell America's seniors with a \nstraight face that it is about to cut $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare but \nthat those cuts won't affect the program in any noticeable way?\n  What about the hundreds of billions of dollars the administration \nwould have to raise to pay for its plan even after its proposed cuts to \nMedicare? The White House hasn't said where it plans to get all of that \nmoney, but to most people, the answer is pretty obvious: more spending, \nmore taxes, higher deficits--or, most likely, all three.\n  What about the deficit? The White House says its health care plan \nwon't add a dollar to the deficit. How do they square that with the \nfact that the Congressional Budget Office has said repeatedly and \nunequivocally that every proposal they have seen would, in fact, add \nhundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit?\n  Any schoolkid in America could tell you that creating a massive new \ngovernment program will cost a lot of money, that cutting Medicare by \nhundreds of billions of dollars will lead to cuts in services people \ncurrently enjoy, and that higher taxes on small businesses will lead to \neven more job losses.\n  These are serious questions. The administration's response to them is \nnot. Their response is to accuse anyone who asks them of being a \nscaremonger and to give them the same two-word answer they gave \neverybody who questioned the stimulus: Trust us.\n  When it comes to health care, Americans are saying these arguments \ndon't add up. These are simple questions. The administration should \nanswer them. If they can't, it is even further validation that the \nquestions are worth asking.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9303-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

NORMAN BORLAUG\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to pay tribute \nto a fellow Iowan, Dr. Norman Borlaug, a 1970 Nobel Peace Prize \nlaureate. That honor--Dr. Borlaug's winning the Nobel Peace Prize--was \nbecause he was the father of the Green Revolution.\n  Dr. Borlaug passed away over the weekend at the age of 95. I am \nhonored to have known Dr. Borlaug. He was a remarkable man, a true son \nof the Iowa soil. A tenacity found through wrestling, a love of the \nsoil, and a twist of fate helped Dr. Borlaug develop the scientific \nbreakthroughs to ease malnutrition and famine around the globe. His \neffort to spare people from the sharp hunger pains that strike an empty \nstomach is an example for generations to come that one person can, in \nfact, make a difference--and, in his case, a big difference.\n  Dr. Borlaug's notoriety most often comes, as I have just said, as the \nfather of what is called the Green Revolution, a time when drastically \nincreased crop yields over a short period of years helped alleviate \nworld hunger. It is from this work that he is credited with saving more \nlives than any other person in history.\n  It is said that Dr. Borlaug's desire for a sufficient food supply \ncame from his childhood. He grew up in a small town on a family farm in \nnortheast Iowa. His education came in a one-room schoolhouse full of \nimmigrant children. It was there where he and his schoolmates learned \nthe common threads between them, similar to what their own parents \nlearned, that working together to provide food for their families was \nmore important than any ethnic differences that might divide them.\n  In true Iowa tradition, as a young man Dr. Borlaug was an outstanding \nwrestler. His wrestling skills took him to the University of Minnesota, \nwhere he, besides wrestling, earned a bachelor's and master's degree in \nforestry and, by a twist of fate, a doctorate in plant pathology.\n  It was after his graduation and World War II service that Dr. Borlaug \nfirst saw the plight of poverty-stricken wheat farmers in rural Mexico. \nIn the early going, his work in Mexico was discouraging, but Dr. \nBorlaug showed his tenacity and willingness to get dirt under his \nfingernails and, in fact, over a period of time ingratiated himself to \nthe local farmers. With the help of Mexican farmers, Dr. Borlaug and \nhis scientific team eventually developed a disease-resistant wheat--a \nbreakthrough in the fight against hunger.\n  His success in Mexico gave Dr. Borlaug the opportunity to help \ndeveloping countries all around the world. His innovative work brought \nan agricultural revolution to poor and hungry countries. I don't think \nit is a stretch to say that Norman Borlaug transformed these countries. \nHis work helped these countries avoid starvation and famine, but he \nalso helped to lift the social conditions and create more peaceful \nsocieties.\n  His commitment to this important cause has been recognized worldwide. \nI already alluded to the fact that he was a 1970 Nobel Peace Prize \nwinner. He is one of only five people to be awarded three different \nmedals of honor: the Nobel Peace Prize, the Presidential Medal of \nFreedom, and this Congress awarded him the Congressional Gold Medal. \nThat may not sound like much, but let's just put that into context. The \nother four recipients of all three of those awards--again, the Nobel \nPeace Prize, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the Congressional \nGold Medal--include Nelson Mandela, Elie Wiesel, Mother Teresa, and Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr.\n  Mr. President, Dr. Borlaug may not be a name known at every kitchen\n\n[[Page S9304]]\n\ntable, but this man is one of the greatest humanitarians who have ever \nlived. He dedicated his life to the development of scientific \nbreakthroughs in order to ease malnutrition and famine all over the \nworld.\n  One of Dr. Borlaug's latest efforts began in the early 1980s. There \nwasn't anything in the Nobel armada of prizes that represented \nagriculture, which is why he received the Peace Prize for recognition \nof his research in agriculture, and so Dr. Borlaug thought there ought \nto be an annual award for research in agriculture and helping with the \nproblems of food production. Through his initiative, the World Food \nPrize was initiated. It recognizes the achievement of individuals who \nhave advanced human development by improving the quality, quantity, and \navailability of food in the world. Just as Dr. Borlaug dreamed, the \nWorld Food Prize is helping to continue to inspire future generations \nof scientists and farmers to innovate and lift those mired in poverty \nand preserving Dr. Borlaug's legacy over the years. The World Food \nPrize is the idea of Dr. Borlaug, and so his scientific work will live \non.\n  The World Food Prize exists today because of the John Ruan family \nendowing it. They are an outstanding Des Moines business family, and \nthey have endowed this. President of the World Food Prize is the former \nAmbassador to Cambodia, Dr. Ken Quinn.

Mr. President, according to news accounts, there are \napproximately 32 or 34 so-called czars in the Obama White House and \ngovernment. Respected voices in the Senate--Senator Byrd, a senior \nDemocrat and Senator Hutchison, a senior Republican--have pointed out \nthat these czars are an affront to the Constitution. They are anti-\ndemocratic. They are a poor example of a new era of transparency, which \nis what was promised to this country. I would add that they are a poor \nway to manage the government, and they seem to me to be the principal \nsymptom of this administration's 8-month record of too many Washington \ntakeovers. We have an AIDS czar, an auto recovery czar, a border czar, \nand a California water czar. We have a car czar, a central region czar, \nand a domestic violence czar. There is an economic czar, an energy and \nenvironment czar, a faith-based czar and a Great Lakes czar. The list \ngoes on, up to 32 or 34. One of these, for example, is the pay czar, \nMr. Kenneth Feinberg, the Treasury Department's Special Master for \nCompensation. He will approve pay packages at seven firms receiving \nTARP funds, thus deciding how much pay is too much. This will affect \nthe top earners at some of the major corporations in America.\n  According to Mr. Feinberg, in answer to some questions, he said:\n\n       The statute provides guideposts but the statute ultimately \n     says I have discretion to decide what it is that these people \n     should make and that my determination will be final. Anything \n     is possible under the law.\n\n  That is the pay czar. Then we have a manufacturing czar. The \nmanufacturing czar's name is Mr. Ron Bloom. He is also the car czar. We \nhave had manufacturing czars before in other administrations, but as \nRollcall pointed out on September 8, Mr. Bloom's background and new \nposition differs from the two czars who served under former President \nGeorge W. Bush:\n\n       Bloom is a former union official, remaining close to \n     leaders in organized labor. Bush's manufacturing czars were \n     placed in the Commerce Department. Bloom, on the other hand, \n     was entrusted with a high profile Presidential task force on \n     autos, and will operate within an office that has broad \n     authority over domestic policy. He will head the auto task \n     force which is in the Treasury Department.\n       According to the policy director for the AFL-CIO, Mr. Bloom \n     is expected to have a major role in the development of \n     climate change legislation. So-called buy American provisions \n     that favor home-grown products, and tax credits for domestic \n     industry need to be included, said the policy director for \n     the AFL/CIO, in the climate change provision. If it's not \n     done right, the President could lose votes, said the AFL/CIO \n     Policy Director.\n\n  In other words, Mr. Bloom may end up being the protectionist czar as \nwell.\n  Then there is the health czar, a very distinguished Tennessean, \nNancy-Ann DeParle, a very able woman I know well. But who is in charge \nof health care policy? Is it the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, confirmed by the Senate, accountable to the Congress, \naccountable, therefore, to the people of the country? Or is it someone \nin the White House who, an administration official says will ``wake up \nevery morning focused on health care reform, and she is going to be \nfocused on that the entire day through?''\n  There have been czars in the White House, at least since President \nFranklin D. Roosevelt. Of the 32 or 34 we have today--and I am using \nthose two numbers because there are different reports and 2 or 3 czar \npositions are vacant--only 8 are confirmed by the Senate. We have had \nczars before, but there has never been anything quite like this.\n  Let me take my concerns one by one. Article I of the Constitution of \nthe United States gives to the Congress the appropriations power and \nsets up, in articles II and III, the executive and judicial branches, a \nsystem of checks and balances to make sure no one branch of the Federal \nGovernment runs away with the government. Senator Robert Byrd, the \nPresident pro tempore of the Senate, wrote a letter to President Obama \non February 23. Senator Byrd, who is often called the Constitutional \nconscience of the Senate, expressed his concern over the increasing \nappointments of White House czars and the relationship between these \nnew positions and their executive branch counterparts, noting:\n\n       Too often, I have seen these lines of authority and \n     responsibility become tangled and blurred, sometimes \n     purposely, to shield information and to obscure the decision-\n     making process.\n\n  That is Senator Byrd speaking. He goes on to say:\n\n       The rapid and easy accumulation of power by White House \n     staff can threaten the Constitutional system of checks and \n     balances. At the worst, White House staff have taken \n     direction and control of programmatic areas that are the \n     statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.\n\n  Continuing:\n\n       As presidential assistants and advisers, these White House \n     staffers are not accountable for their actions to the \n     Congress, to Cabinet officials, and to virtually anyone but \n     the president. They rarely testify before congressional \n     committees, and often shield the information and decision-\n     making process behind the assertion of executive privilege. \n     In too many instances, White House staff have been allowed to \n     inhibit openness and transparency, and reduce accountability.\n\n  More recently, one of the senior Republicans, Senator Kay Bailey \nHutchison of Texas, who is the senior Republican on the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, said in an op-ed in \nthe Washington Post:\n\n       I oversee legislation and agencies that cover policy areas \n     as vast and varied as trade, technology, transit, consumer \n     protection and commercial regulation. As many as 10 of the 32 \n     czars functionally fall under my committee's jurisdiction. \n     Yet neither I nor the committee chairmen have clear authority \n     to compel these czars to appear before our panel and report \n     what they are doing. The Obama administration presented only \n     two of these officials for our consideration before they \n     assumed their duties. We have had no opportunity to probe the \n     others' credentials.\n\n  That is Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have printed in the Record following my remarks the comments \nof Senator Robert Byrd and the op-ed of Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1).\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. As the Senator said, many of these czars have no \nvetting by the Senators, no appropriation requests to be considered by \nus, no testimony given, and answer no hard\n\n[[Page S9305]]\n\nquestions. Who is making the policy, then, on health care, on climate \nchange, on energy?\n  I have been reading President James K. Polk's diaries. I may be the \nonly one in the United States reading them these days. They are \nactually very interesting. He wrote down every night what he did that \nday, back in the 1840s. Among the things he did, he had a Cabinet \nmeeting every Tuesday and Saturday and every major issue that came \nbefore him, whether it was the war with Mexico, annexation of Texas, \nthe argument with Great Britain about what to do in Oregon--he \nsubmitted all those questions to his Cabinet, and then the Cabinet, of \ncourse, had to go before the Congress and testify. He didn't always \nagree with the Cabinet.\n  Secretary of State Buchanan disagreed with President Polk quite a \nbit, but Secretary Buchanan then had to go before the Congress and come \nback and tell the President what he heard. That was a long time ago, \nbut what the Framers had in mind was checks and balances where the \nPresident leads the country, the Cabinet manages the government, and \nthe Cabinet, as the managers of the government, are accountable to the \npeople through their elected Representatives.\n  The 32 or 34 czars are not representative of the way the American \nsystem of government is supposed to work. This is not an era of \ntransparency. It creates so much centralization of power that it is the \nantithesis of freedom, which is the principal characteristic, the \nprincipal aspect of the American character.\n  The second aspect of this large number of czars that is troublesome \nis the issue of managing the government. Forty years ago, I worked in \nthe White House for President Nixon under a wise man named Bryce \nHarlow.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in morning business until I am \nfinished with my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. Harlow had worked for President Eisenhower. He was \na wise counselor to President Johnson. He knew a lot about how the \nAmerican Government is supposed to work. He said to me, then a very \nyoung staff member--he said:\n\n       Lamar, our job here in the White House is to push the \n     merely important issues out of the White House so that we can \n     reserve to the President only that handful of truly \n     Presidential issues.\n       George Reedy, who was Lyndon Johnson's Press Secretary, \n     wrote:\n       The job of the President is three things--to see an urgent \n     need, to develop a strategy to meet the need, and persuade \n     half the people he's right.\n\n  Mr. Reedy didn't say anything about managing the Government of the \nUnited States out of the White House. He talked about leading the \ncountry.\n  Our current President is very skilled at persuading half the people \nhe is right. He has demonstrated that in an election. He continues to \ndemonstrate that with his speeches. That is not the issue. The issue is \nwhether he ought to bring into the White House, or closer to him into \nthe government, a large group of men and women who are accountable to \nhim but not accountable to anybody else. It is not good for the \nPresident of the United States, I would submit, to have close to him \npeople he listens to who do not have to listen to anybody else, or at \nleast who do not have to listen to the elected Representatives of \ngovernment.\n  Everyone knows the first thing that happens when a new President is \nelected is people pick offices, and which office do they pick? They \nwant the office closest to the President because it is an unwritten \nrule in Washington DC, that influence in Washington is measured in \ndirect proportion to the number of inches one is physically from the \nPresident of the United States. So the First Lady usually ends up with \nthe most influence. After that, go right down the hall in the West Wing \nover to the Executive Office Building. After a while you get out around \nthe Cabinet offices.\n  I used to be in one of the Cabinet offices in the first President \nBush's administration. It is true, the persons with the most influence \nwith the President are almost always the men and women who are closest \nto him.\n  The other aspect of management that this seems to contravene in the \nWhite House is the ``one thing at a time'' idea. One thing at a time is \nbest exemplified, I suggest, by President Eisenhower when he said ``I \nshall go to Korea.'' He said that more than a half century ago when the \nbig issue before the country--there were many, but the biggest issue \nwas the Korean war. President Eisenhower said, in October of the \nelection year, ``I shall go to Korea,'' and in December he went. And he \nsaid to the American people, ``I will focus my attention on the war in \nKorea. It will have my full attention until the matter is concluded.''\n  Because he was President and because he had capacity for leadership, \npeople believed he would probably get that one thing done. In fact he \ndid because, in our system of government, people know if the President \nselects a single issue--say it is health care, say it is climate \nchange, say it is resolving the debt, or fixing Social Security--if he \npicks one thing and throws himself into that for as long as he is \nthere, the odds are he is going to wear everybody else out. He might \nhave to compromise a little bit along the way.\n  I used to think this as Governor--and the Presiding Officer was once \nGovernor in Virginia. Often our best proposals would get changed in the \nlegislature. I learned a long time ago you could either condemn that or \nsay: Well, they improved my proposal. Give the other side some credit, \nand go on to the next issue.\n  But a Governor and certainly a President who picks one thing can get \na lot done. We have a lot of very talented people in and around the \nPresident. The President himself is highly intelligent and well liked \nby the American people, as well as he is by those of us in the Senate. \nBut sometimes I am afraid the Obama White House resembles the Harvard \nLaw Review meeting where everybody has a bright idea, everybody is very \nsmart, but everyone forgets that someone has to be the operator. \nSomeone has to make it run. Someone has to pick one thing and lean into \nit for as long as it goes.\n  My point is, having a large number of bright advisers or czars for \nevery issue under the Sun, clustered around the President, coming up \nwith bright ideas, and who are unaccountable to the Congress for most \nof what they have to say, is not the best way for a President to pick a \nsingle, major issue--let's say health care--and lead the country.\n  Finally, the number of czars we now have today, who have accumulated \nover the last several administrations and today have reached a record \nlevel is anti-democratic. Czars are usually Russians; they are not \nAmericans. Czars are usually imperialists, not Democrats.\n  The dictionary says a czar is an autocratic ruler or leader or an \nemperor or king. A czar is not associated with a democracy, not \nassociated with an era of transparency.\n  Czars are alien to our way of thinking and our way of government. I \nam afraid czars are becoming a symbol of this administration and the \nnumber of Washington takeovers. Let me not just use my own words, a New \nYork Times article today said:\n\n       But one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off \n     a series of federal interventions, the government is the \n     nation's biggest lender, insurer, automaker and guarantor \n     against risk for investors large and small.\n       Between financial rescue missions and the economic stimulus \n     program, Government spending accounts for a bigger share of \n     the nation's economy--26 percent--than at any time since \n     World War II. The Government is financing 9 out of 10 new \n     mortgages in the United States. If you buy a car from General \n     Motors, you are buying from a company that is 60 percent \n     owned by the Government.\n  If you take out a car loan or run up your credit card, the chances \nare good that the Government is financing both your debt and that of \nyour bank. And if you buy life insurance from the American \nInternational Group, you will be buying from a company that is almost \n80 percent Federally owned.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this article \nfrom September 14 following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2).\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Czars are becoming a symbol of a runaway government in \nWashington with too many Washington takeovers. Dr. Samuel Johnson, the \nBritish moralist a few centuries ago, was once introduced to a talking \ndog in a London pub. The proud owner\n\n[[Page S9306]]\n\nof the dog asked Dr. Johnson what did he think of how well his dog \ntalked.\n  Dr. Johnson is reported to have said, he was not so impressed with \nhow well the dog talked, but that the dog talked at all.\n  That is about the way I feel about the nearly three dozen White House \nczars and government czars. I am not so worried about who they are, I \nam worried that the czars are there at all. I believe that the American \npeople in addition to respected Senators, such as Senator Byrd on the \nother side of the aisle, and Senator Hutchison on this side of the \naisle, sense this is a problem.\n  My respectful suggestion to the President is along the same lines as \nSenator Byrd and Senator Hutchison have made. I believe it is time to \npush these czars out of the White House, and leave the management of \ngovernment to the managers of government in the Cabinet and the \npositions in the departments of government who are accountable to the \nCongress. The positions who are accountable for their confirmation, \naccountable to answer the questions of Members of Congress, accountable \nfor appropriations that have to be approved by Congress before they can \nspend the people's money. That is the American way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the list of \nczars published in the newspaper Politico on September 4.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 3).\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Byrd Questions Obama Administration on Role of White House ``Czar'' \n                               Positions\n\n       Washington, DC--Senator Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., the \n     Constitutional conscience of the Senate, has written to \n     President Barack Obama expressing his concerns over the \n     increasing appointments of White House ``czars,'' and the \n     relationship between these new White House positions and \n     their executive branch counterparts, noting that ``too often, \n     I have seen these lines of authority and responsibility \n     become tangled and blurred, sometimes purposely, to shield \n     information and to obscure the decision-making process.''\n       Byrd, in his February 23 letter, specifically referenced \n     the creation of new White House Offices of Health Reform, \n     Urban Affairs Policy, and Energy and Climate Change Policy, \n     noting that ``the rapid and easy accumulation of power by \n     White House staff can threaten the Constitutional system of \n     checks and balances. At the worst, White House staff have \n     taken direction and control of programmatic areas that are \n     the statutory responsibility of Senate-confirmed officials.''\n       ``As presidential assistants and advisers, these White \n     House staffers are not accountable for their actions to the \n     Congress, to cabinet officials, and to virtually anyone but \n     the president.

Andrews and David E. Sanger)\n\n       Washington.--When President Obama travels to Wall Street on \n     Monday to speak from Federal Hall, where the founders once \n     argued bitterly over how much the government should control \n     the national economy, he is likely to cast himself as a \n     ``reluctant shareholder'' in America's biggest industries and \n     financial institutions.\n       But one year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers set off \n     a series of federal interventions, the government is the \n     nation's biggest lender, insurer, automaker and guarantor \n     against risk for investors large and small.\n       Between financial rescue missions and the economic stimulus \n     program, government spending accounts for a bigger share of \n     the nation's economy--26 percent--than at any time since \n     World War II. The government is financing 9 out of 10 new \n     mortgages in the United States. If you buy a car from General \n     Motors, you are buying from a company that is 60 percent \n     owned by the government.\n       If you take out a car loan or run up your credit card, the \n     chances are good that the government is financing both your \n     debt and that of your bank.\n       And if you buy life insurance from the American \n     International Group, you will be buying from a company that \n     is almost 80 percent federally owned.\n       Mr. Obama plans to argue, his aides say, that these \n     government intrusions will be temporary. At the same time, \n     however, he will push hard for an increased government role \n     in overseeing the financial system to prevent a repeat of the \n     excesses that caused the crisis.\n       ``These were extraordinary provisions of support, not part \n     of a permanent program,'' said Lawrence H. Summers, director \n     of the National Economic Council at the White House. ``You're \n     seeing a process of exit every day. It's a process that's \n     going to take quite some time, but the prospects are much \n     brighter today than they were nine months ago.''\n       That process unfolds every day in a bland bureaucrat's \n     haven, an annex connected by an underground tunnel to the \n     Treasury's main building on Pennsylvania Avenue. There, about \n     200 civil servants--accountants, lawyers, former investment \n     bankers--oversee the $700 billion program that pumps taxpayer \n     money into banks, insurance companies and two of Detroit's \n     Big Three auto companies.\n       In the main Treasury building, senior officials hold veto \n     power over executive pay packages for the biggest recipients \n     of government loans, like Citigroup and Bank of America. A \n     separate group, working closely with the Federal Reserve Bank \n     of New York, oversees the multibillion-dollar bailout of \n     American International Group. Ten blocks away, at the Federal \n     Reserve, officials are still providing the emergency \n     liquidity that keeps a battered economy moving.\n       To Mr. Obama's critics, thousands of whom took to the \n     streets of Washington this weekend to protest a new era of \n     big government, all these efforts are part of a plan to \n     dismantle free-market capitalism. On the ground it looks \n     quite different, as a new president and his team try to \n     define the proper role, both as owners and regulators.\n\n\n                       A Light Hand on the Reins\n\n       Far from eagerly micromanaging the companies the government \n     owns, Mr. Obama and his economic team have often labored \n     mightily to avoid exercising control even when government \n     money was the only thing keeping some companies afloat.\n       A few weeks ago, there were anguished grimaces inside the \n     Treasury Department as the new chief executive of A.I.G., \n     Robert H. Benmosche, whose roughly $9 million pay package is \n     22 times greater than Mr. Obama's, ridiculed officials in \n     Washington--his majority shareholders--as ``crazies.''\n       Causing even more unease to policymakers, Mr. Benmosche \n     insisted that A.I.G.--one of the worst offenders in the risk-\n     taking that sent the nation over the edge last year--would \n     not rush to sell its businesses at fire-sale prices, despite \n     pressure from Fed and Treasury officials, who are desperate \n     to have the insurer repay its $180 billion government \n     bailout.\n       But in the end, according to one senior official, ``no one \n     called him and told him to shut up,'' and no one has pulled \n     rank and told him to sell assets as soon as possible to repay \n     the loans.\n       A similar hands-off decision was made about the auto \n     companies. Shortly after General Motors and Chrysler emerged \n     from bankruptcy, some members of the administration's auto \n     task force argued that the group should not go out of \n     business until it was confident that a new management team in \n     Detroit had a handle on what needed to be done.\n       But Mr. Summers strongly rejected that approach, and the \n     Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, agreed.\n       ``The argument was that if the president said he wasn't \n     elected to run G.M., then we couldn't hire a new board and \n     then try to run any aspect of it,'' one participant in the \n     discussions said. The auto task force took off for summer \n     vacation in July, and it never returned.\n       But it will probably be several years before the government \n     can begin to sell its stake in G.M. back to the public, and \n     even then, according a report issued last week by the \n     independent monitor of the Troubled Asset Relief Program, \n     some of the $20 billion or so funneled to G.M. and Chrysler \n     is probably gone forever.\n\n\n                         Winding Down Programs\n\n       By contrast, Mr. Obama's team and the Federal Reserve have \n     been more successful than generally recognized at winding \n     down many of the support programs for banks. Nearly three \n     dozen financial institutions have repaid $70 billion in loans \n     to the Treasury, and officials predict that $50 billion more \n     will be repaid over the next 18 months. Indeed, the \n     government has earned tidy profit on the first round of \n     repayments.\n       One of the biggest backstops has been the Temporary \n     Liquidity Guarantee Program of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation, which now guarantees about $300 billion worth of \n     bonds issued by banks.\n\n[[Page S9307]]\n\n       The volume of new guarantees has declined to less than $5 \n     billion a month in August from more than $90 billion a month \n     earlier this year. The F.D.I.C. announced last week that it \n     would either end the program entirely on Oct. 31 or reduce it \n     further by substantially increasing the fees that banks have \n     to pay.\n       Similarly, one of the Fed's biggest emergency loan \n     programs, the Term Auction Facility, has shrunk by more than \n     half in the last 12 months. A second big program, which \n     finances short-term i.o.u.'s for businesses, has shrunk to \n     $124 billion, from $332 billion a year ago.\n       Obama administration officials bristle at even the hint \n     that their rescue measures have ushered in a new era of ``big \n     government.''\n       But supporters and critics alike worry that it will be \n     difficult to shrink the government to anything like its \n     former role. For one thing, Mr. Obama is determined to expand \n     government regulation of business and to beef up federal \n     protections for consumers.\n\n\n                         Seeking More Oversight\n\n       Mr. Obama's proposals to overhaul the system of financial \n     regulation would give the Fed new powers to supervise giant \n     financial institutions whose failure could threaten the \n     entire financial system.\n       To limit the dangers posed by insolvent institutions that \n     are ``too big to fail,'' the F.D.I.C. would receive new \n     authority to close them in an orderly way.\n       The administration would impose much tougher regulation \n     over the vast market for financial derivatives like credit-\n     default swaps and other exotic instruments for hedging risk.\n       It would also create an entirely new Consumer Financial \n     Protection Agency, which would have broad power to regulate \n     most forms of consumer lending.\n       In his speech on Monday, White House officials say, Mr. \n     Obama will step up pressure on Wall Street to accept tougher \n     oversight. Even though his proposals have made little headway \n     in Congress, largely because of the battle over health care, \n     Democratic lawmakers said they were determined to pass \n     comprehensive legislation by next year.\n       ``Big government now is the consequence of too little \n     government before,'' said Representative Barney Frank, \n     chairman of the House Financial Services Committee. ``What \n     you have right now, with the government owning companies, is \n     the result of insufficient regulation before.''\n       On a practical level, experts say it will take years for \n     the government to unwind some of its rescue programs.\n       Thanks to the mortgage crisis and the collapse in housing \n     prices, private investors have fled the mortgage market, and \n     the federal government now finances about 9 out of 10 new \n     home loans in the United States.\n       The Treasury took over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the \n     government-sponsored finance companies that own or have \n     guaranteed more than $5 trillion in mortgages, in the first \n     week of September 2008. Fannie and Freddie now buy or \n     guarantee almost two-thirds of all new mortgages. The Federal \n     Housing Administration guarantees another 25 percent.\n       The cost of keeping the two giant companies afloat has been \n     huge. The Treasury has provided Fannie and Freddie with $95 \n     billion to cover losses tied to soaring default rates and \n     losses in value on their own mortgage portfolios. Analysts \n     predict that the companies will need considerably more in the \n     year ahead. At the same time, the Fed is buying almost all \n     the new mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie Mae, \n     Freddie Mac and the F.H.A. Buying up those securities drives \n     up their price and pushes down their effective interest \n     rates, and ultimately lowers borrowing costs to homebuyers.\n\n\n                           An Enormous Scale\n\n       The scale of the Fed's intervention has been staggering. \n     The central bank has acquired more than $700 billion in \n     mortgage-backed securities so far, and officials have said \n     they will buy up to $1.25 trillion--a goal that should take \n     the Fed until early next year. To help Fannie and Freddie \n     raise the money they need to buy mortgages from lenders, the \n     Fed is also buying $200 billion of their bonds.\n       All told, the government is propping up almost the entire \n     mortgage market and, by extension, the housing industry.\n       As the government backs away from its rescue operations, \n     economists and others worry about unknown consequences. Some \n     analysts are already predicting that mortgage rates will bump \n     higher when the Fed stops buying mortgage securities, \n     potentially delaying a recovery in housing.\n       But the much bigger puzzle is how the government will \n     untangle Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with their combustible \n     mix of taxpayer support, public policy goals and for-profit \n     structures.\n       ``It will be very difficult to unwind, having stepped in as \n     big as they did,'' said Howard Glaser, a senior housing \n     official during the Clinton administration and now an \n     industry consultant in Washington. ``There is no structure, \n     no mechanism, for private investors to come back into the \n     market.''\n       Other experts and policy makers have begun to raise broader \n     concerns. Even if the Obama administration and the Fed do \n     manage to shrink the government's role to precrisis levels, \n     has the government's immense rescue simply set the stage for \n     more frequent interventions in the future?\n       ``This crisis, whether it's because of the Fed or the \n     Treasury or Congress, has created a lot of new moral \n     hazards,'' said Charles I. Plosser, president of the Federal \n     Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. ``Once you have done this once, \n     even though it was in a severe crisis, the temptation will be \n     for people to figure that in the next crisis you'll do it \n     again. You've got to figure out a way to say no.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Sept. 13, 2009]\n\n                           Czarist Washington\n\n                       (By Kay Bailey Hutchinson)\n\n       The Framers of the Constitution knew that the document \n     founding our democracy must be the anchor of liberty and the \n     blueprint for its preservation. Wisely, they provided a \n     balance of powers to ensure that no individual and no single \n     arm of government could ever wield unchecked authority \n     against the American people.\n       Nearly 250 years later, these critical lines of separation \n     are being obscured by a new class of federal officials. A few \n     of them have formal titles, but most are simply known as \n     ``czars.'' They hold unknown levels of power over broad \n     swaths of policy. Under the Obama administration, we have an \n     unprecedented 32 czar posts (a few of which it has yet to \n     fill), including a ``car czar,'' a ``pay czar'' and an \n     ``information czar.'' There are also czars assigned to some \n     of the broadest and most consequential topics in policy, \n     including health care, terrorism, economics and key \n     geographic regions.\n       So what do these czars do? Do they advise the president? Or \n     do they impose the administration's agenda on the heads of \n     federal agencies and offices who have been vetted and \n     confirmed by the Senate? Unfortunately--and in direct \n     contravention of the Framers' intentions--virtually no one \n     can say with certainty what these individuals do or what \n     limits are placed on their authority. We don't know if they \n     are influencing or implementing policy. We don't know if they \n     possess philosophical views or political affiliations that \n     are inappropriate or overreaching in the context of their \n     work.\n       This is precisely the kind of ambiguity the Framers sought \n     to prevent. Article One tasks the legislative branch with \n     establishing federal agencies, defining what they do, \n     determining who leads them and overseeing their operations. \n     Article Two requires the president to seek the advice and \n     consent of the Senate when appointing certain officials to \n     posts of consequence. Thus, authority is shared between \n     government branches, guaranteeing the American people \n     transparency and accountability.\n       As the senior Republican on the Senate Committee on \n     Commerce, Science and Transportation, I oversee legislation \n     and agencies that cover policy areas as vast and varied as \n     trade, technology, transit, consumer protection and \n     commercial regulation. As many as 10 of the 32 czars \n     functionally fall under my committee's jurisdiction. Yet \n     neither I nor the committee chairman have clear authority to \n     compel these czars to appear before our panel and report what \n     they are doing. The Obama administration presented only two \n     of these officials for our consideration before they assumed \n     their duties. We have had no opportunity to probe the others' \n     credentials.\n       Recently we saw the kinds of dangerous details that can \n     slip by when a powerful federal official isn't put through \n     the Senate confirmation process. Before assuming the post of \n     ``green jobs czar,'' Van Jones had engaged in such \n     troublesome activities as endorsement of fringe theories \n     about the Sept. 11 attacks. He has ties to a socialist group. \n     The Senate confirmation process would typically provide an \n     appropriate forum for identifying and discussing these types \n     of issues and for allowing for public input. Jones's case \n     highlighted the lack of accountability that is becoming \n     commonplace under the Obama administration.\n       While Jones rightly resigned, there are dozens of other \n     administration czars about whom we still know very little. It \n     is Congress's duty to know who is serving at the highest \n     levels of government, what they are doing, and what \n     qualifications or complications these people bring to the \n     job. It is also our responsibility to make this information \n     known to the people who have elected us to serve and protect \n     them. This is how we ensure accountability.\n       The deployment of this many czars sets a dangerous \n     precedent that undermines the Constitution's guarantee of \n     separated powers. It must be stopped. President Obama should \n     submit each of his many policy czars to the Senate so that we \n     can review their qualifications, roles and the limits on \n     their authority. To deliver anything less is to deny the \n     American public the accountability and transparency the \n     Constitution guarantees.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n                     [From Politico, Sept. 4, 2009]\n\n                      President Obama's ``Czars''\n\n       Politico has compiled a wide-ranging list of President \n     Barack Obama's various ``czars.''

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are again here on Monday afternoon \ntalking about a very important bill that came to the floor last \nThursday. That is the investment in infrastructure, transportation, and \nhousing across the country. We have many issues important to many \nMembers who want to get this bill passed and to the President as \nquickly as possible so we can move forward. My colleague from Missouri \nand I have worked very hard to put the bill together. We are here this \nafternoon ready and waiting for our colleagues to offer amendments so \nwe can get to final passage. I know the majority leader wishes us to \nfinish this fairly quickly. We have a number of appropriations bills we \nwant to complete before the end of September deadline. So we ask our \ncolleagues to get their amendments up, and we will move through them as \nquickly as we can.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I echo what the chairman of our \nsubcommittee, the Senator from Washington, has said. We have had it out \nnow. We have had this bill out. It has been on the floor since \nThursday. We had Friday and the weekend to look at it. A number of my \ncolleagues, many on this side of the aisle, have talked about offering \namendments. I hope they will be ready to bring those amendments down. I \nthink one or two are going to be offered this afternoon so we can have \nvotes scheduled at 5:30, as the majority leader has suggested. It is \nnot only the majority leader, it is the Senator from Washington and I \nwho are urging people to come down. This is a very important bill. \nEverybody has transportation needs, concerns, and issues. Housing is \nsuch a significant challenge right now, given the situation in the \nfinancial markets and the situation with housing. We have many people \nwho are dependent upon federally supported housing. We need to make \nsure we have the funds made available to take care of their needs.\n  We have special needs projects such as the VASH program for veterans \nwith assisted housing that the Chair and I have entered into. That is \nvery important for bringing our service men and women home and giving \nthem the right kind of accommodation. All of these things are in the \ncontext of significant financial problems in the Federal Housing \nAdministration. FHA, if you read the papers, is at a crisis point. I \nhave described it as a ticking timebomb. Regrettably, I think that is \nstill an accurate calculation. We have funds to provide to HUD and to \nthe Secretary of HUD, to the IG and others, to deal with problems \nbefore they become more serious. So we need to get this bill passed.\n  I hope our colleagues would bring their amendments forward. We will \nonly be able to vote until 3 o'clock tomorrow afternoon. We would \nappreciate them bringing as many amendments as they can forward before \nthen, this afternoon and tomorrow, so we can go about the business of \nconferencing with the House, getting a measure that will get to the \nPresident so he can sign it and put these critically important funds to \nwork.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2355\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 2355 be called \nup.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2355.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: Prohibiting direct or indirect use of funds to fund the \n     Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN))\n\n       After section 414, insert the following:\n       Sec. 4__. None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be directly or indirectly distributed to the Association \n     of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN).\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment \npertaining to ACORN, otherwise known as the Association of Community \nOrganizations for Reform Now.\n  Records will indicate that ACORN has received $53 million in Federal \nfunds--taxpayer money--since 1994. In the current transportation and \nhousing appropriations bill, ACORN is eligible to add to that number, \nto receive millions more in taxpayer funds from several different \naccounts and purposes. It could receive money through mortgage \ncounseling, it could receive money through CDBG, community development \nblock grants, and it could receive money from the Neighborhood \nStabilization Program.\n  The people of Nebraska sent me to Washington to protect them from \nwaste and fraud and abuse, and they asked me to change the status quo. \nI take that responsibility very seriously. That is why my amendment \nwould prohibit one more penny--one more penny--of taxpayer money from \ngoing to ACORN in the transportation and housing appropriations bill.\n  The recent news surrounding ACORN is alarming, at a minimum. In fact, \nit is outrageous. Last week, Miami-Dade prosecutors issued arrest \nwarrants for 11 ACORN employees. The employees are charged with \nfalsifying voter registration cards. A total of 1,400 voter \nregistration cards were turned in, and 888 of those cards were found to \nbe a fake. This means almost three-quarters of the voting cards were \nfraudulent. Then, damaging news surfaced regarding hidden videotapes at \nthe Baltimore and Washington, DC, ACORN offices. You will not believe \nthis: They feature ACORN employees offering advice on illegal \nactivities, including tax evasion, prostitution, and fraud. Today we \nfind out that a different ACORN office--this time in Brooklyn--also \noffered advice on the same topics. I\n\n[[Page S9309]]\n\nwould suggest, obviously, this is a pattern of very rotten behavior. \nWell, the alarm bells are rightly going off.\n  The Census Bureau notified ACORN on Friday that it is severing all \nties with the group for all work having to do with the 2010 census. \nNotwithstanding the fact that is long overdue, I applaud them for that \naction.\n  The Census letter pulled no punches, and I am quoting:\n\n     . . . it is clear that ACORN's affiliation with the 2010 \n     Census promotion has caused sufficient concern in the general \n     public, has indeed become a distraction from our mission, and \n     may even become a discouragement to public cooperation, \n     negatively impacting 2010 Census efforts. Unfortunately, we \n     no longer have confidence--\n\n  ``We no longer have confidence''--\n\n     that our national partnership agreement is being effectively \n     managed through your many local offices. For the reasons \n     stated, we therefore have decided to terminate the \n     partnership.\n\n  Some may even say today, as amazing as this would sound, that the \nrecent events are isolated, that they are not a fair and accurate \nrepresentation of ACORN. How you could say that I am not sure, but to \nthese defenders, I urge them to read the 88-page incriminating report \npublished in July by the minority staff of the House Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform. It is entitled--and, again, I am \nquoting, and I have the report here--``Is ACORN Intentionally \nStructured as a Criminal Enterprise?''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Executive Summary of \nthat report be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and Government \n              Reform, Darrell Issa (CA-49), Ranking Member\n\n      Is ACORN Intentionally Structured as a Criminal Enterprise?\n\n\n                          I. Executive Summary\n\n       ``We should be unfaithful to ourselves if we should ever \n     lose sight of the danger to our liberties if anything partial \n     or extraneous should infect the purity of our free, fair, \n     virtuous, and independent elections''--President John Adams, \n     Inaugural Address, 1797.\n       The Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now \n     (ACORN) has repeatedly and deliberately engaged in systemic \n     fraud. Both structurally and operationally, ACORN hides \n     behind a paper wall of nonprofit corporate protections to \n     conceal a criminal conspiracy on the part of its directors, \n     to launder federal money in order to pursue a partisan \n     political agenda and to manipulate the American electorate.\n       Emerging accounts of widespread deceit and corruption raise \n     the need for a criminal investigation of ACORN. By \n     intentionally blurring the legal distinctions between 361 \n     tax-exempt and non-exempt entities, ACORN diverts taxpayer \n     and tax-exempt monies into partisan political activities. \n     Since 1994, more than $53 million in federal funds have been \n     pumped into ACORN, and under the Obama administration, ACORN \n     stands to receive a whopping $8.5 billion in available \n     stimulus funds.\n       Operationally, ACORN is a shell game played in 120 cities, \n     43 states and the District of Columbia through a complex \n     structure designed to conceal illegal activities, to use \n     taxpayer and tax-exempt dollars for partisan political \n     purposes, and to distract investigators. Structurally, ACORN \n     is a chess game in which senior management is shielded from \n     accountability by multiple layers of volunteers and \n     compensated employees who serve as pawns to take the fall for \n     every bad act.\n       The report that follows presents evidence obtained from \n     former ACORN insiders that completes the picture of a \n     criminal enterprise.\n       First, ACORN has evaded taxes, obstructed justice, engaged \n     in self dealing, and aided and abetted a cover-up of \n     embezzlement by Dale Rathke, the brother of ACORN founder \n     Wade Rathke.\n       Committee investigators have established that a violation \n     of corporate duties led to gross abuses of tax laws and other \n     federal regulations. According to documents obtained from \n     insiders, ACORN was made aware of its lax management \n     structure but chose to ignore the problems and continue a \n     cover-up of criminal activity. By refusing to report Dale \n     Rathke's embezzlement of $948,607.50 as an excess benefit \n     transaction, ACORN appears to have violated the Internal \n     Revenue Code. ACORN's cover-up of the embezzlement for more \n     than eight years would also constitute obstruction of \n     justice.\n       Second, ACORN has committed investment fraud, deprived the \n     public of its right to honest services, and engaged in a \n     racketeering enterprise affecting interstate commerce.\n       Committee investigators have documented ACORN's use of \n     charitable contributions against donor intent, typified by \n     ACORN's secret transfer of donor funds to recover losses due \n     to embezzlement. Moreover, ACORN comingles the accounts of \n     federally-funded affiliates with politically-active \n     affiliates and lacks sufficient oversight to safeguard \n     taxpayer and donor interests, even though it receives \n     millions of federal dollars.\n       ACORN's purposeful lack of quality control translates into \n     the employment of convicted felons and other suspect persons. \n     Through a strategy of providing financial incentives to \n     employees who meet voter registration quotas, ACORN conducts \n     voter drives that routinely produce fraudulent registrations. \n     In fact, ACORN's employment practices have the intentional \n     effect of encouraging voter registration fraud while linking \n     criminal culpability to the lowest-level employees rather \n     than the directors who contrive the illegal schemes.\n       To date, nearly 70 ACORN employees have been convicted in \n     12 states for voter registration fraud, though no federal \n     charges have been filed against ACORN's directors. In fact, \n     Pennsylvania judge Richard Zoller--after holding a low-level \n     ACORN employee liable for election law violations--noted that \n     ``somebody has to go after ACORN.''\n       Third, ACORN has committed a conspiracy to defraud the \n     United States by using taxpayer funds for partisan political \n     activities.\n       Committee investigators have unearthed documentation that \n     ACORN and its affiliates conducted meticulous research that \n     fed aggressive campaign initiatives designed to elect \n     Democratic candidates in targeted races. ACORN forged both \n     formal and informal connections with former Illinois Governor \n     Rod Blagojevich, Ohio Senator Sherrod Brown and President \n     Barack Obama, among others. Each of these campaigns received \n     financial and personnel resource contributions from ACORN and \n     its affiliates as part of a scheme to use taxpayer monies to \n     support a partisan political agenda. These actions are a \n     clear violation of numerous tax and election laws.\n       Documents contained in this report reveal ACORN's political \n     agenda. ACORN's 2005-2007 Strategic Plan states that ``just \n     as important as . . . mobilizing existing progressive voters, \n     ACORN and similar groups actually create new progressive \n     voters.'' In the same document, ACORN acknowledges that its \n     ``issue campaigns play the dual role . . . of attracting new \n     members, and educating or politicizing existing members.'' \n     One particular issue where ACORN claims success is ``fighting \n     key elements of the national Republican program.''\n       In other documents, ACORN affiliates take credit for the \n     election of former-Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich. In the \n     2006 year-end report of ACORN affiliate Service Employees \n     International Union (SEIU) Local 880, efforts to elect \n     Blagojevich and advance partisan political agendas are called \n     ``flawless.''\n       Labor organizations, unions, and other tax-exempt entities \n     stretched Chicago-style political manipulation and back room \n     schemes beyond Illinois to other state-wide and national \n     campaign efforts. In the State of Ohio, where ACORN directors \n     drafted a political plan contained in this report, overt \n     partisan goals are enumerated. The ACORN Ohio Political Plan \n     states: ``ACORN will target three competitive Ohio \n     congressional districts as well as a half dozen state rep \n     seats nested within the districts. Our electoral work will \n     mobilize and educate voters [and] our paid professional \n     canvass will execute tightly managed Voter ID and GOTV \n     canvasses moving our core constituency of base and swing \n     voters to the polls to vote for the candidates who most \n     closely align with a progressive Working Families Agenda.''\n       Moreover, documents provided by former ACORN employees and \n     contained in this report demonstrate the degree to which \n     ACORN and ACORN affiliates organized to elect President \n     Barack Obama in 2008.\n       Fourth, ACORN has submitted false filings to the Internal \n     Revenue Service (IRS) and the Department of Labor, in \n     addition to violating the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).\n       Committee investigators have tracked ACORN's numerous \n     failures to comply with federal laws that required the \n     payment of excise taxes on excess benefits to Dale Rathke. \n     SEIU Local 100--under the direction of ACORN founder Wade \n     Rathke--filed bogus reports with the Labor Department in \n     order to conceal embezzlement. ACORN violated the overtime \n     and record-keeping provisions of FLSA. All of these \n     fraudulent acts would constitute a violation of 18 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1001 by presenting false documents to the United States \n     government.\n       Fifth, ACORN falsified and concealed facts concerning an \n     illegal transaction between related parties in violation of \n     the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA).\n       Committee investigators have concluded that ACORN plundered \n     employee benefits and violated fiduciary responsibilities \n     under ERISA by relieving corporate debts through prohibited \n     loans to a related party. Moreover, ACORN affiliates lack \n     independent control of their own assets and maintain shoddy \n     accounting practices that serve to hide ACORN's secret and \n     illegal use of monies.\n       ACORN conspired to conceal information concerning \n     prohibited transactions from its board in violation of its \n     corporate charter. ACORN's termination of board members who \n     sought to uncover its illegal activities perpetuates a cover-\n     up at the expense of adherence to its own bylaws.\n       The evidence contained in this report proves that ACORN's \n     stated purpose to promote grassroots civic participation has \n     been perverted through fraudulent and illegal acts. The \n     weight of evidence against ACORN and its affiliates is \n     astounding. This syndicate of tax-exempt organizations has \n     coordinated and implemented a nation-wide\n\n[[Page S9310]]\n\n     strategy of tax fraud, racketeering, money-laundering and \n     manipulating the American electorate.\n       Scrutiny is essential to lift a dark cloud of suspicion \n     from nonprofit community organizations; to bring to justice \n     the responsible parties who have heretofore been shielded \n     from prosecution by ACORN's obscure organizational structure; \n     to protect the American system of democratic self-government \n     from manipulation and disruption; and to free our political \n     climate from the choke of corruption that threatens to \n     strangle free and fair elections.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. According to the report:\n\n       Operationally, ACORN is a shell game played in 120 cities, \n     43 states and the District of Columbia through a complex \n     structure designed to conceal illegal activities, to use \n     taxpayer and tax exempt dollars for partisan political \n     purposes, and to distract investigators. Structurally, ACORN \n     is a chess game in which senior management is shielded from \n     accountability by multiple layers of volunteers and \n     compensated employees who serve as pawns to take the fall for \n     every bad act.\n\n  There is a history here, and it is a sad history. In 1998, an ACORN \nemployee was arrested for falsifying voter registration forms. In 1999, \nPhiladelphia authorities found hundreds of fraudulent registration \nforms by ACORN. In October of 2008, the pattern continues. ACORN's \nNevada offices were raided by Federal agents, and in 2009 their Las \nVegas field director was charged with voter registration fraud. In May \n2009, seven ACORN employees were charged in Pittsburgh for voter \nregistration fraud.\n  I cite this sad, tragic history because the events of the last week \nwere not isolated, and I do not believe it was accidental that this \nvideo caught ACORN employees delivering the same message in different \ncities. They magnify a troubling, systemic, and criminal pattern. In \nfact, they serve as a public window into an organization that is \nbesieged by corruption, by fraud, and by illegal activities, all \ncommitted--all committed--on the taxpayers' dime. Mr. President, I \nwould suggest to you, if we had the capability to ask every taxpayer in \nAmerica: Is this how you want your money spent, we would have a nearly \nunanimous count saying: Absolutely not.\n  At a time when we are experiencing record deficits and the economy is \nstruggling every day to get back on its feet, how in the world can \nanyone come to this floor of the Senate and say: I want to cast my vote \nto continue to fund this organization with taxpayer dollars, hard-\nearned dollars by American families, when so many questions of \nlegitimacy reign? I think the answer to that is simple. I do not see \nhow anybody could cast that vote. To do so, in my judgment, would \nignore the proof, and it would also ignore our responsibility to \nprotect taxpayers from waste and fraud and abuse. I would go so far as \nto say that I respect that some of my colleagues believe the work done \nby ACORN in some communities might be valuable. But I would \nrespectfully suggest that the problems riddling this organization, in \noffice after office, cannot and should not be trivialized. This is an \nopportunity for the Senate to stand up and say: Enough is enough, just \nas the Census Bureau did.\n  As Judge Richard Zoller said, after holding an ACORN employee liable \nfor election law violations:\n\n       Somebody has to go after ACORN.\n\n  Well, I suggest today, on the floor of the Senate, that ``somebody'' \nis each and every U.S. Senator. That ``somebody'' is each Senator, who \nnow has the ability to come to the floor and say to the taxpayers back \nhome: We will not tolerate this any longer. Until a full investigation \nis launched into ACORN, no taxpayer money should be used to fund its \nactivities. A vote in favor of my amendment is a vote in favor of the \ntaxpayer and a vote against the status quo.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 25 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Fiscal Update\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, building on a series of speeches I have \ngiven over the past few years and in the tradition of a former Member \nof this body, Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina, I hope to \nprovide my colleagues and the American people with regular updates on \nour catastrophic national debt. Unfortunately, given the lack of action \nto address this coming tsunami, I believe President Obama and Congress \nneed to be reminded of the fiscal realities in which we find ourselves. \nSenator Hollings came down to the Senate floor every few weeks with a \nposter updating the national debt, and today I renew his tradition, and \nI will continue it until we do something about this unsustainable \nfinancial crisis.\n  One of my grandchildren's favorite stories is ``The Emperor's New \nClothes'' by Hans Christian Anderson. In the tale, an emperor goes \nabout the land wearing a nonexistent suit sold to him by a new tailor \nwho convinced the monarch the suit is made of the finest silks. The \ntailors--two swindlers--tell the emperor that the threads of his robes \nwill be so fine that they will look invisible to those dimwitted or \nunfit for their position. The emperor and his ministers, themselves \nunable to see the clothing, lavish the tailor with praise for the suit \nbecause they do not want to appear dimwitted or incompetent.\n  Word spread across the kingdom of the emperor's beautiful new robes. \nTo show off the extraordinary suit, a parade was formed. People lined \nthe streets to see the emperor show off his new clothes. Again, afraid \nto appear stupid or unfit, everyone pretends to see the suit. It is \nonly when a child cries out ``the emperor wears no clothes'' does the \ncrowd acknowledge that the emperor is, in fact, naked.\n  Much like the emperor, America's elected leaders know we face a \nfiscal train wreck, but we are choosing to ignore our current economic \nreality. I am here to tell my colleagues and President Obama, the \nemperor has no clothes and we are naked in terms of dealing with our \ndeficits and national debt.\n  As shown right here on this chart, get the book out. I am sure you \nhave it. Read it. That is where we are right now. The irony is that the \nAmerican people know we are naked, and they are coming to Washington to \nlet us know we are naked, and so does the rest of the world, and our \ncredibility and our credit today are at risk.\n  I have this chart, what I refer to as the ``Wheel of Misfortune.'' \nThis lays out quite clearly what our national debt is today.\n  One of the reasons I ran for the Senate back in 1998 was I wanted to \ncome to Washington and reduce the national debt and balance budgets, \nwhich is something I did as the mayor of the city of Cleveland and \nsomething I did as Governor of the State of Ohio.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1999, our gross national debt stood at \n$5.6 trillion or 61 percent of the GDP. Today, as you can see from the \nchart behind me, the gross national debt is nearly $11.8 trillion. I \nunderstand the President is going to ask us to increase our debt limit \nto $12 trillion and, quite frankly, I believe he is going to be asking \nus to raise the debt limit to more than $12 trillion.\n  This is an increase of more than 100 percent in 10 years. Much of \nthis increase has come recently. In fact, from 2008 to 2009 alone, the \nFederal debt will increase 22 percent, boosting the country's debt-to-\nincome ratio--our national debt as a percentage of GDP--from 70 percent \nlast year to 86 percent this year. We haven't seen this kind of GDP \ndebt since the Second World War. It was 65 years ago during the Second \nWorld War that we saw these kinds of numbers.\n  By the way, this does not include our unfunded Medicare and Social \nSecurity obligations which the Peterson Foundation recently tagged at \n$56.4 trillion. This is the equivalent of a $483,000 debt per American \nhousehold or $184,000 for every man, woman, and child in America today. \nThose are unfunded liabilities.\n  It doesn't take an economist to realize our course is unsustainable. \nPresident Obama and this Congress are fully aware of this reckless \nfiscal path. Yet they continue to spend and borrow,\n\n[[Page S9311]]\n\nspend and borrow. Our Federal Government is the worst credit card \nabuser in the world. We talk to our kids about not abusing their credit \ncards. What kind of example do we set? You know what. We are putting \nthe tab on the credit of our children and grandchildren.\n  Like the boy who cried ``the emperor has no clothes,'' the American \npeople see through this sham. There were a bunch of them here this \nweekend who saw through the sham. A recent poll conducted by the \nPeterson Foundation showed that after their personal job, the most \npressing concern of Americans is the national debt. Americans are \ncutting back, folks, in their own family. They are making tough \ndecisions. They know they haven't been living within their means.\n  Some people are saying: Why are they paying attention to this \nfinally? Well, they are finally realizing in their own families they \nneed to redo the way they are doing things, and they are asking \nthemselves: Why isn't our Federal Government doing the same thing we \nare doing in our households? It is no wonder they are looking at \ngovernment's reckless spending with disapproval and wondering why we \nare not doing the same thing they are doing. They are mad as hell, and \nthey aren't going to take it anymore.\n  The media is also finally starting to pay attention to this issue. \nRecently, the Washington Post ran an article by Fred Hiatt, their chief \neditorial writer, acknowledging that our long-term fiscal path is \nunsustainable, as well as an editorial taking the administration to \ntask for lacking a plan on how to start digging our economy out of this \nfiscal crisis.\n  Additionally, Newsweek published an article by Fareed Zakaria where \nhe outlines what he describes as ``the disease of modern democracy: the \nsystem cannot impose any short-term pain for long-term gain.'' We are \nunwilling to pay for it or do without.\n  The first one, this Newsweek article, is called,\n\n       There is a Silver Lining.\n       The crisis has forced the United States to confront bad \n     habits developed over the past few decades. If we can kick \n     those habits, today's pain will translate into gains.\n\n  The other is a Washington Post article entitled ``No Laughing Matter. \nWhy the U.S. Needs to Get Serious About Long-Term Budget Deficits.''\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Congressional Record the articles to which I previously \nreferred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Newsweek Magazine, Oct. 20, 2008]\n\n                        There Is a Silver Lining\n\n                          (By Fareed Zakaria)\n\n       Some of us--especially those under 60--have always wondered \n     what it would be like to live through the kind of epochal \n     event one reads about in books. Well, this is it. We're now \n     living history, suffering one of the greatest financial \n     panics of all time. It compares with the big ones--1907, \n     1929--and we cannot yet know its full consequences for the \n     financial system, the economy or society as a whole.\n       I'm betting that, in the end, the world's governments will \n     win this battle against fear. They have potentially unlimited \n     tools at their disposal, especially if they act in concert. \n     They can nationalize firms, call bank holidays, suspend \n     trading for weeks, buy up debt and equity, and renegotiate \n     home mortgages. Most important, the American government can \n     print money. All of these tools have long-term effects that \n     are extremely troublesome, but they are nothing compared with \n     the potential collapse of the financial system. And \n     Washington seems to have recognized that it must do whatever \n     is required to shore up that system. Big questions remain. \n     What will it take to stop the fall? How costly will it be? \n     How long before the rescue plan starts to have an effect? But \n     at some point, the panic that gripped world markets last week \n     will end. Of course, that will not mean a return to growth or \n     a bull market. We're in for tough times. But it will mean a \n     return to sanity.\n       Amid all the difficulties and hardship that we are about to \n     undergo, I see one silver lining. This crisis has--\n     dramatically, vengefully--forced the United States to \n     confront the bad habits it has developed over the past few \n     decades. If we can kick those habits, today's pain will \n     translate into gains in the long run.\n       Since the 1980s, Americans have consumed more than they \n     produced--and they have made up the difference by borrowing.\n       Two decades of easy money and innovative financial products \n     meant that virtually anyone could borrow any amount of money \n     for any purpose. If we wanted a bigger house, a better TV or \n     a faster car, and we didn't actually have the money to pay \n     for it, no problem. We put it on a credit card, took out a \n     massive mortgage and financed our fantasies. As the fantasies \n     grew, so did household debt, from $680 billion in 1974 to $14 \n     trillion today. The total has doubled in just the past seven \n     years. The average household owns 13 credit cards, and 40 \n     percent of them carry a balance, up from 6 percent in 1970.\n       But the average American's behavior was virtue itself \n     compared with the government's. Every city, every county and \n     every state has wanted to preserve its many and proliferating \n     operations and yet not raise taxes. How to square this \n     circle? By borrowing, using ever more elaborate financial \n     instruments. Revenue bonds were backed up by the prospect of \n     future income from taxes or lotteries. ``A growing trend is \n     to securitize future federal funding for highways, housing \n     and other items,'' says Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute. \n     The effect on the projects, he points out, is to make them \n     more expensive, since they incur interest payments. Because \n     they ``insulate the taxpayer from the cost''--all that needs \n     to be paid now is the interest--they also tend to produce \n     cost overruns.\n       Local pols aren't the only problem. Under Alan Greenspan, \n     the Federal Reserve obstinately refused to inflict any pain. \n     Russian default? Cut interest rates. Worried about Y2K? Cut \n     rates. NASDAQ crash? Cut rates. The economy slows after 9/11? \n     Cut rates. Whatever the problem, the solution was to keep the \n     money flowing and goose the economy. Eventually, by putting \n     the housing market on steroids, the strategy created problems \n     too large to untangle.\n       The whole country has been complicit in a great fraud. As \n     economist Jeffrey Sachs points out, ``We've wanted lots of \n     government, but we haven't wanted to pay for it.'' So we've \n     borrowed our way out of the problem. In 1990, the national \n     debt stood at $3 trillion. (That sounds high, but keep \n     reading.) By 2000, it had almost doubled, to $5.75 trillion. \n     It is currently $10.2 trillion. The number moved into 11 \n     digits last month, which meant that the National Debt Clock \n     in New York City ran out of space to display the figures. Its \n     owners plan to get a new clock next year.\n       ``Leverage'' is the fancy Wall Street word for debt. It's \n     at the heart of the current crisis. Warren Buffett explained \n     the problem in his inimitable way on ``The Charlie Rose \n     Show.'' ``Leverage,'' he said, ``is the only way a smart guy \n     can go broke . . . You do smart things, you eventually get \n     very rich. If you do smart things and use leverage and you do \n     one wrong thing along the way, it could wipe you out, because \n     anything times zero is zero. But it's reinforcing when the \n     people around you are doing it successfully, you're doing it \n     successfully, and it's a lot like Cinderella at the ball. The \n     guys look better all the time, the music sounds better, it's \n     more and more fun, you think, `Why the hell should I leave at \n     a quarter to 12? I'll leave at two minutes to 12.' But the \n     trouble is, there are no clocks on the wall. And everybody \n     thinks they're going to leave at two minutes to 12.''\n       If there is a lesson to be taken from this crisis, it's a \n     simple and old rule of economics: there is no free lunch. If \n     you want something, you have to pay for it. Debt is not a bad \n     thing. Used responsibly, it is at the heart of modern \n     capitalism. But hiding mountains of debt in complex \n     instruments is a way to disguise costs, an invitation to \n     irresponsible behavior.\n       At some point, the magical accounting had to stop. At some \n     point, consumers had to stop using their homes as banks and \n     spending money that they didn't have. At some point, the \n     government had to confront its indebtedness. The United \n     States--and other overleveraged societies--have now gotten \n     the wake-up call from hell. If we can respond and change our \n     behavior markedly, this might actually be a blessing in \n     disguise. (Though, as Winston Churchill said when he lost the \n     election of 1945, ``at the moment it appears rather \n     effectively disguised.'')\n       In the short term, all the solutions to the current crisis \n     require that governments take on more debts and larger \n     obligations. This is inevitable and necessary. But that \n     doesn't mean we should, as some noted economists advocate, \n     stimulate the economy with more tax cuts. That would be only \n     one more way to keep the party going artificially--like \n     asking a drunk to go to AA next year, but in the meantime to \n     have even more whisky. A far better stimulus would be to \n     announce and expedite major infrastructure and energy \n     projects, which are investments, not consumption, and \n     therefore have a much different effect on the country's \n     fiscal fortunes. (They are not listed separately in the \n     federal budget, but that's just bad accounting.)\n       In the medium and long term, we have to get back to basics. \n     Households, for instance, should save more. Governments \n     should put incentives in place that make such savings more \n     likely. The U.S. government offers enormous incentives to \n     consume (the deduction of mortgage interest being the best \n     example), and it works. We have the biggest houses in the \n     world, the thinnest flat-screen TVs and the most cars. If we \n     were to tax consumption and encourage savings, that would \n     also work. Regulations on credit-card debt should be revised \n     to ensure that people understand the risks and costs of these \n     instruments. Moving in this direction would be good for \n     families and for the government as well.\n       Wall Street will also need to change. Paul Volcker has long \n     argued that the recent\n\n[[Page S9312]]\n\n     spate of financial innovation was nothing of the kind: it \n     simply shuffled around existing resources while contributing \n     few real benefits to the economy. Such activity will now be \n     reduced significantly. Boykin Curry, managing director of \n     Eagle Capital, says, ``For 20 years, the DNA of nearly every \n     financial institution had morphed dangerously. Each time \n     someone at the table pressed for more leverage and more risk, \n     the next few years proved them `right.' These people were \n     emboldened, they were promoted and they gained control of \n     ever more capital. Meanwhile, anyone in power who hesitated, \n     who argued for caution, was proved `wrong.' The cautious \n     types were increasingly intimidated, passed over for \n     promotion. They lost their hold on capital. This happened \n     every day in almost every financial institution over and \n     over, until we ended up with a very specific kind of \n     person running things. This year, the capital that remains \n     is finally being reallocated to more careful, thoughtful \n     executives and investors--the Warren Buffetts . . . of the \n     world.''\n       Volcker has also argued that the highly complex financial \n     system was not nearly as stable as people believed and that \n     far-reaching efforts were needed to regulate and stabilize \n     it. Now these issues will get attention at the highest level. \n     The fear on Wall Street is that a Democratic administration \n     would overregulate. But look at who is advising Barack \n     Obama--Buffett, Volcker, former Treasury secretaries Robert \n     Rubin and Larry Summers. It is more likely that what will \n     come from their efforts will be a better-regulated financial \n     system that, while producing less-extravagant profits, will \n     be more stable and secure.\n       The financial industry itself is likely to shrink, and \n     that's not a bad thing, either. It has ballooned dramatically \n     in size. Curry points out that ``30 percent of S 500 \n     profits last year were earned by financial firms, and U.S. \n     consumers were spending $800 billion more than they earned \n     every year. As a result, most of our top math Ph.D.s were \n     being pulled into nonproductive financial engineering instead \n     of biotech research and fuel technology. Capital expenditures \n     went into retail construction instead of critical \n     infrastructure.'' The crisis will stop the misallocation of \n     human and financial resources and redirect them in more-\n     productive ways. If some of the smart people now on Wall \n     Street end up building better models of energy usage and \n     efficiency, that would be a net gain for the economy.\n       The American economy remains extremely dynamic and \n     flexible. Even now, the most surprising data continue to be \n     how resilient the economy has been through all these shocks. \n     That will not last, especially if the panic persists. But \n     even so, it highlights the fact that the U.S. economy has \n     underlying virtues and, after a tough recession, will \n     probably recover faster than many can now imagine. The rise \n     in emerging-market economies, which have been powering global \n     growth, will not vanish overnight, either.\n       A new discipline would benefit America in a more general \n     sense, too. Ever since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the \n     United States has operated in the world with no constraints \n     or checks on its power. This has not been good for its \n     foreign policy. It has made Washington arrogant, lazy and \n     careless. Its decision making has resembled General Motors' \n     business strategy in the 1970s and 1980s, a process driven \n     largely by a vast array of internal factors but little sense \n     of urgency or awareness of outside pressures. We didn't have \n     to make strategic choices; we could have it all. We could \n     make blunders, anger the world, rupture alliances, waste \n     resources, wage war incompetently--it didn't matter. We had \n     more than enough room for error--lots of error.\n       But it's a different world out there. If Iraq cast a shadow \n     on U.S. political and military credibility, this financial \n     crisis has eroded America's economic and financial power. In \n     the short run, there has been a flight to safety--toward \n     dollars and T-bills--but in the long run, countries are \n     likely to seek greater independence from an unstable \n     superpower. The United States will now have to work to \n     attract capital to its shores, and manage its fiscal house \n     better. We will have to persuade countries to join in our \n     foreign endeavors. We will have to make strategic choices. We \n     cannot deploy missile interceptors along Russia's borders, \n     draw Georgia and Ukraine into NATO, and still expect Russian \n     cooperation on Iran's nuclear program. We cannot noisily \n     denounce Chinese and Arab foreign investments in America one \n     day and then hope that they will keep buying $4 billion worth \n     of T-bills another day. We cannot keep preaching to the world \n     about democracy and capitalism while our own house is so \n     wildly out of order.\n       It's a fundamental American belief that competition is \n     good--in business, athletics and life. Checks and balances \n     are James Madison's crucial mechanisms, exposing and \n     countering abuse and arrogance and forcing discipline on \n     people. This discipline will be painful for a country that \n     has gotten used to having it all. But it will make us much \n     stronger in the long run. If we can learn the right lessons \n     from this crisis, the United States will once more be playing \n     by its own rules. And that cannot be bad for us.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 5, 2009]\n\n                           No Laughing Matter\n\n       The Obama administration inherited from its predecessor \n     both a tanking economy and a huge federal budget deficit. \n     Under the circumstances, it cannot be faulted for increasing \n     the deficit in the short run, because a mammoth recession \n     called for fiscal stimulus. Thus, it is neither surprising \n     nor irreversibly dangerous that the total federal debt held \n     by the public looks as if it will reach 57 percent of gross \n     domestic product by the end of fiscal 2009 on Sept. 30--well \n     above the previous four decades' average of about 40 percent. \n     What is more alarming is that, barring major spending cuts or \n     tax increases, President Obama's budget could drive that \n     figure to 82 percent by 2019, according to the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n       We are already getting a taste of the problems that could \n     develop if the president and Congress do not address this \n     soon. Since the end of last year, the interest rate on 10-\n     year Treasury notes has gone up from 2 percent to over 3.5 \n     percent. That number is within historical norms; indeed, \n     Treasury rates probably had been artificially depressed \n     during the financial panic of the fall. But the spike, which \n     will cost the government tens of billions of dollars, also \n     reflects mounting investor concern--at home and, especially, \n     abroad--about the U.S. fiscal situation. If government \n     borrowing costs continue to accelerate, they could kill \n     economic growth for years to come.\n       It was a sign of the times that Treasury Secretary Timothy \n     F. Geithner had to travel to Beijing this week to reassure \n     China, the world's largest holder of Treasury debt, that \n     lending money to the U.S. government is still a wise thing to \n     do. Mr. Geithner insisted that, ``in the United States, we \n     are putting in place the foundations for restoring fiscal \n     sustainability.'' To be sure, China doesn't have many good \n     alternatives to parking its massive trade surpluses in \n     dollars. But it does have some, including commodities and the \n     debt of more fiscally prudent European governments. In a \n     moment that all Americans should consider a wake-up call, Mr. \n     Geithner was met with laughter when he told a group of \n     Chinese students that their country's assets were ``very \n     safe'' in Washington.\n       The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, was \n     considerably more decorous than the Chinese students in \n     testimony before Congress on Wednesday but, in essence, only \n     slightly less skeptical. ``Even as we take steps to address \n     the recession and threats to financial stability,'' he said, \n     ``maintaining the confidence of the financial markets \n     requires that we, as a nation, begin planning now for the \n     restoration of fiscal balance.''\n       Mr. Bernanke did not say explicitly that there is no such \n     plan in Mr. Obama's budget--at least not according to the \n     CBO, whose estimates of the president's budget show annual \n     deficits lingering indefinitely above 4 percent of GDP. Nor \n     did he point out that Congress has yet to come up with \n     credible financing for the president's desirable but \n     expensive health-care proposal. He did not say that Mr. Obama \n     and Congress have done nothing so far to deliver on the \n     president's pledge of entitlement reform. But if the Fed \n     chairman had said those things, he would have been absolutely \n     right.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, now is the time to take the first step \ntoward fiscal responsibility and making good on our promises by \nenacting meaningful, comprehensive tax and entitlement reform. The \nrecent pay-as-you-go legislation passed by the House isn't going to get \nthe job done. We know that. This Band-Aid relies on smoke and mirrors \nand exempts the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, patching the alternative \nminimum tax, updating physician payments in Medicare, and modifying the \nestate tax. It is intellectually dishonest. Even the Budget Committee \nchairman in the Senate, Senator Conrad, calls this pay-go that came out \nof the House insincere. If Congress is going to reenact statutory pay-\ngo, then it should apply to everything, not just to what is convenient.\n  We need real comprehensive reform. I am pleased to say it appears as \nthough President Obama is finally starting to get it. In an interview \nwith the Washington Post, President Obama endorsed the idea of creating \na commission where--here is what he said:\n\n       Everything is going to be on the table when it comes to \n     examining our tax and entitlement systems and presenting \n     long-term solutions to place the United States on a fiscally \n     sustainable course.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       What you end up having to do in terms of structural reforms \n     realistically is you probably have to set up some sort of \n     commission or mechanism that reports back with the prospect \n     of maybe locking in a pledge for action, post election.\n\n  I know we have talked about this on occasion, about this commission \nand setting it up and trying to get the administration to commit to it \nso we can let the American people know we are sincere about doing \nsomething about this debt and balancing our budget.\n  For the past three Congresses, I have been calling for such a \ncommission. This Congress, I am proud to say, Senator Lieberman has \njoined me as an original cosponsor to create the commission now.\n\n[[Page S9313]]\n\n  Similar to the BRAC process, the Save America's Future Economy \nCommission--we call it SAFE--would break the legislative logjam in \nWashington by creating a bipartisan, bicameral committee to draw up \npolicy prescriptions for the government's long-term budget shortfalls \nthat would then go before Congress on an up-or-down vote. The \nlegislation is similar to legislation introduced by Congressmen Jim \nCooper and Frank Wolf in the House, and today they have 69 cosponsors. \nIt is vital--it is vital--to ensuring the solvency of entitlement \nprograms for future generations.\n  It is my understanding that Pete Peterson and David Walker of the \nPeterson Foundation have endorsed this legislation along with the \nHeritage Foundation, the Brookings Institute, the Business Roundtable, \nand a host of other former CBO Directors who said it is time for us to \ndo something about the problem, and they understand we will not get it \ndone with the regular order of business. We have to have a commission \ncome back with a recommendation, put it on a fast track, send it to the \nHouse, send it to the Senate, and let us either vote up or down as we \ndo with the commissions we have set up on closing bases.\n  I am sure many of my colleagues are familiar with this legislation. I \nknow David Walker has met with both Republican and Democratic \nlegislative leaders or directors regarding this legislation.\n  Continuing down our current path, folks, is unsustainable. It is \nunsustainable, and it is immoral. For too long we have clothed \nourselves in economic falsehoods, pretending they would protect us from \nthe harsh economic realities. Folks, time is running out. The world \nsees that the emperor, in fact, has no clothes. I am calling on \nPresident Obama to follow through on his comments about the need for a \ncommission and support the SAFE Commission Act.\n  OMB Director Peter Orszag has understood our fiscal crisis in the \npast and called for the creation of an entitlement commission, but \nsince joining the administration he has stopped pushing for a \ncommission, instead focusing just on health care reform. The bottom \nline is health care reform is but one of the major issues that needs to \nbe addressed to respond to our fiscal crisis. We must also reform the \nTax Code to encourage personal savings, investment, job creation, and \neconomic growth. A lot of Americans are not aware of this fact, that we \nspend $240 billion a year paying our taxes; that is, to pay for \nprofessional help and keeping track of all of the papers we need to \nhave when we prepare to pay our Federal income tax.\n  I think the current health care debate in Congress is a perfect \nexample of why a piecemeal approach doesn't work. If we dealt with the \nfiscal crisis, it would be a lot easier for us to deal with health \ncare.\n  There is a new poll out just today, AP, that says half of Americans \nare more concerned about tackling our debt than our health care reform, \neducation, and climate change. Did my colleagues hear that? Over half \nof them say deal with the fiscal crisis. The reason I believe we are \nhaving such a darn difficult time dealing with health care and why we \nare not going to pass any kind of climate change legislation is that \nthe people of this country know we have a fiscal crisis and they want \nus to contend with that before we deal with these other issues.\n  I think the American people know we can't afford the health care \nsystem we now have, and we must find a way to be more responsible. \nThink of this: We spend $2.2 trillion on health care in this country. \nThe Medicare trust fund will be insolvent in 2017, and we have to \nreform the way we pay physicians under the program, which experts say \nwill cost us $280 billion over 10 years. Furthermore, the States are \nalready overburdened by the cost of their Medicaid programs.\n  We gave the States $87 billion in the stimulus bill. I can tell you \nin ordinary circumstances, many States usually come to Washington with \na tin cup. I can guarantee you that the Governors of this country are \ngoing to be down here with a large bathtub asking us to fill it because \nof the problems they confront.\n  In other words, they can't now take care--well, they can now because \nthey got the $87 billion, but once that runs out, they are going to be \ndown here saying: We can't handle the current system as it is. How can \nwe expand Medicaid when we can't take care of the Medicaid Program we \nnow have? With the financial crisis we have in this country, we have to \nbe careful of taking on something we can't afford, particularly when we \ncan't afford to pay for what we already have.\n  I am surprised that in the President's speech last week he didn't \ntalk about the fact that by 2017--everybody needs to understand this--\nthe money coming in for Medicare would not be adequate to take care of \nthe people who are out there who are eligible for Medicare. It is part \nof what I call that unfunded liability I talked about earlier.\n  The Peterson Foundation recently commissioned an in-depth health care \nstudy conducted by the Lewin Group, and I urge my colleagues to take a \nclose look at this analysis and see the principles the Peterson \nFoundation lays out to determine a fiscally responsible health care \nreform bill.\n  I am not the only one calling for Congress to be fiscally responsible \nwhen considering health care reform. In order for health care reform \nlegislation to be fiscally responsible, it must, one, pay for itself \nover a 10-year period; two, not add to the deficit beyond a 10-year \nperiod; three, bend the cost curve down to reduce health care spending; \nand four, significantly reduce current unfunded obligations. That is \nwhat we should be talking about.\n  President Obama and Congress must act. We all came to Washington to \nserve, and we have a moral responsibility to leave this place better \nthan what we found it. How will we look our children and grandchildren \nin the eye knowing we have mortgaged their future at a time when we \nknow they are going to have to work harder than we have to maintain the \nstandard of living we enjoy.\n  God has blessed me with three children and seven grandchildren. I am \nconstantly worried about what kind of America they are going to be \nliving in. I know darn well the competition we face today worldwide is \na lot more fierce than anything I experienced during my life here. I \nknow because of that competition they are going to have to work harder. \nThey are going to have to work smarter. It would be very cruel for us, \non top of that, to lay this terrible burden on their shoulders and say: \nWe weren't willing to pay for it or do without, so you take care of it. \nIt is your problem. You handle it.\n  I was pleased to hear President Obama echo this last Wednesday during \nhis joint session of Congress, the same sentiment I have just made. He \nstated--and I quote the President of the United States:\n\n       I understand that the politically safe move would be to \n     kick the can further down the road--to defer reform one more \n     year, one more election, one more term. But that is not what \n     the moment calls for. That is not what we came here to do. We \n     did not come here to fear the future. We came here to shape \n     it. I still believe we can act, even when it is hard.\n\n  President Obama's words ring true in light of the fiscal challenges \nwe face as a nation today. And they should get the first priority. \nUntil we start on a commission, Congress, the administration, the \nAmerican people, and the world will know the Emperor has no clothes. We \nare naked in terms of realizing and dealing with our fiscal crisis. Now \nis the time to act.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2355, as Modified\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Johanns \namendment be modified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 2355), as modified, is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: Prohibiting use of funds to fund the Association of Community \n                 Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN))\n\n       After section 414, insert the following:\n       Sec. 4__.  None of the funds made available under this Act \n     may be distributed to the\n\n[[Page S9314]]\n\n     Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN) \n     or its subsidiaries.\n\n  Mr. BOND. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise today to support the amendment \noffered by my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Johanns. He has proposed \nan amendment to end taxpayer funding for the Association of Community \nOrganizations for Reform Now.\n  We cannot allow taxpayer funds to support groups engaged in repeated \nvoter registration fraud activities, and now their repeated assistance \nfor housing, tax, and mortgage fraud.\n  I recognize--and let's be clear about it--that ACORN has helped \ncounsel homeowners through the recent mortgage meltdown. Doubtless, \nthey have helped good people find affordable housing solutions. But \nthat cannot outweigh the numerous and repeated abuses of taxpayer \ndollars allowed to occur in their name.\n  In my home State of Missouri, several ACORN workers in Kansas City \nadmitted to voter registration fraud. There have been other \ninvestigations throughout the State. Unfortunately, ACORN vote fraud in \nMissouri is not isolated. ACORN workers in Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, \nMichigan, North Carolina, New Mexico, Ohio, Minnesota, Pennsylvania, \nTexas, Virginia, Wisconsin, and Nevada have all been associated with \nfraudulent voter registration activities.\n  This long list shows this is not a problem of a handful of rogue \nemployees but, regrettably, an endemic systemwide culture of fraud and \nabuse. Now we have disgusting and unacceptable video footage of ACORN \nhousing workers counseling on how prostitutes might circumvent mortgage \napplications, tax law, and child endangerment laws. Again, this \ndespicable behavior is not isolated to one rogue employee but has \noccurred repeatedly in Washington, Baltimore, and New York.\n  For those who say that minority and low-income advocates are being \npicked upon, I say the causes of expanding housing and voting \nopportunities and wise counseling and assistance to those who need help \nare too important to be allowed to be sullied by such a morally \nfraudulent organization. The tireless volunteers and underpaid staffers \ntoiling to help the impoverished and disenfranchised do not deserve to \nhave their reputation pulled down by the organization they work for \nwhich cannot put an end to these abuses. All taxpayers deserve to know \ntheir hard-earned tax dollars are not going toward voter, housing, \nmortgage, or tax fraud assistance.\n  Congress has the opportunity to end this relationship now. I am \nhoping we will be able to vote this afternoon, and I urge my colleagues \nto support the Johanns amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of an \namendment by my good friend, Senator Mike Johanns, that would prevent \nour taxpayer dollars from being directed to the Association of \nCommunity Organizations for Reform Now, more commonly known as ACORN. I \nalso want to commend the Census Bureau's recent decision to cut all \nties with ACORN.\n  Simply put I am very pleased with this decision, which was announced \nlate last week through a letter from Census Bureau Director Robert \nGroves to ACORN's National Headquarters. As I met with Dr. Groves in my \noffice just last week, I raised this very issue and expressed my \ndisappointment, along with the disappointment of many of the Utahns I \nrepresent, that ACORN would have any association with such an important \nand historic event such as the 2010 Census.\n  Anyone who knows me, knows that I am always supportive of reasonable \nefforts to ensure that taxpayer funds are not used for unlawful \nactivities, particularly when those activities may be construed to be \npartisan in nature. That is why I have followed this particular issue \nso closely throughout the year and raised the issue directly with \nDirector Groves.\n  In fact, as next year's census quickly approaches, I continue to work \nwith Census officials at the Commerce Department on all levels. As all \nUtahns are keenly aware, the Decennial Census requires precision and \nuniformity--both of which I am closely monitoring as the Census moves \nforward.\n  To that end, I am hopeful that the Census Bureau will ensure that all \nAmericans are counted fairly and accurately, with the privacy of the \nindividual always in mind. I applaud Director Groves and his decision \nfor the Census Bureau to cut all ties with ACORN. I am pleased that he \nlistened not only to my concerns, but also to the concerns of thousands \nof Utahns and Americans from across country who have expressed severe \ndisappointment with ACORN's involvement in the 2010 Census. Personally, \nI feel ACORN should not have been involved in the 2010 Census in the \nfirst place. However, I recognize Director Groves' decision as an \nimportant step toward an accurate and fair count and look forward to \nassisting in additional efforts toward that same end in the near \nfuture.\n  While I am encouraged by the recent actions by the Census Bureau, I \nbelieve it is critical to adopt Senator Johanns' amendment so we can \nknow with certainty that partisan political organizations like ACORN \nwill not be underwritten with taxpayer dollars.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 \np.m. today, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Johanns \namendment No. 2355, as modified; that no amendment be in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; and that there be 2 minutes of debate \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, with that, there will be a vote at 5:30 \nthis afternoon, and if any other Senators wish to come to the floor to \nspeak to their amendments, we are here ready and waiting for them to do \nthat.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 25 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Financial Abuses\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, tomorrow is the first anniversary of \nthe Lehman Brothers collapse, the largest bankruptcy in United States \nhistory. Lehman's failure sent shock waves throughout the entire \ncountry.\n  The resulting financial meltdown plunged the American economy into \nthe most severe recession since the 1950s. Credit markets froze, \ninvestor confidence collapsed, stock prices crashed, and millions of \nAmericans lost their jobs, their homes, and their savings.\n  Lehman brought about its own demise. Once the Nation's fourth-largest \ninvestment bank, Lehman allowed a culture of recklessness to engulf its \nfirm.\n  But the blame for this downward spiral and for the consequences to \nmillions of Americans does not end with Lehman. At a time when banks \nwere taking on unprecedented risk, our regulatory agencies were taking \ntheir referees off the field.\n  The SEC, like other regulatory agencies, has made many mistakes in \nrecent years: from failing to monitor the credit rating agencies and \npermitting the banks to increase their capital-leverage ratios to as \nmuch as 30- or 50-to-1 to buy up what turned out to be toxic assets, to \nremoving the uptick rule without putting anything effective in its \nplace and failing to put in place systems to monitor and adjust its \nregulations as the markets rapidly evolved.\n  Our Nation has paid dearly for these mistakes.\n  In response, we have vowed to shine a light on Wall Street, to enact \nfinancial regulatory reforms, to push for clearer\n\n[[Page S9315]]\n\nand enforceable laws, to strengthen our oversight agencies--all in an \neffort to prevent history from repeating itself and to rebuild the \ncredibility of and investor confidence in our markets.\n  But our actions have not yet followed our words.\n  President Obama has proposed a new financial regulation plan that \nwould enforce stricter capital and liquidity requirements for \ninvestment banks, revamp the disjointed regulatory system, and impose \nhigher standards for risky products like credit default swaps.\n  I applaud President Obama's efforts to address the regulatory \nproblems that devastated our economy and I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to create a systemic risk regulator, to regulate \nderivatives effectively, and to ensure consumer financial protections.\n  But we cannot simply react to problems after they have occurred. We \nmust also adopt a forward-looking approach to regulation that \nrecognizes manipulation and wrongdoing while it is happening and stops \nit in its tracks.\n  Because of the damage that was done to our economy by the prior \nfinancial scandals, the regulatory agencies and Congress need to catch \nup and redress prior mistakes--while at the same time focus on current \nquestionable market practices before new problems arise.\n  Since I became a Senator in January, I have been spending much of my \ntime in Congress asking questions and promoting regulatory solutions to \ncurrent questionable practices on Wall Street. And I have stressed \nrepeatedly the need for the SEC to step forward as a strong and \ndetermined cop on the beat.\n  I believe that democracy and fair markets are the foundation of our \nAmerican society.\n  They are both based on the notions of equality and fairness--the idea \nthat all Americans have an equal opportunity to succeed.\n  For markets to have credibility and investors to have confidence, \nCongress and the SEC must act urgently to restore a level playing field \nfor investors.\n  If investors don't believe the markets are fair, they won't invest in \nthem. It is as simple as that.\n  Fairness may be an ever-changing and elusive concept when it comes to \nthe financial markets, but it must be defined and then defended by the \nregulators. Where abuses continue in our financial markets, those \nabuses must be addressed through clear rules with teeth and through \ntough enforcement.\n  Otherwise, we will be left with two financial markets: One market for \nhuge-volume, high-speed players, who can take advantage of every \nloophole for profit, and another market for retail investors, whose \norders are seemingly filled as an afterthought without any special \npriority.\n  For example, since March, I have worked with a bipartisan group of \nSenators to push the SEC to do more about abusive or so-called \n``naked'' short selling.\n  When Lehman Brothers began to go down, many believe naked short \nsellers drove it into its grave, profiting handsomely by manipulating \nthe price of Lehman's stock down, down, down.\n  The SEC will be holding a roundtable on September 30th to discuss \npre-borrow requirements and centralized ``hard locate'' system \nsolutions that I and other Senators have proposed. I strongly urge the \nCommission to propose new rules addressing these issues and to begin to \nelicit serious comments about their effectiveness.\n  At the very least they should set up pilot programs to test how they \nmight work.\n  Otherwise, if the SEC does nothing, I am concerned that when the \nconditions for profitable naked short selling reoccur, there will be no \nenforceable rules to stop it, and the SEC will be unable to punish \nthose who undertake it, just as the SEC has yet to punish anyone for \nthe naked short selling events of last year.\n  More recently, several questionable market structure issues have come \nto light, threatening market fairness in ways we are only beginning to \nunderstand.\n  Wall Street has undergone a radical transformation in only the last \nfew years. Only a few years ago, powerful trading organizations, like \nthe New York Stock Exchange, handled over 80 percent of all \ntransactions. Today, the market is currently heavily fragmented and \ndominated by high-frequency traders.\n  According to research by the Tabb Group, there are now over 50 \ntrading venues in the United States. Technologically advanced high-\nfrequency trading firms now represent over 61 percent of the daily \ntrading volume in stocks.\n  Institutional investors prefer to trade in dark liquidity pools, \nwhich arguably violate the spirit of rules that require fair and non-\ndiscriminatory access to quotations.\n  These innovations, from market fragmentation to high-speed electronic \ntrading, have produced benefits, including increased liquidity, \nnarrowed spreads, and lowered commissions for most investors.\n  But while competition and innovation have flourished, the fundamental \nfairness of our markets cannot be taken for granted.\n  Actions by the SEC over recent decades have had the unintended \nconsequence of producing markets that now seem to favor the most \ntechnologically sophisticated traders, sometimes at the expense of \nordinary retail investors. Moreover, competition for market trading \nvolume among market centers now includes questionable practices such as \nliquidity rebates, flash order offerings, co-location of servers, and \nother inducement arrangements with broker-dealers and other market \nparticipants.\n  Congress, the SEC, and the public they serve need to stand back and \nbetter understand what has happened. Even for the skilled insiders, it \nis all very complicated and opaque, and the challenge we face is to \nunderstand the benefits, costs, and risks of these developments to \nlong-term investors, in a market environment very different from just 5 \nyears ago.\n  This is why I recently called on the SEC to undertake a comprehensive \nreview of a broad range of market issues, analyzing the current market \nstructure from the ground up before piecemeal changes built on the \ncurrent structure add to the potential for execution unfairness.\n  I am concerned that questionable practices threaten to further erode \ninvestor confidence in our financial markets and that our understanding \nand regulatory capability have not kept pace with those changes.\n  To her credit, SEC Chairman Schapiro, for whom I have great respect \nas well as for the urgent tasks she confronts in this challenging era \nfor the Commission, has begun such a review and has agreed to broaden \nit.\n  In her letter responding to my concerns, she too recognizes the \ntrade-offs between liquidity and fairness, as well as the importance of \nstanding up for the interests of long-term investors.\n  She wrote: ``If . . . the interests of long-term investors and \nprofessional short-term traders conflict, the Commission previously has \nemphasized that `its clear responsibility is to uphold the interests of \nlong-term investors.' I firmly agree that the Commission's focus must \nbe on the protection of long-term investors.''\n  Alan Greenspan, the former Fed Chairman, in commenting on the fixed \nincome markets, learned this lesson too late: technological \ndevelopments without effective regulation do not always lead to the \nbest interests of investors.\n  He wrote: ``All of the sophisticated mathematics and computer \nwizardry essentially rested on one central premise: that enlightened \nself interest of owners and managers of financial institutions would \nlead them to maintain a sufficient buffer against insolvency by \nactively monitoring and managing their firms' capital and risk \npositions.'' The premise failed in the summer of 2007, the former Fed \nChairman said, leaving him ``deeply dismayed.''\n  We are all deeply dismayed, and we do not ever want to be so dismayed \nagain.\n  So while recent developments in the equity and options markets are \nvery different from what happened in the fixed income markets, Congress \nmust exercise its oversight capacity to lay out the issues and ask the \ntough questions about high-frequency trading and recent market \nstructure issues.\n  High-frequency traders have many tools at their disposal that give \nthem significant advantages over regular investors.\n  The first is speed. In order to receive information as quickly as \npossible,\n\n[[Page S9316]]\n\nhigh-speed firms place their computer servers right next to the \nexchanges. Co-locating allows them to receive information a few \nmilliseconds before the rest of the world. Because every millisecond is \ncritical in the world of high-frequency trading, firms are willing to \npay millions of dollars annually for this advantage.\n  Information on price movement and market trends is routed directly to \nelectronic algorithms, designed by top engineers to make trades \nautomatically.\n  These programs rely on the rapid acquisition of information in order \nto read the markets and execute trades instantaneously, sometimes as \nmany as 1,000 times in a single second.\n  To prevent abuse, the SEC must ensure ``fair access'' for co-located \nservers at the exchanges and a method of allocation that does not \ndisadvantage retail orders.\n  Another advantage for insiders in this new system, arises from what \nare known as market latency disparities.\n  Market fragmentation appears to permit high-speed traders to use the \ndisparities in time, place, speed, and price to advantage themselves \nover unsuspecting investors.\n  Let me read from a recent article in The Economist magazine entitled \n``Rise of the Machines.'' ``High-frequency traders attempt to uncover \nhow much an investor is willing to pay--or sell for--by sending out a \nstream of probing quotes that are swiftly cancelled until they elicit a \nresponse. The traders then buy or short the targeted stock ahead of the \ninvestor, offering it to them a fraction of a second later for a tidy \nprofit.''\n  While the cost to each individual might be slight, the Tabb Group \nestimates that high-speed stock traders banked about $8 billion in \nprofits last year. Let me repeat: $8 billion with a ``b.'' How much of \nthis profit came from legitimate practices that benefited all \ninvestors, and how much of it was a toll paid by the average investor?\n  We all know the old adage, that it is easier to steal a penny or two \nfrom 100 million people than to steal a million dollars from one \nperson.\n  We need to know if high-speed traders are proving this to be true in \nour markets every day.\n  Some market practices have also introduced potential conflicts of \ninterest into the marketplace. For example, trading venues offer \nrebates to investors who post limit orders, which bring liquidity to \ntheir exchange, and charge for market orders, which take liquidity out \nof the exchange. Some broker-dealer firms direct a sizable majority of \ntheir order flow to the exchanges that offer the highest payments and \nlowest fees.\n  In theory, best execution is always the first priority, as \nregulations clearly state that even if the customer's order is routed \nto a market that does not have the best price, it must be rerouted to \nthe market center that does.\n  I am concerned that regulators are outmatched by the rapid advances \nin high-speed trading. In a highly fragmented system where millions of \ntrades take place in a microsecond, the ability to measure and enforce \nso-called ``best execution'' may be a vain hope.\n  The so-called Rule 605 forms, which purport to measure execution \nquality, are woefully outdated. The first column for time for execution \nreads ``0-9 seconds.'' In a gap of 9 seconds, prices can change \nsignificantly. In a world of 50 market venues, with structural latency \nissues being targeted by an entire industry of high-frequency traders, \nmillions of trades reaping millions of dollars can take place before \nretail investors and the regulators who protect their interests can \ncomprehend what happened.\n  We need to ask if regulators are looking through the wrong end of a \ntelescope when they should be using a microscope.\n  Average investors must now wonder if their orders are being routed to \na venue because it offers the best execution quality for them, or \nbecause it leads to the most revenue or lowest transaction fees for \ntheir brokers.\n  Liquidity rebates paid by the exchanges have increased trade volume \nand thereby provided added revenue for exchanges.\n  Most of the traders who capitalize on rebates are high-frequency \ntraders who execute millions of low-risk trades a day. These market \nparticipants are not investors. Rather, they step in between buy and \nsell orders, trade on both sides of a security, and cash in on double \nthe rebate.\n  Let me again read from The Economist: ``Another popular HFT [high-\nfrequency trading] strategy is to collect rebates that exchanges offer \nto liquidity providers. High-frequency traders will quickly outbid \ninvestors before immediately selling the shares to the investor at the \nslightly higher purchase price, collecting a rebate of one-quarter of a \ncent on both trades.''\n  Some argue that such innovations add needed liquidity to the market. \nBut high-speed traders mainly target the most frequently-traded stocks.\n  Liquidity is light and spreads are wide on many lower-volume stocks. \nWe must rigorously examine the degree to which rebates actually bring \nliquidity to the marketplace where it is needed and help the market \nfunction properly.\n  I have discussed a variety of questionable practices that deserve and \nI hope will receive a searching examination by the SEC and by Congress.\n  While some of these innovations have produced benefits, they have \nalso created wide disparities between high-speed traders and average \ninvestors. We do not have a clear accounting of all the costs and \nbenefits of these recent market structure changes.\n  Under the current system, until empirical data shows up to dispel our \nconcerns, we have little reason to believe average investors can \ncompete with the high-speed traders they are up against.\n  We must question whether certain broker-dealers are acting in the \nbest interests of their customers, under cover of flawed regulation and \nantiquated enforcement techniques. At the same time, we have dark \ntrading platforms that are insufficiently monitored by regulators and \nwhich undermine public price discovery.\n  Moreover, unlike specialists and traditional market-makers that are \nregulated, some of these new high-frequency traders are unregulated, \nthough they are acting in a market-maker capacity.\n  They have no requirements to ``maintain a fair and orderly'' market. \nThey trade when it benefits them.\n  If we experience another shock to the financial system, will this \nnew, and dominant, type of pseudo market maker act in the interest of \nthe markets when we really need them? Will they step up and maintain a \ntwo-sided market, or will they simply shut off the machines and walk \naway? Even worse, will they seek even further profit and exacerbate the \ndownside?\n  Because our rules and regulations are so inapt, most of the practices \nI've mentioned today are still legal, but they are not fair.\n  It used to be that steroids were not banned by Major League Baseball. \nIn fact, they were great for business. The game's biggest sluggers hit \nhome runs at an unprecedented rate, enthralling fans in the process. \nBut the game was tainted, the competition was unfair, and the power was \nnot genuine. Eventually, the game suffered a crisis of legitimacy.\n  High-frequency trading, while not illegal, may operate in ways that \nundermine the legitimacy of our financial markets. In order to restore \ninvestor confidence, we must effectively regulate unfair performance-\nenhancers. We must shine a light on dark pools, conduct a searching \nexamination of high-frequency trading strategies to ensure they are not \nmanipulative, ban flash orders, and give regulators the tools they need \nto ensure that broker-dealers are acting in the best interests of their \nclients.\n  I know as well as anyone the benefits of free markets. I know that \ntechnology, innovation, and competition are critical components of \neconomic growth. But we must balance those interests, against the \nvalues of fairness and equal opportunity. We must bring back a level \nplaying field, encourage long-term investment, and help our economy \ngrow.\n  I am not here today, to stand in the way of progress. I do not wish \nto return to a horse-and-buggy system.\n  High frequency trading and the ``Rise of the Machines''--as The \nEconomist called it--are here to stay.\n  I don't want to ban them. I don't want to slow them down.\n  Simply put, technological developments should not control our \nregulatory destiny; rather, our regulatory\n\n[[Page S9317]]\n\nagencies should ensure that technological progress everywhere bring \nbenefits to long-term investors. And where the interests of the two are \nin conflict, our regulators must stop the practices of professional \nshort-term traders that harm the interests of long-term investors.\n  The market structure rules themselves should not enshrine or permit \nillicit advantages that a careful review, a surgeon's scalpel, \nelectronically constructed solutions, and effective enforcement can \nend.\n  Neither should needed solutions that protect investor interests, like \nreinstatement of some form of the uptick or bid test--or the need for a \n``hard locate'' requirement to end naked short selling once and for \nall--remain unused primarily in deference to the desires and \nconvenience of high-frequency traders.\n  For our part, we in Congress need to undertake a fundamental review \nof the oversight responsibilities we give to regulators, examining \nwhether they have adequate tools to carry out these responsibilities.\n  We have become complacent in thinking that continually updating our \nbody of regulations is enough, when in reality we perhaps have failed \nto provide regulators with the necessary tools they need to observe \nthese complex financial institutions.\n  So on this anniversary of the Lehman Brothers collapse, I conclude by \nsaying I look forward to working with my colleagues, not only to \naddress the financial crises of the past, but also to scrutinize and \nbegin to correct the financial abuses of the present, so we can avoid \nthe problems of the future.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, at 5:30, in a few minutes, we are going \nto vote on the pending amendment, which is an amendment to bar ACORN \nfrom receiving any money from the appropriations bill we are \nconsidering. I spoke earlier today, so I will only speak a couple of \nminutes.\n  I wanted to come to the floor again to underscore the importance of \nthis vote and to underscore the history that brings us here today to \ntake this action. The history is a sad one.\n  On September 9, 2009, Miami-Dade prosecutors issued arrest warrants \nfor 11 ACORN employees. The employees are charged with falsifying voter \nregistration cards. A total of 1,400 voter registration cards were \nturned in, and 888 of those were found to be fake. That means that \nalmost three-quarters of those cards were fraudulent.\n  Late last week, damaging news surfaced regarding hidden videotapes at \nthe New York, Baltimore, and Washington, DC, ACORN offices. What is the \nfeature on these videotapes? They feature ACORN employees offering \nadvice on a number of illegal activities, including tax evasion, \nprostitution, and fraud--all with taxpayer dollars.\n  Finally, the Census Bureau notified ACORN on Friday in a letter that \nit was severing all ties. The Census Bureau has had a bellyful. They \nsevered all ties with this group having to do with the 2010 census. \nHere is what they said in the letter:\n\n     . . . it is clear that ACORN's affiliation with the 2010 \n     Census promotion has caused sufficient concern in the general \n     public, has indeed become a distraction from our mission, and \n     may even become a discouragement to public cooperation, \n     negatively impacting the 2010 Census efforts.\n\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       Unfortunately, we no longer have confidence that our \n     national partnership agreement is being effectively managed \n     through your many local offices. For the reasons stated, we \n     therefore have decided to terminate the partnership.\n\n  According to a report published in July by the minority staff of the \nHouse Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, again quoting:\n\n       Operationally, ACORN is a shell game played in 120 cities, \n     43 states and the District of Columbia through a complex \n     structure designed to conceal illegal activities, to use \n     taxpayer and tax exempt dollars for partisan political \n     purposes, and to distract investigators. Structurally, ACORN \n     is a chess game in which senior management is shielded from \n     accountability by multiple layers of volunteers and \n     compensated employees who serve as pawns to take the fall for \n     every bad act.\n\n  It doesn't stop there. In 1998, an ACORN employee was arrested for \nfalsifying voter registration forms. In 1999, Philadelphia authorities \nfound hundreds of fraudulent registration forms by ACORN. In October of \n2008, ACORN's Nevada offices were raided by Federal agents and in 2009 \ntheir Las Vegas field director--their field director: unbelievable--was \ncharged with voter registration fraud.\n\n  In May 2009, seven ACORN employees were charged in Pittsburgh for \nvoter registration fraud.\n  To date, nearly 70 ACORN employees have been convicted in 12 States \nfor voter registration fraud.\n  The events of the last week are not isolated. We have only caught \nthem. As Judge Richard Zoller said, after holding an ACORN employee \nliable for election law violations:\n\n       Somebody has to go after ACORN.\n\n  Madam President, I suggest this afternoon that ``somebody'' is each \nand every Member of the Senate. Until a full investigation is launched \ninto ACORN, no taxpayer money should be used to fund their activities. \nA vote in favor of my amendment is a vote in favor of the taxpayer and \nagainst the status quo.\n  I will just wrap up by saying, if somehow we could bring the \ntaxpayers of America to the Senate floor and ask them: Do you want your \ntaxpayer dollars to continue to fund this organization, with this kind \nof history, with the videos that have been just released, \noverwhelmingly, taxpayers would say: Absolutely not.\n  This is our opportunity to stand up against an organization that does \nnot deserve the trust of the American people.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \npending amendment and I yield back all time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Maryland (Mrs. Mikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Burr), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Coburn), \nthe Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Graham), the Senator from New \nHampshire (Mr. Gregg), the Senator from Texas (Mrs. Hutchison), the \nSenator from Arizona (Mr. McCain), and the Senator from Louisiana (Mr. \nVitter).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nGraham) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 83, nays 7, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 275 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--83\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Grassley\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     LeMieux\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n[[Page S9318]]\n\n\n\n                                NAYS--7\n\n     Burris\n     Casey\n     Durbin\n     Gillibrand\n     Leahy\n     Sanders\n     Whitehouse\n\n                             NOT VOTING--9\n\n     Burr\n     Byrd\n     Coburn\n     Graham\n     Gregg\n     Hutchison\n     McCain\n     Mikulski\n     Vitter\n  The amendment (No. 2355), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, had I been present, I would \nhave voted in favor of amendment No. 2355 offered by Senator \nJohanns.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, my counterpart, Senator Bond, and I \nhave been on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon, Thursday evening, \nFriday, and this afternoon and into the evening today. We are waiting \nfor Members to bring their amendments to the floor.\n  For the information of all Senators, there will not be votes after 3 \no'clock tomorrow, as everybody knows. We intend to finish this bill by \nWednesday. So there is not a lot of floor time tomorrow.\n  If anyone has an amendment, offer it tonight. We will set up the vote \nfor tomorrow or Wednesday. Again, we intend to finish this bill by \nWednesday. So do not expect that your amendments will have time after \nthat.\n  Again, I ask Members who have amendments to bring them to the floor \nand offer them so we can get them considered and up for a vote.\n  Again, it is going to be a short week. We need to get the bill done \nby Wednesday. We ask everybody to please consider that and come and \noffer their amendments so we can get this bill moving.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I rise to offer for the record the \nBudget Committee's official scoring of H.R. 3288, the Departments of \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $67.7 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2010, which will result in new outlays of $51.8 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \ndiscretionary outlays for the bill will total $134.5 billion.\n  The Senate-reported bill matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and is $8 million below its allocation for outlays. No \nbudget points of order lie against the committee-reported bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  H.R. 3288, TRANSPORTATION, HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT, AND RELATED\n                    AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n  [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                     General\n                                          Defense    Purpose     Total\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................        174     67,526     67,700\n    Outlays............................        174    134,287    134,461\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........     67,700\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........    134,469\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................        174     68,647     68,821\n    Outlays............................        174    134,411      4,585\nPresident's Request:\\1\\\n    Budget Authority...................        174     68,696     68,870\n    Outlays............................        174    134,829    135,003\n \n   Senate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority...................  .........  .........          0\n    Outlays............................  .........  .........         -8\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority...................          0     -1,121     -1,121\n    Outlays............................          0       -124       -124\nPresident's Request:\n    Budget Authority...................          0     -1,170     -1,170\n    Outlays............................          0       -542       -542\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ For comparison purposes, Pesident's requested level is adjusted to\n  remove $39.45 billion in proposed BA that continues to be classified\n  as transportation obligation limitations.\n \nNote: Table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency budget\n  authority provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L.\n  111-32).\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9318-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9318]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Madam President, last week in Cincinnati, President Obama \njoined thousands of Ohioans at the Nation's largest Labor Day picnic. \nOhioans gathered together to celebrate our history of workers who \ntransitioned our Nation from one industry to the next, sustaining our \neconomy, creating the middle class, and strengthening the middle class.\n  It is time once again to invest in our workers. It is time to invest \nin a national manufacturing policy.\n  As Ohioans understand, manufacturing for so many is a ticket to the \nmiddle class, and Ohioans understand that a strong middle class makes a \nstrong nation. That is why American workers deserves a manufacturing \nstrategy that works for them.\n  First, we must invest in manufacturing innovation. We should make \nresearch and development tax credits permanent to incentivize \ninvestment in emerging manufacturing industries, such as clean energy, \nso that the tax system is predictable so investors will bring money \nforward, especially for capital-intensive industries that create jobs \nsuch as wind and solar manufacturing.\n  Second, a national manufacturing strategy must strengthen our \ncomponent supply chain. Companies that make the parts for cars and \ntrucks should be able to expand to make component parts for other \nindustries, such as clean energy, aerospace, and biotechnology. If a \ncompany can make glass for a truck, they can make glass for solar \npanels. If a company can make gears for a car, they can make gear boxes \nfor wind turbines.\n  The Investments for Manufacturing Progress and Clean Technology Act, \nthe IMPACT Act, I introduced 4 months ago, would provide a $30 billion \nrevolving loan fund to help component part manufacturers transition to \nthe clean energy economy.\n  Third, we must better connect workers with jobs in emerging \nindustries. Earlier this year, I introduced the Strengthening \nEmployment Clusters to Organize Regional Success Act which will allow \nlocal communities to determine their workforce needs from the bottom \nup. Workforce investment boards working with local businesses, working \nwith local community colleges, working with local organized labor could \ndetermine what they want to specialize in region by region, even within \na State. That way workers will be retrained for jobs that actually \nexist, that are productive, and that build the middle class.\n  Fourth, there must be improved Federal assistance for economically \ndistressed communities. When a major plant closing results in massive \njob loss and economic decline, there must be a coordinated Federal \nresponse such as we are trying to do in Wilmington, OH, in response to \nthe closing of DHL, the same way the Federal Government responds to \ndisastrous base closings--disastrous in terms of what it does to local \ncommunities--and the same way the Federal Government responds to help a \ncommunity to recover from a devastating flood or tornado.\n  Fifth, a national manufacturing strategy must revamp how our Nation \ndoes trade. It must include fair trade policies that promote American \nmanufacturing and level the playing field for workers and products \nalike.\n  I applaud the President's decision Friday night to stand up and \nenforce fair trade rules that will save jobs, that will help our \ncommunities, that will strengthen the middle class.\n  Since China joined the World Trade Organization, American workers \nhave not been assured that the government would defend them against \nunfair trade. With this section 421 decision--a section of trade law \nthat China agreed to during the permanent normal trade relations \ndebate--President Obama has taken the side of American workers and \nAmerican manufacturers.\n  If American workers and manufacturers are going to compete in the \nglobal market, they need to have a government that uses the trade \nenforcement tools that exist, including the section 421 safeguard.\n  As part of becoming a member of WTO, as I said, about a decade ago, \nChina agreed to this so-called section 421 safeguard. Four times it has \nbeen invoked or been suggested by the International Trade Commission, a \nbipartisan, generally free trade arm of the Federal Government, four \ntimes President Bush backed off and let China have its way. This is the \nfirst President who stood up on this issue to actually enforce the \ntrade laws that exist on the books to make our trade policy fairer and \nto help American workers.\n  The data in this case on tires make clear that American workers are \ngetting crushed by a surge in tire imports from China. Imports of these \nproducts more than doubled in volume and tripled in dollar value in \nonly a 4-year period. During this time, domestic production obviously \ndeclined. Manufacturers could not sell their high-quality products and \norders dropped. In many cases, there was no choice but to slow or even \nhalt production.\n  Take, for example, workers at the Denman Tire Company located in \nLeavittsburg, OH. I have been to that plant. That plant that has been \nin operation for almost 100 years produces a variety of tires. About \nhalf of its 2,600 units-per-day capacity is dedicated to the passenger \nand light truck tires that are the subject of this trade investigation. \nThe facility employs 270 men and women in good-paying, skilled jobs \nthat strengthen the middle class.\n  Take, for example, workers at the Cooper Tire and Rubber facility in \nFindlay, OH. There over 1,100 workers produce some 22,000 units per \nday. The Cooper facility has also been in operation for almost a \ncentury.\n  It is time our trade policies reflect our national interest and that \nwe do not practice trade according to a textbook that was out of print \n20 years ago. It is time our trade laws were enforced to promote our \ngoods and services--and our auto communities.\n  Tomorrow the President travels to Lordstown, OH, a northeast Ohio \ncommunity not far from Youngstown, where GM workers are building the \nnext generation fuel-efficient vehicles, the most fuel-efficient \nvehicles in the GM fleet. Increased production of these vehicles \ninvests in Ohio workers and invests in the future of our auto industry.\n  We have a rare opportunity to reinvigorate manufacturing by helping \nto build demand for products and technologies in a brand new industry. \nWe have not had an opportunity such as this in 40 years. We can build a \nnew industry that will help end global warming and create good will and \nwill rebuild our Nation's manufacturing backbone. We can build on our \nauto industry, which in my State has been a leading economic engine for \nall kinds of next-generation manufacturing.\n  When you look at a GM factory in Parma, outside of Cleveland, or a \nChrysler factory in Toledo, you are also seeing the genesis of next-\ngeneration manufacturing jobs up and down the Ohio Turnpike as it \ncrisscrosses from west of Toledo in Williams County to the Pennsylvania \nborder near Youngstown--jobs in the aerospace industry, the component \nparts industry, the largest industry still in America--auto parts, auto \ncomponents, auto supply parts--and you can also see jobs in the soap \nindustry all coming out of the auto industry. These jobs were created \nout of America's manufacturing ingenuity and entrepreneurship.\n\n[[Page S9320]]\n\n  Plainly and simply, as we work to build more fuel-efficient autos, we \nwill expand opportunities for new manufacturing jobs that become part \nof the green jobs supply chain.\n  Again, this manufacturing strategy must include rigorous trade \nenforcement.\n  I am struck by the chorus of voices from editorial boards and from \nthe conventional wisdom think-tanks that warn against creeping \nprotectionism. Safe to say, none of these editorial writers and none of \nthese think-tank academicians have ever lost their job because of trade \nagreements or ever lost their job because of unfair trade practices.\n  These think-tank academicians and these editorial board members are \nconfusing protectionism with pragmatism. Utilizing trade remedies under \nlimited circumstances, as the President did, as provided for under \ninternational trade rules, is not protectionism. It is simply enforcing \nthe law. Enforcement of trade remedy laws consistent with WTO rules, \nagain, is not protectionism.\n  Most Americans recognize that trade plays an important roll in \ncreating opportunities for economic growth. But when our trade deficit \nis bumped up against $2 billion a day for much of the last several \nyears--we buy $2 billion more in products than we sell abroad, about a \nthird of that bilaterally with China alone--you know something is not \nworking.\n  American workers and businesses have an entrepreneurial spirit and \ncan compete with anyone. They also need to look to new markets to \nsustain economic growth. American workers can compete with anyone, but \nthey must rely on this government to enforce fair trade practices. Done \nright, a national manufacturing policy can reinvest in our workers' \ncapacity to build next-generation technologies and can rebuild the next \ngeneration of middle-class families.\n  One thing is certain: It is time to invest in the workers and the \ncommunities that are the backbone of our middle class.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9320-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     50TH ANNIVERSARY OF BALL HOMES\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I read with great interest a recent \narticle published in the Lexington Herald-Leader, retracing the 50 \nyears of hard work that Don and Mira Ball have put into making their \nbusiness the largest provider of new homes in central Kentucky. On top \nof their success in business, Don and Mira should be commended for the \ngood work they have done on behalf of their community. They have \nsupported several community initiatives, including the Hope Center that \nhelps at-risk and homeless individuals get the stability and the help \nthey need to improve their lives. I am proud to have joined them in \nsupport of this and other efforts for the good of everyone in their \ncity and surrounding region.\n  I know all of my colleagues will join me in recognizing Don and Mira \nfor all they have done for the Lexington community, and for 50 years of \nBall Homes.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the full article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Aug. 9, 2009]\n\n       Homeseller: Ball Homes Is Celebrating 50 Years in Business\n\n                          (By Melissa Nipper)\n\n       Now Central Kentucky's largest home builder, Ball Homes was \n     incorporated in 1959 by Don and Mira Ball. Today, the company \n     is still family owned and operated by Don and Mira and their \n     three children. Ray Ball is the president, and siblings Mike \n     Ball and Lisa Ball Sharp serve as vice presidents.\n       Ball Homes has built thousands of affordable houses in \n     Kentucky neighborhoods over the last five decades. Every year \n     since 1998, BUILDER magazine has named Ball Homes one of the \n     top 100 builders of single-family homes in the nation.\n       While the Ball name is usually associated with home \n     building, the family is also deeply ingrained in the \n     community, supporting organizations such as Habitat for \n     Humanity, the Hope Center, Virginia Place and many others. \n     Many of their efforts promote home ownership, helping people \n     overcome obstacles to the American Dream.\n       ``We are glad that our children see the value of the family \n     business and that what we do is not just to make a living,'' \n     Mira said. ``We are building affordable homes that people can \n     be proud of. We love this community, all of us do, and I \n     don't think there's a better place to be.''\n\n\n                          A STRONG FOUNDATION\n\n       Don and Mira met while attending the University of \n     Kentucky. Don was a pre-law student and worked part time \n     distributing brochures for a builder. The couple married in \n     1955 and four years later started their business. They share \n     fond memories of the early days.\n       ``I remember when Don had his real estate license, we moved \n     13 times in two and a half years,'' Mira said. ``We would \n     find a house that was marketable, fix it up, sell it and buy \n     a new one. That enabled us to get started. Don used to say \n     that our furniture was on wheels.''\n       Ball Homes started targeting the first-time home buyers and \n     over the years evolved into a company that builds for the \n     ``total market,'' Mira said.\n       ``I guess the biggest change is, back then we were building \n     houses for $10,950,'' Don said. ``Now the lots cost more than \n     that.''\n       One thing that hasn't changed is that Ball Homes has always \n     been a family affair. Don and Mira never pushed the home-\n     building business on their children. But from his earliest \n     days, Ray remembers coming to the office with his parents. \n     And of course, there were always summer jobs to be had for \n     the Ball siblings.\n       ``I think (the family business) says a lot about the way \n     our parents raised us,'' said Lisa, who focuses on Ball \n     Homes' sales, marketing and customer relations. ``They \n     weren't in any way overpowering, but they gave us moral \n     lessons and giving back to the community was just inherent in \n     the way they live.''\n\n\n                        A BLUEPRINT FOR SUCCESS\n\n       So how does a builder remain successful for five decades--\n     throughout a continuously evolving market, constant changes \n     in technology and even during economic downturns and \n     recessions?\n       Like all businesses, Ball Homes has had its share of \n     challenges. The toughest time for the company was in the \n     1980's, when mortgage interest rates soared to 22 percent. \n     The family had to develop creative products and financing to \n     weather the hard times. ``And of course, it helped us that \n     that period was a relatively short duration,'' Don said.\n       The family has never been afraid to try new ideas and adapt \n     to the marketplace. In the early 1990s, Ball Homes expanded \n     its product line, offering more styles of homes in a wider \n     variety of price ranges.\n       They also stretched their base into surrounding communities \n     of Versailles, Paris, Richmond, and Frankfort. The company \n     also builds in Louisville, and in 2008 was ranked \n     Louisville's No. 1 home builder by BUILDER magazine.\n       In recent years, the builder has incorporated energy-\n     efficient materials and technology into all of its homes. New \n     Ball Homes meet Energy Star qualifications. (The Energy Star \n     designation signifies that a home meets strict energy \n     efficiency guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency.)\n       ``People may say they don't build (homes) like they used \n     to,'' Mira said. ``Well, today we do so much more with energy \n     efficiency and we build them better than we used to.''\n       Ball Homes has several ongoing projects, including the \n     Chilesburg community which features a six-home model village \n     where home buyers can see a variety of floor plans and \n     amenities in one location.\n       They recently opened another model home village at their \n     newest development, Glasford. Located in Lexington on the \n     outer loop of Man O' War Boulevard between Tates Creek and \n     Nicholasville roads, Glasford offers 30 floor plans and many \n     luxury options, including beautiful tilework, built-in book \n     cases and crown molding, chair rail and wainscoting packages \n     in formal living and dining rooms.\n\n\n                            A BRIGHT FUTURE\n\n       Innovative products, careful planning and great employees \n     helped make Ball Homes what it has become over the past 50 \n     years. However, Ball family members say their success and \n     future depend on the most important component of their \n     business--the customers, many of whom are living in their \n     second and even third-generation Ball Home.\n       ``One of the keys to our success in the environment is that \n     we are recognized as a company that has been here many years, \n     and we will remain here,'' Ray said. ``We just try to take \n     care of the customer and offer a good product in good \n     locations.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9320-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9320-S9321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING JIM WILLIAMS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise today to pay tribute to Jim \nWilliams, the director of communications of one of Kentucky's most \nstoried racetracks, Keeneland in Lexington. After 38 years at the \nforefront of Kentucky's racing community, Mr. Williams has left a \nlegacy worthy of the champion thoroughbred horses who have won there, \nand the entire State wishes him well as he retires from the job he \nloves.\n  Keeneland racetrack is located in the beautiful Bluegrass region of \nKentucky. Since 1936 Keeneland has operated two meets per year, every \nApril and October. For nearly 40 of those years, Mr. Williams has \nhelped transform what was once a small racetrack\n\n[[Page S9321]]\n\nthat began on a local farm into a premier equestrian facility.\n  Mr. Williams's passion and dedication for Keeneland and horse racing \nbegan when he was just a boy, when he moved to Lexington and attended \nhis first race at Keeneland. Since that first race, Mr. Williams has \nbeen in attendance at a majority of Keeneland's races.\n  Mr. Williams has had the opportunity to serve under three Keeneland \npresidents: Mr. Ted Bassett, Mr. Bill Greely and the current CEO, Mr. \nNick Nicholson. Mr. Nicholson spoke dearly of Jim when asked to reflect \non his service. In a recent article in the Lexington Herald-Leader, he \nsaid:\n\n       To put Jim's tenure in perspective, when he joined \n     Keeneland in 1971, Richard Nixon was president, ``All in the \n     Family'' premiered on television, and gas was 30 cents a \n     gallon. Since that time, Jim has been the public face of \n     Keeneland, and he has conducted himself in a manner that has \n     enhanced Keeneland's stature in the eyes of everyone who has \n     had the pleasure of meeting him. Jim is a man of character, \n     integrity and humility. We at Keeneland thank him for his \n     many years of service and wish him the best in his \n     retirement.\n\n  Jim Williams is a legend in Kentucky horse racing and his \ncontributions to the Commonwealth's most hallowed sport are \nimmeasurable. His retirement is going to leave a large hole that will \nbe very hard to fill. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing Jim Williams for his 38 years of service to Keeneland and \nto Kentucky horse racing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9321-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9321]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 BOWLING GREEN AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

The chamber of commerce works to boost the business \n     community by attracting new companies to the area and helping \n     existing businesses expand.\n       ``Our principle responsibility is to bring wealth and \n     prosperity to our community for the benefit of our business \n     members, partners and for all citizens,'' Hizer said.\n       About 7,000 chambers exist in the United States and 1,400 \n     of those are members of the ACCE. This year, two other cities \n     that sit along Interstate 65 won ACCE awards--Nashville's \n     chamber won the large division and Columbus, Ind., won the \n     small division, according to the chamber.\n       In 2008, about 26 businesses either located or expanded \n     operations in the Barren River area with a total investment \n     of about $105 million and 2,092 additional jobs, according \n     the chamber.\n       And because of its new businesses and expansion efforts, \n     southcentral Kentucky received several national recognitions \n     last year--the area was named by Forbes Magazine the 12th \n     best small place in the area for businesses and careers. It \n     was also ranked 33rd of 363 metropolitan areas in job growth \n     and employment.\n       ``The fact that the Bowling Green metropolitan area, by \n     virtually every measure, has been . . . the fastest growing \n     metropolitan area in the state of Kentucky, is evidence that \n     we are achieving our objective in spite of a challenging \n     economic environment,'' Hizer said.\n       As for future economic development, the ACCE award will \n     help attract new businesses and convince existing businesses \n     to consolidate here or expand, Hizer said.\n       ``This sent a message to the rest of the world that there \n     are some special things happening here in southcentral \n     Kentucky,'' Hizer said. ``And that in and of itself will draw \n     additional interest to our community.''\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I would like to take this opportunity \nto recognize the Bowling Green Area Chamber of Commerce for receiving \nthe 2009 Chamber of the Year award.\n  The Bowling Green Chamber of Commerce is truly an outstanding \norganization. It provides an invaluable service to South Central \nKentucky by working with its more than 1,300 partners to stimulate \neconomic development and create a better business environment in the \nregion. Its hard work and advocacy has also enabled Bowling Green to \ncompete nationally and to earn Site Selection Magazine's ranking of \nninth for its number of 2008 industry and expansion projects.\n  The greater Bowling Green region is home to a resilient economy where \nsmall and large businesses are forced to contend with a number of \neconomic challenges. Recognizing these challenges, the Bowling Green \nChamber of Commerce has remained committed to aiding businesses as they \nwork their way through today's economic landscape.\n  Strong leadership and solid organization have contributed to the \nchamber's record of success. Under the guidance of current chamber \npresident, Jim Hizer, the chamber's membership and activities have \ncontinued to increase, providing local businesses more opportunities \nfor growth and employment.\n  I would like to congratulate the Bowling Green Chamber of Commerce \nfor receiving the 2009 Chamber of the Year award. Over the years, it \nhas become a strong organization committed to serving the interests of \nits members and community. I wish it all the best in its future \nendeavors within Kentucky and around our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9321-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9321-S9322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last Friday was the eighth anniversary of \nthe September 11 terrorist attacks, and we solemnly remembered the \nthousands of innocent lives, of many nationalities and religions, that \nwere so cruelly and indiscriminately destroyed on that infamous day. It \nwas a defining moment for our country, and since then we have sought to \naddress the shocking intelligence and security failures that enabled \nthe perpetrators to so brazenly enter this country and carry out those \nattacks, as well as to track down the masterminds of that atrocity and \nto destroy al-Qaida and other terrorist networks that have become a \nglobal menace.\n  We all recognize the threat that violent extremists pose to \nAmericans, as well as to citizens of other countries, and the \nimperative of countering it. This should not be a matter of partisan \npolitics, but of working together in a common purpose for the sake of \nlaw abiding people everywhere. I supported many of the initiatives of \nthe Bush administration, as I have the Obama administration, to make \nour borders more secure, to improve our intelligence gathering, to \ntrack down terrorists and bring them to justice.\n  But there have been strong differences over what tactics to use, and \nthe effectiveness of military force to combat violent extremism in \ncountries where we are widely seen as invaders or occupiers. No issue \nhas generated more\n\n[[Page S9322]]\n\ncontroversy than the Bush Administration's abuse of detainees, whether \nat Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq, Bagram prison in Afghanistan, Guantanamo, \nother secret detention facilities around the world, or through the use \nof ``extraordinary rendition'' whereby prisoners were secretly \ndelivered to the custody of foreign security forces whose use of \ntorture was well documented.\n  These policies and practices, conceived and supported at the highest \nlevels of the Bush administration, justified by Department of Justice \nlawyers who made a mockery of the law, and steadfastly defended as \nrecently as last week by former Vice President Cheney, were abhorrent. \nThey were also dangerous. They violated our international legal \nobligations, caused grave harm to our reputation as a country devoted \nto the rule of law, endangered our service men and women who every day \nface the risk of capture and mistreatment by our enemies, and caused \ndeep embarrassment among the American people who, for generations, have \ntaken pride in the image of our country as a defender of human rights \nand the highest moral values.\n  Last Friday, these issues and concerns were eloquently addressed in a \ntimely piece in The Miami Herald by two distinguished retired senior \nU.S. military officers, Charles C. Krulak, who was commandant of the \nMarine Corps from 1995 to 1999, and Joseph P. Hoar, who was commander \nin chief of U.S. Central Command from 1991 to 1994. I urge all Senators \nto read it, and ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Miami Herald, Sept. 11, 2009]\n\n                 Fear Was No Excuse To Condone Torture\n\n               (By Charles C. Krulak and Joseph P. Hoar)\n\n       In the fear that followed the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, \n     Americans were told that defeating Al Qaeda would require us \n     to ``take off the gloves.'' As a former commandant of the \n     U.S. Marine Corps and a retired commander-in-chief of U.S. \n     Central Command, we knew that was a recipe for disaster.\n       But we never imagined that we would feel duty-bound to \n     publicly denounce a vice president of the United States, a \n     man who has served our country for many years. In light of \n     the irresponsible statements recently made by former Vice \n     President Dick Cheney, however, we feel we must repudiate his \n     dangerous ideas--and his scare tactics.\n       We have seen how ill-conceived policies that ignored \n     military law on the treatment of enemy prisoners hindered our \n     ability to defeat al Qaeda. We have seen American troops die \n     at the hands of foreign fighters recruited with stories about \n     tortured Muslim detainees at Guantanamo and Abu Ghraib. And \n     yet Cheney and others who orchestrated America's disastrous \n     trip to ``the dark side'' continue to assert--against all \n     evidence--that torture ``worked'' and that our country is \n     better off for having gone there.\n       In an interview with Fox News Sunday, Cheney applauded the \n     ``enhanced interrogation techniques''--what we used to call \n     ``war crimes'' because they violated the Geneva Conventions, \n     which the United States instigated and has followed for 60 \n     years. Cheney insisted the abusive techniques were \n     ``absolutely essential in saving thousands of American lives \n     and preventing further attacks against the United States.'' \n     He claimed they were ``directly responsible for the fact that \n     for eight years, we had no further mass casualty attacks \n     against the United States. It was good policy . . . It worked \n     very, very well.''\n       Repeating these assertions doesn't make them true. We now \n     see that the best intelligence, which led to the capture of \n     Saddam Hussein and the elimination of Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, \n     was produced by professional interrogations using non-\n     coercive techniques. When the abuse began, prisoners told \n     interrogators whatever they thought would make it stop.\n       Torture is as likely to produce lies as the truth. And it \n     did.\n       What leaders say matters. So when it comes to light, as it \n     did recently, that U.S. interrogators staged mock executions \n     and held a whirling electric drill close to the body of a \n     naked, hooded detainee, and the former vice president winks \n     and nods, it matters.\n       The Bush administration had already degraded the rules of \n     war by authorizing techniques that violated the Geneva \n     Conventions and shocked the conscience of the world. Now \n     Cheney has publicly condoned the abuse that went beyond even \n     those weakened standards, leading us down a slippery slope of \n     lawlessness. Rules about the humane treatment of prisoners \n     exist precisely to deter those in the field from taking \n     matters into their own hands. They protect our nation's \n     honor.\n       To argue that honorable conduct is only required against an \n     honorable enemy degrades the Americans who must carry out the \n     orders. As military professionals, we know that complex \n     situational ethics cannot be applied during the stress of \n     combat. The rules must be firm and absolute; if torture is \n     broached as a possibility, it will become a reality. Moral \n     equivocation about abuse at the top of the chain of command \n     travels through the ranks at warp speed.\n       On Aug. 24, the United States took an important step toward \n     moral clarity and the rule of law when a special task force \n     recommended that in the future, the Army interrogation manual \n     should be the single standard for all agencies of the U.S. \n     government.\n       The unanimous decision represents an unusual consensus \n     among the defense, intelligence, law enforcement and homeland \n     security agencies. Members of the task force had access to \n     every scrap of intelligence, yet they drew the opposite \n     conclusion from Cheney's. They concluded that far from making \n     us safer, cruelty betrays American values and harms U.S. \n     national security.\n       On this solemn day we pause to remember those who lost \n     their lives on 9/11. As our leaders work to prevent \n     terrorists from again striking on our soil, they should \n     remember the fundamental precept of counterinsurgency we've \n     relearned in Afghanistan and Iraq: Undermine the enemy's \n     legitimacy while building our own. These wars will not be won \n     on the battlefield. They will be won in the hearts of young \n     men who decide not to sign up to be fighters and young women \n     who decline to be suicide bombers. If Americans torture and \n     it comes to light--as it inevitably will--it embitters and \n     alienates the very people we need most.\n       Our current commander-in-chief understands this. The task \n     force recommendations take us a step closer to restoring the \n     rule of law and the standards of human dignity that made us \n     who we are as a nation. Repudiating torture and other cruelty \n     helps keep us from being sent on fools' errands by bad \n     intelligence. And in the end, that makes us all safer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9322-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9322]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        POLAND'S 70 YEAR JOURNEY\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, this month we commemorate an important \nanniversary: 70 years ago the Second World War began in Europe with a \nruthless Nazi assault on Poland. Outnumbered and outgunned, Poland's \ndefenders fought bravely, forced to surrender only through the \noverwhelming force of their enemies. Every American should remember the \nsacrifice made by the heroes of Poland, whose bravery was tragically \noften rewarded with a concentration camp or a bullet in the head in a \ndark forest. They were the first of many innocent victims, almost too \nmany to count.\n  On an occasion like this it is important to honor the past, remind \nthe present of the sacrifice of those who came before, and warn the \nfuture that the world should never allow the initiation of such \ncatastrophic events again.\n  In September 1939, authoritarian paranoia and violence won out over \ntrust and humanity, and in the end the world burned. Seventy years \nlater, Poland and its democratic neighbors work together in Brussels to \nbuild a better Europe. We remember the importance of that hard-won \ncooperation on this 70th anniversary.\n  As Americans, let us appreciate this achievement, help extend the \ncooperation, and continue to assist in the preservation of democratic \nideals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9322-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9322-S9323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   BASKETBALL HALL OF FAME INDUCTEES\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I wish to speak about a matter of great \nprominence to the people of my State. This past Friday, in Springfield, \nMA, Jerry Sloan and John Stockton were inducted into the Naismith \nMemorial Basketball Hall of Fame. This is a well-deserved honor, and I \nwanted to take a few moments to congratulate them both.\n  As any fan of professional basketball can tell you, the Energy \nSolutions Arena in Salt Lake City is widely considered one of the most \ndifficult places for visiting teams to play. Some have tried to blame \nthis on the city's high elevation, but, if you have ever been to a game \nthere, you know very well that it is because of the Jazz fans.\n  You see, due to its relatively small population, Utah has only one \nmajor sports franchise--the Jazz. And there were times when people \nthought that this small market would not be able to sustain even a \nsingle NBA team. But for more than two decades the Jazz have enjoyed \none of the most loyal and supportive fan bases of any team in \nprofessional sports. This is due in no small part to the careers of \nboth John Stockton and Jerry Sloan.\n  John Stockton grew up in Spokane, WA, and played basketball at both\n\n[[Page S9323]]\n\nGonzaga Prep and Gonzaga University in his hometown. He was a relative \nunknown when he moved into the professional ranks, picked by the Jazz \nin the middle of the first round of the 1984 draft and initially \nrelegated to a reserve role on the team. But after three seasons he \nbecame the full-time starter at the point guard position and went on to \nhave one of the most prolific careers in basketball history.\n  Over the course of his career, he accumulated numerous honors. He was \nselected to play in the NBA All Star game 10 times. He played on the \n1992 and 1996 Olympic teams--the first two Olympic squads to include \nprofessional players winning Gold Medals in both years. He was selected \nto the All-NBA First Team twice, the All-NBA Second Team six times, the \nAll-NBA Third Team three times, and the NBA All-Defensive Second Team \nfive times. In 1996, the NBA celebrated its 50th anniversary by \nselecting the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. Of course, John \nStockton was honored on this list as well.\n  Though the accomplishment of winning an NBA championship eluded him, \nStockton did lead the Jazz to two consecutive NBA Finals appearances in \n1997 and 1998. John Stockton was immortalized in the first of those \nseasons when, in Game 6 of the Western Conference finals, he scored the \nlast 9 points for the Jazz, including a last-second 3 pointer to send \nthe Jazz to the Finals for the first time. This was probably the most \nmemorable moment of Stockton's career and the history of the Jazz \nfranchise and it is still replayed in montages of great sports moments.\n  It is impossible to talk about John Stockton without mentioning Karl \nMalone. Together, these two formed one of the game's legendary one-two \npunches. Together, they became the league's models of consistency, \ncommitment, and success. The two played 18 seasons and an NBA record \n1,412 regular-season games together as teammates. Due to their \ncollaborative efforts, Malone finished his career as the second highest \nscorer in NBA history and Stockton holds the all time career assist \nrecord.\n  Let's talk about that assist record for a moment. In the 63-year \nhistory of the NBA, only 4 players have career assist totals of over \n10,000. Stockton finished his career with 15,806 assists. Mark Jackson, \nNo. 2 on the list, collected 10,334 assists--5,483 fewer than Stockton.\n  But, the raw numbers don't do this record justice. To put it in \nperspective, only 37 players have dished out 5,483 or more assists in \ntheir entire careers. Indeed, just getting that many assists over a \nwhole career would put you in pretty elite company--and that is the \ndifference between John Stockton's total and that of the guy who is \nnext in line.\n  This record is among the truly unbreakable records in all of sports--\nand it isn't the only one held by John Stockton. He also holds the \ncareer record in steals, also by a considerable margin. He holds the \nNBA record for the most seasons and consecutive games played with one \nteam and is third in total games played.\n  John Stockton's success on the floor was matched only by his \nconsistency. He missed only 22 games during his career, 18 of them came \nin 1 season. In 17 of his 19 seasons in the NBA, he played in every \nsingle game. Overall, he played in 1,504 of 1,526 possible games. These \nare Lou Gehrig or Cal Ripken-type numbers.\n  Stockton will always be remembered for his no-nonsense approach to \nthe game, his hard-nosed defense, his matchless work ethic, and his \nquiet, unassuming personality. His unflashy, fundamentally sound style \nof play earned him the respect of John Wooden, the legendary UCLA \nbasketball coach, who once said that John Stockton was the only NBA \nplayer he would pay money to see.\n  Stockton retired in 2003 and returned home to Spokane. While other \nNBA greats have sought careers in broadcasting and coaching after their \ncareers were over, so far, John has been content to stay at home with \nhis family. This comes as no surprise to those who know him.\n  Guiding John through most of his NBA career, was coach Jerry Sloan, \nwho, once again, is also being inducted into the Hall of Fame. Sloan's \ncareers as both a player and a coach have been characterized by his \nunyielding toughness and an unmatched drive to compete.\n  Jerry was born and raised in McLeansboro, IL, and played his college \ncareer at the University of Evansville. He played one season in the NBA \nfor the Baltimore Bullets before being selected by the Chicago Bulls in \nthe expansion draft. In fact, he was the team's first player, earning \nhim the nickname ``The Original Bull.'' Sloan quickly became known for \nhis tenacity on defense, and he led the expansion team to the playoffs \nin its first season.\n  He had an exceptional career as a player. He played in two All-Star \nGames, was named to the NBA All-Defensive First Team four times and the \nAll-Defensive Second Team twice. He also led the Bulls to the playoffs \non various occasions and helped them to win the franchise's only \ndivision title prior to the Michael Jordan era. After his playing \ncareer was cut short by knee injuries, the Bulls retired Sloan's No. 4 \njersey, the first jersey retirement in the team's history.\n  Immediately after his retirement, he became part of the Bull's \ncoaching staff, starting out as a scout, eventually working his way up \nto head coach, a position he held for three seasons. A few years later, \nhe joined the Jazz coaching staff as an assistant to another Utah \nsports icon, Frank Layden. In 1988, when Layden's health forced him to \nretire, Jerry was named head coach of the Jazz, a position he has held \never since.\n  Coach Sloan just finished his 20th season as coach of the Jazz, a \nmilestone that, in today's sports world, is almost unthinkable. Over \nthe course of his Jazz tenure, literally hundreds of coaching changes \nhave taken place throughout the NBA. In a league that has had a number \nof great coaches in its history, none have coached for the same team as \nlong as Jerry Sloan.\n  This extends to other sports as well. Currently, Sloan is the \nlongest-tenured coach in any major professional sport.\n  There are a number of reasons to explain his longevity. The most \nobvious is that he has been successful. He is currently fourth on the \nlist for alltime coaching wins--though he holds the record for most \nwins with one team. In 17 out of the 20 seasons he's been in Utah, the \nJazz have been in the playoffs, the only absences coming in \ntransitional years after the departures of John Stockton and Karl \nMalone.\n  Another reason Sloan has been able to stick around is his consistent, \nno-nonsense approach to the game. Over time, teams have changed \nstrategies to become flashier in order to cater to younger fans and the \nnew era of players, many of whom have been self-centered prima donnas. \nThroughout that time, Coach Sloan has been a model of consistency, \nplacing premiums on discipline and hard work among his players. The \nresult has been a franchise that, for over two decades, has competed at \na high level.\n  In many ways, Stockton and Sloan were alike, and their strengths \ncomplemented each other. Neither one will claim to have been able to be \nsuccessful without the other.\n  Currently, there is a huge statue of John Stockton in front of the \nEnergy Solutions arena alongside a statue of Karl Malone. Chances are, \nin 20 or 30 years when Jerry Sloan finally decides to hang it up, they \nwill want to build a monument to him as well. Neither of these \ngentlemen would actively seek such limelight, but few are as deserving.\n  Once again, I would like to extend my congratulations to both John \nStockton and Jerry Sloan for this great honor and to thank them for \ntheir contributions to the Utah community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9323-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9323-S9324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          COMMENDING DICK RUSH\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, on behalf of the Oklahoma \nCongressional Delegation, I would like to congratulate Richard P. Rush \non his retirement from the Oklahoma State Chamber of Commerce.\n  Dick will be leaving the State chamber next spring after serving as \nits president and chief executive officer for 24 years. Dick has made a \npositive contribution to the State of Oklahoma and has been \ncharacterized as ``the State's leading pro-business advocate.''\n\n[[Page S9324]]\n\nDick's success is evident in both his internal administration of the \nState chamber and his work leading key probusiness campaigns which have \nmade a positive impact on Oklahoma creating jobs and increasing \nbusiness development.\n  Due to Dick's work, the State chamber now operates debt free. During \nhis tenure, Dick has built the State chamber to over 2,000 members. He \nhas been named Executive of the Year by the Oklahoma Chamber of \nCommerce Executives and is already a member of the Oklahoma Chamber of \nCommerce Hall of Fame.\n  Through leading key campaigns advocating new business opportunities \nand job creation such as Right-to-Work and tort reform, Dick has been \ncredited with saving the business community in Oklahoma over $2 \nbillion. In fact, the State chamber recently earned the Nation's \nhighest honor from the American Tort Reform Association and the U.S. \nChamber's Institute for Legal Reform. Just this year, the State chamber \nwas awarded the ``The State Legislative Achievement Award'' by the U.S. \nChamber's Institute for Legal Reform and the first annual ``Gold Medal \nfor the Best State Civil Justice Legislation'' by the American Tort \nReform Association. Dick has also led international outreach serving as \nExecutive in Charge of sister chamber work between the Oklahoma State \nChamber and both the Gansu, China Provincial Chamber and the Liaoning, \nChina Provincial Chamber. Dick was a presenter at the VI Hemispheric \nSister Cities Forum in Iquique, Chile, and he is the recipient of the \n``The George Nigh Global Trade Award.'' Dick's involvement in Oklahoma \nbusiness development has been extensive.\n  Dick's success is due in part to his long history in chamber \nmanagement. Before coming to Oklahoma, Dick worked in chambers \nthroughout the country from California to Texas before coming to \nOklahoma in 1986. His experience also extends internationally as Dick \nworked as a project adviser for the U.S. Chamber's Center for \nInternational Private Enterprise serving as a consultant to the \nNational Chamber of Commerce of Zimbabwe, Africa.\n  Oklahomans can appreciate Dick's service to the Oklahoma State \nChamber and the entire State of Oklahoma, and we wish him the very best \nin his retirement and all future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9324-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING C. VIVIAN STRINGER\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to extend my \ncongratulations to C. Vivian Stringer for her induction into the \nNaismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. It is a proper tribute for \nsuch a distinguished and celebrated career. This is certainly an \nincredible honor which stands tall, even amongst her other considerable \naccolades.\n  The success that Vivian Stringer has achieved in her 38-year coaching \ncareer, including the last 14 at Rutgers University, speaks for itself: \n825 victories; 30 seasons of 20 or more wins; 22 NCAA Tournament \nappearances; 4 Final Fours with 3 different programs; Olympic Gold as \nan assistant coach with the 2004 U.S. Women's Basketball team. Her \ncommitment to excellence is unsurpassed and lauded by peers and \nsupporters alike.\n  Most importantly, Vivian Stringer has served, above all else, as a \nteacher to each of her players. Her dedication to education beyond the \ncourt is clear, as her players traditionally graduate on par with their \nnonathlete classmates. The students who have walked into her program \nwalk out of it as strong and dignified women, each ready to continue \nthe legacy of achievement that Vivian Stringer has set before them, \nwhatever the arena. Two years ago, Vivian Stringer's leadership was on \ndisplay as the Lady Scarlet Knights, in the face of adversity and \nslander, served as shining examples of exceptional poise and grace.\n  This 2009 Hall of Fame Class is indeed one of the most distinguished \nin memory, and it is fitting that Vivian Stringer enters alongside \nother luminaries that share her caliber of achievement. I applaud \nVivian Stringer's service to Rutgers University, the entire basketball \ncommunity, and the great State of New Jersey. I wish her luck as she \ncontinues her career and in all of her other future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9324-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9324-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9324-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9324]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. LIEBERMAN, from the Committee on Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs, with amendments:\n       S. 599.

A bill to require the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to satisfy certain conditions before issuing to \nproducers of mid-level ethanol blends a waiver from certain \nrequirements under the Clean Air Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today along with Senators Cardin, \nWhitehouse, and Landrieu I am introducing legislation that requires the \nadministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency to satisfy three \nconditions before granting a waiver from the Clean Air Act of 1970 to \nproducers of mid-level blends of ethanol. These are fuels that contain \nmore than ten percent ethanol that are destined for use in engines \noriginally designed to work with just gasoline.\n  While I believe that expanding our capacity to generate and use \nrenewable energy is an important step toward becoming energy \nindependent, I have serious concerns about the impact of ethanol on \nengines and fuel efficiency. Ethanol blends are more corrosive than \ngasoline and can cause failure in small and older engines, such as boat \nengines.\n  The 2005 Energy Policy Act required that renewable fuels be \nintroduced into our fuel supply to reduce our dependence on foreign \noil. In 2007, that Renewable Fuel Standard was updated to require that \nby the year 2022 we introduce annually a minimum of 36 billion gallons \nof renewable fuel into our fuel supply.\n  The first, easiest route to satisfying the renewable fuel mandate was \nthrough blending ethanol, chiefly derived from corn, into gasoline at a \nlevel of 10 percent by volume, resulting in a gasoline known as \n``E10.'' Due to its high oxygen content, this fuel requires a Clean Air \nAct waiver, which EPA first granted in 1978. Today, in many areas of \nthe country, people only have E10 as a choice at the pump. This \nincludes my constituents in Maine. While the most modern engines have \nbeen designed to work with E10, older engines have well-documented \ndifficulties using this fuel. I am very concerned that they will have \neven greater problems using ethanol fuel blends with even higher levels \nof ethanol.\n  E10 was introduced into Maine in 2008 and now it is the only fuel \nchoice in the State. E10 has caused problems for some of my \nconstituents. One topped off his gas tanks before heading to sea but, \ntwo miles out, the boat stopped. He later discovered that his tanks \nwere topped off with E10 that destroyed his boat's fuel lines and \ncaused fuel filters and carburetors to clog. He eventually had to tear \nup the boat deck and replace the fuel tanks at a cost of thousands of \ndollars.\n  In March 2009, manufacturers of mid-level ethanol blends containing \nas much as 15 percent of ethanol by volume, termed E15, petitioned the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, EPA, to also grant this new fuel a \nwaiver from the Clean Air Act. Many organizations share my concern \nabout this development and are demanding that the performance of E15 in \nthe current fleet of engines be thoroughly investigated before the new \nfuel can be introduced into commerce.\n  In June, 21 Senators wrote to the administrator of the EPA urging her \nto ensure that independent and comprehensive testing of any ethanol \nblend fuel with greater than 10 percent ethanol was completed prior to \nany waiver from current EPA guidance as required under the Clean Air \nAct. The response on July 20 was that a decision to grant a waiver for \nthe new fuel rests entirely on the demonstration that the new fuel will \nnot cause or contribute to the failure of vehicles or engines to meet \nemission standards. This is not adequate to alleviate my concerns about \nolder and non-road engines.\n  Thus, today I am introducing the Mid-Level Ethanol Blends bill. This \nbill requires that the EPA Science Advisory Board carefully evaluate \nthe body of evidence presented about E15's performance in the current \ninventory of engines and report back to the Administrator before any \nwaiver is granted. The report would indicate whether or not a \nsufficient body of evidence exists to support a decision to grant a \nwaiver, which is hotly contested between supporters of E15 and those \nwho caution against introducing the fuel into the market now. \nAutomobile manufacturers who warranty their products to perform with \nE10 are justifiably concerned about whether they will be able to extend \nthe warranty to users of E15 without putting themselves at significant \neconomic risk. They will require significant testing of all engine and \nemission systems before accepting such risks.\n  The Science Advisory Board also would report on the ability of the \nwholesale and retail gasoline fuel infrastructure to introduce an E15 \nfuel into commerce without consumer confusion or misfueling. The \nScience Advisory Board also would estimate whether consumers throughout \nthe country will be able to purchase gasoline other than E15 \nimmediately and for five years after the introduction of the new blend. \nThis will provide the Administrator with information about potential \ndifficulties faced by many millions of vehicle, boat, and small-engine \ndevices, for example, lawnmowers, chainsaws, weed trimmers, \nsnowmobiles, that have engines whose performance could be compromised \nwere they unable to use any fuel other than E15.\n  Once the Science Advisory Board report is released and the public has \nan opportunity to comment on the Board's findings, should the \nadministrator decide to grant a waiver, this bill requires that the \nadministrator formally respond to the recommendations of the Science \nAdvisory Board in the waiver announcement. The administrator can only \nissue a waiver if the findings are that it will not adversely \nconventional gasoline-powered onroad and nonroad vehicles and nonroad \nengines in widespread use as of the date the new fuel is introduced.\n  There are over 200 million engines in the U.S. today that could \nconceivably be damaged by the introduction of new fuel blends \ncontaining higher amounts of ethanol. Should this occur, it would \nresult in significant hardship to millions of Americans. We simply \ncannot place so many people in jeopardy through precipitous actions. \nAny introduction of a new fuel must be done carefully with ample time \nfor testing.\n  As we pursue strategies to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, we \nmust also take action to insure that ethanol fuel blends are safe and \nefficient for current engines. I urge my colleagues to join me, Senator \nCardin, and the coalition of organizations endorsing this legislation, \nand ensure that the ramifications of introducing mid-level ethanol \nblends into commerce are thoroughly understood before they are granted \na waiver from the Clear Air Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S9329]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for the development and coordinator of a \ncomprehensive and integrated United States research program that \nassists the people of the United States and the world to understand \npast, assess present, and predict future human-induced and natural \nprocesses of abrupt climate change, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer a bill to authorize \nfunding for abrupt climate change research. I am pleased to be joined \non this bill by Senator Cantwell as lead cosponsor and by our \ncolleagues, Senators Snowe, Kerry, and Gillibrand.\n  Abrupt climate change is defined as a large-scale change in the \nclimate system that takes place over a few decades or less, persists, \nor is anticipated to persist, for at least a few decades, and causes \nsubstantial disruptions in human and natural systems.\n  Our bill authorizes $10 million per year for the next 6 years for a \ncomprehensive and integrated competitive, peer-reviewed, research \nprogram at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to \nunderstand, assess, and predict abrupt climate change.\n  Abrupt climate change is not necessarily a result of increased \namounts of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. It can be caused by \nnatural phenomena, such massive volcanic eruptions, or natural climate \nvariability.\n  However it comes about, abrupt climate change can pose significant \nrisks and challenges to our society. For us to uphold our \nresponsibility as stewards of the Nation's environmental and economic \nsecurity, it is crucial that we better understand abrupt climate change \nso that we can recognize it early and respond to it effectively.\n  Understanding and predicting climate change are enormous scientific \nchallenges. The challenges are made even more difficult with the \nrecognition that the climate system is capable of dramatic and abrupt \nchanges. Past global temperatures have swung as much as 20 degrees \nfahrenheit within a decade, accompanied by drought in some places and \ncatastrophic floods in others. An abrupt climate change triggered by \nthe ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would also \nlikely result in the redistribution of atmospheric moisture and \nrainfall, with substantial impact on the world's food supplies. \nUnfortunately, we have no satisfactory understanding of what triggers \nabrupt climate changes.\n  The National Academy of Sciences and the U.S. Climate Change Science \nProgram have identified abrupt climate change as a key priority for \nadditional research. The National Academy of Sciences stated that \n``Large, abrupt climate changes have repeatedly affected much or all of \nthe Earth.'' Furthermore, the Academy went on to state that ``abrupt \nclimate changes are not only possible but likely in the future, \npotentially with large impacts on ecosystems and societies,'' and noted \nthat we're not doing nearly enough to identify the threat of abrupt \nclimate change. The U.S. Climate Change Science Program last reported \nto the President and Congress on abrupt climate change in December \n2008. The overarching recommendation of this report is the urgent need \nfor committed and sustained monitoring of components of the climate \nsystem particularly vulnerable to abrupt climate change. Our bill \nprovides a framework and funds for the U.S. to better understand and \naddress abrupt climate change.\n  One reason this funding is so urgent is that we are rapidly losing \none of the greatest sources of information: ice cores from glaciers. \nThe University of Maine's Climate Change Institute has one of the best \nabrupt climate change research programs in the world. The Climate \nChange Institute uses ice cores from glaciers and ice sheets around the \nworld to make discoveries that change the way we think about climate \nchange. Unfortunately, numerous glaciers around the world are melting, \nand when they go, we lose the very record that has given us so much of \nthis critical climatic history.\n  I have had several opportunities to see how scientists are able to \nuse glaciers and ice sheets to understand climate change. In 2006, I \njoined Senators McCain and Sununu in traveling to the South Pole to see \ngroundbreaking research taking place on ice more than 2 miles deep. \nAlong the way we toured some of the University of Maine research sites \nin New Zealand with distinguished Professor George Denton, who was the \nfirst scientist from the University of Maine to be elected to the \nNational Academy of Sciences. According to Professor Denton, 50 percent \nof the glaciers in New Zealand have melted since 1860, and this melting \nis unprecedented in the last 5,000 years. We stood with the professor \non sites that had been buried by massive glaciers at the beginning of \nthe 20th century, but are now ice free.\n  I also traveled with Senators McCain, Sununu, and others to Ny-\nAlesund, the northernmost community in the world. The scientists we met \nwith told us that the global climate is changing more rapidly now than \nat any time since the beginning of civilization. They further stated \nthat the region of the globe changing most rapidly is the Arctic. The \nchanges are remarkable and disturbing.\n\n[[Page S9330]]\n\n  In the last 30 years, the Arctic has lost sea-ice cover over an area \n10 times as large as the State of Maine. In the summer, the change is \neven more dramatic, with twice as much ice loss. The ice that remains \nis as much as 40 percent thinner than it was just a few decades ago. In \nNy-Alesund, Senator McCain and I witnessed massive blocks of ice \nfalling off glaciers that had already retreated well back from the \nshores where they once rested.\n  The melting of glaciers and sea ice, the thawing of permafrost, and \nthe increases in sea levels resulting from warming are already \nbeginning to cause environmental, social, and economic changes. If \nthese changes were to be compounded with an abrupt climate change on \nthe scale seen in our climatic history, the result could be \ndevastating.\n  Mr. President, this measure has passed the Senate many times, as part \nof the 2001, 2003, and 2007 energy bills. I hope this is the year that \nwe finally pass this important provision into law. I urge my colleagues \nto support this bill.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1667\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Abrupt Climate Change \n     Research Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``abrupt climate change'' means a \n     change in the climate that occurs so rapidly or unexpectedly \n     that human or natural systems have difficulty adapting to the \n     climate as changed.\n\n     SEC. 3. ABRUPT CLIMATE CHANGE RESEARCH PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Establishment of Program.--The Secretary of Commerce \n     shall establish within the Office of Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Research of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration, and carry out, a program of extramural \n     awards, made on a peer-reviewed and competitive basis, to \n     conduct scientific research on abrupt climate change.\n       (b) Purposes of Program.--The purposes of the program \n     established under subsection (a) shall be as follows:\n       (1) To develop a global array of terrestrial and \n     oceanographic indicators of paleoclimate in order to \n     sufficiently identify and describe past instances of abrupt \n     climate change.\n       (2) To improve understanding of thresholds and \n     nonlinearities in geophysical systems related to the \n     mechanisms of abrupt climate change.\n       (3) To incorporate such mechanisms into advanced \n     geophysical models of climate change.\n       (4) To test the simulation of climate change by such models \n     against an improved global array of records of past abrupt \n     climate changes.\n\n     SEC. 4. AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of Commerce for each of \n     fiscal years 2010 through 2016, $10,000,000 to carry out the \n     research program established under section 3(a).\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Amounts appropriated pursuant \n     to the authorization of appropriations in subsection (a) are \n     authorized to remain available until expended.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/14/senate-section/article/S9330-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9330-S9331]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 263--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 2009 AS ``NATIONAL MEDICINE \n                        ABUSE AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Feinstein) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n\n                              S. Res. 263\n\n       Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines are \n     extremely safe, effective, and potentially lifesaving when \n     used properly;\n       Whereas the abuse and recreational use of over-the-counter \n     and prescription medicines can be extremely dangerous and \n     produce serious side effects;\n       Whereas during a recently sampled month, approximately \n     7,000,000 individuals 12 years of age and older reported \n     using prescription psychotherapeutic medicines for non-\n     medical purposes;\n       Whereas prescription medications such as pain relievers, \n     tranquilizers, stimulants, and sedatives are second only to \n     marijuana as the most abused drug in the United States;\n       Whereas recent studies indicate that 2,500,000 children \n     between 12 and 17 years of age, or 1 out of every 10 \n     children, have intentionally abused cough medicine to get \n     high from the ingredient dextromethorphan;\n       Whereas 4,700,000 young adults, or 1 out of every 5 young \n     men and women, have used prescription medicines for non-\n     medical purposes;\n       Whereas in 2008, the National Institute on Drug Abuse \n     estimated that the rates for intentional abuse of cough \n     medicine among eighth, tenth, and twelfth graders stood at \n     3.6 percent, 5.3 percent, and 5.5 percent, respectively;\n       Whereas according to research from the Partnership for a \n     Drug-Free America, more than \\1/3\\rd of teenagers mistakenly \n     believe that taking prescription drugs, even if not \n     prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using street \n     drugs;\n       Whereas the lack of understanding by teenagers and parents \n     of the potential harms of these powerful medicines makes it \n     more critical than ever to raise public awareness about the \n     dangers of their abuse;\n       Whereas when prescription drugs are abused, they are most \n     often obtained through friends and relatives, but can also be \n     obtained through rogue internet pharmacies;\n       Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives \n     teenagers access to websites that promote abuse of medicines;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month promotes \n     the message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines \n     should be taken only as labeled or prescribed, and that \n     taking over-the-counter and prescription medicines for \n     recreational use or in large doses can have serious and life-\n     threatening consequences;\n       Whereas National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month will \n     encourage parents to educate themselves about this problem \n     and talk to their children about all types of substance \n     abuse;\n       Whereas observance of National Medicine Abuse Awareness \n     Month should be encouraged at the national, State, and local \n     levels to increase awareness of the rising abuse of \n     medicines;\n       Whereas educational toolkits and training methods have been \n     developed on how to best engage and educate parents and \n     grandparents, teachers, law enforcement officials, doctors \n     and health care professionals, and retailers about the \n     potential harms of cough medicine abuse; and\n       Whereas educating the public on the dangers of medicine \n     abuse and promoting prevention is a critical component of \n     what must be a multi-pronged effort to curb the disturbing \n     rise in medicine abuse: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2009 as ``National Medicine Abuse \n     Awareness Month''; and\n       (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and \n     activities to educate parents and youth of the potential \n     dangers associated with medicine abuse.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit a resolution \ndesignating the month of October, 2009 as the National Medicine Abuse \nAwareness Month. The abuse of prescription drugs and cold medicine is \ncurrently the fastest growing drug abuse trend in the country. \nAccording to the most recent National Survey of Drug Use and Health, \nNSDUH, nearly 7 million people have admitted to using controlled \nsubstances without a doctor's prescription. People between the ages of \n12 and 25 are the most common group to abuse these drugs. However, more \nand more people are dying because of this abuse. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention report that the unintentional deaths \ninvolving prescription narcotics increased 117 percent from the years \n2001 to 2005.\n  Abuse of over-the-counter, OTC, cough and cold medicines is also \nalarming. While these common cold medicines are safe and effective if \nused properly, the abuse of these medicines can also be destructive. \nAccording to a study conducted by the Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica, nearly one in ten young people between the ages of 12 and 17 \nhave intentionally abused cough medicine to get high off its main \ningredient Dextromethorphan. These are statistics that can no longer be \nignored.\n  Millions of Americans use these medicines every year to treat a \nvariety of symptoms due to injury, depression, insomnia, and the \neffects of the common cold. Many legitimate users of these drugs often \ndo not use as much medication as the prescription contains. As a \nresult, these drugs remain in the family medicine cabinet for months or \nyears because people forget about them or do not know how to properly \ndispose of them. However, many of these drugs, when not properly used \nor administered, are just as addictive and deadly as street drugs like \nmethamphetamine or cocaine.\n  According to the NSDUH, more than half of the people who abuse these \ndrugs reported that they obtained OTC and prescription drugs from a \nfriend or relative or from the family medicine cabinet. As a result, \ngroups like the Community Anti-Drug Coalitions of America, the Consumer \nHealthcare Products Association, and the Partnership for a Drug-Free \nAmerica have been reaching out to communities\n\n[[Page S9331]]\n\nthroughout the nation to raise awareness of this growing drug abuse \ntrend and encourage communities to tackle the problem head on. Many \ncommunity anti-drug coalitions, public health officials, and law \nenforcement officials have been holding town halls, organizing \ncommunity ``clean out your medicine cabinet'' events, and holding many \nother events to raise awareness of this growing abuse in an effort to \nreverse this trend.\n  We can stop the growing trend of medicine abuse in its tracks, but it \nwill require all sectors of the community to join together to make it \nhappen. The National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month Resolution promotes \nthe message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines must be \ntaken as directed, and when used recreationally or in large doses they \ncan have serious and deadly consequences.
