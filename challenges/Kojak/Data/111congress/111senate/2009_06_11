JOHNS\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, yesterday, this city and our country \nexperienced a terrible and horrifying tragedy. A man by the name of \nStephen Johns went to work every day for the last 6 years at one of our \nNation's most moving museums--a living memorial to one of our world's \nmost horrific atrocities--the Holocaust Memorial Museum.\n  While standing guard yesterday at that U.S. Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum, Mr. Stephen Johns was killed while protecting thousands of \nothers who were inside the building from the same fate that he \nsuffered. His death has shocked, upset, and angered the Senate, our \nNation, and all who detest such senseless bloodshed.\n  Mr. Johns was murdered in a place built to memorialize humanity's \nmost unspeakable murders. He was a victim of violence and hatred in a \nplace dedicated to teaching us the evils of violence and hatred. He was \na target of intolerance in a place created for reflection on the \nconsequences of intolerance. His death reminds us that we have much \nmore work to do.\n\n[[Page S6482]]\n\n  Stephen Johns was just 39 years old. He had a wife and a son. He grew \nup in Temple Hills, MD, just a few miles south and east of where I \nstand today. He still lived in that community. Mr. Johns started \nworking at the Holocaust Museum after spending a year in New Orleans in \nthe aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.\n  Those who knew Mr. Johns called him ``Big John'' and ``a gentle \ngiant.'' Those who knew him describe him as caring, polite, friendly, \nand helpful. Even those who didn't know him are deeply saddened by his \nloss and inspired by his heroism.\n  In the spirit of the museum where every day he so bravely reported \nfor duty, it is our duty to keep alive his memory. Today, the Holocaust \nMuseum is closed. Its flags fly at half staff. When it opens tomorrow, \nit will continue to serve as one of our Nation's most poignant \nreminders of the inexcusable racism, hatred, violence, and cruelty that \nwe must never stop trying to erase from our world. When it opens \ntomorrow, and every day thereafter, Stephen Johns' courage and courtesy \nwill be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6482-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, our plan to fix America's broken health \ncare system is based on a simple premise: when it comes to keeping \nourselves and our loved ones healthy, people--not corporations--should \nbe in the driver's seat.\n  We have a plan to right that wrong. That plan is guided by three \ngoals: One, lower the high costs of health care; two, ensure every \nAmerican has access to that quality, affordable care; three, let people \nchoose their own doctors, hospitals, and health plans.\n  One of those choices should be a public option. This has two primary \nbenefits: First, people can choose to get their insurance from someone \nother than a greedy private insurance company; second, the very \nexistence of that public option means there is more competition in the \nmarket. As a result, the private options will have to serve their \ncustomers even better.\n  The Republicans often like to pretend the government will force you \nto take the public option. Every time you hear them say that, you know \nthey are not interested in honest debate. After all, it is right in the \nname; it is a public ``option.'' So talking about government forcing \nanybody to do anything is simply unfair and not accurate. It is a \npublic option, meaning you have choices.\n  If you have coverage, and you like it, you can keep it. You should be \nable to choose the best coverage for your family. You should be able to \ncompare benefits and prices instead of surrendering to out-of-control \ncorporations. You, the individual, should be in control of your own \nfamily's health decisions.\n  I am confident that both private insurance companies and the option \nof a public plan can live in harmony. When you send a birthday present \nto a relative--say, I want to send something to one of my children in \nNevada--the products that I choose can be sent by FedEx, UPS, DHL, or \nyou can choose the U.S. Postal Service. The Postal Service may not be \nperfect, but because that public option is there, the private \ncompanies--FedEx, UPS, and DHL--know they cannot overcharge, rip you \noff, or slack in their service.\n  Just like our proposal for the health care system, you don't have to \nchoose the Postal Service. But it is good to know it is there. For \nsome, it is all they can afford. I hear every day from Nevadans who are \nasking for our help. They are people turned down for health coverage by \ninsurance providers who care more about profits than people; people who \nlost their health coverage when they lost their jobs and now have no \nmeans of getting it back; people who play by the rules and rightly \ndemand our health care system be guided by common sense.\n  Nearly two-thirds of all bankruptcies are caused by medical problems \nand the exorbitant bills that ensue. Many of the foreclosures are both \na cause and an effect for the global credit crisis and can be traced \nback to health insurance costs.\n  If you agree we already have enough economic problems on our hands, \nif you agree we cannot wait another year while 50 million Americans \nlive without any options to stay healthy, then you will agree now is \nthe time for action, not partisan games.\n  Insurance companies are holding Americans' health hostage. Far too \nmany people cannot afford the ransom. If we are going to fix our broken \nhealth care system, we are going to have to return control to the \npeople who need that care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6482-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the American people are frustrated \nwith the U.S. health care system. But they are also increasingly \nconcerned about some of the proposals coming from Washington. Now the \nalarms are beginning to sound. As reported in today's New York Times, \nthe Nation's doctors are strongly opposed to the so-called government \nplan that appears to be gaining steam in Washington. The American \nMedical Association says the government plan threatens to restrict \npatient choice by putting out of business existing health plans that \ncover nearly 70 percent of Americans.\n  One estimate suggests that 119 million Americans could lose the \nprivate coverage they have as a consequence of the government plan. \nMoreover, the AMA, in its statement from yesterday, notes that ``the \ncorresponding surge in public plan participation would likely lead to \nan explosion of costs that would need to be absorbed by taxpayers.''\n  Republicans and Democrats alike agree that health care reform is \nneeded in this country. But a government plan is not the kind of reform \nthe American people want. They want real reform for a system that's in \nserious need of it. Unfortunately, what some in Washington are \nproposing instead is the illusion of a reform that will replace what is \ngood about health care in America with something that is far worse.\n  Instead of making health care more affordable and accessible, these \nproposals could make treatments and procedures that everyday Americans \ncurrently take for granted less accessible or even impossible to \nobtain--even as these proposals would add to the colossal and \nunsustainable debt that already burdens the Federal Government.\n  I have spoken repeatedly on the Senate floor about the dangers of a \ngovernment-run health plan. By drawing on the experience of countries \nthat have already adopted these government-run system I have pointed \nout the serious problems government-run health care creates for \nmillions around the world. I have noted that a common defect of these \ngovernment-run plans is that they deny, delay, and ration health care. \nAnd I have noted that the primary culprit in almost every case is the \nso-called government board that these countries have established to \ndecide which treatments and medicines patients in these countries can \nand cannot have. This morning I would like to focus again on these so-\ncalled government boards, so people have an idea of what they could \nexpect from a government-run plan here in the U.S.\n  Britain's government board, the National Institute for Health and \nClinical Excellence, or NICE, is responsible for setting guidelines on \nthe use of drugs and treatments for patients in that country. The \ngovernment bureaucrats at this agency are supposed to weigh the \neffectiveness of a medicine or a treatment against its cost to the \ngovernment. If the government thinks that a drug is too expensive, it \ncan refuse to make it available to patients, regardless of any \npotential benefits.\n  Last summer, the board in Great Britain denied patients in that \ncountry access to four kidney cancer drugs that have the potential to \nextend life. Here's the chilling explanation it gave to justify the \nmove.\n\n       Although these treatments are clinically effective, \n     regrettably the cost . . . is such that they are not a cost-\n     effective use of . . . resources.\n\n  After a public outcry, NICE reversed its position on one of the drugs \nbut affirmed its ban on the other three.\n  In New Zealand, a government board known as Pharmac reviews potential \ndrugs and treatments and decides whether they should be prescribed to\n\n[[Page S6483]]\n\npatients in that country. Pharmac says its goal is to use its \n``expertise'' to ``help . . . decide which new hospital medicines are \ncost-effective.'' And like the government board in Great Britain, if \nPharmac does not think a drug's cost justifies its benefits, it can \nrefuse to make it available to patients or doctors who want it.\n  One drug that Pharmac did not think was worth the cost was Herceptin, \nwhich had proven to be effective in fighting breast cancer. Although \nPharmac began covering the drug for advanced breast cancer in 2002, it \nrefused to fund the drug for early stage breast cancer. After a public \noutcry and a reevaluation of the decision, Pharmac finally relented and \ndecided to allow the drug for early stage breast cancer in 2007, but \nonly for a limited amount of treatments.\n  These kinds of decisions about which drugs should or should not be \ncovered are based on a method commonly known as ``comparative \neffectiveness.'' Comparative effectiveness is not alien to the U.S. \nhealth care system. Indeed, the stimulus bill Congress passed earlier \nthis year included significant funding to lay the groundwork for just \nthis kind of research in the United States. In my view, the more \nresearch we do on the effectiveness of drugs and treatments the better. \nDoctors should have as much good information as possible in dealing \nwith their patients.\n  What Americans strenuously oppose, however, is the government using \nthis information to deny access to treatment or procedures that \npatients and doctors choose to pursue--just as government agencies such \nas NICE and Pharmac do in Great Britain and New Zealand. Americans \noppose this kind of government-mandated limitation on health care. They \nsimply will not allow it.\n  That is why my friend, Senator Kyl, will propose a bill that will \nprohibit the government from ever using comparative effectiveness in \nthis way. It is a wise bill, and it should be included as a part of any \nhealth reform we consider. Americans want their doctors to have \nclinical information on which treatments work best and which ones do \nnot. But government bureaucrats should not be able to use that \ninformation to determine what treatments Americans can or cannot get. \nThat is a decision we currently leave between a patient and his or her \ndoctor, and that is where it should remain.\n  Americans want to see changes in the health care system, but they \ndon't want changes that deny, delay, or ration care. They want reforms \nthat control costs, even as they protect patients. They want us to \ndiscourage frivolous medical liability lawsuits that limit access to \ncare in places such as rural Kentucky. They want prevention and \nwellness programs that cut costs by helping people quit smoking, \novercome obesity, and diagnose illnesses early. And they want us to \naddress the needs of small businesses without imposing new mandates or \ntaxes that kill jobs.\n  All of us want reform, but the government-run plan some are proposing \nin the United States is not the kind of change Americans are looking \nfor. We should learn the lessons from problems we have seen in \ncountries such as Great Britain and New Zealand. We should learn a \nlesson from the nightmares so many people in these countries and their \nfamilies have endured as a result of government-run health care and the \nbureaucratic government boards that almost always come with it.\n  Madam President, I am about to yield the floor, but before I do that, \nI see my friend from Arizona is on the floor. I want to express to him \nmy gratitude for his leadership on this very important issue. The most \nimportant issue we will be dealing with this year is the question of \nwhether the government should literally take over and run 16 percent of \nour economy. We have seen the government take over banks, insurance \ncompanies, and automobile companies. Now it appears as if there is an \neffort underway to take over health care as well.\n  I thank my friend from Arizona for the contribution he has made on \nthis important issue in the past and say we are looking forward to \nworking together on this in the future.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6483-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to discuss two issues this \nmorning, health care reform and also the pending supplemental spending \nbill that, according to news reports, does not include the Senate \nlanguage that explicitly allowed President Obama to keep photos of \ndetainee abuse during the Bush administration confidential.\n  I thank my friend from Kentucky, the Republican leader, who has shown \nsuch impressive leadership on, as he describes, probably the most \nimportant domestic issue that certainly will be addressed by this \nCongress. I look forward to working with my colleagues over the next \nfew weeks on legislation reforming our current health care system.\n  Americans are looking to Congress to enact health care legislation \nthat provides all Americans affordable access to health insurance and \nthe ability to choose the health insurance policy that fits each \nAmerican's needs. Yesterday, it was reported that 62 percent of \nAmericans support Congress enacting a major overhaul of the U.S. health \ncare system, according to a Diageo/Hotline poll.\n  I believe health care should be available to all and not limited to \nwhere you work or how much money you make. I believe any proposal must \nuse competition to improve the quality, availability, and affordability \nof health insurance and match people's needs, lower prices, and promote \nportability. I believe American families, not Washington bureaucrats or \ninsurance companies, should be in charge of any health care decision. \nBut I don't believe we need to expand government's bureaucracy to \ncontrol one-sixth of our economy to ensure the uninsured get health \ncoverage. Nor do I believe Americans should be asked to pay more in \ntaxes to cover the costs of any comprehensive health care reform \nlegislation.\n  Last month, the Wall Street Journal stated:\n\n       But now Democrats need the money to finance $1.2 trillion \n     or more for their new health insurance entitlement. . . .\n       A sampler:\n       End or limit the tax-exempt status of charitable hospitals. \n     . . .\n       Make college students in work-study programs subject to the \n     payroll tax. Also targeted are medical residents, perhaps on \n     the principle that they'll one day be ``rich doctors.''\n\n  I agree that any real health care reform proposal must address the \ntax treatment of employer-provided health benefits, but not in such a \nway that would force Americans to fork over more of their hard-earned \nmoney to the Federal Government, particularly during these difficult \ntimes.\n  Today individuals who receive health insurance through their employer \nare not taxed on their health care benefits, as we know. However, those \nwho purchase coverage on their own do not receive such a tax break. \nThat is unfair and regressive. It hits those who need this tax break \nthe most--the self-employed or working poor whose employer does not \noffer health insurance coverage.\n  To offset the taxable treatment of this income, I believe Americans \nshould have funds returned to them to assist with the cost of acquiring \nhealth insurance. An approach such as this treats individuals equally, \nin stark contrast to the system we currently have.\n  Key to any proposal is a policy that allows people to have \naccessible, portable, and affordable health insurance coverage. \nPolicies should also address what I hear from Americans everywhere I \ngo--choice. Americans want\n\n[[Page S6484]]\n\nchoice. They want choice of their doctor, their care, their coverage, \nand employment freedom--freedom to seek employment that is not \ndependent on whether an employer provides insurance coverage. This is \nparticularly important in today's difficult economic times when \nAmericans are uncertain about whether they will have a job tomorrow. \nSome, including the President, criticize this approach. However, the \nNew York Times reported:\n\n       The Obama administration is signaling to Congress that the \n     President would support taxing some employee health benefits.\n\n  While I appreciate the President's and the Democrats' new \nconsideration of such a proposal, it is not acceptable to turn this \ninto a tax-and-spend health care reform. Any new resources derived from \nchanging the existing tax treatment of private health insurance should \nbe devoted to a fairer and more efficient mechanism for Americans to \nacquire private insurance.\n  The United States spends over $2.4 trillion on health care. Health \ninsurance premiums continue to rise as employer-based family coverage \nincreased and Medicare and Medicaid spent $818 billion in 2008 and is \nprojected to reach $1.7 trillion by 2018.\n  I also want to mention something that should trouble every American \nand every Member of this Chamber.\n  Last week, I spoke about what the special interests were doing to \nderail much needed health reform dealing with prescription drugs, a \nreform that is very bipartisan. Any Member in this Chamber knows I work \nacross the aisle on policies that are important to the American people. \nHealth reform is one issue that fundamentally must be bipartisan.\n  All Americans are affected by what we do here, so we should be \nworking in a bipartisan manner. It is with extreme regret that I read \nin ``Roll Call'' this morning about a meeting that Democratic staff was \nthreatening--let me repeat--threatening Democratic lobbyists or the \norganizations they represent against meeting with Republicans and that \nattending meetings with Republicans ``will be viewed as a hostile \nact.''\n  This is outrageous. I hope the article is inaccurate. I hope the \nstaff on the other side does not view health reform as a process they \ncontrol by threats and hostilities. I hope we are above that.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the ``Roll Call'' article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From the Roll Call, June 11, 2009]\n\n                       Baucus Aides Warn K Street\n\n           (By David M. Drucker, Anna Palmer and Kate Ackley)\n\n       Top aides to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus (D-Mont.) \n     called a last minute, pre-emptive strike on Wednesday with a \n     group of prominent Democratic lobbyists, warning them to \n     advise their clients not to attend a meeting with Senate \n     Republicans set for Thursday.\n       Russell Sullivan, the top staffer on Finance, and Jon \n     Selib, Baucus' chief of staff, met with a bloc of more than \n     20 contract lobbyists, including several former Baucus aides.\n       ``They said, `Republicans are having this meeting and you \n     need to let all of your clients know if they have someone \n     there, that will be viewed as a hostile act,' '' said a \n     Democratic lobbyists who attended the meeting.\n       ``Going to the Republican meeting will say `I'm interested \n     in working with Republicans to stop health care reform,' '' \n     the lobbyists added.\n       Republican leaders have been meeting with health care \n     stakeholders for months, with those sessions occurring ``more \n     frequently than once a month,'' according to a senior Senate \n     GOP aide.\n       The stated purpose of Thursday's meeting, organized by Sen. \n     John Thune (R-S.D.), is to discuss proposals for how to pay \n     for health care reform.\n       But the underlying motivation for the get-together is to \n     encourage health care lobbyists and stakeholders concerned \n     about the Democrats' health care reform plans to speak out \n     publicly.\n       ``They need to speak up,'' one Senate Republican leadership \n     aide said. ``They need to help us help them.''\n       Thune said Democrats are using threats and intimidation to \n     keep unhappy stakeholders silent.\n       ``If you don't engage on this thing, this train's leaving \n     the station,'' Thune said. ``If you want [Republicans] to \n     have more influence, you've got to engage.''\n       One longtime health care lobbyist agreed that the GOP \n     frustration is spilling out of the Capitol and onto K Street.\n       ``It is notable that Republicans are really finding their \n     voice, and their level of frustration is building with the \n     stakeholders' inability or refusal to speak out,'' this \n     lobbyist said. ``They're getting frustrated. Republicans are \n     doing it themselves.''\n       One senior Democratic source charged that Thune's meeting \n     and the supposed motives behind it are in fact a smoke screen \n     for killing health care reform altogether.\n       ``While Democrats and many Republicans are working \n     collaboratively to reform health care, a small group of \n     Republicans appear all too eager to derail this promising, \n     bipartisan effort,'' this source said. ``It's politics as \n     usual, it's disheartening and it's a shame.''\n       Senate Republicans are opposed to plans by President Barack \n     Obama and Congressional Democrats to implement a government-\n     run, public plan option as a part of health care reform. They \n     also are concerned with how Democrats plan to pay for reform.\n       Recognizing they don't have the votes to stop legislation \n     on their own, Republicans are pushing their natural allies in \n     the business community to help bring public pressure to bear \n     as another way to influence the outcome.\n       Obama has set Oct. 15 as the deadline for approval of \n     health care reform, and Democratic leaders in Congress are \n     rushing to clear bills from their respective chambers by the \n     end of July.\n       ``Our effort has been to get these folks to speak their \n     mind,'' one senior Senate Republican aide said.\n       After months of holding their tongues while inclusive, \n     bipartisan negotiations continued in the Senate Finance and \n     Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committees, the \n     business community has now considered speaking out, given \n     their displeasure with the HELP panel's reform bill, which \n     was made public on Tuesday.\n       But with Baucus' office still warning dissenters that \n     anyone who makes their opposition public could be permanently \n     excluded from future negotiations, the groups representing \n     businesses, health care providers, hospitals and similar \n     stakeholders are still wavering on whether to voice their \n     concerns publicly.\n       The lineup of lobbyists who attended the Wednesday session \n     included a cast of Democratic insiders similar to that at \n     previous meetings convened by Baucus' staff. The participants \n     included: Jeff Forbes, a former Baucus chief of staff who \n     lobbies at Cauthen Forbes & Williams; Jonathon Jones, a \n     partner with Peck, Madigan, Jones & Stewart; Tarplin \n     Strategies' Rich Tarplin, an assistant secretary at Health \n     and Human Services in the Clinton administration; another \n     former Baucus top aide, David Castagnetti, of Mehlman Vogel \n     Castagnetti and OB-C Group founder Larry O'Brien.\n       Democratic sources noted Wednesday that Baucus is courting \n     Republican support and remains committed to treating all \n     stakeholders fairly.\n       On Wednesday, he met with Senate Minority Leader Mitch \n     McConnell (R-Ky.) in the Capitol, part of a marathon day of \n     bipartisan meetings that included a session with his GOP \n     colleagues at the White House and discussions with Republican \n     members of the Finance Committee.\n       ``Chairman Baucus wants to continue to keep health care \n     stakeholders informed of the progress on health reform,'' \n     said the Senator's Finance Committee spokesman, Scott \n     Mulhauser. ``This is a lengthy, transformative process, and \n     meetings like these are an essential part of the ongoing, \n     bipartisan effort to continue to keep everyone at the table \n     working together.''\n       One lobbyist who attended the Wednesday meeting with \n     Baucus' staff said that the message was more bipartisan. \n     ``They said they anticipate having a bipartisan bill and that \n     the process is going well with Republicans,'' this lobbyist \n     said. But, the lobbyist added, Baucus' team did warn, ``If \n     your clients attack the process or the product, it's going to \n     be hard to work with you.''\n       As for Baucus, he told reporters earlier this week that he \n     was not aware of health care stakeholders being threatened by \n     his staff to play ball with the Finance Committee-led \n     negotiations or risk being blackballed from the process.\n       ``I'm sure they can all say what they want to say,'' Baucus \n     said, referring to GOP accusations that health care lobbyists \n     have been subject to intimidations and threats. ``It's news \n     to me. I don't think so. I don't know of any.''\n       Republican lobbyists said they have not felt any threats \n     from their party.\n       ``For a while, Republicans have cautioned industry to be \n     careful about getting in bed with the administration or \n     Kennedy or Baucus too early,'' said Janet Grissom, a lobbyist \n     at Peck, Madigan, Jones & Stewart, who was once a top aide to \n     McConnell.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN.

Madam President, it appears the House Democrats, \naccording to a ``Roll Call'' article this morning about the \nsupplemental bill--I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this morning's ``Roll Call'' article titled ``Intraparty Fights \nPervade Agenda'' concerning the war supplemental bill.\n\n[[Page S6485]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       [Roll Call, June 11, 2009]\n\n                    Intraparty Fights Pervade Agenda\n\n        (By Steven T. Dennis and Emily Pierce, Roll Call Staff)\n\n       Democratic leaders appeared to clear the way Wednesday for \n     passage of a $100 billion war supplemental, even as they \n     worked furiously to repair internal rifts over health care \n     and climate change legislation.\n       The war bill, which has swollen with items including a \n     cash-for-clunkers incentive, will eliminate Senate language \n     explicitly allowing President Barack Obama to keep photos of \n     detainee abuse during the Bush administration confidential.\n       That language was included by the Senate and is backed by \n     Obama and Republicans, but it has been a deal-breaker for \n     House liberals like Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank \n     (Mass.).\n       Frank and other Democrats who opposed the war bill \n     originally, have committed to voting for it in order to help \n     carry a $108 billion package of loans to the International \n     Monetary Fund, an Obama priority.\n       Assuming no Republican support, Democratic leaders need 18 \n     of 51 anti-war Democrats to back the bill, a number that they \n     appear likely to reach despite the continued opposition from \n     leaders of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n       House Republican leaders had derided the IMF money as a \n     ``global bailout'' and vowed to whip hard to defeat the \n     supplemental with it included.\n       And even moderate House Republicans from auto industry \n     states appeared unlikely to be won over by the inclusion of a \n     cash-for-clunkers provision aimed at jump-starting the auto \n     industry.\n       ``That's going to have no bearing on people's votes on the \n     bill,'' Rep. Fred Upton (R-Mich.) said. ``They're not going \n     to get hardly any Republican votes.''\n       The outcome of any Senate vote on the supplemental \n     conference report remains uncertain, given that Sens. Joe \n     Lieberman (ID-Conn.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) threatened \n     to not only filibuster the bill, but also block other Senate \n     business if the supplemental did not include their language \n     barring disclosure of the detainee abuse photos.\n       One senior Senate Democratic aide said Lieberman and \n     Graham's threat to hold up the supplemental indefinitely was \n     unlikely to last and predicted that Defense Secretary Robert \n     Gates would likely pressure the two defense hawks to \n     relent so that funding for the wars wouldn't run out.\n       The trickier problem is what delay tactics Graham and \n     Lieberman might use to stymie Senate action on other bills. \n     The senior Senate Democratic aide acknowledged that Senate \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) and Speaker Nancy Pelosi \n     (D-Calif.) might have to come up with a plan for passing the \n     language on some other bill that would be able to pass the \n     House, but this aide noted that Obama has the strongest hand \n     in getting Graham and Lieberman to stand down.\n       Senate Democratic aides said the language to close the \n     prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, was designed to satisfy the \n     Obama administration's need to transport terrorists for \n     trial, as well as to ease, for the most part, Democrats' fear \n     of political repercussions from having detainees permanently \n     housed in the United States.\n       The language would allow terrorists to be in the U.S. for \n     trial only, which the senior Senate Democratic aide said \n     would ``give Obama some flexibility while also mollifying \n     those that have NIMBY problems.''\n       But the supplemental has been largely a sideshow to the big \n     push behind the scenes on health care, especially from the \n     White House.\n       One House Democratic aide to a liberal lawmaker said left-\n     leaning Members have been much more focused on health care \n     reform and are generally happy with the direction \n     negotiations on the issue are going.\n       ``The debate is no longer whether there will be a public \n     plan; it's over what the public plan will look like,'' the \n     aide said.\n       Democratic House chairmen have dismissed a call from \n     conservative Blue Dogs for a ``trigger'' option that would \n     delay a government-sponsored health care plan, but there are \n     still numerous fights going on behind the scenes--including \n     on the makeup of the plan and how to pay for it.\n       Some Members fear that a Medicare-style plan that forces \n     doctors to participate will provoke a revolt; others worry \n     that a public plan may ultimately swallow up the entire \n     marketplace.\n       But parochial concerns are also proving paramount, with \n     individual lawmakers demanding answers on how it will affect \n     their own districts. Rep. Dennis Cardoza (D-Calif.), a \n     leading Blue Dog, said his district is plagued by a lack of \n     doctors in part because of low reimbursement rates under \n     government health programs.\n       ``If that's not addressed, I'm not voting for the bill,'' \n     he said. ``We have huge amounts of details to put on the \n     bones.''\n       But health care isn't the only issue sparking Democratic \n     intraparty battles.\n       The cap-and-trade bill limiting carbon emissions, largely \n     negotiated behind closed doors in the House, has rural \n     Democrats balking.\n       House Agriculture Chairman Collin Peterson (D-Minn.) said \n     Wednesday that Democrats have reached an impasse on the \n     climate change bill. He cast doubts that his committee would \n     pass the bill by next week.\n       ``I think it's very doubtful that we can get anything done \n     by then,'' Peterson said.\n       Pelosi set a June 19 deadline for committee action on the \n     bill, although she left open the possibility of an extension.\n       Peterson previously estimated that 45 Democrats would side \n     with him in opposing the climate change measure if an \n     agreement wasn't reached. On Wednesday, he said that number \n     has likely grown.\n       ``The more people look at this, the more problems they've \n     got. My list has grown since I've been looking at it,'' \n     Peterson said.\n       For his part, Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry Waxman (D-\n     Calif.) said that there are ``very constructive'' discussions \n     taking place and that he still wants the bill on the floor \n     before the July Fourth recess.\n       House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) said he expected \n     to bring the war bill to the floor next week. The conference \n     committee was scheduled to meet at 3 p.m. today.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I quote from it:\n\n       The war bill, which has swollen with items including a \n     cash-for-clunkers incentive, will eliminate Senate language \n     explicitly allowing President Barack Obama to keep photos of \n     detainee abuse during the Bush administration confidential.\n\n  The Graham-Lieberman amendment that would classify these photos was \naccepted by voice vote. In other words, any Senator who wanted to \nobject or vote against it could have called for a vote. Instead, it was \nunanimously adopted.\n  According to the ``Roll Call'' article I quoted, that provision will \nbe removed from the emergency supplemental. According to that article:\n\n       One senior Democratic aide said Lieberman's and Graham's \n     threat to hold up the supplemental indefinitely [unless their \n     provision was included] was unlikely to last and predicted \n     that Defense Secretary Robert Gates would likely pressure the \n     two defense hawks to relent so that funding for the wars \n     wouldn't run out.\n\n  I think this Democratic aide highly underestimates Senator Lieberman, \nSenator Graham, and the rest of us.\n  I had a conversation with General Petraeus the day before yesterday. \nI believe those conversations are confidential, and I asked his \nagreement to quote from him: If these photos are released, it would \nharm the ability of the United States military to pursue our national \nsecurity interests and could put American lives in danger. That is a \nserious statement from the most respected military leader this Nation \nhas.\n  I want to point out something very important. Today the President of \nthe United States could issue an Executive order classifying those \nphotos and not allowing them to be released. He could do it today. It \nis time for the President of the United States to stand up to the \nleftwing of his party for the good of the national security of this \nNation.\n  I join others, that if that supplemental comes over without the \nprovision which was adopted unanimously by the Senate to make sure \nthose photos are not released because of the harm it would do to \nAmerica's effort in combating radical Islamic extremism throughout the \nworld and put the lives of the men and women who are serving in our \nmilitary in greater danger--I intend to join my friends Senator \nLieberman and Senator Graham in doing everything we can to oppose such \nlegislation.\n  This war supplemental is intended to help us win this battle, the war \non terrorism, dare I say. It is supposed to help the men and women who \nare serving in Iraq and Afghanistan as they pursue an implacable and \nevil enemy and try to instill democracy and freedom in these \ncountries. And if these photos are made public, it will harm their \neffort and put their lives in danger.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing a bill that would \neliminate the provision that prevents these photos from being \npublished, and I call on the President today to relieve this pressure \nand declare, by Executive order, that these photos are classified and \nnot to be released to the world's public.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6486]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6486-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, the House of Representatives is \nprepared to pass the President's energy tax. It is also known as the \nAmerican Clean Energy and Security Act. The act, therefore, is known as \nACES--American Clean Energy and Security Act. ACES is the right thing \nto call this particular bill because it gambles--it gambles--with the \nfuture of the American people. In blackjack, the dealer might have an \nace that is showing, but one card in the dealer's hand is always \nhidden. In this case, the hidden card is the card that shows the real \ncost of this bill to the American taxpayer. What the taxpayer doesn't \nknow is that the game is rigged. The taxpayer is going to lose. No \nmatter how many times the majority adds to this hand another giveaway \nto special interests, another tax break to offset the monumental cost \nof this bill, the end will be just the same: The taxpayer goes bust and \nWashington will win the game.\n  ACES is the product of a supermajority that the Democrats have in the \nHouse of Representatives. Given the rules and given the procedures of \nthe House, reasonable amendments are going to be defeated or even \nblocked from ever being considered. The final product will not be a \nreal starting point to begin this debate on climate change.\n  ACES is going to have a devastating effect on our economy, and we \nwill see there will be no environmental benefit from doing this bill--\nnone. That is not just my belief or my assessment alone, it is also the \nbelief of others.\n  Martin Feldstein, noted Harvard economist, in a recent Washington \nPost article stated:\n\n       ACES will have a trivially small effect on global warming \n     while imposing substantial costs on all American households.\n\n  Let me repeat that: a trivially small effect, while imposing \nsubstantial costs. How big are the costs? Well, he cites the \nCongressional Budget Office, which estimated that the resulting \nincreases in consumer prices needed to achieve just a 15-percent \nreduction in carbon dioxide--slightly less than the target of this \nbill--would raise the cost of living $1,600 a year, every year, for \nevery family in America. That is a $1,600 tax on every American family \nevery year.\n  The Heritage Foundation predicts that the ACES approach could cost \nthe economy $9.6 trillion and more than 1 million lost jobs into the \nfuture. And these are just the raw numbers. The real potential for \neconomic pain goes much further.\n  David Sokol, chairman of MidAmerican Energy, points out that ACES--\nthis bill--could be a bonanza. And for whom will it be a bonanza? For \nmore Wall Street corruption and more Wall Street greed because ACES is \ngoing to deal in investment banks, it is going to deal in hedge funds \nand other speculators who want to speculate in the cap-and-trade \nmarket. David Sokol points out:\n\n       If you liked what credit default swaps did to our economy, \n     you're going to love cap and trade.\n\n  Coincidently, the House bill actually allows for credit default \nswaps.\n  He is not alone in his assessment. British scientist James Lovelock, \nwho is a noted chemist and environmentalist, stated in January that:\n\n       Carbon trading, with its huge government subsidies, is just \n     what the finance industry wanted. It'll make a lot of money \n     for a lot of people and postpone the moment of reckoning.\n\n  So he is saying it will make a lot of money for a lot of people in \nthe financial industry.\n  Carbon markets can also cause huge fluctuations. We can look to \nEurope as an example and what we saw happen there. In February of this \nyear, the Financial Times wrote an article entitled ``Fall in \nCO2 Price a Risk to Green Investment.'' It seems that the \nprice of carbon in the European Union had fallen so low that it no \nlonger provided an incentive to lower the use of carbon.\n  So those are things happening not just for this country but around \nthe world.\n  Another problem is the huge economic gamble ACES makes by bypassing \ncheaper, low-carbon fuels by heavily relying on unreliable expensive \nenergy. This ACES legislation mandates that by 2020 the electric \nutilities meet 20 percent of their electricity demand through renewable \nenergy sources and energy efficiency. This is the wrong approach. We \nneed an all-of-the-above energy strategy to address our Nation's energy \nneeds. We need to make America's energy as clean as we can, as fast as \nwe can, without raising energy prices for American families. That is \nhow you create and that is how you then sustain economic development. \nSo I would say, let's develop all of our energy sources--wind, solar, \ngeothermal, hydro, clean coal, nuclear, natural gas--all of the energy \nsources. Our Nation is so blessed with abundant energy resources. They \nare right here for us to use in a clean and environmentally friendly \nway. Coal is cheap and abundant in America. It is what is keeping our \nenergy affordable today. Uranium is abundant in America too. Let's \ndevelop this proven zero-carbon resource. And, yes, let's develop all \nof the renewable energies--the wind, the solar, the hydropower. We need \nit all.\n  Lisa Jackson, Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, \nrecently took a trip to Wyoming, and this is what she said while she \nwas in my home State of Wyoming:\n\n       As a home of wind, coal, and natural gas, Wyoming is at the \n     heart of America's energy future.\n\n  That is because Wyoming has it all. It has the coal, it has the wind, \nit has the natural resources of natural gas and oil and uranium for \nnuclear power. It has it all, and we need it all.\n  The bottom line is that the Democrats' cap-and-tax bill costs jobs \nand it raises energy prices. I don't understand why we can't make \nAmerica's energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising \nenergy prices on American families. The administration wants to take a \ndifferent approach. Why are the American people being given this \nstacked deck, where all of the options hurt the economy, raise energy \nprices, and cost jobs? The President says we need green jobs. I agree. \nWe also need red, white, and blue jobs--American energy, American \nenergy sources.\n  The reality is, this partisan energy tax bill passing in the House is \na bad bet for all of us. We shouldn't double down with any more \ntaxpayer money to bail out the climate through an energy tax.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS.

Madam President, I rise today to discuss an issue that \nis one of these ``believe it or not'' issues of waste and abuse \nconcerning billions of tax dollars and stimulus funding. I have some \ngood news and then I have some bad news to report.\n  First the good news. In the last 24 hours, we have been able to \nreverse a policy that would have used stimulus money to pave the same \nroad twice within a matter of months. I said yesterday that did not \npass the Kansas commonsense test or, for that matter, any State's \ncommonsense test, and would be a huge abuse of taxpayer dollars. We \nhave reversed this plan, this silly plan, in a bipartisan way.\n  I wish to personally thank Vice President Biden, the man charged with \noverseeing all of the stimulus spending, for taking action to correct \nthis abuse after I contacted him. I really thank the Vice President \nbecause the White House moved and the Vice President moved in an \nexpeditious fashion, and I, quite frankly, didn't expect they could \nmove that fast, but they got the job done.\n  The Vice President will be in Kansas today, and I asked him to review \nthis rather ridiculous example of wasteful spending occurring in \nCherokee County, KS, just a short 2-hour drive south on U.S. Highway 96 \nfrom where the Vice President will be. You see, a section of old \nHighway 96 would have been\n\n[[Page S6487]]\n\nresurfaced with stimulus funds. Then portions of an EPA Superfund site \nwould have been cleaned up with stimulus funds, and the heavy equipment \nused for the cleanup would have damaged the newly resurfaced highway, \nso they would have to go back in and do the highway again. Once this \ncleanup was complete, additional stimulus funds would have gone to \nrepair the road damage caused by the heavy trucks. Taxpayers would have \npaid almost $1 million to fix this road twice.\n  Fortunately, in working with the Vice President, we now have media \nreports that the Superfund cleanup will occur prior to any roadwork. \nThat is the good news. Again, I credit the Vice President and his staff \nand his team.\n  Now for the bad news. While this spending issue has been fixed, there \nis a much larger spending issue affecting dozens of Kansas families in \nCherokee County, KS, and that is still a major problem. I am going to \nurge the Vice President to again provide leadership. He is the self-\nproclaimed new sheriff in town. I am an honorary sheriff of Dodge City, \nKS, my hometown. So from one sheriff to another, I would simply say to \nthe Vice President: Sheriff, I will ride shotgun or you can ride \nshotgun. We have the problem only half solved.\n  You see, in April, EPA Region 7 issued a press release saying \nCherokee County would receive up to $25 million from the stimulus. \nAccording to the press release:\n\n       By starting or speeding up cleanup at Superfund sites, the \n     [stimulus] funding is also increasing the speed with which \n     these sites are returned to productive use. When a Superfund \n     site is redeveloped, it can offer significant economic \n     benefits to local communities, including future job creation.\n\n  Unfortunately, for fewer than 100 residents living in the city of \nTreece, the stimulus funding for this project is literally going down a \nsinking hole. The city of Treece, KS, sits on the Kansas-Oklahoma \nborder. This small, rural community was once a world leader in lead and \nzinc mining, mining that lasted for nearly 100 years. As the mining \ncompanies shut down in the 1970s, the groundwater began to rise and the \npillars that supported the soil above the mine shafts began to collapse \nand you had a giant sinkhole. Shortly thereafter--in 1983, to be \nexact--the EPA placed over 500 square miles in southeast Kansas, \nnortheast Oklahoma, and southwest Missouri on the National Priorities \nList of the Superfund list, including the city of Treece. In total, \nCherokee County, KS, where Treece is located, has 115 square miles in \nthe Superfund Program.\n  Last summer, during a listening tour of this part of Kansas, I saw \nfirsthand how 100 men and women and children are living in absolute \nblight. They live day by day not knowing when--and I mean when, not \nif--their homes will collapse into the earth below into a giant \nsinkhole. They remain there despite the loss of businesses and \ninfrastructure because their homes have no market value and they cannot \nsell them to fund a new home or even rent one.\n  As parts of Cherokee County have been on the Superfund list for the \nlast 26 years, the EPA has removed and replaced contaminated topsoil. \nAccording to their stimulus press release, the EPA will continue to \nremove lead-contaminated residential soil at more than 380 acres in \nBaxter Springs and Treece. That probably sounds like an admirable thing \nto do, but as the ground below it caves in, the exposed soil that has \nnot been cleaned up will rise, so essentially this is a never-ending \nprocess. You are cleaning up topsoil on a single home, and after the \nsinkhole sinks, obviously the topsoil is going to be contaminated with \nthe contaminated soil underneath the new topsoil. If you get all that, \nI think you got the problem. This is a never-ending process.\n  I have worked very long and hard with other members of the Kansas \ndelegation to determine how best to address this situation. The only \nsatisfactory answer anyone has been able to give me is to relocate the \ntown to protect the residents from a complete cave-in. The Federal \nGovernment needs to buy out the land from the remaining homes and \nbusiness owners and then prohibit any future construction on the \nproperty affected by the contamination. This is exactly what we did \nwith Pitcher, OK, on the other side of the State line, just a few years \nago. Most estimates indicate we could relocate the entire town with $3 \nmillion in Federal funding and $500,000 in State funding--funding the \nState of Kansas has already set aside. During the previous Congress, I \nintroduced legislation to address the Federal portion of this funding.\n  Fast forward to today, with an economy experiencing a lot of \nturbulence and a so-called stimulus bill that everyone in this body \nheard was an absolute necessity and not only a job maintainer but a job \ncreator. So I asked the EPA to use $3 million of already allocated \nstimulus funding to relocate the community--$3 million. I was told no.\n  Instead of solving this problem and relocating the families of Treece \nto a safe facility, the EPA, with the assistance of the stimulus \npackage, continues to spend even more money, $25 million--eight times \nthe amount needed to relocate the community, the 100 people who live in \nblight and fear that their homes will sink into a sinkhole--to put new \nsoil--this is what they are currently going to do--onto contaminated \nsoil, which is then going to collapse and recontaminate all the soil. \nThis doesn't make sense.\n  I have had an ongoing dialog with EPA, and they have told me:\n\n       The wastes are causing great environmental harm to \n     southeast Kansas--\n\n  We, of course, knew that--\n\n     as evidenced by the documented impacts to birds, fish, \n     mussels, macro-invertebrates, and horses. There is also \n     evidence of harm to humans as it is related to elevated blood \n     lead levels.\n\n  The letter went on to say:\n\n       EPA Region 7 believes the situation at the adjacent Region \n     6 Tar Creek Superfund site in Oklahoma materially differs \n     from the Cherokee County Superfund site, and that is what \n     drives different decisions for the Tar Creek Site.\n\n  I am going to refer to a couple of charts here.\n  This is a picture of Treece, KS, located right here. You can see all \nof these white objects here. Basically, that is the chat material that \nhas come out of many mines over 100 years.\n  Here is Treece, KS, and here is Pitcher, OK. Here is a giant chat \npile in between. I have been there. You see many little ponds and \nwinding roads, and I advise you not to go fishing in any of those \nponds. You might catch a three-eyed fish. At any rate, it is all \ncontaminated, all a sinkhole, whether it is from Treece, KS, in Region \n7 with the EPA or whether it is Pitcher, OK, in Region 6 in Dallas. I \ndon't know what the difference is. If this is contaminated, and it is, \nand this is contaminated and looks the same, and it is, what the heck \nis the difference?\n  Let me show another angle so you can appreciate what I am talking \nabout. This is what the people of Treece see every day as the Sun rises \nand sets. This is a giant chat mountain--all of this contaminated soil. \nThis side of the chat mountain is Treece, the other side is Oklahoma--\nthe same situation, same problem, same contaminated soil, same \nsinkhole, and the same thing on the other side, except EPA 7 in Kansas \nCity can't get it through their heads that this is identical to the \nsame problem over here.\n  Instead of spending $25 million to clean up and put topsoil on \ncontaminated soil that will sink, why can't we spend $3 million to save \nthe community of Treece and relocate these people? Basically, EPA \nRegion 7 does not have a factual basis, according to them, ``that would \nallow the use of regular or [stimulus] funds for a residential buy-out \nat the Treece subsite.'' Why? We were going to spend money for a road \nto be built twice. We are spending $25 million to put topsoil on a \nsinkhole. Why can't we put $3 million to relocate this town?\n  Here is my question. EPA acknowledged there is evidence of harm to \nhumans. They listed a whole series of other animals and wildlife, and \nso on and so forth, that they are worried about. I understand that. But \nwhy not provide assistance to relocate fewer than 100 people from \nharm's way?\n  Furthermore, EPA told me that ``a 10-year timeframe is estimated for \ncomplete waste remediation.'' Due to the continual mine collapses, I \nwonder if the environmental cleanup will ever be completed.\n  I think it is in the best interests of all taxpayers to quit throwing \nmoney down sinkholes and provide an opportunity for 100 folks who have \nno other\n\n[[Page S6488]]\n\noptions to move, as their homes are worth nothing. We do not need to \nspend, again, $25 million on a problem that will not be solved--topsoil \non top of the sinkhole. We need to take care of these people and spend \n$3 million to let them get on with their lives. While American \ntaxpayers are spending untold millions to prevent mortgage collapses, I \ncan see no better use for the stimulus plan than to get the residents \nof Treece into safe homes.\n  I said once before, I am an honorary sheriff of Dodge City. I have a \nbadge. You can go to Dodge City and you can meet the marshal, you can \nsee Miss Kitty. You can go down to the Long Branch. We are used to \ntaking care of problems ourselves. Kansas has appropriated $500,000 to \ndo this. All we are asking for is $3 million, not the $25 million that \nI don't think is going to ever really result in any long-term cleanup.\n  You have to be there to realize just how bad this is, the pools of \nwater and all. People will tell you: Senator, we are going to take you \naround this way. Don't walk this way.\n  So I would just ask Sheriff Joe, who is the self-declared sheriff on \nstimulus money, help me out here. Ride sidesaddle or you can drive the \nstage. Help me get $3 million. You have already stopped the ridiculous \nsituation of building the road twice after we had destroyed it with \nstimulus money. That is the good news. But the rest of the story is \nthat the citizens of Treece need to be relocated. We can do this for $3 \nmillion.\n  This remains an awful way to treat any community. I think it is not a \nwise use of taxpayer money. It does not pass the Kansas commonsense \nsmell test.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6488-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6488-S6489]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the urgent need \nfor health care reform. The people of Colorado, and the American \npeople, have waited for too long for Washington to act.\n  We should begin with a basic principle: if you have coverage and you \nlike it, you can keep it. We will not take that choice away from you.\n  But even as we keep what works, we must confront the challenges of \nsoaring health care costs and the lack of access to affordable, quality \nhealth care. The status quo is unacceptable. Every day, families in \nColorado and across America face rising premiums. Their plans offer \nfewer benefits. They are denied coverage because of preexisting \nconditions.\n  And until we fix the health care system, we will not be able to fix \nthe fiscal mess in which we find ourselves.\n  Since 1970, the share of health care as a part of the GDP has gone \nfrom 7 percent to 17 percent. The United States spends over $2 trillion \nin health care costs, including over $400 billion on Medicare. \nPresident Obama has said the biggest threat to our nation's balance \nsheet is the skyrocketing cost of health care. He is right.\n  In Colorado, we have not waited on Washington. We have made real \nprogress in showing how you can provide high quality health care at a \nlower cost. Last week, the New Yorker magazine published an article \ntitled ``The Cost Conundrum'' that highlights the important work that \nhas been done in Mesa County, CO. Over 30 years ago this community \nserving 120,000 people came together, doctors, nurses, and the \nnonprofit health insurance company. They agreed upon a system that paid \ndoctors and nurses for seeing patients and producing better quality \ncare. They realized that problems and costs go down when care is more \npatient-focused.\n  In Mesa County, the city of Grand Junction implemented an integrated \nhealth care system that provides follow-up care with patients. This \nfollow-up care has helped lower hospital readmissions rates in Grand \nJunction to just 3 percent. Compare that to the 20 percent rate \nnationwide, and it is clear that our rural community on the Western \nSlope of Colorado is onto something groundbreaking.\n  High readmission rates are a large problem for our seniors. Nearly \none in five Medicare patients who leave a hospital will be readmitted \nwithin the following month, and more than three-quarters of these \nreadmissions are preventable. Rehospitalization costs Medicare over $17 \nbillion annually.\n  It is painful for patients and families to be caught up in these \ncycles of treatment. All too often, care is fragmented; you go from the \ndoctor, to the hospital, to a nursing home, back to the hospital and \nthen back to the doctor again. Patients are given medication \ninstructions as they are leaving the hospital, many times after coming \noff of strong medications. They do not know whom to call, and they are \nnot sure what to ask their primary care doctor.\n  The solution, both our Denver and Mesa County health communities have \nfound, is to provide patients leaving the hospital with a ``coach.'' \nThis coach is a trained health professional connecting home and the \nhospital. This coach teaches patients how to manage their health on \ntheir own.\n  Our Denver health community created a model based on this idea called \nthe Care Transitions Intervention. Their work is the basis for the \nMedicare Care Transitions Act of 2009, a bill I introduced to implement \nthis model on the national level. This legislation recognizes that \npatient care should not begin in a doctor's office and end at the \nhospital doors. Investing in coaching and transitional care now can \nhead off huge costs down the road. It has the advantage of being both \npreventive and responsive.\n  Take 67-year-old Bill Schoens, from Littleton, CO, who recently \nsuffered a heart attack. Before he was released from the hospital, \nregistered nurse Becky Cline was assigned as his Transitions Coach. She \nmade sure that he understood the medications that his doctors \nprescribed and everything else he needed to do to get healthy. Bill \neven pointed out, ``When you are in the emergency room, you are all \ndrugged up and can barely remember what to do. Confusion starts to set \nin.''\n  Becky went through each step Bill needed to follow when he left the \nhospital. Becky evaluated Bill's ability to follow doctor's orders in \nhis environment and helped him maintain his own Personal Health Record. \nWith her help, when Bill visited the doctor, he did not have to \nremember everything that happened since he left the hospital; it was \nall in the book.\n  Bill said, ``When people are in front of their doctor, their blood \npressure goes sky high and they forget what they need to ask.'' He said \nhe found the help and guidance he received from his Transitions Coach \n``invaluable and life-saving.''\n  We need patient-centered coordinated care, care that views nurses, \ndoctors and family members not as isolated caregivers, but as partners \non a team whose ultimate goal is to make sure patients get the guidance \nand care they need. Hospitals are not the problem, primary care \nphysicians are not the problem, and nurses are not the problem. Our \nfragmented delivery system of care is the problem.\n  This bill also makes sure that we are teaching patients to manage \ntheir own conditions at home.\n  Sixty-nine-year-old Frank Yanni of Denver, CO, had surgery for a \nstaph infection of the spinal cord. After leaving the hospital, he \nnoticed that the pain he was experiencing weeks after surgery was \ngetting worse. Having been ``coached,'' he identified the problem and \nknew to insist on visiting his doctor immediately. A hospital test \nshowed that Mr. Yanni required a second surgery. His coach said that, \n``Had he let that go for even another week, he could have ended up in \nthe ICU, septic and horribly sick.''\n  Our Colorado transition of care model, reflected in our legislation, \ngives health care systems the choice of whether to create this program. \nBut it allows existing patient-centered transitional care programs like \nthe one in Mesa County, CO, to continue on.\n  We want communities and providers to think and work together to \nreduce readmission rates, reduce costs and provide better coordinated \ncare to our patients. Other systems should look at Colorado and the \nsystems in 24 States that have already begun to follow this model.\n  As we begin to emerge from the economic downturn, we must call upon \nexisting health care professionals from all walks of life--nurses, \nnurse practitioners, social workers, long-term care, and community \nhealth workers--to serve as transitional coaches.\n  Colorado nurses like Becky Cline have found that focusing on \ntransitional care has leveraged their skills,\n\n[[Page S6489]]\n\nempowering them to take a more active role with patients. They are able \nto work with both patients and family caregivers. For too long, family \ncaregivers have been ``silent partners.'' Some 50 million Americans \nprovide care for a chronically ill, disabled or aged loved one. This \nbill recognizes their importance, connecting them with a coach who can \nteach them how to properly coordinate at-home care.\n  This bill is only a small part of the solution to the complex \nchallenges of our fragmented health care system. The problems of rising \ncosts and limited access affect people from all walks of life.\n  Skip Guarini of Parker, CO, is a self-employed private consultant and \nretired U.S. Marine. After years of regular doctors' visits, Skip's \ndentist discovered a lump on his thyroid during a routine exam that had \ngone undetected by his physician despite 10 previous exams.\n  Skip underwent a CT/MRI scan, ultrasound, and biopsy, all of which \nwere inconclusive. A second series of tests 6 months later revealed \nthat the lump had grown, and Skip underwent surgery. During the \nsurgery, doctors found cancer. Skip was then sent to an endocrinologist \nwho ordered more tests. All tests came back negative. A second full \nbody scan revealed no sign of cancer anywhere in Skip's body.\n  All these exams and screenings cost Skip $122,000.\n  Since then, Skip has maintained perfect health, but he cannot obtain \nprivate insurance because of the thyroid surgery. He now relies on \nCOBRA and is paying a monthly premium of $1,300. This coverage is set \nto expire in less than 1 year, at which point Skip will have no \ninsurance.\n  Hollis Berendt is a small business owner in Greeley, CO. She is \ncovered through her husband's employer, which is ``a luxury many other \nsmall business owners don't have,'' she said.\n  After graduating from Colorado State University in 2004, their \ndaughter Abby found a job with a large company in New York City. She \nwas told she could not get health care coverage until she had been \nworking for the company 1 year. At 10 months of employment, she was \ndiagnosed with an ovarian tumor that would require surgery. The \nexpenses were too much for Abby, so her parents had to take out a \nsecond mortgage to pay her medical bills.\n  Hollis shared that ``this experience brought to light, all too \nclearly, how close we all are to losing everything due to a health \nissue.''\n  The current system is hurting our small business people and their \nemployees. Take Bob Montoya of Pueblo, CO, who runs Cedar Ridge \nLandscape in Pueblo with his brother Ron. They are torn between \nproviding health care coverage for employees and keeping the business \nafloat.\n  Last year, the business paid out $36,000 for a health care plan to \ncover Bob and Ron's families and one other employee. The other 12 \nemployees and their families do not get coverage through their work. \nBob said, ``As business owners, we want to do right by the people who \nwork for us, but if all our employees opted into our health care plan \nand paid their 50 percent, we would be forced out of business.''\n  He said it is an ``impossible situation'' for him and his employees.\n  Like too many small business owners, Bob can not find good health \ncare coverage at a cost he can afford.\n  He said, ``The longer it takes to pass comprehensive health care \nreform, the more jobs will be lost as small businesses shut their doors \ndue to rising costs.''\n  These Coloradans speak for countless others across the nation. All \nthey ask for is a health care system that works for them, a health care \nsystem that does not crush them with unreasonable costs, and a health \ncare system that does not deny them coverage just because they have \npre-existing conditions. I am hopeful.\n  I am hopeful that we can keep what works in our system and fix what \nis broken. I am hopeful that this Congress, working with our President, \nwill finally deliver on the promise of health care reform. The people \nof Colorado deserve it. The American people deserve it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman.)

Mr. President, the Senate Energy Committee has \njust approved an energy bill that adopted a very controversial \namendment that would allow oil to be drilled 10 miles off of the coast \nof Florida.\n  I wish to refer to this chart. Here is the peninsula of Florida. This \nis the panhandle of Florida, including Pensacola, Fort Walton Beach, \nPanama City, and Cape San Blas. Some of our largest military \ninstallations in America are here: the Pensacola Naval Air Station, the \nbig complex of the Air Force, Eglin Air Force Base in that area of Fort \nWalton Beach. Down here in Panama City is Tyndall Air Force Base, where \nthey are training all of the F-22 pilots. As one can see on this map, \nthe rest of the gulf coast of the United States includes Alabama, \nMississippi, Louisiana, and then Texas.\n  This chart illustrates what the Dorgan amendment does to Florida. It \nshows the western planning area of the gulf, the central planning area, \nand what is known as the eastern planning area. The chart shows that in \nlegislation we passed in 2006, a compromise was struck whereby the oil \nindustry could drill in an additional 8.3 million acres, in addition to \nthe 33 million acres they have under lease in the central and western \ngulf--33 million that they have under lease that they had not drilled. \nWe worked out an additional 8.3 million acres in this tan area called \nlease sale 181. In exchange, the compromise was for the protection of \nthe Gulf of Mexico, everything east of this longitude line known as the \nmilitary mission line. Why? Because everything east of this line is the \nlargest testing and training area for the U.S. military in the world. \nIt is where we are training our F-22 pilots out of Tyndall Air Force \nBase, it is where we are training our Navy pilots in Pensacola, and it \nis where we are testing some of the most sophisticated weapons systems \nin the world that are under the test and evaluation component of Eglin \nAir Force Base.\n  This is the area. It is also where we are training our Navy squadrons \nat Key West Naval Air Station. They will send in a squadron down here \nto Key West, and when they lift off from the Boca Chica runway, within \n2 minutes they are over protected airspace. So they don't have a lot of \ntravel time. They don't spend a lot of gas getting to their training \narea, which is out here. So we see that we have this area that is now \nprotected.\n  I wish to have printed in the Record a letter from the Secretary of \nDefense--and this is actually from the previous Secretary of Defense, \nSecretary Rumsfeld--in which he says the use of this for oil and gas \nproduction would be incompatible with the needs of the U.S. military in \nthis test and training area.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record, if \nI may.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2005.\n     Hon. John Warner,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, Russell Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter of October 7, \n     2005, concerning the potential effect of Department of \n     Interior-administered oil and gas leasing on military \n     training and readiness in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico. The \n     Department of Defense (DoD) fully supports the national goal \n     of exploration and development of our nation's offshore oil \n     and gas resources. The DoD, the Department of the Interior, \n     and affected states have worked together successfully for \n     many years to ensure unrestricted access to critical military \n     testing and training areas, while also enabling oil and gas \n     exploration in accordance with applicable laws and \n     regulations.\n       DoD conducts essential military testing and training in \n     many of the 26 Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) planning areas. \n     Prior\n\n[[Page S6490]]\n\n     analysis and existing agreements with Interior recognize that \n     areas east of the 86 deg. 41' line in the Gulf of Mexico \n     (commonly know as the ``Military Mission Line'') are \n     especially critical to DoD due to the number and diversity of \n     military testing and training activities conducted there now, \n     and those planned for the future. In those areas east of the \n     Military Mission Line, drilling structures and associated \n     development would be incompatible with military activities, \n     such as missile flights, low-flying drone aircraft, weapons \n     testing, and training.\n       As the planning process for Interior's new 5-year OCS oil \n     and gas leasing program proceeds, DoD will continue both to \n     evaluate its military requirements and to work with Interior \n     to ensure the 2007-2012 oil and gas program, and any future \n     lease sales resulting from it, strike the proper balance \n     between our nation's energy and national security goals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Donald Rumsfeld.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, here is what people don't \nunderstand. The committee that adopted this amendment, 13 to 10, \ndoesn't realize this is the largest testing and training area for the \nU.S. military. That is why in the legislation in law we protect \neverything east of that line that we passed 3 years ago. In return, we \ngave the oil boys an additional 8.3 million acres in lease sale 181 and \nlease sale 181 south. That, by the way, is in addition to their 33 \nmillion acres they have under lease here, and here, as shown on this \nmap, that they have not drilled.\n  Why do the oil companies want to have this additional lease area \nwhen, in fact, they have a lot of leases they haven't drilled--33 \nmillion acres plus another 8 million acres? Well, it is because a lease \nhas a legal value. If there is estimated to be any oil or gas there, \nthat has a value, and those leases then become a part of the assets of \nthe company, which increases the value of the company, which, of \ncourse, then makes their stock worth more. But what we struck in the \ncompromise 3 years ago that everybody out here on this Senate floor \nagreed to--agreed to, I might say, with Senator Martinez and me--was in \nexchange for getting that additional area, they would leave the \nmilitary mission test and evaluation and training area alone.\n  In the last round of BRAC, which is the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission, the ``r'' of BRAC stands for realignment. Is it any wonder \nthat in that round of evaluating military bases they decided to send \nall the pilot training for the new stealth fighter--the F-22--that they \nbrought it here to Tyndall Air Force base at Panama City? Why? Because \nthey have that area.\n  Listen, this fighter does a dog fight at 1.5 Mach, twice what an F-16 \nand an F-15 does a dog fight at. They are doing a dog fight, doing \ntight turns at about .75 Mach. The new F-22 stealth fighter will go \ninto and engage another aircraft at 1.5 Mach. When you do turns at \ntwice the speed of an F-15 and F-16, you have a much wider radius of a \nturn. That is why they need all that area. When they are dropping on \ntargets, they are dropping live ordnance.\n  When we are testing long-range weapons systems at Eglin Air Force \nBase--some that we release from airplanes, some that are shot from \nships--we need hundreds of miles of range. That is why the operative \npolicy of the Department of Defense is that you can't have oil rigs out \nhere to interfere with national security preparation, but, apparently, \nthat is not the way 13 Members of the Senate Energy Committee \nunderstood this argument.\n  Now there is another argument. By the way, I might point out that in \nthat realignment of the bases, they are bringing into Eglin Air Force \nbase all the pilot training for the new F-35. That is the Joint Strike \nFighter that is still being developed, but that will be coming out \nwithin the next few years. That is the Joint Strike Fighter for the \nNavy, the Marines, and the Air Force. That Joint Strike Fighter will be \nsold to some of our allies.\n  Where is the pilot training? Right here because of the restrictions, \nit being a test, a training, and an evaluation area. That is why the \nU.S. military brought these new assets into this area.\n  There is another reason now that I get so exercised about this, other \nthan the fact of the agreements that were set, that were agreed to; the \ncompromises that were struck 3 years ago are now being abrogated.\n  That is, they now bring oil rig leasing within 10 miles of the \nworld's most beautiful beaches. There are not too many Americans who \ndon't know that the beaches running from Pensacola all the way through \nPanama City to Mexico Beach are some of the world's most beautiful \nbeaches. They are sugary white sand, and people from all over go to \nenjoy this extraordinary valuable resource. It is God's way of giving \nus a blessing on Earth that people enjoy when they want to go to the \nbeach.\n  Can you imagine, what the Energy Committee has passed, allowing oil \nrigs 10 miles off the world's most beautiful beaches? Environmentally, \nthat is one thing, but let's look at the economy of Florida. The \neconomy of Florida--we are a peninsula. We have more coastline than any \nother State, save Alaska, but Alaska doesn't have a lot of beaches. We \nhave more beaches than almost--not almost--than any other State. Is it \nany wonder we want to protect our economy, which is a $60 billion-a-\nyear tourism industry, particularly at a time when the economy is being \nsavaged as much as it is?\n  Yet the Senate Energy Committee would say they are not only going to \nignore the military tests and training range that has been off-limits \nin the law, but now they are going to run rigs up to 10 miles offshore \nand threaten those sugary white beaches.\n  Well, let me tell you a few points about this wise energy policy they \nhave supposedly adopted. We all know increased domestic drilling is not \ngoing to decrease U.S. dependence on foreign oil. That has been shown \nover and over. Why? Because if there was oil there, you are not going \nto get it into production for 10 years. So using the scare tactics of \nthe gas prices going up and up doesn't do a bit for decreasing U.S. \ndependence on foreign oil and helping gas prices. But let's say it \nwould. Even though bad oil spills and shipping accidents take place, \nlet's say, for a moment, the technological innovations now have made \nall drilling operations safe; and if the United States wishes to remain \ndependent on oil, well, shouldn't we drill anywhere we can find oil? \nHow about Colorado for oil shale? But, oh, no, that is off-limits.\n  How about the five Great Lakes? They should have plenty of black \ngold. But, no, that is off-limits. How about the oil-rich Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge? That is off-limits. This Senator has \nsupported keeping that off-limits. No, the reality is that, instead, \nsome of my colleagues in the Senate want to come--it is kind of like: \ndon't tax you, don't tax me, go tax that ``fella'' under the tree. They \nwant to go and hit somebody else. They want to cut the heart and the \nlungs out of the U.S. military testing area. They want to come in and \nstart fouling up the most beautiful beaches in the world, the northwest \nFlorida coast.\n  Three years ago, we opened that additional 8.3 million acres. We \ndidn't allow any drilling any closer than 100 miles off Pensacola, 125 \nmiles off Panama City, 237 miles off Tampa Bay, and over 300 miles off \nNaples. Why are some people pushing to change this so soon after that \ncompromise that was struck 3 years ago? It is the oil industry, that is \nwhy. The oil industry has those 33 million acres out here in the \ncentral and western gulf. It is leased, it is not being drilled, but \nthat is not enough for them. Even though the industry hand-picked areas \nopened here in the 2006 compromise, it now feels it can make more of a \nprofit by drilling closer to Florida's coast.\n  I don't think we should have to trash our coastline and our economy \nand the U.S. military so big oil can increase its profit margin. There \nare serious national security implications if this were to become law. \nI wish to show you something else. Look at this picture. This is a \nbeach in Pinellas County, Florida after an oil spill. You know what \nthat is--that is oil mixing with white, sugary, powdery, white sand.\n  Drilling 10 miles off the coast of Florida would destroy the economy \nof the Nation's fourth largest State. It would convert Florida's world-\nclass beaches to an industrial coastline. We would trade the world's \ntop beaches and the tourist attractions for an industrial waste line \ndotted with transmission pipes, storage tanks, and oil rigs. We would \ntake away the U.S. military's last unfettered testing and training \nrange--and take it away during a time of war.\n\n[[Page S6491]]\n\n  Supporters of opening the eastern gulf say we need to do it to help \nget America off foreign oil. Tell me, then, why isn't there a clause in \nthe drilling amendment passed specifying that all oil and natural gas \nthat would be produced in the eastern gulf has to stay in the United \nStates for domestic consumption?\n  But, no, that is not there because, the truth is, any oil that would \nbe drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing \nour use of foreign oil not by one single drop.\n  If we wish to reduce our dependence on foreign oil--and you have \nheard me say this ad infinitum--we need to increase our use of \nalternative energy, energy-efficient cars and appliances.\n  Mr. President, is my time coming to a close?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent to proceed for an \nadditional 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Recently, we have seen how gas prices have \nstarted to rise. Why? Last year, the price of oil went up to $147 a \nbarrel. Why, in 1 day, did the price of oil rise $37 for a barrel of \noil? It is because those greedy speculators on unregulated futures \ncommodities markets had been able to bid up crude oil prices in part \ndue to a legal loophole, called the Enron loophole, which, in effect, \nunleashed insider trading similar to condo flipping since 2001.\n  Some Gulf Coast States, such as Louisiana, have embraced drilling. \nCongress even agreed to prop them up with revenue sharing. But because \nLouisiana doesn't have beaches--or has beaches that are left such as \nthis one in the picture--and they don't have a tourism economy like \nFlorida's, it isn't worth the risk to the jobs and the revenue and the \neconomy of Florida.\n  Florida's Gulf Coast has some of the most beautiful beaches in the \nworld. These beaches account for a substantial portion of the $60 \nbillion-a-year tourism economy.\n  Would you visit a beach with oil operations along its shores? Would \nyou want to go to a beach that looks like this photo? I'll tell you a \nlittle more about it. This photo is of a relatively small oil spill \nthat occurred as a result of a shipping accident in Pinellas County, \nFL, in 1993. It simply doesn't make sense to jeopardize Florida's \ntourism industry and put the coastline at risk of ending up like this.\n  I will close by reading a timely editorial that appeared in today's \nSt. Petersburg Times. That is one of Florida's largest newspapers. This \nwas so poignant I think it is worth me inserting it into the Record, \nwhich I will.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire article be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the St. Petersburg Times, June 11, 2009]\n\n                  Again, With Feeling: No New Drilling\n\n       There is a rhythm to summer that has become as predictable \n     in Washington as it is predatory and senseless: Schools let \n     out, vacation season begins, gas prices rise and opportunists \n     in Congress--encouraged by Big Oil--cite the pain at the pump \n     to push for expanding offshore drilling, jeopardizing \n     Florida's priceless coastline.\n       Do any of the 13 members of the Senate Energy and Natural \n     Resources Committee who voted to expand drilling Tuesday \n     realize that the nation is moving in the opposite direction \n     and seeking to reduce reliance on fossil fuels with a cleaner \n     energy policy?\n       The committee approved an amendment to a Senate energy bill \n     that would allow gas and oil drilling just 45 miles off \n     Florida's west coast and even closer off the Florida \n     Panhandle. It would wipe out a 2006 congressional compromise \n     that bans drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 100 \n     miles of the Panhandle through 2022. That exclusion zone is a \n     reasonable line of defense. Florida's beaches are vital to \n     the state's status as a world-class tourist destination.\n       Allowing drilling within 10 miles off the eastern Gulf \n     Coast also would jeopardize an important training area for \n     the Air Force and Navy.\n       As an energy strategy, the measure makes the Senate look \n     hopelessly out of date.

Madam President, the time for health care reform is \nnow. We cannot afford to wait any longer. For some time, Peter Orszag, \nnow President Obama's Budget Director, has warned that rising health \ncosts are unsustainable and represent the central fiscal challenge \nfacing the country.\n\n[[Page S6492]]\n\n  At $2.4 trillion per year, health care spending represents close to \n17 percent of the American economy, and it will exceed 20 percent by \n2018 if current trends continue. Hospitals and clinics are also \nproviding an estimated $56 billion in uncompensated care. Meanwhile, \nbusinesses are squeezed on the bottom line, forced to reduce or drop \nhealth coverage for their employees. Without action, costs will \ncontinue to rise and waste will proliferate.\n  We need to make health care affordable for everyone, and we need to \nreduce the waste and fraud that plagues the current system.\n  To my colleagues who are conjuring up reasons not to pass reform this \nyear, using scare tactics about nationalized health care and engaging \nin fear mongering, I say we cannot stay where we are. We cannot stay \nwhere we are. They must be getting different mail than I am. I am \ngetting mail, and I am getting people coming up to me all over the \nState. Even though our State has some of the most affordable health \ncare in the country, people know their money is being spent in other \nStates that are not as efficient. They know health care coverage when \nthe economy is tough is very difficult to come by, and that is what \nthey are coming up to me and talking about. They are not saying let's \nstay the way we are. They are saying reform this system.\n  In 2008, employee health premiums increased by 5 percent, two times \nthe rate of inflation, and the annual premium for an employer health \nplan covering a family of four averaged nearly $12,700.\n  Families cannot continue to bear the burden of runaway health costs. \nIf we do not act, these costs are going to break the backs of the \nAmerican people. We must remain committed to enacting a uniquely \nAmerican solution to our Nation's health care problem. We must keep \nwhat works and fix what is broken.\n  As Congress prepares to take up landmark health care legislation, \nmany in Washington are looking to my State, the State of Minnesota, as \na leader. Among them is the President of the United States. President \nObama has provided leadership and vision on this issue, and in a recent \nweekly radio address, he has highlighted how the Mayo Clinic and other \ninnovative health care organizations succeed in providing high-quality \ncare at relatively low cost. As he has said, we should learn from the \nsuccesses and promote the best practices, not the most expensive ones.\n  In Minnesota, the Mayo Clinic is not alone. Health partners Park \nNicollet and Essensia Health are already among those working to deliver \nthe best health care at the least price. At 92 percent of the State \ncovered by some kind of health care insurance, Minnesota has a strong \nhistory making sure the health care system promotes both quality care \nand access--92 percent coverage.\n  Minnesota, Washington, Wisconsin, Iowa, Utah, and North Dakota are \njust a few of the States that can help provide leadership to help \nCongress and the administration as we work to develop a quality \nintegrated health care system that reduces cost to the taxpayer and \nimproves health care outcomes.\n  It is no coincidence that as we speak, the President is in Wisconsin, \nanother State that understands to have high-quality care, you do not \nnecessarily have to have high prices. In fact, it is the opposite.\n  I will distill this cost issue into some understandable language. I \ngrew up watching the Minnesota Vikings. Year after year, our State has \nwaited for the Vikings to win the Super Bowl. We have been to the Super \nBowl four times, and we have never won the Super Bowl. All during that \nsame amount of time, the people of our country have been waiting for \nhealth care reform. They have been waiting for something to happen to \nmake health care more affordable. The people of this country cannot \nwait any longer. We might be able to wait on the Vikings; the people \ncannot wait any longer.\n  The importance of Minnesota's best practices can be outlined in a \ngame plan for national health care reform with a few key pointers: \nrewarding quality, not quantity; promoting coordinated, integrated \ncare; and focusing on prevention and disease management.\n  We are never going to be able to move the ball for that next first \ndown unless we start talking about costs; otherwise, we are simply \ngoing to have different people pay for the same expensive health care \nbut not do anything to reduce the cost.\n  First, our game plan for health care reform to reduce costs is to be \nsure to keep score. That means measuring outcomes and rewarding \nproviders who deliver quality results. Right now in many places, we are \nnot getting our money's worth from our health care dollars. In Miami, \nMedicare spends twice as much on the average patient as it does in \nMinneapolis, even though quality is much better in Minnesota--twice as \nmuch.\n  If we look at this chart, we will see that the areas in dark blue are \nthe higher spending regions of the country. They receive the lion's \nshare of Medicare payments. The light blue areas--States such as \nMinnesota, Montana, and Iowa--are areas where Medicare spending is low \nbut quality of care is often high.\n  In a recent New York Times article, some explained these differences \nin spending as they were trying to explain how can this happen that you \nhave twice the Medicare, twice the taxpayers' dollars for the same kind \nof medical treatments as you would in another part of the country. Some \nsaid it is a difference in cost of living, sicker people, more teaching \nhospitals. But research shows those factors only explain 18 percent of \nthe variation in spending.\n  It is no surprise. Most health care is purchased on a fee-for-service \nbasis, so more tests and more surgeries mean more money. Quantity, not \nquality, pays.\n  According to research at Dartmouth Medical School, nearly $700 \nbillion per year is wasted on unnecessary or ineffective health care--\n$700 billion per year. That is 30 percent of total health care \nspending. So to my colleagues who are fear mongering and saying we \nshould do nothing, I say how about $700 billion, 30 percent of total \nhealth care spending that we have the opportunity to change around to \nbenefit the people of this country?\n  Just look at this fact, if you want to look at quality care. The Mayo \nClinic ranked as one of the highest quality institutions in this \ncountry. If you look at the last 4 years of the lives of chronically \nill patients, some of the most difficult times for people in this \ncountry, an independent study from Dartmouth came out after they looked \nat what the Mayo Clinic did. They have a team of doctors working \ntogether with quality ratings incredibly high. Then they looked at what \nwas going on in other regions of the country.\n  If all the hospitals in this country used the same protocol that Mayo \nClinic used in the last 4 years of a patient's life, where the quality \nrating is incredibly high, we would save $50 billion every 5 years in \nMedicare spending--$50 billion.\n  So, no, I don't think the answer is just to throw away health care \nreform and do a lot of fear mongering. I think the answer is to work \ntogether to bring this kind of cost savings to the rest of the country.\n  There is general consensus that Medicare should reward value, and \nvalue consists of both quality and efficiency. However, value is not \ntaken into account when Medicare determines payment for providers.\n  To begin reining in costs, we need to have all health care providers \naiming for high quality, cost-effective results. That is why I plan to \nintroduce legislation with Senator Cantwell and others that would \nauthorize the U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary to create a \nvalue index as part of a formula used to determine Medicare's fee \nschedule--paying for value. This indexing will help regulate \noverutilization because those who produce more volume will need to also \nimprove care or the increased volume will negatively impact fees. You \nhave to have those incentives in place in how you do the payments or \nyou are never going to reduce costs.\n\n  In adding a value index, my bill would give physicians a financial \nincentive to maximize quality and value of their services instead of \nvolume. Linking rewards to the outcomes for the entire payment area \ncreates the incentive for physicians and hospitals to\n\n[[Page S6493]]\n\nwork together to improve quality and efficiency.\n  I am also interested in the idea that the President has proposed to \ngive increased consideration to recommendations made by the Medicare \nPayment Advisory Committee, MedPAC, a commission created by a \nRepublican Congress. MedPAC's recommendations for payment reform \ninclude bundling, which has potential significant cost savings. Giving \nthe recommendations made by experts increased authority could be a \nvaluable tool to help rein in health care spending and improve quality \nin a responsible way.\n  So the first part of our game plan for reducing costs for health care \nis focusing on value. The second part of the game plan for making \nhealth care more affordable is to focus on teamwork.\n  Understandably, patients like it when their health care providers \ntalk with one another and even work together. This means higher quality \ncare, as well as more efficient care. In too many places, however, \npatients must struggle against a fragmented delivery system where \nproviders duplicate services and sometimes work at cross-purposes--an x \nray here, an x ray there, an expert here, an expert there. It is like a \nfootball team with 11 quarterbacks but no wide receivers, no running \nbacks and no offensive line. This does not work in football, and it is \nnot going to work in health care.\n  The beauty of integrated care systems is that a patient's overall \ncare is managed by a primary care physician in coordination with \nspecialists, nurses, and other care providers as needed. It is one-stop \nshopping. In our rural communities, critical access hospitals utilize \nthis model and provide quality health care for residents in their \ncommunity with a team of providers.\n  To better reward and encourage this collaboration, we also need to \nhave better coordination of care and less incentive to bill Medicare by \nvolume. Increasing the bundling of services in Medicare's payment \nsystem has the potential to deliver savings and start encouraging \nquality, integrated care.\n  When it comes to improving care, changing who pays a doctor will make \nno more difference. The lesson of high-quality, efficient States such \nas Minnesota and Wisconsin is that someone has to be responsible for \nthe care of the patient from start to finish, from one goal line to the \nother. Bundling will ensure that practice is rewarded.\n  This is a very interesting chart. It does not look interesting, but \nit is. A lot of people think the more you pay, the better quality care \nyou get. This was a MedPAC analysis of county level fee-for-service \nexpenditures, a national study.\n  Do you know what they found? They found that those areas of the \ncountry, those counties that had low utilization--in other words, maybe \nsomeone called a nurse line or a doctor referred them to one specialist \ninstead of them going to three on their own--they found they had the \nhighest quality care. Why is that? It makes sense. You have one primary \ndoctor who knows exactly what is going on, is checking your charts and \ncan send them to one specialist so mistakes are not make. You go to one \nspecialist who does not know you are taking a certain medication and \nyou are allergic to another. High-quality care with low utilization; \nlowest quality care with high utilization.\n  That is probably the opposite of what most people in this country \nthink. But, literally, you get the highest quality care in those parts \nof the country where you are paying less money.\n  As I said, if people start to say our area of the country is so \nexpensive, only 18 percent of that difference with the high-quality, \nlow-cost States and the low-quality, high-cost States can be attributed \nto cost of living.\n  Research has shown that moving toward a better integrated and \ncoordinated delivery system would save Medicare alone up to $100 \nbillion per year. So if people don't want to talk about reform and they \nwant to make a bunch of fear-mongering statements, let them explain to \nthe American people why we are not going to save $100 billion per year.\n  Finally, the last game pointer is that the best offense is a good \ndefense. My dad covered football his whole life for the newspaper, and \nthis is what he would always say to me: It works on the football field \nand it works in health care. It is a lot better for both the patient \nand the patient's pocketbook if a chronic medical problem can be \nprevented or managed early to stave off complications and the need for \ncostly care. Right now, physicians are paid to treat diseases, not \nprevent them. Yet a payment system that encourages prevention and \ndisease management could generate enormous savings because a large \nportion of health care spending is devoted to treating a relatively \nsmall number of people with chronic medical conditions.\n  Let me give an example of this. This is Health Partners, which is a \nclinic in Minnesota--all over our State. A lot of patients are members \nof it. They started looking at how can we do a better job with \ndiabetes. They did this back in the fourth quarter of 2004 compared to \nthe fourth quarter of 2008. You see here an increase in quality for the \npatients, an increase in percentage of patients with optimal diabetes \ncontrol, because they put in some practical protocols.\n  What do you see with costs? You see an actual major decrease in the \ncost per patient. That is the green line. The yellow line is an \nincrease in the patients with optimal diabetes control, as the doctors \ndetermined. The green line is a decrease in cost. The red line is \npatients with diabetes who had asked that they recommend Health \nPartners clinics. So even as they saw this dramatic reduction in cost, \nthey were still on the up in terms of recommending using Health \nPartners clinics. Most people don't like their HMOs very much. They \nalways have reasons to complain. So I think this is amazing that they \nwere able to show this kind of result.\n  At Park Nicollet in Minnesota, they have implemented a congestive \nheart failure program with Medicare. In the 3 years since the program \nbegan, Park Nicollet has saved nearly $5,000 per patient, per year.\n  Diabetes, congestive heart disease, and back problems all contribute \nto the excessive cost and growth in our health care system and cause \ndecreased productivity in our economy. One study found that the most \ncostly 20 percent of Medicare patients in a given year account for 84 \npercent of total Medicare spending. By contrast, the least costly 40 \npercent of Medicare patients accounted for just 1 percent of overall \nspending. As the examples from Minnesota and other places demonstrate, \neffectively managing these and other chronic illnesses is essential to \nhealth care reform.\n  A recent New Yorker magazine article showcased the Mayo Clinic in the \ncontext of health care's cost conundrum.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. According to the author, a physician, we are in ``a \nbattle for the soul of American medicine.'' On one side is a \nfragmented, volume-driven model that too often crosses into \nprofiteering. There are good parts about our health care system, \nbelieve me. I know this because I live in Minnesota. We have to \nmaintain those. But we have to fix this broken cost structure. On the \nother side, you see this model offered by Mayo and other peer \ninstitutions across the country where doctors collaborate to provide \nthe best, most efficient care for their patients.\n  On one side is more of the same, which is both financially and \nmorally unsustainable; on the other side is a new direction that \npromises to curb cost while expanding affordable coverage. It is time \nto choose sides. For the sake of our fiscal health and for the sake of \nmillions of Americans struggling to afford the care they need, I urge \nmy colleagues to choose the latter.\n  Yesterday, I met with a bipartisan group of Senators, and I have to \ntell you I still have hope that we are going to get this done and I \nhave hope that there will be bipartisan support for this. What I am \ntalking about today--cost reduction, putting these incentives in \nplace--isn't a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. It is an \nAmerican issue. This is an American cause, and we can find a uniquely \nAmerican solution to this problem so that we can reduce costs and make \nhealth care better quality. I can tell you, having spent my entire life \nin the State of Minnesota and having a daughter who was\n\n[[Page S6494]]\n\nborn very sick, who couldn't even swallow when she was born, I know we \ncan get high-quality health care at lower cost. They do it every day in \nmy State, and we can do it in the rest of the country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, when it comes to health care, Republicans \nwant reform that respects patient freedom and choice. We want to \nmaintain the sanctity of the doctor-patient relationship. We believe \ndoctors, not Washington, should tailor an individual's care. \nWashington-run health care would delay or deny care and would displace \nmillions of Americans who are happy with their current health \ninsurance. Federal bureaucracies are not known for being efficient, \ninnovative, or hassle-free.\n  On Wednesday, the majority whip said:\n\n       Those who come to the floor of the Senate defending the \n     health insurance companies and saying they want no change in \n     the health care system have to defend the indefensible.\n\n  Well, who exactly has come to the floor and said that? Who in the \nSenate has come to the floor and said they want no change? I know of no \none who has done that. This is a straw man argument, usually made when \nyou can't win an argument on the merits, but it has become a familiar \nrefrain from some of our friends on the other side of the aisle. They \npresent a false choice between doing what they want and doing nothing. \nWhen they don't want to listen to Republican ideas, they accuse us of \nwanting to do nothing. It happened with the stimulus bill, and it is \nhappening now with health care.\n  Republicans want health care reform. I have said this repeatedly, and \nso has Senator McConnell. I have noted that there are abundant problems \nin our current system, that a routine visit to the doctor can be \nsurprisingly expensive. Too many people have to go without basic care \nfor a host of reasons, whether they are unemployed or work for a \nbusiness that doesn't have health care or perhaps have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  The task before us is to ensure that all Americans have access to \nquality health care without degrading the quality of care for anyone. \nIn other words, those who are happy with their care--and that is the \nmajority of Americans--don't want to have to sacrifice their care in \norder to take care of the problem of those who are having issues. And \nby access to care, I don't mean access to a government waiting list.\n  There are two ways to approach health care reform while trying to \nkeep costs in line. One, which President Obama says he rejects, is to \ncreate a competitive marketplace in which consumers get to pick the \nplan that works the best for their families. Competition helps the \nconsumer. The more competition, the better. And this concept does not \ninclude a Washington-run plan.\n  The other is for the government to ration care by deciding what \ntreatments you can get and which medications you can have. Yes, you can \ncut costs this way, but it is not right, it is not what Americans want, \nnor is it what physicians want. The American Medical Association, an \norganization of 250,000 of America's physicians, said in a recent \nstatement that it does not ``. . . believe that creating a public \nhealth insurance option for nondisabled individuals under the age of 65 \nis the best way to expand health insurance coverage and lower costs.'' \nI agree. The doctors--those who provide the care--are concerned about \nwhat a Washington-run health care would mean for their patients and for \nthe uninsured Americans who need to get in to see them.\n  Republicans have been discussing the state of health care in Canada \nand the United Kingdom because those countries have government-run \nhealth care and they delay or deny treatment for many of their citizens \nin order to keep costs under control. The Canadian and British \nGovernments created these systems with the best of intentions, but \ngovernment-run care is not serving their citizens' needs, and we don't \nneed to replicate their problems here in the United States. In fact, in \nCanada, Claude Castonguay, chair of the commission which recommended \nthat Quebec establish a government-run system in the 1960s, declared \nlast year that ``the system is in crisis''--his words. Private clinics \nare opening all over Canada at the rate of one per week to treat those \nwho are on waiting lists at the public hospitals. Many Canadians who \nhave the resources to get out of the bureaucratic government have \nchosen to do so.\n  As the Republican leader pointed out today, Britain's National \nInstitute for Health and Clinical Excellence--the entity responsible \nfor setting guidelines on pharmaceuticals and treatments for British \npatients--last year denied patients in that country access to four \nkidney cancer drugs that have the potential to elongate patients' \nlives. The institute explained it this way:\n\n       Although these treatments are clinically effective, \n     regrettably, the cost is such that they are not a cost-\n     effective use of resources.\n\n  A chilling statement, indeed. The stories of patients being denied \ntreatment by their governments are real.\n  President Obama and some of my colleagues in the Senate have argued--\nas the majority whip has--that a public or a government-run option can \ncompete with other insurers and that this government-run option would \nbe only one choice of many. My question is, Why is it needed?\n  And what will it do? Government-run health care would crowd out other \ninsurers, quickly becoming a monopoly. I have cited these statistics \nfrom the Lewin Group, which has made this point. Someone who has \ninsurance through his or her company could be forced into the \ngovernment's plan if the employer decides it is simpler and cheaper to \npay a fine to the government and eliminate its coverage. A company \nmight say: Why bother with the paperwork and administration when we can \njust pay a fine and tell people to get onto the government insurance \nrolls? As I said, that is what health experts say will happen. The \nLewin Group I cited before has estimated that 119 million people will \nbe shifted from a private plan onto a government plan if it is created. \nThat would affect two-thirds of the 170 million Americans who currently \nhave private insurance, all but ending private insurance in America.\n  President Obama said recently:\n\n       If we don't get this done this year we're not going to get \n     it done.\n\n  Well, why is that? Why does that have to be so? Could it be because \nthe President would prefer that we rush a bill through before Americans \nget a chance to absorb what Washington-run health care would mean for \ntheir families? If this is worth doing, it is worth doing right. It is \nworth taking the time to do it right.\n  Americans are compassionate, and we want coverage for our neighbors \njust as much as we want it for our own families. But I will tell you \nthat my constituents worry about the cost, and they do not want the \nFederal Government to cover others at their expense, both in cost and \nin the form of rationed care. So one of the first questions for this \nprogram is, How much is it going to cost and who is going to pay it? \nAnother question is, What is going to be the effect on seniors who are \nin Medicare? Do they have anything to worry about? And my answer to \nthat is, absolutely, because some of the conversation has to do with \n``reforming the way our seniors get their health care.''\n  We haven't heard much about the exact price of government-run health \ncare, but we know the cost will be extremely high. And whatever we \nspend, it won't be enough to ensure all Americans get the care they \nneed. So when we begin talking about cost and being more concerned \nabout the cost than the quality of care, as was the institute in \nBritain I just quoted, then we get into a situation where we are going \nto have to ration care, and that is something neither our seniors nor \nfamilies with coverage today want at all.\n  We need a real marketplace of options. Choice, freedom, and \ncompetition should be guiding principles for the health care reform we \nall want.\n  I reiterate that Republicans as well as Democrats want reforms in our \nhealth care system. There are people who need coverage, and we all \nunderstand there are ways we can save money. The question is, Do we do \nthis through more government control, more government bureaucracy, \ngovernment-run insurance companies, fines on employers, and raising \ntaxes in order to add 40 or 50 million more people to insurance rolls \nor do we try to\n\n[[Page S6495]]\n\nachieve the results through removing barriers to competition which \ncurrently exist?\n  Republicans have noted a whole series of laws right now that could \neither be reformed or repealed in order to allow more competition, in \norder to reduce prices for those already in the market and give \npatients more choice. I don't know why the resistance to this insurance \nreform. I don't know of anybody who likes the way insurance companies \nalways do their business. I know I don't. So why not reform and enable \nthose who would do it the way people want to have products that could \nbe offered to the public and which presumably the public would buy if \nthey are concerned about the way their insurance is currently being \noffered?\n  So this is not a matter of one side wanting reform and the other side \nnot; it is a matter of different approaches. And from my constituents, \nI can tell you they are concerned about what they have and they are \nconcerned about what they are going to have to pay. As much as they \nwant to help other people have the same kind of coverage they do, they \ndon't want it at the expense of their families, by having care rationed \nto them and their families as a result of the fact that it would cost \nmore money than we are currently paying.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in my State of Ohio and States such as \nMichigan, Indiana, Pennsylvania, middle-class families already hit by a \nterrible recession are facing a new wave of devastating job losses and \nplant closings. Some 400,000 Ohioans are employed, directly or \nindirectly, because of the auto industry. The auto industry crisis is a \ncrisis especially in my State and in Michigan and in the other States \nin the region.\n  As Congress works to help the industry through these most difficult \ntimes, the industry must do all it can to keep jobs here at home. That \nis why it was welcome news when GM announced that rather than start \nmore small car production in China and Mexico, which they have done in \nthe past, they would open a new small car manufacturing plant somewhere \nin one of these auto States.\n  This crisis has hit home in my State, especially in Mansfield, where \nGM has one of its best stamping plants. Workers at this plant were \nasked to make concessions over the past 2 years, and they did. They \nwere asked to produce in an exceptionally efficient manner, and they \nnow rank at or near the top, across a range of performance standards. \nThe Mansfield GM Fisher Body Stamping Plant played by the rules, did \nall that was expected of them, and they made it to the top, literally \nto the top of GM's stamping plants. Yet GM has decided to close this \nfacility.\n  GM's decision not to include the Mansfield stamping plant in the New \nGM, this new coming-out-of-bankruptcy company, one that is focused on \nbuilding fuel-efficient cars for the 21st century, is troubling, it is \nmore than troubling to employees and members of the Mansfield community \nand to me.\n  Yesterday, I met with GM officials who were direct and polite and are \ntrying to do their best. I met with GM officials to try to understand \ntheir decision. I am not convinced this makes sense for the New GM, to \nclose this Mansfield Fisher Body Stamping Plant. I know it does not \nmake sense for Ohio. GM's own scorecard shows the Mansfield plant has \nmet nearly 100 percent of its targets and has a productivity rate of 94 \npercent. According to GM's records, it is the single highest ranked \nstamping plant in GM.\n  The plant that is a very close second is 70 miles away, north of \nMansfield, in Parma, OH. By GM's own records, those are the two top-\nrated stamping plants. It makes little sense to me and to the town and \nGM workers at Mansfield that the company would not want its best and \nbrightest to embark on its new path toward success.\n  The auto crisis hit home in Twinsburg, OH. Twinsburg is the home of \nthe most modern stamping plant in Chrysler's network. It ranks among \nthe highest in safety and productivity. Yet Twinsburg's workers and \ntheir families got the rug pulled out from under them last month. The \ncrisis is playing itself out every day as auto suppliers struggle to \nfind credit.\n  So it is not just Mansfield and Twinsburg, it is not just the loss of \nfewer than 100, but 80 or 90 people in families in the Columbus area \nwho lost jobs when a GM supply center announced it was closing. It is \nalso what happens to those companies that supply the auto companies, \nand they, frankly, employ more workers than the auto companies \nthemselves do.\n  The crisis plays itself out every single day as auto suppliers \nstruggle to find credit. If a manufacturer has auto customers, banks \nseem to put them on a black list and do not want to extend any loans, \neven those backed by the Small Business Administration.\n  The crisis plays itself out in Warren and Dayton, where Delphi \nsalaried workers, who played by the rules, are left without the \npensions they deserve. These stories from Mansfield, from Twinsburg, \nfrom Warren, from Dayton, from smaller communities are, unfortunately, \nnot unique. There are more stories, stories from small Ohio towns such \nas Trotwood, near Dayton; Van Wert, on the Indiana border; and \nGreenwood and from other cities across Ohio and the Midwest.\n  That is why it angered me when I sat in the Banking Committee as I \nwas chairing, as Chairman Dodd was working on health care issues, when \nI heard these restructuring proposals for Chrysler and GM portrayed by \nmy more conservative colleagues in this body as ``giveaways'' to \nworkers. When they label this as ``everybody sacrificed except the \nworkers,'' the workers have seen tens of thousands of lost jobs. We \nhave seen a $7-an-hour cut in compensation for these workers. That is a \n$14,000 a year hit that these workers are taking. They are far from \ngiveaways.\n  American autoworkers, their families, and their communities are all \nin this together and have suffered with their communities perhaps more \nthan anybody.\n  Just 3 years ago there were a quarter million members of the UAW. \nAfter these GM and Chrysler restructurings in the auto industry, that \nnumber of worker members will be below 100,000. These are men and women \nwho make up our Nation's middle class, the heartbeat of America, if you \nwill.\n  They work hard, they support their families. They are watching as \ntheir chance at the American dream goes up in smoke. It is an American \ntragedy. Anyone who dismisses it otherwise should be ashamed.\n  Wages have decreased for entry-level workers. Wages have been frozen. \nKey health care benefits were eliminated for both active and retired \nworkers. Understand, the much maligned legacy costs that companies are \nburdened with, if you will, these legacy costs, health care and \npensions, were negotiated at the bargaining table when workers said: We \nwill take less money in salary and wages today if you put that money \naside for pensions and health care--for health care now and for \npensions later. So they gave up dollars at the bargaining table. That \nis what these legacy costs are.\n  These concessions, combined with swapping GM's contributions owed to \nthe VEBA with stock, a step that will increase risks for retirees, will \nsave General Motors billions. That is a good idea because we want this \ncompany to survive and thrive.\n  Every facet of this restructuring has an impact on hard-working \nAmericans, on their communities, their States, their Nation as a whole. \nWe should ask yourselves this: Is the government doing everything it \ncan to protect and create American jobs? Is the government ensuring \nthat top-performing segments of Chrysler and GM are not sacrificed \nbecause of expediency or politics or information gaps or favoritism?\n  I held a conference call with mayors from Ohio's auto communities \nrecently. Nearly all of them raised the fact that they may need to \neliminate police and fire and their other local government entities, \neliminating teaching positions and others, because\n\n[[Page S6496]]\n\nof the shortfall in tax revenue from plant closings. Some mayors have \nalready done that.\n  The worry from these mayors reminds us we are talking more about jobs \nand bottom line. We are talking about our Nation's manufacturing \nfuture. We are talking about our Nation's middle class.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico.)

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak of a subject \nthat is on the minds of so many Americans. It is also the subject of a \nlot of attention and work here in Washington, and that issue is health \ncare. I won't try today to cover every aspect of it and to cover all of \nthe details that are being debated here in Washington, but I rise to \nbegin a series of speeches that I and others will be giving on this \ntopic.\n  I don't think I need to recite the challenge the people of \nPennsylvania and America face when it comes to their health care. I do \nbelieve there is some consensus, not only here in Washington but around \nthe country, about what we have to do. We have to take action, and as \nwe take action, we have to be very clear about what we tell people and \nwhat is in the legislation: that if you like the health care you have, \nyou can keep it; if you don't like what you have or you don't have any \nhealth care, we are going to put a bill in front of the American \npeople--in front of the Senate and the House, and then legislation \nbefore the American people--which will allow that kind of choice.\n  I believe there is consensus about that. There is consensus about \nsome fundamental keys to reform. No. 1 is the question of cost \nreduction. We can't get through this process and not get a handle on \ncosts, especially for the future. No. 2: I think there is a great \nconsensus about choice, preserving the kinds of choices people have now \nand in fact enhancing the choices that people have in their health care \ndecisions. No. 3: To ensure quality, affordable health care for all \nAmericans. The nature of that issue is that we can build on our current \nsystem, but that we have too many people--as many as almost 50 \nmillion--who are uninsured.\n  There are a lot of people to thank here in Washington for the work \nthat has been done already. I know we are a long way off. We have a lot \nmore to do. There are weeks and weeks of work still ahead of us, but a \nfew bear mentioning. Obviously, the President of the United States, \nPresident Obama, has made this a central issue of his Presidency and \nhas worked very hard and has continued to make this a priority. We want \nto commend his leadership. It is essential. We cannot move this \nlegislation without his help.\n  Senator Kennedy, who has worked on this issue for more than four \ndecades, I guess, now, has given tremendous leadership and inspiration. \nWhether he is here physically or whether he is not, he is providing \nthat and has provided that for the American people for a generation on \nhealth care.\n  Senator Baucus, the head of the Finance Committee, has worked not \njust months but years on this. Especially in the last year, in the last \n6 months, he has been working very hard to get it right on that \nessential committee.\n  Senator Dodd has stepped into the Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee leadership role because Senator Kennedy hasn't \nalways been able to be here because of his own health challenges.\n  I also wish to commend the bipartisan spirit that I think is evident \non both sides of the aisle. People want to get this done, and they want \nto get it done in a bipartisan manner.\n  What I will speak about today is an aspect of this challenge which I \nthink is not getting enough attention and enough focus and, therefore, \nmay not get enough resolution in the legislation, and that is the issue \nof what happens to our children, especially children who are poor or \nthose with disabilities, those with special needs. I believe the \ntheme--not just the theme and not just the goal but the ironclad \npromise that we should make when we talk about reforming health care \nand getting legislation passed--the ironclad promise should be as \nfollows: No child worse off. No child in America should be worse off at \nthe end of this process, especially poor children and especially those \nwho have special needs, those with a disability.\n  Despite all of the great work--and I could cite a long list of people \nto thank for children's health insurance--the legislation that was \npassed in the 1990s and the reauthorization is great news: 6 million \nkids covered, plus 4 million more who will be covered, so almost 10 \nmillion--almost 11 million, actually--more than 10 million children are \ncovered by that. That is wonderful. We should be happy about that. We \ngot that done this year. Here is the problem: There are still 5 million \nmore who are not covered. So I rise today to speak about coverage and a \nfocus on those children.\n  Here is what I believe when it comes to children in our society. I \nbelieve every child born in America is born with a light inside them. \nFor some children, the reach of that light will be boundless. It will \nbe scintillating. You won't be able to see it, it will be so bright, \nbecause of that child's potential or because of his or her \ncircumstances, but their potential and, therefore, the light within \nthem is boundless. For some other children, that light will be a little \nmore limited because of circumstance, or because of other limitations \nthey may have. No matter what the situation that child is in, no matter \nhow brightly or not so brightly that light is shining, we have to make \nsure we are there for them, especially when it comes to health care. So \nI believe that light has to continue to shine, and one of the reasons I \nam so grateful for the work that has been done already is that in our \ncommittee, we have made children a priority.\n  The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee has not only \nproduced a bill already--it is from one side of the aisle, the \nDemocratic side; we are working with our Republican colleagues now--but \nthe Affordable Health Choices Act is now on the table for debate. We \nare working on it today, hours and hours yesterday and today, and we \nwill continue that with our Republican colleagues.\n  There are a number of provisions in there for children that speak \ndirectly to this concern I have. Senator Dodd has shown tremendous \nleadership on this issue of helping our children through this \nlegislation. But I believe we have to focus the attention of the \ncountry on the challenge, and that is why I have introduced S. Res. \n170.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the entire resolution be printed in the \nRecord as a part of my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 170\n\n       Whereas Medicaid is a cornerstone of the Nation's health \n     care infrastructure, providing critical health coverage to \n     Americans who have the greatest needs: children and adults \n     whose financial means are very modest and people who are in \n     poorer health compared to the population at-large, including \n     individuals with significant disabilities and those with \n     multiple chronic illnesses;\n       Whereas Medicaid provides health coverage to \\1/4\\ of the \n     Nation's children and more than \\1/2\\ of all low-income \n     children;\n       Whereas because minority children are more likely to be \n     from low-income families, Medicaid has been shown to reduce \n     racial and ethnic disparities in health care, as it provides \n     coverage for 2 out of every 5 African-American and Hispanic \n     children;\n       Whereas by limiting cost-sharing and premiums, Medicaid \n     provides a comprehensive benefit package and ensures that \n     children have access to affordable coverage and the health \n     care services they need to stay healthy and meet \n     developmental milestones;\n       Whereas Medicaid is designed to meet the complex health \n     care needs of low-income and special needs children by \n     including a wide range of essential and comprehensive \n     services that many private insurers do not cover;\n       Whereas Medicaid provides developmental assessments for \n     infants and young children (including well-child visits, \n     vision and hearing services, and access to a wide range of \n     therapies to manage developmental disorders and chronic \n     illnesses) and coverage for in-home support, long-term care \n     for special needs children, and transportation services;\n\n[[Page S6497]]\n\n       Whereas Medicaid provides a care coordination benefit that \n     supports at-risk children by coordinating State health \n     services, thereby furthering the ability of States to \n     effectively coordinate medical and social services that are \n     provided by multiple organizations and agencies;\n       Whereas administrative spending is lower in Medicaid than \n     through private insurance;\n       Whereas Medicaid is critical for ensuring that children \n     have access to safety-net providers in their local \n     communities and for training health care professionals, \n     including pediatricians; and\n       Whereas Medicaid provides low-income children with the full \n     complement of services they need to meet their unique health \n     and developmental needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Congress should ensure that reform of our Nation's \n     health care system shall benefit all children and that no \n     child shall be worse off, particularly the most vulnerable \n     low-income children and children with disabilities; and\n       (2) strengthening our Nation's Medicaid program should be a \n     priority and that low-income children should not be moved \n     into a health care exchange system that could disrupt and \n     diminish their benefits, cost-sharing protections, \n     availability of care standards and protections, and access to \n     supports, services, and safety-net providers.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. S. Res. 170 is cosponsored by Senators Dodd, Rockefeller, \nBrown, Whitehouse, and Sanders. I will highlight some of the features \nof it.\n  First, it starts with a recognition that the Medicaid Program is a \ncornerstone of the Nation's health insurance infrastructure. It notes \nin the resolution that Medicaid covers a quarter of all children in the \ncountry--one-quarter--and half of all poor children. It notes as well \nthat Medicaid has been shown to reduce racial and ethnic disparities in \nhealth care and provides coverage for two out of every five African-\nAmerican and Hispanic children.\n  Medicaid is a comprehensive benefit package. It provides \ndevelopmental assessments for infants and young children. It has care \ncoordination benefits in support of at-risk children, and Medicaid's \nadministrative spending is lower than that through private insurance.\n  Here is the end of the resolution, and I am summarizing here: It is \nthe intent of this resolution to say that the Nation's health care \nsystem shall benefit all children--all children--and that no child \nshall be worse off at the end of this debate. Low-income children \nshould not be moved into a health care exchange system that could \ndisrupt and diminish their benefits. That is S. Res. 170.\n  I believe it is critically important to emphasize this idea, that no \nchild should be worse off as a result of health care reform--not a \nsingle child--and in particular, those who have special needs or who \nhappen to be poor.\n  We know from our research that children are not small adults. They \nhave different challenges. They have developmental and health care \nneeds that are very different from adults. The challenges they have, \nthe problems they encounter can be exacerbated if children face \neconomic challenges or have any kind of special needs. These needs must \nbe met, and if they are not met, the whole trajectory for the future of \nthat child will be changed for the worse.\n  Let me say in conclusion, we have seen throughout our history that \nthere are some people who cannot do something on their own, that they \nneed the help of a program, they need the help of a government, and \nthank goodness we made the determination a long time ago that our \nhealth care system is part of that equation. When I think about health \ncare and when we think about the health care of children, no matter \nwhat income level their family happens to be in, but especially if they \nare poor or have special needs, and you think of the love of a mother, \nwith the kind of love that a mother provides to a child, there are so \nmany things that one mother can provide for her child. She can help \nwith that child's education. She can provide nurturing and care and \nlove to make sure that child develops in the way we would hope. She can \neven help somewhat in that child's health care. But no matter how much \na mother loves her child, no matter how skilled she is, no matter how \ndedicated she is to the welfare of her child, and no matter how much \nshe loves that child, she cannot--cannot--provide the kind of \nprotections that health insurance provides and the kind of medical \nattention that a good hospital or a good doctor or a good health care \nprofessional can provide.\n  So we have a choice. We can have health reform legislation, and \neveryone will pat each other on the back and we will all be happy we \ngot it done. That would be wonderful. But if we get this bill passed \nand we have fallen short with regard to our children, especially those \nwho are poor and have special needs, I think we will have failed not \nonly those children, of course, but we will have failed the obligation \nwe have to make sure that every child comes through this with the kind \nof protections and the kind of help they should have a right to expect, \nand that that mother can have a sense that this country, this \ngovernment has made a full commitment--not a partial commitment but a \nfull commitment--to children.\n  Let us, as we go forward, remember the love that a mother has for her \nchild and the limitations--no matter how much that mother loves that \nchild and what she is able to do--that we must help her with in this \ndebate. Let us not forget, and let us make sure that the legislation we \npass on health care reform has as one of its ironclad promises: no \nchild worse off.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and would note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6497-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6497]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Morning business is closed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6497-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6497-S6523]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1256, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1256) to protect the public health by \n     providing the Food and Drug Administration with certain \n     authority to regulate tobacco products, to amend title 5, \n     United States Code, to make certain modifications in the \n     Thrift Savings Plan, the Civil Service Retirement System, and \n     the Federal Employees' Retirement System, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 2:30 \np.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the Senator from Wyoming, Mr. Enzi, or their \ndesignees.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see my friend from Ohio, Senator Brown, \nwho has been a champion of this issue, not only as a Member of this \nbody but as a former Member of the other body. He has spoken eloquently \non this already. I will defer to him whatever time he may wish to use. \nI am told Senator Enzi will be here shortly. We will go back and forth \nbetween now and 2:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I have watched with great admiration Senator Dodd's \nwork on this bill. I also worked on this bill with Henry Waxman in the \nHouse of Representatives. Senators Kennedy, Dodd, Durbin, and \nCongressman Waxman have helped to bring these issues forward, and they \nhave never given up.\n  I boil this issue down to basically almost one sentence. I remember \nsitting in front of the Health Subcommittee in the House years ago and \nseeing the tobacco company executives swear to tell the truth, and they \ndidn't exactly tell the truth when they talked about nicotine not being \nan addiction. I learned one simple concept at that hearing--and we have \nknown this for a number of years--which is that 400,000 Americans die \nevery year from tobacco-related illnesses. On average, that means more \nthan 1,000 Americans die every day from tobacco-related illnesses.\n  If you are a tobacco executive, you think about this: You have lost \n400,000 customers every year, more than a thousand customers every day, \nand you\n\n[[Page S6498]]\n\nneed to replenish your customer base. What do you do? You need to find \n400,000 new customers every year. You don't go to people of Senator \nDodd's and my generation; you don't even go to my children's age group; \nthey are in their late twenties. You aim your marketing campaign at the \nyoung men and women sitting in front of me, the pages on the steps in \nfront of the Presiding Officer's chair. You aim at people 14, 15, 16, \n17, 18 years old. You have to find 400,000 new customers every year and \nmore than 1,000 customers every day. And they are pretty successful at \nit.\n  I heard Senator Dodd talk a few minutes ago in another meeting, and \nhe said something like 3,000 new young people start smoking every day. \nOf those 3,000, for many it becomes a lifelong habit and many will die \nas a result of smoking. So the key point about this legislation--what \nmakes the legislation Chairman Dodd brought forward today so \nimportant--is to have the FDA finally be involved in tobacco-related \nillness and regulation. What makes it so important is we need somebody \nto stand between the very well-paid drug company marketing executives \nand these 13-, 14-, 15-, and 16-year-olds who aren't nearly as \nsophisticated. We need some assistance in making sure those targeting \nefforts cannot get those young people addicted.\n  One thousand Americans every day die from tobacco-related illnesses. \nThey need 1,000 new customers every day to replenish their customer \nbase. This legislation will help stop that. That is why this is \nimportant, and the Senate needs to pass this legislation. That is why \nthis 15-year effort to do this right finally is coming to fruition. We \nneed to pass this and get it to the President. He is eager to sign it. \nIt will matter greatly in affecting America's public health in the \ndecades ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Ohio for his remarks and for his \nefforts over the years. This has been a long journey. It goes back 50 \nyears. Back then, the Surgeon General of the United States warned of \nthe health effects of smoking--a half century ago.\n  I know we will have a big vote at 2:30, and that is great news. \nSometimes a large vote such as this minimizes the impact of the \ndecision. This has been a very long battle. Somebody told me the other \nday the issue to ban smoking on airplanes only passed the Congress by \none vote. Imagine today if somebody tried to restore the right, or \nprivilege, to smoke on airplanes. I doubt you would find one vote in \nfavor. Even smokers object to smoking on airplanes today. So only by a \none-vote margin did Congress vote to ban that practice.\n  On Monday, we had a cloture vote. People can vote for a lot of \ndifferent reasons. I don't suggest that everybody who voted against \ncloture was in favor of continuing to allow the tobacco industry to be \nunregulated. But by a 1-vote margin, basically, 61 votes, on a \nbipartisan basis, we terminated that debate, which is bringing us to \nthe vote in 20 minutes. While it may seem like another vote on this \nday, June 11, 2009, it is a significant vote. I don't know of another \nvote in the last number of years as important as this one. We are going \nto start a markup in the next week--my friend from Wyoming has been \ninvolved in this and is passionate about the issue of smoking. We are \ngoing to mark up bills and fashion a major health care reform debate in \nthis country. What better way to begin that debate than by the vote we \nare going to take in a few minutes.\n  For the first time in the history of our country, we will insist that \ntobacco products be regulated by the FDA. To put this into perspective, \nthe FDA regulates not only all the food and other products we ingest, \nit regulates cosmetics, mascara, lipstick, and all sorts of products \nthat we not only ingest but that we also use on our bodies. It also \ncontrols the products your pets consume, such as cat food, dog food, \nhamsters, and whatever else; the FDA has the power to regulate that.\n  But for 50 years, the tobacco industry has successfully fought the \nability to regulate tobacco products. Yet 3,000 to 4,000 kids start \nsmoking every day in this country; 400,000 a year die, as you have \nheard from Senator Brown. It is incredible to me that for more years \nthan many want to believe or count, we have had an industry that has \ngone basically unregulated. Of course, the idea that you can put cherry \nflavors and strawberry flavors in a cigarette and use cartoon figures \nto market it, that is not aimed at the 30- and 40-year-old tobacco \nuser, it is aimed at children. One thousand of those children become \naddicted every day, and one-third that number will die prematurely from \nsmoking.\n  I will guarantee you there is not an adult smoker who wishes their \nchild would begin smoking. I guarantee you that virtually 100 percent \nof adult smokers have many wishes for their children and one is that \ntheir children never start the habit that they did. We are told by \nhealth officials, experts, that the average person who smokes and tries \nto quit, tries seven times before effectively kicking the habit. I am a \nformer smoker. Let me tell you, it is hard. I know others have not \nsmoked, and my colleague from Wyoming talks about his own family \nsmoking. He never did, but he grew up in a family that did. My mother \nsmoked cigarettes and my father smoked cigars and pipes in our house \nwith six children. Many of my siblings smoked growing up, all of whom \nhave stopped. But it is hard.\n  Today, in the name of my colleague from Massachusetts, Senator \nKennedy, who for four decades championed this, as well as Henry Waxman \nin the House, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Mike Enzi \nof Wyoming, and many others who have fought this battle, we will vote \nat 2:30. It will go through overwhelmingly, and we will go on to the \nnext matter.\n  Our leader, Harry Reid, insisted we stay on this matter. That is \nleadership. He could have easily said let's move on to another issue, \nit is taking too long--3 weeks to get it done. But because Harry Reid \nand Dick Durbin and Mike Enzi stayed with us and insisted we go through \na normal process, which is right to do in our committee, with the good \nstaff people who have worked hard on this, we are going to get this \ndone today. We might move on to the next issue then.\n  For the first time, we will make a difference by requiring that the \nFDA regulate the production, the sale, and the marketing of these \nproducts. That is history. I cannot tell you how proud I am to be \ninvolved in it, in the name of Ted Kennedy and the others who came \nbefore us, including Mike DeWine of Ohio, Tom Davis, Henry Waxman and \nmany others and the thousands of organizations that joined us in this \neffort today.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his leadership \non this issue. Just a few weeks ago, he had the legislation on credit \ncard reform.\n  I thank Senator Enzi for making this a true bipartisan effort. We \nwould not be here today without his cooperative effort.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for invoking the name of our great hero, Ted \nKennedy, who started this fight.\n  In just a few minutes, this Senate will make a historic decision, and \nI think it will make the right decision. Joe Camel will be given a life \nsentence and put away forever, and we are going to give our kids and \nfamilies across America a fighting chance for a better life.\n  This bill is historic. It has been a long time coming. I thank my \ncolleagues for all their work to make it possible.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. I have thought long and \nhard about this legislation, and after a lot of work and a few good \nimprovements, I believe this bill is the only bill we will consider \nseriously that will make it difficult for kids to get tobacco, make it \ndifficult for them to start smoking, and that is the important point.\n  I want to be clear, I still do not think there is enough in this bill \nto stop smoking. One smoker is too many. But maintaining the current \nstate of tobacco regulations is not acceptable to me.\n  One issue we have not discussed much is the cost of tobacco use to \nnonsmokers. Many smokers say it is their business what they put into \ntheir bodies. Ordinarily, they would be right.\n\n[[Page S6499]]\n\nBut when it comes to tobacco, we all pay for what smokers put into \ntheir bodies and breathe out into the air. We all bear the increased \nfinancial costs of the diminished health of smokers. When one of your \ncolleagues smokes, health insurance premiums go up for everybody. Every \nsenior who uses tobacco creates a further strain on Medicare, and since \nyou pay for that, too, through your taxes, it puts a strain on your \nwallet.\n  If smokers were the only ones who paid the price for smoking, we \nwould not be having this debate at all. But since the extra costs get \nshifted to the rest of us, it becomes our problem too. Secondhand smoke \npenalizes those who do not smoke, particularly the families of smokers. \nI hope they listen to that and realize that.\n  Unfortunately, I know a lot about this since my parents' smoking \nimpacted me. My mom, we thought, quit, but she became a closet smoker, \nwhich goes with Senator Dodd's comment that it is hard to give it up, \nand I understand how hard it is to give it up. When she quit smoking \nand was not smoking around me, my doctor told me he was glad I quit \nsmoking. I said I never did. He showed me the lung x rays he had taken \nthe year before at my athletic physical and that year at my athletic \nphysical. When they quit smoking around me, I also got over extreme hay \nfever.\n  Nearly 22 million U.S. children aged 3 to 11 are exposed to \nsecondhand smoke. Approximately 30 percent of indoor workers in the \nUnited States are not covered by smoke-free workplace policies. Those \nnumbers are just too high. We cannot keep paying that price.\n  I also have concerns about the long-term financial health of this new \ncenter at FDA. The bill gives FDA increases in funding for this program \nfor the first 10 years but leaves it flat after that. I think Congress \nwill have to revisit that issue or this program will wither on the vine \nand we will not have meaningful tobacco regulation. We cannot let that \nhappen.\n  This bill does contain three important provisions for which I fought; \nincreased fines on tobacco companies, larger color graphic warning \nlabels, and reporting to Congress on how the program is going. I would \nlike to talk about each of these for a moment.\n  We know from decades of experience that the tobacco companies are not \ninclined to follow the law. They do not have a history of being \nforthcoming with the health information in their possession. Just 2 \nweeks ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia found \nthat the tobacco companies were guilty of `` . . . a decades-long \nconspiracy to deceive the American public about the health effects and \naddictiveness of smoking cigarettes.''\n  I am pleased I was able to add a measure to the bill that increased \ncivil penalties for violations of the new law and sends a strong \nmessage that we are serious about expecting compliance from the tobacco \nindustry.\n  The new larger color graphic warning labels provision I authored will \ndo a lot to reduce smoking. Everyone from the World Health Organization \nto the Congressional Budget Office says these warnings work. Research \nshows these warnings have a big impact. One-fifth of the participants \nreported smoking less as a result of the labels. Only 1 percent \nreported smoking more.\n  We should want kids who are thinking about taking up this deadly \nhabit to have a bit of a shock just by looking at the package. We \nshould want smokers to think about these health issues each time they \nlight up. Any tool in our arsenal that makes people think twice about \ntaking up tobacco should not be an option, it should be a requirement. \nNow these labels are a requirement.\n  Finally, we now require reports on the performance of FDA's tobacco \ncenter and on the financial situation of the program. Without this \nregular reporting, Congress would have little insight into the \noperation and status of this new program. These reports play an \nimportant role in establishing the health of the programs and FDA's \nperformance in carrying out the law.\n  I want to make sure the agency is doing what it is supposed to do and \nthat the fees are paying for FDA's tobacco control activities. These \nreports will help us do just exactly that.\n  I have always stood against tobacco. The footing would have been \nbetter if changes such as my phase-out amendment to reduce tobacco use \nover 100 years was accepted. I know how addictive it is. I did not want \nto make it too short a period of time. I thought 100 years was plenty \nreasonable. We did not have a chance to debate that or look at it. I \nactually offered that a little more than a year ago. It was a new \namendment then. New amendments have trouble getting traction, except in \nNew Zealand. New Zealand liked this approach to stopping smoking and \nlooked at it in their legislature. They even called it the Enzi bill. \nOf course, you have to realize that is how it sounds and that is the \nway they spelled it, but in New Zealand, ``NZ'' stands for their \ncountry. I think they were talking about their country's bill rather \nthan something I had written. It was kind of fun to watch anyway.\n  I think we need to look at some approaches such as that idea where \nthe tobacco companies have to reduce the number of cigarettes they are \nselling each and every year or purchase a number from another company \nto make up for the increase in cigarettes they sold, which would reduce \nsmoking at least in one part and over a long period of time would \neliminate this problem.\n  This bill is just one step toward the goal I know we all share, which \nis reducing the public health toll of tobacco use. I urge my colleagues \nnot to rest on their laurels and think this bill is enough to combat \ntobacco. I intend to continue the fight against tobacco, and I ask my \ncolleagues to join me.\n\n  I thank Senator Dodd, who has been chairing this effort and working \non this bill with me, for giving us a voice and taking the bill through \nthe whole process. It was extremely important, extremely valuable. The \nfloor discussion took longer but with less debate than I anticipated. I \nknow some parliamentary issues got in the way of that. We could have \nhad more success, but there were some additional amendments that could \nnot be resolved.\n  I always ask people to do relevant or germane amendments to the \nbills. When they talk about doing other ones, it sometimes slows our \nprocess down dramatically and usually does not result in any of those \namendments happening anyway.\n  I also wish to thank all the staff who worked on this bill. They, \ntoo, have been very diligent, have looked at everything, have done \ntremendous research. I particularly thank Amy Muhlberg for her efforts \non this legislation. I think she knows the tobacco bill and other \nproposals better than probably anybody. She has real diligence and \npassion for it. I also thank Greg Dean of my staff for his efforts. He \nhas a legal mind that helps us on these issues.\n  I thank Senator Burr for his hard work during this process. Although \nhe ultimately was not successful, his efforts helped advance the debate \nand highlight some areas where improvement is needed. He put \nconsiderable time and energy into preparing a viable alternative, and I \nappreciate the way he created options.\n  Chris Wall of Senator Burr's staff was extremely helpful during the \nmarkup and floor debate, and I thank him and compliment his work with \nmy staff and others on this bill. Jeff Teitz and Ben Olinsky of Senator \nKennedy's staff, and Jim Fenton and Jeremy Sharp of Senator Dodd's \nstaff were also critical to our progress on this bill. Finally, Megan \nHauck from the Republican leader's office and the floor staff for their \nassistance.\n  I do intend to continue the fight against tobacco. I ask my \ncolleagues to join me in this fight. I thank Senator Dodd for all of \nhis efforts. There is true passion.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     Regulating tobacco warehouses\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, the bill before us grants standby \nauthority to the Secretary of Health and Human Services to regulate \n``tobacco warehouses.'' Because the bill already draws a bright line \nbetween tobacco companies that actually manufacture tobacco products \nand those, including growers and ``tobacco warehouses,'' that do not \nmanufacture, I would expect that the Secretary would utilize the \nstandby authority to regulate tobacco warehouses only under unforeseen \nand unanticipated circumstances that give rise to public health \nconcerns.\n  Mr. DODD. That is my general understanding of the provision.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank the Senator.\n\n[[Page S6500]]\n\n                          Pesticide Regulation\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs \nhas been protecting the environment, agricultural workers and the \npublic health by regulating pesticides for many years. These chemicals \nare commonly used in agriculture, including the production of tobacco \nleaf. EPA approves the use of all pesticides in the United States under \nthe authority of the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide \nAct--FIFRA. I would ask Senator Harkin if this bill would in any way \nlimit the authority of the Administrator of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to regulate pesticides under FIFRA.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I would respond to the Senator from Georgia that it is my \nunderstanding that nothing in the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act would restrict the Administrator's authority provided under \nFIFRA.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with my colleagues from the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Family Smoking Prevention and \nTobacco Control Act. Tobacco products kill approximately 400,000 people \neach year. The Food and Drug Administration, FDA, must be provided with \nthe authority to regulate deadly tobacco products, restrict \nadvertising, and further restrict access of tobacco to children.\n  The Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids estimates that almost 10 percent \nof Hawaii high school students smoke. Flavored cigarettes are one of \nthe repulsive methods used by tobacco companies to get children and \nteenagers to start smoking. In 2004, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company \ntried to exploit images of my home state of Hawaii and the name of one \nof our islands in an attempt to make smoking more attractive. One of \nthe cigarettes, which was named Kauai Kolada, was flavored with hints \nof pineapple and coconut. Another lime-flavored cigarette was featured \nin the predatory marketing campaign. It was extraordinarily offensive \nthat a manufacturer of such a deadly product would exploit and taint \nthe images and names from Hawaii in an attempt to attract young \nsmokers. This is just one example of some of the products and marketing \nused to attract young people to become smokers.\n  This legislation includes a long overdue prohibition on fruit and \ncandy flavored cigarettes. It also will permit the FDA to restrict \nadvertising, marketing, and sales practices in an attempt to further \nlimit the access of tobacco products to children. This bill will help \nprotect our children and improve the public health of our country. We \nmust prevent tobacco companies from cultivating another generation of \nsmokers so that they can increase sales and reap more profits at the \nexpense of the health and well-being of our families.\n  In order to supplement the loss in revenue from this bill, the House \nadded provisions to increase revenue through the introduction of a \nRoth-like option for Thrift Savings Plan participants. The additional \nrevenue also covered a number of annuity enhancement, correction, and \nequity provisions for Federal employees. The Lieberman amendment \nincluded these provisions as well as the Non-Foreign Area Retirement \nEquity Assurance Act, to provide Federal employees in Alaska, Hawaii, \nand the territories locality pay. I strongly supported the Lieberman \namendment and all the Federal employee annuitant provisions, and I am \nvery disappointed that a lack of cooperation for this bipartisan \namendment led to its defeat. I am hopeful that we will be able to \naddress these critical issues to Federal employees very soon.\n  I appreciate all of the work done on this important issue by my \nfriend from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, and my friends from \nConnecticut, Senators Dodd and Lieberman. I look forward to the \nenactment of this vital legislation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is moving once \nagain to pass legislation to regulate tobacco products in the United \nStates. Senator Kennedy's lifetime efforts to improve the public's \nhealth are exemplified in his fight to pass the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act. Despite many setbacks, Senator \nKennedy has worked tirelessly to pass this legislation and I am proud \nto join him again as a cosponsor of this bill. This legislation is long \noverdue and I look forward to it being signed into law.\n  The health risks associated with smoking are undisputed and cost \nhundreds of thousands of Americans their lives every year. Tobacco \nproducts will kill one out of three long-term smokers, leading to over \n400,000 deaths per year. The Surgeon General has determined that \nsmoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious illnesses. \nDeaths from tobacco products exceed deaths from HIV/AIDS, illegal drug \nuse, alcohol use, car accidents, suicides, and murders combined.\n  Despite the dangers of smoking, we have seen that children have the \ngreatest risk of becoming addicted to tobacco. Each day more than 3,500 \nchildren will try a cigarette for the first time and 1000 of those kids \nwill become regular smokers. Among adult smokers, 90 percent started \nsmoking as children and teens under the age of 18. In my home State of \nVermont, more than 18 percent of high school students smoke. According \nto the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, 12,000 children in Vermont will \nultimately die from smoking if smoking rates remain unchanged.\n  These statistics are horrifying but perhaps not surprising given the \nhistoric lack of regulation of the tobacco industry. At a congressional \nhearing as late as 1994, tobacco industry chairmen and CEOs testified \nthat nicotine is not addictive, even though decades of evidence showed \notherwise. In fact, the tobacco industry has increased the nicotine \nlevels in cigarettes by more than 11 percent from 1998 to 2005, \nincreasing the risk of cigarette addiction. If enhanced nicotine levels \nin cigarettes is not enough to convince us that the tobacco industry \nshould be regulated, a new study released this spring showed that \nchanges the tobacco industry has made to cigarette design over the \nyears has increased the risk of lung cancer for those who smoke.\n  In addition to making their products more potent and addictive, study \nafter study has shown how the tobacco industry continues to \nsuccessfully target advertising to minors to get them hooked for life \non smoking. Each year, the tobacco industry spends over $13 billion in \nadvertising--that is $36 million every day. Studies have showed that \nchildren are three times more sensitive to tobacco advertising than \nadults and are more likely to be influenced to start smoking by \ncigarette marketing than by peer pressure.\n  This bill addresses these shameful business practices by giving the \nUnited States Food and Drug Administration the authority for the first \ntime to regulate the sale, distribution, and advertising of cigarettes \nand smokeless tobacco. It will require manufacturers to better disclose \nthe contents and consequences of their products in new, stronger \nwarning labels on packages. It will also prohibit cigarette companies \nfrom labeling their brands as reduced risk ``lite'' or ``ultra-lite'' \nunless the government can certify that those claims are true. The very \npurpose of the Food and Drug Administration is to protect the interests \nand safety of consumers and this legislation will finally allow the FDA \nto hold the tobacco industry accountable for their products.\n  A recent ruling by the District of Columbia Circuit Court highlights \nthe need for serious regulation of the tobacco industry. The DC Appeals \nCourt confirmed the district court's ruling, which found that the \ntobacco industry had for decades engaged in deceptive marketing tactics \nto conceal the negative health impacts of smoking. The ruling confirmed \nthat tobacco companies had not changed the way their products were \nmarketed in response to the Master Settlement Agreement, and instead \nthe industry has more than doubled spending on marketing campaigns that \nincluded spurious claims of ``healthier'' cigarettes that are ``light'' \nor ``low-tar.'' The ruling did not, however, require that the tobacco \nindustry surrender profits that resulted in the misleading advertising \nor stop the industry from adding flavors to make products more \nappealing to kids or to manipulate nicotine levels to increase \naddictiveness and harm. The tobacco industry must be regulated to \ncreate transparency in the contents of tobacco products and to help \nstop hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths each year.\n  For far too long, the tobacco industry has been given free rein to \nmislead\n\n[[Page S6501]]\n\nthe public and encourage children and teens to take up smoking. The \npassage of this bill will give the FDA the authority it needs to \neffectively protect children from smoking and improve consumer \nawareness of tobacco industry practices, which will in turn save \nAmerican lives. I urge all Senators to support passage of the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. We are getting close \nto the time of the vote. I would be remiss if I did not also mention \nour staff. I often say in a time such as this, Senators get the \nopportunity to stand at a podium and be heard, but there are literally \ndozens of people whose names most Americans will never know who make \nthese moments happen. They deserve public recognition because they \nworked tirelessly, late nights, weekends, around the clock negotiating, \nworking with each other trying to iron out provisions of the bill.\n  On Senator Kennedy's staff: Jeff Teitz, Michael Myers, Ben Olinsky, \nTerri Roney, Shawn Daugherty, and Portia Wu. Some are in the Chamber. I \nthank them immensely on behalf of Senator Kennedy.\n  Senator Durbin's staff: Tom Falletti and Sara Singleton have been \nterrific in this effort. We thank Tom and Sara for their work.\n  Senator Enzi's staff: Greg Dean and Amy Muhlberg. We thank them \nimmensely. They worked hard on this bill.\n  Finally I want to thank Jim Fenton from my office, Rachael Holt, \nJeremy Sharp, who is sitting next to me, and Monica Feit. I have gotten \na lot of help in this effort, with Senator Kennedy's staff and Senator \nEnzi's staff.\n  There are members of the majority leader's staff who deserve our \nthanks as well. We always have to thank Lula, Tim, and others who make \nit all possible. We thank them all very much for what they do.\n  Again, as Senator Durbin said, and Senator Enzi and others have said, \nthis is a historic moment for our Chamber to be able to do something. \nFifty years ago the Surgeon General warned us of tobacco use, and a \nhalf century later we are about to insist the agency in charge of food, \ndrugs, cosmetics, and pet food also be able to include tobacco. We are \nabout to do that.\n  The House and Senate bills are similar, and I believe we will have a \nPresidential signature on this legislation very quickly.\n  On behalf of millions of families across this country and as the \nfather of a 4-year-old and a 7-year-old who do not know anything about \ntobacco yet, and whose mother does not smoke, never did, and a father \nwho did but stopped, on behalf of my children and millions of children \naround this country, we are told by the Congressional Budget Office \nthat an 11-percent reduction in youth smoking can happen immediately \nwith the passage of this bill. That may not seem like much, but it is a \nbeginning. We may just reach the goal of my colleague from Wyoming of a \n100-percent reduction of young people smoking. My hope is that \ncertainly will be the case.\n  Mr. President, with a little bit of time remaining, I am prepared to \nyield back the time, and at the appropriate moment, I will ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Wyoming has 3 minutes 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the bill having been read the third time, \nthe question is, Shall the bill, as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Missouri (Mr. Bond) \nwould have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 79, nays 17, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 207 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--79\n\n     Akaka\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Harkin\n     Hutchison\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--17\n\n     Alexander\n     Bennett\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Graham\n     Hagan\n     Hatch\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     McConnell\n     Roberts\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Bond\n     Byrd\n     Kennedy\n  The bill (H.R. 1256), as amended, was passed, as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1256\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 1256) entitled ``An Act to protect the public health by \n     providing the Food and Drug Administration with certain \n     authority to regulate tobacco products, to amend title 5, \n     United States Code, to make certain modifications in the \n     Thrift Savings Plan, the Civil Service Retirement System, and \n     the Federal Employees' Retirement System, and for other \n     purposes.'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     DIVISION A--FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n\n[[Page S6502]]\n\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year, and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco-induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products, and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by youth. Past \n     efforts to oversee these activities have not been successful \n     in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2005, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than \n     $13,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than \n     adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily \n     marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and \n     older, smoke these same brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the first amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration, and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution of, including access \n     to and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this division.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion play a crucial role in the decision \n     of these minors to begin using tobacco products. Less \n     restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not and \n     will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed by \n     such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes, and such products may \n     actually increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in ensuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be reviewed in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support claims be fully verified.\n       (44) The Food and Drug Administration is a regulatory \n     agency with the scientific expertise to identify harmful \n     substances in products to which consumers are exposed, to \n     design standards to limit exposure to those substances, to \n     evaluate scientific studies supporting claims about the \n     safety of products, and to evaluate the impact of labels, \n     labeling, and advertising on consumer behavior in order to \n     reduce the risk of harm and promote understanding of the \n     impact of the product on health. In connection\n\n[[Page S6503]]\n\n     with its mandate to promote health and reduce the risk of \n     harm, the Food and Drug Administration routinely makes \n     decisions about whether and how products may be marketed in \n     the United States.\n       (45) The Federal Trade Commission was created to protect \n     consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and to \n     regulate unfair methods of competition. Its focus is on those \n     marketplace practices that deceive or mislead consumers, and \n     those that give some competitors an unfair advantage. Its \n     mission is to regulate activities in the marketplace. Neither \n     the Federal Trade Commission nor any other Federal agency \n     except the Food and Drug Administration possesses the \n     scientific expertise needed to implement effectively all \n     provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \n     Control Act.\n       (46) If manufacturers state or imply in communications \n     directed to consumers through the media or through a label, \n     labeling, or advertising, that a tobacco product is approved \n     or inspected by the Food and Drug Administration or complies \n     with Food and Drug Administration standards, consumers are \n     likely to be confused and misled. Depending upon the \n     particular language used and its context, such a statement \n     could result in consumers being misled into believing that \n     the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration \n     for use or in consumers being misled about the harmfulness of \n     the product because of such regulation, inspection, approval, \n     or compliance.\n       (47) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies \n     continue to target and market to youth. USA v. Philip Morris, \n     USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, \n     2006).\n       (48) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies \n     dramatically increased their advertising and promotional \n     spending in ways that encourage youth to start smoking \n     subsequent to the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement \n     in 1998. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil \n     Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).\n       (49) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies have \n     designed their cigarettes to precisely control nicotine \n     delivery levels and provide doses of nicotine sufficient to \n     create and sustain addiction while also concealing much of \n     their nicotine-related research.

So the day we get back \nthere will be a Monday morning vote. We have a tremendous amount of \nwork to do. We not only have health care, which is going to take so \nmuch of our time, but we are in the appropriations process. The House \nis going to pass all their appropriations bills by the end of the July \nrecess. I don't know if we can meet that schedule--it is somewhat \ndoubtful--but we are going to pass some bills.

Mr. President, I want to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the importance and challenge of health care reform, something \nthat is on the fast track in the Senate.\n  Recently, as I traveled my State of 24 million people, I heard many \nsimilar themes from my constituents. What they told me is that our top \npriority ought to be reducing the cost of health care because, of \ncourse, by reducing the cost it becomes more affordable by more people \nand we attack what is one of the other principal concerns, and \ncertainly one of mine, and that is too many people who are uninsured in \nthis country.\n  We know cost is one reason why 46 million people are not insured in \nthis country, some of whom have good jobs that pay well, but if they \nare young they would rather put the money in their pocket than pay for \nhealth care. Others have different circumstances, maybe small \nbusinesses that are priced out of the market.\n  It is a fact that American families have seen their health care \npremiums double over the last 10 years. My constituents and the \nAmerican people generally are also very concerned about our future. As \nthey see so much borrowing and so much spending here in Washington, \nthey worry about the fact that Medicare, which is the health care \nprogram for seniors, has an unfunded liability of $38 trillion. So, to \nunderstand, while we have roughly $2 trillion in annual deficits \nrunning, we also have $38 trillion in unfunded Federal liabilities for \nMedicare and the trust\n\n[[Page S6524]]\n\nfund is anticipated to go insolvent by the year 2017, less than 8 years \nfrom now.\n  I appreciate the urgency of focusing on health care reform. We have \nbeen working under Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley on the \nFinance Committee. I know other Senators have been working hard at this \nas well--Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi on the HELP Committee.\n  I urge us to keep working very hard to work through all the \ncomplexities and moving parts of this very challenging problem. I also \nwant to say that I think how we discuss health care reform is very \nimportant, but I am also concerned that some voices are greeted with \nderision or even implicit threats that suggest they better keep quiet \nif they know what is good for them.\n  A tremendous amount of work has gone into the series of three Finance \nCommittee roundtables and walk-throughs. But I am disturbed by some \nreports that perhaps Senators, certainly staff, have urged key \nstakeholders in the health care reform debate to keep their mouths \nshut. Every American citizen has a right to petition their government. \nThis is a right every American citizen has, and no American should be \ntold to keep quiet on the subject of health care reform, in particular. \nWe know reforming health care is an urgent priority, as I said, and \nmore than 300 million Americans have a stake in our success.\n  The Congress needs to take the time given the fact that this \nrepresents 17 percent of our gross domestic product and is so complex. \nWe need to take the time and get the input from everyone who has \nsomething to offer as we undertake this massive task. We have a highly \ncomplex, $2.6 trillion system, and we need to take time to get the \nreforms done right. I am not talking about peddling in place, I am not \ntalking about wasting time, I am talking about doing what the American \npeople expect us to do; that is, get it right, not try to rush \naccording to some arbitrary timetable.\n  So I am pleased to say that some stakeholders are standing up against \nthis notion that this deal ought to be cut in a closed back room \nsomewhere. The American Medical Association, for example, has announced \nits opposition to a government-run plan. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nand the National Federation Of Independent Businesses have expressed \nconcerns about some aspects of the legislation that has been proposed \nby the President and by leadership here in Congress. But more voices, \nnot less--indeed all voices--deserve to be heard on something of such \nfundamental importance to our country. The American people deserve a \ntransparent and open debate about the reforms, the various proposals \nthat are on the table, so they can judge for themselves whether \nWashington elites have their best interest in mind or, to the contrary, \nwhether they believe something else is going on.\n  I also express my appreciation for the professionals at the \nCongressional Budget Office for refusing to compromise their integrity \nand for continuing to provide objective analysis of all reform \nproposals. That is their job. Their job is not to make policy, but it \nis their job to give us unvarnished, objective information about costs \nso we can determine what policy makes sense and what policies we can \nafford.\n  In particular, I commend the Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, Dr. Doug Elmendorf, who I read was quoted as saying that the \nCongressional Budget Office ``will never adjust our views to make \npeople happy.'' That demonstrates the kind of integrity and objectivity \nwe would want to inform our decisions. We are the ones who are elected \nto make those decisions on the part of the American people. We are the \nones who should be held accountable for those policies. But we have to \nget good, objective, unbiased information from professionals with \nintegrity such as Dr. Elmendorf and his staff at the CBO.\n  Some, it has been suggested, do not like the big price tag the \nCongressional Budget Office has put on some of their proposals. But the \nsolution is not for the Congressional Budget Office to get creative, it \nis for Senators to get real and deal with the reality and to use that \ninformation in order to craft decisions that work.\n  I wish to speak in particular about the only bill that has actually \nbeen rolled out, more or less, or provisions, and that is the bill \nproffered by our colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  Senator Kennedy has been a leader in the health care reform debate \nfor more than four decades. I appreciate the fact that he is the first \nDemocrat on either end of Pennsylvania Avenue who has actually put out \na proposal with some detail for us to evaluate and react to. While more \ndetails are certainly needed, and I hope they will be forthcoming, we \nalready know there are some red lines, some hot spots, some areas that, \nif embraced by the Democratic leadership, will result in failure, not \nin success. I think we all should be invested in the goal of bipartisan \nsuccess. In fact, there are some provisions in the Kennedy bill that \nwould make things worse, in my view and in the view of others.\n  I think there is one thing we should do; that is, take the \nHippocratic Oath, the same oath medical practitioners take to ``do no \nharm.'' I think we should take a legislative Hippocratic Oath to first \ndo no harm as we undertake this massive reform. For example, in the \nKennedy bill, it describes a plan called ``a public health insurance \nplan operated by the Federal Government with a payment scale that is \nset in statute and based on Medicare.'' I believe ``Medicare for all'' \nor a government-run health plan is a disaster in the making for the \nmillions of Americans who will depend upon us to get this right. Let me \nexplain why.\n  First, a government-run plan will ultimately take away the health \ninsurance people have right now. Last year, President Obama campaigned \non the promise that if you like what you have, you will be able to keep \nit. I agree with him. That ought to be our goal. But with a so-called \ngovernment plan, that will not happen because we all know that the \ngovernment is not just the regulator, but it is also the one paying the \nbills; that ultimately, the government cannot be calling the balls and \nstrikes even as it takes to the field to be a so-called competitor.\n  Let me put a finer point on it. One group of analysts, the Lewin \nGroup, said a government plan would take away, ultimately, current \nhealth benefits from 119 million Americans and force 130 million into a \nWashington-run health care plan. How does that happen? Well, ostensibly \nyou would have the government competing with the private sector to \nprovide health care. But we know the government ultimately would \nprovide a more generous package and could do so, of course, at taxpayer \nexpense and save the difficulty of having to compete in the \nmarketplace. Ultimately, as the Lewin Group concluded, it would \nundercut private competitors, leaving people with no choices and \nultimately leaving everyone, or at least 130 million Americans, on a \nWashington-run health care plan--not a good idea, in my opinion.\n  Secondly, we know a government plan would drive up costs for those \nwho remain with private insurance. How does that happen? Well, we know \nthere is a phenomenon in health care called cost shifting. That is \nbecause Medicare and Medicaid pay submarket rates and health care \nproviders have to make it up somewhere else. Where do they make it up? \nThey end up making it up from people who have insurance. And how do \nthey do that? By people who have insurance paying more than they \nultimately receive because the costs are literally shifted from \nMedicare and Medicaid onto private insurance.\n  According to a respected actuary, Milliman, commercial payers \nsubsidize the cost of Medicare and Medicaid by nearly $90 billion a \nyear in cost shifting. This represents a hidden tax on American \nfamilies and small businesses. Milliman estimates that the average \nprivate health care premium is more than $1,500 higher per family, more \nthan 10 percent higher than it would be without this government cost-\nshifting phenomenon. A new government program would increase this cost \nshifting dramatically and increase the health care premiums of every \nAmerican family who continues on their private health insurance plan.\n  Third, we know this Medicare-for-all or government-run plan would \nbasically be like Medicare and Medicaid on steroids. Lest anybody be \nconfused, that is not a good thing. I believe Medicare illustrates what \nhappens when the government takes over health care delivery. For \nexample, first of all, it is\n\n[[Page S6525]]\n\nnot fiscally sustainable. As I mentioned, Medicare is going to go \ninsolvent in 2017 and currently has $38 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities.\n  Low reimbursement rates--and frankly, that is how Medicare and \nMedicaid try to deal with costs. They cut payments to providers--\nhospitals and doctors--below the otherwise market rates. These low \nreimbursement rates reduce patient choice and increase wait times for \nthe physicians they see. Many providers, as I am sure the distinguished \noccupant of the chair, in his State, knows--we know many doctors are \nnot even taking new Medicare patients and new Medicaid patients because \nlower reimbursement rates are the problem. Every year, Congress has to \ncome back and reverse the cuts to physician payments under the Medicare \nsustainable growth rate formula, and those cuts, unless we act to \nreverse them, will cut physician payments by 20 percent this January.\n\n  According to the Washington Post last fall, taxpayers also pay up to \n$60 billion a year in fraudulent claims on Medicare. So in addition to \nbeing fiscally unsustainable, in addition to rationing or providing \nunrealistically low payments, denying people access to health care, we \nhave $60 billion in fraud and waste in the Medicare Program--hardly a \nmodel for Medicare, for a government-run option.\n  Well, Medicaid has even more problems. Medicaid provides coverage, \nbut it does a poor job of providing access. In one way, this is really \na ruse that is being perpetrated on the American people under Medicare \nand Medicaid. We say: Yes, you have coverage. But if you cannot find a \ndoctor or a health care provider who will provide you access at that \nprice, then their coverage does not do you any good.\n  According to a recent Wall Street Journal article, Medicaid's low \nreimbursement rates, which are actually lower than Medicare, have \nresulted in 40 percent of physicians restricting access to patients in \nthe program. So it is no wonder, as the journal Health Affairs said \nlast month, that ``physicians typically have been less willing to take \non new Medicaid patients than patients covered by other types of health \ninsurance.''\n  Medicaid reimbursement rates, as I said, are even lower than \nMedicare, more than 25 percent lower than Medicare. The story of \nPediatrix Medical Group, which has a significant presence in my State, \nillustrates the problem.\n  Pediatrix has more than 1,300 physicians and 500 advanced practice \nnurses. They specialize in the care of newborns and other very \nvulnerable children. Pediatrix has noted that ``the lack of appropriate \nreimbursement is among the common reasons for physicians to refuse to \naccept new Medicaid patients.'' They have noted that within their own \nnational neonatal and hospitalist patient population, the current \ngovernment rates pay an average of 28.7 percent less than rates from \nprivate insurers. No wonder it is hard for Medicaid beneficiaries--\nnotwithstanding what Congress does, it is hard for them to find a \nphysician who will actually see them at that kind of rate.\n  Pediatrix has said, ``We believe a public plan structured [after \nMedicare and Medicaid] would ultimately erode the availability of \nprivate health and negatively impact patient access to needed health \ncare.''\n  The fourth problem I have with the plan in the Kennedy bill is that \nthe government plan would ultimately lead to a rationing of health \ncare. What does that mean? Well, that means delay or denying access to \ntreatment. All we have to do is look at Canada.\n  A recent op-ed by Dr. David Gratzer in the Wall Street Journal this \nlast week talked about what a government-run plan in Canada has done. \nThousands of our friends to the north, of course, come to America each \nyear for lifesaving surgery, if they can afford it, after their \ngovernment has told them they will just have to wait. Various studies \nindicate that Canadians, especially the poor, are less healthy under \nsocialized medicine than those in our country. More and more Canadians \nwant to reduce the role of government and expand private options for \nhealth care, even as the elites in Washington want to move America in \nthe opposite direction.\n  The fifth reason a government plan is not a good idea is it would \nlead to poorer health outcomes. Many Canadians are realizing that \nsocialized medicine is not working for them, and so are many folks in \nEurope. According to a piece in the Washington Examiner this week, \nbreast cancer rates in Europe, under nationalized health care systems, \nare significantly higher than they are here in the United States. \nEuropean women are much more likely to have breast cancer than are \nAmerican women. Currently, the United States leads the world in \ntreating breast cancer. Women in our country with breast cancer have a \n14-percent better chance of survival than those in Europe. Compared to \nthe United States, breast cancer mortality is 52 percent higher in \nGermany and 88 percent higher in the United Kingdom. This is not \nsomething we should want to emulate.\n  We also see some poor health care outcomes in the United States under \ngovernment-run health care. For example, numerous studies have \ndocumented the poor patient outcomes under the Medicaid Program \nrelative to patients in private plans. For example, Medicaid patients \nare more than 50 percent more likely to die of coronary bypass surgery \nthan patients with private coverage or Medicare.\n  There are other problems with the bill that the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts has proposed. Again, I credit him with being the \nfirst one to lay out a plan. We have not yet seen one from any other \nsource. But the fact is, the Kennedy bill is not paid for. We don't \nknow how much additional borrowing or how much higher our taxes will \nhave to go up in order to pay the price. It also includes a concept \nknown as pay or play for small businesses. In other words, if you don't \nhave health care coverage for your employees and are a small business, \nyou will have to pay a punitive tax.\n  The bill also provides very generous Federal subsidies to individuals \nmaking as much as $110,000 a year. We are all for a safety net for \npeople who are low income and can't otherwise provide for themselves. \nBut why should taxpayers be forced to pay higher taxes to subsidize \nhealth care for people making over $100,000 a year. It doesn't make \nsense.\n  The bill also includes an innocuous-sounding council called the \nMedical Advisory Council, which in effect would give the government \npower over personal health care decisions, particularly to unelected \nand unaccountable bureaucrats. Of course, the bill creates new \nentitlements, which we have no hope of paying for, at the same time \nwhen unfunded liabilities for so much of our entitlement programs \nremain unpaid for. Frankly, while I applaud the distinguished Senator \nfrom Massachusetts and his leadership on this issue, I worry that this \nis a bill that has no bipartisan input. I applaud Senator Baucus, \nchairman of the Finance Committee, and other Democrats on that \ncommittee who said we need to come up with a bipartisan solution. When \nI raised this concern this morning in the Finance Committee, the \nKennedy bill was described as more of a wish list than anything else.\n  The bill reflects very few ideas from Republicans, which we have \noffered to discuss and would hope to include in any comprehensive \nhealth care reform. It includes several provisions which\n\n[[Page S6526]]\n\nRepublicans have made clear are off the table, if our colleagues want a \ntruly bipartisan bill. I mentioned the government plan option which \nkills bipartisanship because Republicans cannot support a policy that \nwill lead to a Washington takeover of our health care system. There are \nbetter alternatives, alternatives which empower individuals and \npreserve the individual choice each of us has to make health care \ndecisions, in consultation with our physician or family doctor, in the \nbest interest of our families. Empowering people rather than government \nis a much better solution than this proposal we see under the Kennedy \nbill.\n  Innovators in both government and the private sector have learned \nthat by empowering patients and providing them some incentives, they \ncan actually see costs lowered.\n  There are a lot of good ideas out there. Unfortunately, the partisan \nproposal we have from the HELP Committee is not one of them. We hope we \ncan continue to work together, on a bipartisan basis, toward a \nsuccessful outcome.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation described by my colleague, \nthe Travel Promotion Act, is legislation I wish to discuss. The Travel \nPromotion Act is a bipartisan piece of legislation I have introduced \nwith Senators Ensign, Inouye, Martinez, Klobuchar, Reid, and many \nothers. I believe in the last session of Congress, when we introduced \nthis, we had over 50 cosponsors. Let me describe what its purpose is.\n  Who can be against travel promotion? Here is what has happened to our \ncountry with respect to the jobs and economic growth that comes with a \ndecline in foreigners traveling to the United States. Measures put in \nplace quickly after the 2001 attack on 9/11 had a significant impact on \ntravel to the United States by foreign travelers.\n  We, obviously, wanted to be careful about whom we allowed into our \ncountry. We still do. But what happened following that is, instead of \nreaching out to the world to say: Visit the United States, this is a \ngreat place, we encourage you to come here, to vacation here, to see \nwhat the United States is all about, we backed away from that. Other \ncountries have not. Here is what we have experienced. I have a chart \nhere showing overseas travel between 2000 and 2008.\n  Since 2000 and 2008, there has been a 3-percent decrease in foreign \nvisitors to the United States. At the same time, there has been a 40-\npercent increase in visitors to other countries around the world. Think \nof the consequences of that to our economy. A foreign visitor, overseas \nvisitor, coming to our country spends on average $4,500 per visit--that \nis a lot of economic activity, a lot of economic growth and jobs. But \ninbound travel has decreased in our country and substantially increased \nin others. Why is that the case?\n  The rest of the world is very anxious to attract destination visitors \nto their country, international travelers, to say: We want you to come \nto our country as a destination for your trip. Take India--one special \nreason to visit India is this advertisement saying:\n\n       ``Incredible India, any time is a good time to visit the \n     land of Taj, but there is no time like now.''\n\n  Not unusual to see this. It is not only India.\n\n       Australia's says: ``Arrived looking for an experience to \n     remember. Departed with adventure we will never forget. \n     Australia, come to Australia.'' If you are an overseas \n     traveler, deciding where to visit, be sure and come to \n     Australia.\n       Ireland says: ``Go where Ireland takes you.''\n\n  Pretty straightforward--makes you want to go to Ireland. Great \nBritain, Italy, Spain, France, Australia, India, Ireland, they say: \nCome to our country. Travel to our country. See what our country is \nabout.\n  We are not doing that.\n  As a result, in the last 8 years, we have seen a 3-percent decrease \nin travel by foreign visitors to the United States, while the rest of \nthe world has had a 40-percent increase in travelers destined to those \nother areas. It makes a big difference. It is very negative in terms of \nour country's economic opportunity that comes from travel and tourism.\n  I showed the examples of what other countries are saying in their \nvery explicit campaigns around the world, to say to people: If you are \ntraveling abroad, if you are planning a vacation, a trip, come to our \ncountry. Come and see Italy, Great Britain, Ireland, India.\n  Let me show you what is happening with respect to our country. \nHeadlines such as these: The Sydney Sunday Morning Herald: ``Coming to \nAmerica Isn't Easy.'' From The Guardian: ``America: More Hassle Than \nIt's Worth?'' From The Sunday Times in London: ``Travel to America? No \nThanks.''\n  There is a perception that it is difficult to come to our country, \nhard to get a visa, and tourists will experience long waiting lines. \nMany of these problems have been corrected or improved. In the \nconstruction of this legislation, we address the need to better \ncommunicate our entry and exit procedures and their improvements. We \ndon't want these negative headlines to be the message to the rest of \nthe world--in fact, quite the opposite.\n  What a large group of us in the Congress want is for our country to \nbe engaged internationally, to say to people around the world: Come to \nour country. To see the United States is to understand the wonder of \nthis great country. Come here. Stay here. Vacation here. Understand \nwhat America is about.\n  I can't think of anything better, in terms of our position in the \nworld and how people think of this great country, than to invite them \nand encourage them to come here. That is why we have introduced this \nbipartisan piece of legislation called the Travel Promotion Act of \n2009.\n  Interestingly enough, the Congressional Budget Office has said this \npiece of legislation will reduce the Federal budget deficit by $425 \nmillion between 2010 and 2019. We don't bring many pieces of \nlegislation to the floor of the Senate in which the Congressional \nBudget Office says:\n  This will make money. This is a net positive. This will reduce the \nFederal budget deficit. That is what this bill is about.\n  Let me explain, for a moment, what we are trying to do with the \nlegislation. The Travel Promotion Act will attempt to create \ninternational travel opportunities for people from all around the world \nto come to this country. It will set up a nationally coordinated travel \npromotion campaign run in a public-private partnership to communicate \nto the world our country's travel policies and, more importantly, \ncommunicate to the world: We want you here. We want you to explore what \nthis great country has to offer. This public-private partnership is an \nideal\n\n[[Page S6527]]\n\nmethod for us to improve any negative perceptions out there, \nparticularly as we work on visas and any remaining delays in entry \nprocedures which we have corrected, in large part. This combines public \nsector accountability with private sector enterprise.\n  This bill establishes a Corporation for Travel Promotion, an \nindependent, nonprofit corporation, with an 11-member board of \ndirectors appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. It creates an Office \nof Travel Promotion in the Department of Commerce to work with that \nnonprofit corporation. It sets up a travel promotion fund, financed by \na public-private matching program. Federal contributions will be \nfinanced by a $10 fee paid by foreign travelers from visa waiver \ncountries and collected in what is called the Electronic System for \nTravel Authorization.\n  Many other countries impose fees for people coming and going: \nAustralia, $37 departure fee, an entry fee of $19 to $70; Mexico, an \n$11 departure fee, up to $38; New Zealand, $16 to $19 on the departure \nfee; United Kingdom, $80 to $160. There are a lot of fees around for \npeople traveling internationally. We propose to fund this with a very \nmodest fee of $10.\n  This is very simple. It should be noncontroversial. There are many of \nus who have worked on this and worked very hard.\n  My colleague from Minnesota is here, Senator Klobuchar, who has \nworked with us on this legislation. This is a piece of legislation \nSenator Reid has worked on. Senator Ensign is the lead Republican \ncosponsor. Other cosponsors include Senator Martinez and Senator Nelson \nof Florida. We have cosponsors across the political spectrum because \nthis issue of asking people from around the world to come to America is \nnot controversial and benefits every State. It cannot possibly be \npartisan, and it certainly is job creating.\n\n  Now here is what some newspapers around the country have said about \nthe legislation.\n  The Sacramento Bee:\n\n       This country needs to reclaim its status as a global magnet \n     for visitors . . . and Congress can help by passing the \n     Travel Promotion Act.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Considering that the U.S. spends hundreds of millions of \n     dollars on public diplomacy with dubious results and nearly \n     nothing on promoting tourism, we might do well to invest a \n     little money in wooing travelers.\n\n  The Detroit Free Press:\n\n       Doesn't it make sense to encourage--at no cost to \n     taxpayers--foreign visitors to come here and leave us some \n     money? There's no good reason not to pass this bill.\n\n  The Dallas Morning News:\n\n       The Travel Promotion Act is a sensible first step toward \n     putting the welcome mat back on America's doorstep.\n\n  And the list goes on.\n  I do not come from Hawaii or Florida or California, I come from the \nnorthern Great Plains. And we have a lot of tourist destinations: the \nBadlands in North Dakota, some of the most beautiful areas in our \ncountry. Tourism is North Dakota's second largest industry. There are \nso many destinations with such wonder to attract people to our region \nof the country.\n  It is where Lewis and Clark, in their epic adventure, decided to \nspend the winter in area about 40 miles north of Bismarck, ND. We \ncelebrated the 200th anniversary, the bicentennial, of the Lewis and \nClark Expedition, and we had a lot of people come from around the world \nto see that.\n  The fact is, every State in this country has something it is anxious \nto show the world, to say: Look at us. Look at what we are doing here. \nLook how beautiful this part of America is.\n  So what has happened is, we have been unilaterally disarmed since 9/\n11, to say: Well, we are worried about who is going to come into this \ncountry. We certainly want to keep terrorists out. We sure do, \nabsolutely. But that message ought not be mixed with a message that we \ndo not want to encourage foreign travelers to come to this country to \nvacation and to experience America.\n  So at long last a group of us, Republicans and Democrats, have said: \nIf we disagree on so much, how about if we agree on tourism? Can we \nagree on promoting travel? To say to the English, the Italians, the \nSpaniards, the French, the folks from India and Thailand and China and \nelsewhere: You are welcome in this country. We want you to come to this \ncountry. We want you to see what our country is about?\n  To experience this country is to have a sense of wonder about the \ngreatest democracy, the most significant and longest surviving \ndemocracy on Earth. We want them to go home with that understanding of \nwhat a great country this is. That is what we want.\n  By the way, we do not believe our nearest neighbors--Mexico and \nCanada--are irrelevant. We have a lot of people coming from Mexico and \nCanada, and God bless them. They are great neighbors. We welcome them. \nWe are told they spend, on average, about $900 per trip.\n  The foreign travelers from overseas, by contrast, spend about $4,500 \nper trip. That is why this is such an unbelievable job generator. \nPeople who come here and spend significant money and purchase the hotel \nrooms and the rental cars and go to the tourist attractions and do the \nthings people who want to experience America routinely do not only \ncreate a lot of jobs and boost economic activity, but their travel also \ngives us the opportunity to show the rest of the world this is an \nextraordinary place where they can go home and tell their neighbors \nthey just went to one of the greatest places on Earth.\n  So as to the Travel Promotion Act of 2009, my hope is--after having \nbattled here on so many different issues, and having cloture votes on \neverything, and then 30 hours post-cloture while we all stand around \nwith our hands in our pockets and shuffling our shoes--my hope is, \nperhaps this is the issue, this is the one time, this is the occasion \nwhere everybody might say: Do you know something. There is something we \ncan agree on that is noncontroversial, that makes sense. It creates \njobs, it expands the economy, and represents the best of sending \nAmerican values abroad; and that is, the Travel Promotion Act.\n  If, perhaps, next week we get to that point, I think the American \npeople will have believed we have done something good. So I am pleased \nto be the lead sponsor. We introduced this in the last Congress and did \nnot get it passed. In this Congress I believe we will.\n  I give my commendation to the majority leader and thank him for \nputting this on the agenda. I give my thanks to Senator Ensign as the \nlead cosponsor on the Republican side. But so many Republicans and \nDemocrats have said: Yes, this makes sense. Count us in. We want to be \npart of expanding this economy and creating jobs and giving an \nopportunity for the people in the rest of the world to understand we \nwelcome them here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am here today to speak in support of \nthe Travel Promotion Act, which is bipartisan legislation. I first want \nto thank Mr. Dorgan, the Senator from North Dakota. I have visited the \nTeddy Roosevelt Park, and I want to thank him for his great leadership \non this bill over many years. I also want to thank Senator Ensign for \nhis leadership. I believe this legislation will help our economy to do \nbetter, to create jobs without any taxpayer expense.\n  As the chair of the Commerce Subcommittee that includes tourism, I \nrecently held a hearing--a well-attended hearing--with many Senators \nand people there to examine the state of our tourism industry during \nthese troubled economic times. I want to thank my ranking Republican \nmember, Senator Martinez. We did it together. I also held a field \nhearing in Duluth, MN, to highlight the importance of tourism to \nmidsize and smaller towns in the United States.\n  During the hearings, we heard about the importance of tourism and \ntravel to our economy and the urgent need to increase international \ntravel to the United States.\n  As the Presiding Officer, Senator Udall, knows, coming from Colorado, \nAmerica has so much to offer our travelers: whether it is the mountains \nof Colorado or--Senator Kaufman is here--the beaches of Delaware or the \nstunning national landmarks, such as the Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, \nand the Statue of Liberty or the oceans, lakes, and rivers or our \nmountains, forests, and beaches or our scenic country towns or the \nbright lights of the big cities or centers of fun and\n\n[[Page S6528]]\n\nentertainment such as Las Vegas or Disney World or Duluth.\n  From the heartland to the coasts, every State has an economic stake \nin the tourism industry, which is now a major part of the American \neconomy. Throughout the United States, many communities have discovered \nand developed the economic potential of travel and tourism.\n  I keep using the example of Duluth because at some point in the \n1970s, the economy was so bad there they actually had a billboard, so \nwhen you drove out of town, it said: The last one to leave, please turn \noff the lights.\n  Well, that billboard is not there anymore, as tourism is the biggest \npart of their economy, on beautiful Lake Superior, with beautiful \nmuseums and an aquarium and a children's museum. It has changed the \nlife of that town. Tourism creates good jobs that cannot be outsourced.\n  Mr. President, one out of every eight Americans is employed in our \ntravel economy. Each year, travel and tourism contribute approximately \n$1.3 trillion to the American economy. International visitors, as \nSenator Dorgan just noted, spend an average of $4,500 per person.\n  In economic terms, international tourism to the United States counts \nas an export. Instead of shipping our product to a customer overseas, \nthe customer is coming here to spend money on our goods and our \nservices.\n  Last year, travel and tourism exports accounted for 8 percent of all \nU.S. exports and 26 percent of all U.S. services exports. In fact, \ntourism is one of the few economic sectors where we enjoy a substantial \ntrade surplus.\n  Travel is a part of the fabric of our State and our country. But over \nthe past decade, we know it has been stretched to the brink. While more \npeople around the world are traveling, a smaller percentage of them are \nvisiting the United States.\n  This is not just about our troubled economy right now. This was going \non long before that. It actually started after 9/11, where, for good \nreasons, security measures were put in place. But some of those good \nreasons have turned into very difficult times for tourists to come to \nthis country, and that needs to be fixed. That is part of this bill: to \nmake it easier for tourists to visit our country.\n  Since 2000, the U.S. share of the world travel market has decreased \nby nearly 20 percent, costing us hundreds of thousands of jobs and \nbillions of dollars in revenue.\n  Last year, nearly 200,000 travel-related jobs were lost. The Commerce \nDepartment predicts we will lose another 247,000 jobs this year. \nRemember, this is not about airport CEOs. This is about the janitors \nwho work at the airports. This is about the maids who are doing the \nbeds. This is about the waitresses who are working at the restaurants. \nThis is about the people who do the flowers for the hotels and for the \nbanquets and for the business travelers. These are real jobs in \nAmerica.\n  This has always been a country that has opened its arms to people \nfrom around the world. That is why we are so great. We have to bring \nthat back. We have to bring people in to visit this country.\n  The Travel Promotion Act will do just that. By boosting travel to the \nUnited States it will also give a boost to our economy. So it is a win-\nwin for the tourism industry, for jobs for America, and for the \nAmerican people.\n  Senator Dorgan went through the bill. I do want to emphasize that not \nonly will this consist of travel promotion and promoting our country, \nlike other countries have been doing for years that have been \nleapfrogging us in this market, additionally, this legislation will \nestablish the Office of Travel Promotion in the Department of Commerce \nto work with the Corporation for Travel Promotion and the Secretaries \nof State and Homeland Security to encourage travel and to make sure \ninternational visitors are processed efficiently.\n  It does not cost taxpayers a cent, as Senator Dorgan pointed out, and \neconomists expect it to generate billions for our economy.\n  According to an analysis by Oxford Economics, this tourism program is \nestimated to attract 1.6 million new international visitors annually \nand create $4 billion in new spending in our country, creating 40,000 \nnew jobs.\n  We know we need to bring back business travel. We should not let a \nfew bad actors influence the decisions of good companies around this \ncountry. We know we have to look, this summer, for affordable deals for \nour families, and people are staying close to home. We want our \nMinnesotans to go fishing in Minnesota.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I would love to ask you if you know \nhow much money people spend alone in Minnesota on bait and worms every \nyear. I will tell you the answer. It has probably never been uttered \nbefore in this Chamber: $50 million a year. Minnesotans and visitors to \nour State spend $50 million a year on bait and worms for recreational \nfishing--just to give you an idea of what we are talking about when we \ntalk about tourism spending.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this important piece of \nlegislation. I am proud to be a cosponsor. I look forward to working on \nthis bill on the floor in the days to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6528-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

Mr. President, I rise today to discuss President Obama's \nnomination of Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor has impeccable legal credentials and a record \nof excellence and integrity. Equally important, she has the experience \nnot only to make an excellent Justice but also to have a significant \nimpact on a Court that today reflects too narrow a slice of America.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor's deep appreciation for how the law affects the \nlives of ordinary Americans is born from her compelling personal \nbackground, as well as her time as an assistant district attorney, a \ncommercial litigator, and later as a judge.\n  Once confirmed, she will become the first Hispanic Justice, and just \nthe third woman, to serve on the Nation's highest Court.\n  What are we to make, then, of the assaults on the character and \nrecord of this seemingly exemplary nominee?\n  Unfortunately, they seem to be a remnant of more than two decades of \n``culture wars'' over Supreme Court nominees.\n  As someone who was present for the beginning of these wars, I have \nseen them develop into elaborate political dances, where both sides \ntrade charges that are predictable and often baseless.\n  Some of these attacks, such as charges of racism and bigotry, deeply \nundermine our national dialog.\n  I am encouraged to note that my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle have chosen not to join in these attacks, and many, in fact, have \ncondemned them.\n  Other attacks are equally predictable, from the general charge of \n``extremist'' to particular instances of political ``gotcha''--\nwrenching statements out of context in order to paint a distorted \npicture of the nominee's record.\n  At some level, partisan assaults are expected in the Supreme Court \nnomination process. But in the case of Judge Sotomayor, they are \nespecially divorced from this body's good-faith exercise of its duty to \nadvise and consent.\n  It is one thing to attack a nominee's judicial philosophy when the \nPresident is trying to reshape the Court based on judicial philosophy, \nwhen the balance of the Court is at stake, or when the Senate and the \nPresident are deeply divided.\n  None of those situations apply to this nomination.\n  Judge Sotomayor is a well-qualified, mainstream jurist who does not \nthreaten to tip the balance of the Court and\n\n[[Page S6529]]\n\nwho is likely to be confirmed by a substantial majority.\n  Although these partisan attacks take many forms, today I would like \nto address one persistent, unhelpful, and often baseless charge--that \nof so-called ``judicial activism.''\n  What is especially unhelpful about calling someone a judicial \nactivist is that many times it is an empty epithet, divorced from a \nreal assessment of judicial temperament.\n  As conservative jurist Frank Easterbrook puts it, the charge is \nempty:\n\n       Everyone wants to appropriate and apply the word so that \n     his favored approach is sound and its opposite ``activist.'' \n     Then ``activism'' just means judges behaving badly--and each \n     person fills in a different definition of badly.\n\n  In other words, the term activist, when applied to the decisions of a \nSupreme Court nominee, is generally nothing more than politically \ncharged shorthand for decisions that the accuser disagrees with.\n  That is not to say that the term ``judicial activism'' is necessarily \nwithout content. If we want to take it seriously, it might mean a \nfailure to defer to the elected branches of government, it might mean \ndisregard for long-established precedent, or it might mean deciding \ncases based on personal policy preferences rather than the law.\n  I think it is fair to say that based on any of these definitions, the \nSupreme Court's current conservative majority has been highly activist.\n  Let me give just a few examples.\n  In United States v. Morrison, decided in 2000, the Rehnquist court \nstruck down a key provision of the Violence Against Women Act. Rather \nthan deferring to the considered judgment and extensive fact-finding of \na democratically elected Congress, the Court went out of its way to \nimpose its own judgment. This body held extensive hearings, made \nexplicit findings, and voted 95 to 4 in favor of the bill. An activist \nCourt chose to ignore all that and substitute its own, constricted view \nof the proper role of the national government for that shared by both \nCongress and the States.\n  That same year, the Court decided Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents. \nThe five-Justice majority concluded that States could not be sued by \nprivate citizens for age discrimination without their consent because \nof a general principle of sovereign immunity.\n  This is another decision that was, simultaneously, ``conservative'' \nin terms of policy outcome and ``activist'' in terms of judging.\n  It was conservative because it expanded States rights and contracted \nantidiscrimination rights.\n  It was activist both because it struck down the considered judgment \nof Congress and because it was based not at all on the text of the \nConstitution but instead on the policy preferences of five Justices.\n  In his dissent in Kimel, Justice Stevens said:\n\n       The kind of judicial activism manifested in such cases \n     represents such a radical departure from the proper role of \n     this Court that it should be opposed whenever the opportunity \n     arises.\n\n  With the addition of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, the \nconservative majority of the current Court has continued to be highly \nactivist, even though the two newest Justices are not always candid \nabout what they are doing.\n  In fact, that charge has been leveled against Justices Alito and \nRoberts by no less an authority than Justice Scalia.\n  In the campaign finance case, Federal Election Commission v. \nWisconsin Right to Life, the Court struck down key provisions of the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act, again substituting its view of good \npublic policy for that of Congress.\n  But this was more than a failure to defer to a democratically elected \nbody. The Court effectively overruled controlling precedent--McConnell \nv. FEC--while pretending that it was doing no such thing. Justice \nScalia called this ``faux judicial restraint.''\n  In much the same vein, in a case called Hein v. Freedom from Religion \nFoundation, Justices Roberts and Alito were part of a majority that in \neffect overruled longstanding precedent on taxpayer standing, while \nagain claiming that they were not doing so.\n  Again, Justice Scalia called their bluff, attacking Justice Alito's \nopinion for falsely claiming to honor stare decisis.\n  Of course, in both cases Justice Scalia wanted to overrule the cases \nin question expressly, but at least he was honest about his intentions.\n  Then there's Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School \nDistrict No. 1.\n  In that case the Court rejected local community authority in the area \nof voluntary integration of public schools. Chief Justice Roberts' \nplurality opinion for the four-person conservative bloc gave the back \nof the hand to a long line of desegregation precedents, beginning with \nBrown v. Board of Education.\n  Remember that this is the same Justice who, during his confirmation \nhearing, repeatedly professed his allegiance to stare decisis.\n  If not for the opinion concurring in the judgment by Justice Kennedy, \ncommunities that want some modest measure of racial integration in \ntheir schools would be virtually powerless to act.\n  Another recent case, this time in the anti-trust area, again shows \nthat activism is in the eye of the beholder. In Leegin v. PSKS, the \nCourt, with the addition of Justices Roberts and Alito, overruled 96 \nyears of unbroken precedent on vertical price-fixing.\n  This case, plain and simple, represents the elevation of big \nmanufacturers' interests over those of the consumer. And this Court \nrejected nearly a century of precedent because the majority of its \nmembers decided to embrace a particular economic theory different from \nthe one that prevailed at the time the Sherman Antitrust Act became \nlaw.\n  I want to mention one final example of conservative judicial \nactivism, though there are plenty more I could cite.\n  Pending before the Supreme Court right now is a case that involves a \nconstitutional challenge to section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. As my \ncolleagues in this body know, section 5 requires some States and \npolitical subdivisions, because of a history of racial discrimination, \nto ``pre-clear'' new voting rules with either the Justice Department or \na Federal court.\n  The claim made by the Texas voting district in the case seems to be \nthat section 5 has outlived its usefulness.\n  Before voting to reauthorize the Voting Rights Act in 2006, the \nCongress undertook an extensive and thorough review of the current \nnature and extent of discrimination against minority voters, and of the \ncontinued need for section 5.\n  It held 21 hearings and accumulated 16,000 pages of testimony over \nthe course of 10 months. And at the end of that process, Congress \nconcluded that section 5 is still necessary, and passed the bill by a \nvote of 98-to-0 in the Senate and 390-to-33 in the House.\n  Though the Court has not yet ruled in this case, the questioning from \nthe bench during oral argument should give us concern, and does give us \nmore evidence of conservative judicial activism.\n  Some members of the conservative wing of the Court, including \nJustices Scalia and Roberts, suggested by their questions that they \nintend to disregard the entire Congressional Record.\n  In discussing the provisions of the act that allow jurisdictions to \n``bail out'' of section 5 coverage, by showing that they no longer need \nto be covered, Justice Scalia argued that bailing out was impractical.\n  When the attorney for the United States explained that Congress had \nconsidered and rejected that argument, Justice Scalia responded: ``The \nquestion is whether it is right, not whether Congress rejected it.'' So \nmuch for deference to legislative fact-finding.\n  What makes this apparent substitution of a justice's assessment of \nthe facts for that of Congress particularly troubling is the language \nof the Constitution itself.\n  Remember that congressional authority for the Voting Rights Act comes \nfrom the 15th amendment, which not only guarantees the right of \ncitizens of the United States to vote, but also says in section 2. \n``The Congress shall have power to enforce this article by appropriate \nlegislation.''\n  So here we have Congress operating at the height of its power, and \nmembers of the Supreme Court seeming to want to decide the case based \non their own view of good policy.\n\n[[Page S6530]]\n\n  I think I have given enough examples to suggest that judicial \nactivism is a two-way street.\n  As my Judiciary Committee colleague from Oklahoma said during the \nconfirmation hearing for Chief Justice Roberts, ``We each have our own \ndefinition of judicial activism.''\n  So what does the ``activism'' charge add to the debate? I would say, \nvery little.\n  Let's take a look at the charge that Judge Sotomayor is a judicial \nactivist.\n  To support that claim, critics point to a single, much-publicized \ncase involving New Haven firefighters. But this attack is not only \ndisingenuous it is upside down.\n  In that case, Judge Sotomayor was part of a 3-0 decision based on \nsettled circuit court precedent.\n  Her panel's decision supported the trial court judge's ruling and the \ndecision of the local government regarding the best way to determine \npromotions for firefighters.\n  Later, a majority of the entire court of appeals ruled to let the \npanel's decision stand.\n  There is no doubt that the case addresses a difficult set of issues, \nand that the Supreme Court may come out the other way, though likely by \na razor-thin margin.\n  But Judge Sotomayor's decision to defer to the democratically \naccountable, local New Haven government and rule along with the \nmajority of her court not to upset settled precedent cannot meet any \ndefinition of judicial activism. In fact, the complaint seems to be \nthat she was not activist enough.\n  The truth of the matter is that Judge Sotomayor, far from being an \nextremist, is very much in the mainstream.\n  Other than the firefighters case, she has decided 88 cases involving \nclaims of race discrimination while on the court of appeals. In 78 of \nthose cases, Judge Sotomayor and the panel rejected the claim of \ndiscrimination.\n  Of the 10 cases favoring claims of discrimination, 9 were unanimous, \nand of those 9, in 7 the unanimous panel included at least one \nRepublican-appointed judge.\n  I am not so naive as to believe we can eliminate entirely the \npartisan exploitation of the confirmation process.\n  Maybe, though, we can put to rest the tired and un-illuminating \ncharge of judicial activism.\n  After all, that charge is rarely meant as a genuine claim about the \nexercise of judicial power. Instead, it is generally just an \nestablished part of an elaborate and tired script, a claim that we can \nexpect no matter who the nominee may be.\n  So let's focus on substance rather than empty code words. Let's \ndebate the quality and merits of Judge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy \nand approach rather than hurl epithets or engage in demagoguery.\n  Next month, the Judiciary Committee will hold a confirmation hearing, \nat which Senators from both sides of the aisle will be able to question \nJudge Sotomayor directly and publicly.\n  Because Supreme Court Justices are not elected but rather appointed \nfor life, the qualifications of every nominee should be carefully \nexamined, not only by Senators but also by the public at large.\n  This is the time when the public should be and will be paying close \nattention. We do not do ourselves, or the public, any favors if we rely \non meaningless labels left over from the culture wars.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to reconsider what the charge of \n``judicial activism'' brings to our debate.\n  Judge Sotomayor deserves our careful consideration, but I hope that \nmy colleagues here in the Senate will continue to abstain from the \nculture wars and name calling that too often have characterized our \njudicial nominations over recent years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6530-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6530-S6531]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I wish to speak today about reforming our \nhealth care system. As I said last week, most Americans are satisfied \nwith the health care they receive, but if we want to maintain and \nimprove the quality of affordable health care, we need to act now. We \nmust get health care costs under control while preserving choice. We \nmust reform health care to make it more affordable for businesses and \npatients and less cumbersome for providers. Health care reform has been \ndelayed for too long, and it cannot wait any longer.\n  If anyone needs reasons as to why health care reform is necessary, \nall they have to do is read some of the studies that have been released \nrecently that show the dire consequences for our health care system and \nour economy if we refuse to act. For example, if we allow the status \nquo to persist, the White House Council of Economic Advisers has \nestimated that the sheer gross domestic product devoted to health care \nwill rise from 18 percent in 2009 to 28 percent in 2030 and 34 percent \nin 2040. This trajectory is simply unsustainable.\n  Businesses in America have to compete against companies from other \ncountries. Many of these foreign companies pay nothing for health care \nfor their workers or retirees. Others pay far less than what many of \nour larger corporations pay. This puts many of our businesses at a \ndisadvantage in the global marketplace.\n  A recent report by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban \nInstitute reiterates the pressure that American businesses face in \nsupplying health care benefits to their employees. These researchers \nprepared analyses using a simulation model estimating how coverage and \ncost trends would change between now and 2019. Looking at three \ndifferent scenarios, the worst case would be where there is a slow \ngrowth in incomes and continuing high growth rates for health care \ncosts; an intermediate case where there would be some faster growth in \nincomes but a lower growth rate for health care costs; and the best \ncase would be where there is full employment, faster income growth, and \neven slower growth in health care costs.\n  Under all three scenarios, the report showed a tremendous strain on \nbusiness owners and their employees over the next decade if no reform \nis enacted. If health care reform is not enacted, the report projects \nthat within 10 years, the cost of health care of a business can double \nfrom approximately $430 billion for employee premiums in 2009 to $885 \nbillion in 2019. Even in the best case scenario, employer spending on \nhealth insurance premiums would rise by 72 percent.\n  This would most likely result in fewer Americans being offered \nemployer-sponsored insurance, with a likely drop from 56 percent of \nemployees getting coverage through their employer in 2009 to as few as \n49 percent by 2019.\n  If no changes are made, and the number of people with employer \nsponsored insurance continues to decrease, that also means the ranks of \nthe uninsured will increase. And the projections are not pretty.\n  Under the same scenarios, the number of uninsured will reach just \nover 53 million under the best case and as high as 66 million under the \nworst case.\n  Unfortunately, when those without insurance do receive care--most \nlikely in an emergency room--the costs for treating them are passed on \nto those of us who are fortunate enough to have health insurance.\n  Providers and hospitals charge insurers more for the services \nprovided to patients who do have health insurance to make up for the \ncost of treating the uninsured.\n  These cost shifts result in a ``hidden tax'' of higher premiums for \npatients and businesses.\n  Right now, this hidden tax results in an increase of about $1,000 for \npremiums for family coverage.\n  It is time for reform.\n  Over the last decade, Americans have watched their health insurance \npremiums double at a growth rate six times faster than their wages, \nthreatening their financial stability.\n  If we do not reform health care, if health care premiums continue to \nrise at 4 percent per year, in 2025 premiums for family coverage will \ncost more than $25,000 per year.\n  Can you imagine how that dollar amount will affect American families?\n  On top of this, a recent study published in the American Journal of \nMedicine showed that bankruptcies involving medical bills now account \nfor more than 60 percent of U.S. personal bankruptcies, an increase of \n50 percent in just 6 years. And it is not the uninsured that is driving \nthis increase.\n  In fact, more than 75 percent of families needing to enter bankruptcy \nbecause of health care costs actually\n\n[[Page S6531]]\n\nhave health insurance. Most are middle class, well educated, and own \ntheir homes.\n  They just cannot keep up with the alarming rise in out-of-pocket \ncosts associated with medical care.\n  It is time for reform.\n  Our current health care system is rampant with bureaucracy, \ninefficiency and waste.\n  An example of this is the amount of time physicians must spend \nfilling out various forms required by insurance plans.\n  A national survey of physician practices found that, on average, \ndoctors are spending 3 hours per week--the equivalent of 3 workweeks \nper year just on administrative tasks required by health plans.\n  The study showed that the cost of interacting with insurance plans \namounts to $31 billion annually and approximately 7 percent of all U.S. \nexpenditures for physician and clinical services.\n  More importantly, on a personal level, this is 3 weeks less time \nannually that physicians have to spend with their patients discussing \ntheir treatment options, explaining the pros and cons of various \nprocedures, learning the fears and anxieties of their patients, \nfurthering the patient-doctor relationship.\n  It is time for reform.\n  We have attempted to reform our health care system several times in \nthe past to no avail. But this year it is different.\n  This time, the call for reform is coming from people and \norganizations that previously opposed reform.\n  This time, because of the reasons I have mentioned, businesses, along \nwith unions that represent their workers, are asking for reform.\n  This time, patient advocacy organizations and provider groups are \ncalling for health reform.\n  Make no mistake, reforming health care is not an easy task, and it is \none that will require true compromise from everyone across the \nideological spectrum.\n  But it is a task that must be done.\n  Our country, and the health of its citizens as well as the economy, \ncannot afford to maintain the status quo.\n  Next week, the members of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and \nPensions Committee and the Senate Finance Committee will begin \ndeliberations on legislation to reform health care.\n  As the members of these committees gather to discuss and ultimately \nmark up legislation, I want to take this opportunity to again voice my \nsupport for a public option in a menu of insurance options from which \npeople may choose.\n  I believe a public option is imperative in providing a true choice \nfor all Americans.\n  Let me stress: this would be a purely voluntary option.\n  If you like your current plan, you keep it.\n  But there are too many Americans who do not have real choices when it \ncomes to health insurance, especially those who live in rural areas.\n  In addition, many large urban areas are dominated by one or two \ninsurers that serve more than 60 percent of the market. In fact, there \nare seven states where one insurer has over 75 percent of the market \nshare.\n  A public option can help Americans expand their choice of an \ninsurance provider.\n  A public option could take various forms, and I think the committees \nare the proper place to determine the appropriate contours of a public \noption.\n  But I want to point out again that right now, today, there are more \nthan 30 State governments that offer their employees a choice between \ntraditional private insurance and a plan that is self-insured by the \nState. Some States have had them for more than 15 years.\n  In these 30 States, the market share of the self-funded plans within \nthe market for State employees typically ranges from 25 to 40 percent. \nThis shows a healthy competition between the public option and private \ninsurers, not domination by either type of insurer.\n  And I want to point out that these arrangements do not seem to be a \nproblem or incite ideological issues at the State level.\n  Why then, should it be so when discussing health reform on a national \nlevel?\n  A public option can go a long way in bringing more innovation to the \ndelivery system and introducing new measures to reduce cost and improve \nquality.\n  A public option can serve as a benchmark for all insurers, setting a \nstandard for cost, quality and access within regional or national \nmarketplaces.\n  It can have low administrative costs and can have a broad choice of \nproviders. It can give Americans a better range of choices, make the \nhealth care market more competitive, and keep insurance companies \nhonest.\n  And again, the key to all this is that a public option will be just \nthat, an option, not a requirement.\n  Some people will choose it; others will not. If you like the \ninsurance plan you have now, you keep it.\n  If you are happy with the insurance you get with your employer, or \neven the individual insurance market, you stay enrolled in that \ninsurance plan. And if you are unsatisfied with the public option, you \nhave the option to switch back to private insurers.\n  Americans firmly support the ability to choose their own doctor and \nvalue their relationships with their providers. So do I. It is key to \nany health care plan that Americans have a right to choose their \ndoctor.\n  An overriding goal of health reform is to increase a patient's access \nto affordable, quality health care--offering a public option can help \nincrease Americans' choices.\n  Mr. President, it is time for reform that protects what works and \nfixes what is broken.\n  It is time to reform health care so that American businesses can \nafford to offer health care to their employees.\n  It is time to reform health care so that all Americans have access to \nquality, affordable care, regardless of preexisting medical conditions.\n  It is time to reform health care so that physicians and other \nproviders have less redtape to deal with and more time to spend with \npatients.\n  It is time to reform health care so we place a higher priority on \nprevention and wellness, saving lives as well as money.\n  It is time to reform health care so all Americans can compare the \ncosts and benefits of different health insurance policies.\n  And, it is time to reform health care so Americans have more choices \nand can retain the right to choose their own doctors.\n  For all these reasons and more, it is time for health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the quorum \ncall to be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

Mr. President, I would like to report a tremendous \nhistoric development in the ability of our country to have clean air, \nan effective way to deal with climate change, and enough low-cost, \nreliable electricity to help keep jobs in this country. Yesterday I \nattended a press conference from a company, Babcock & Wilcox. Also \nincluded was the Tennessee Valley Authority. The company and TVA \nannounced that Babcock & Wilcox will soon make an application to the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission for permission to start building and \nselling a small nuclear reactor that can be built in a factory, shipped \nby railway to a site, and put together like Lego blocks at the site. \nThe nuclear reactor is a 125-megawatt reactor. That compares with the \nlarge nuclear plants, of which we have 104 today in the United States. \nThose plants produce, on average, 1,000 megawatts of electricity. This \nwould be 125. So the real prospect exists that we will be able to have, \nin this country, nuclear reactors for electricity that might cost as \nlittle as one-tenth as much to build, can be built in 3 years instead \nof 6, and will produce, as I said, 125 megawatts instead of 1,000--\nmaking it easier to integrate them into our electric grid--and can be \nbuilt in a factory and shipped to a customer.\n\n[[Page S6532]]\n\n  The reason I am excited about this prospect is it has a real chance \nof happening. No one has built more small reactors in the world than \nBabcock & Wilcox, and the Tennessee Valley Authority is the largest \npublic utility in the United States and the only utility in the United \nStates that is currently building a nuclear powerplant.\n  Republicans and, I am sure, many Democrats, but certainly Republicans \nin the Senate and the House, unanimously believe our goal as a country \nought to be to build 100 new large nuclear powerplants over the next 20 \nyears, while we figure out renewable electricity. The reason we want to \ndo that is we want to deal with climate change. We want clean air, but \nwe want to be able to keep jobs here at the same time. If climate \nchange is the inconvenient problem, nuclear power is the inconvenient \nsolution.\n  Why is that? Climate change is caused by carbon that comes from coal \nplants and from a variety of other sources. Forty percent of the carbon \nthat is produced in the United States comes from coal-fired \npowerplants. But if we are looking for a way to produce electricity in \na way that is pollution free and carbon free, 70 percent of all the \npollution-free, carbon-free electricity we have today comes from our \nnuclear plants. Six percent of our clean electricity comes from the \nSun, the wind, and the Earth.\n  One day it may be that we are able to make more of our electricity \nfrom the Sun, the wind, and the Earth. But at the moment, not much is \navailable. It is expensive and the Sun is only available when the Sun \nshines and the wind is only available when the wind blows. If you are \nwanting to operate your computer, or manufacture an automobile in \nIllinois or Tennessee, or turn on your light at night, you don't want \nto have to pray that the wind is blowing or that the Sun is shining. \nYou want reliable, low-cost electricity.\n  In Tennessee, we are excited about the prospect of, one day, solar \nenergy making a bigger difference in our electrical grid. In fact, two \nbig new plants have moved into our State to make polysilicon, which is \nthe product that goes into the solar cells that go on the top of your \nhouse. Each of those plants uses 120 megawatts of electricity. Where \nwill they get that electricity? One reason they are in Tennessee is \nbecause the TVA supplies a lot of low-cost, reliable electricity. That \ncomes from coal and nuclear power and a little bit from natural gas in \nour State. That is pretty much the way it is around the country. Solar \npower is not yet low-cost, reliable electricity. You can't run the \nplant making the solar energy products on solar power or wind power \ntoday. One day we may, but in the meantime, while we are trying to \nrebuild the auto industry in Michigan and Illinois and Wisconsin and \nTennessee, we want low-cost, reliable electricity. We want our Alcoa \nplant to stay open in Blount County, in Maryville, where I am from in \nTennessee. Why is it closed? The cost of the electricity. What will \nopen it? A 20-year contract on low-cost, reliable electricity. If we \nsay to the Alcoa plant: We will sell you a lot of wind power, they will \nsay: But the wind doesn't blow in our area. If we say: We will sell you \nsolar power, they will say: It is four times as much and we might like \nto operate a night shift and you can't store it.\n  But what we will be able to say, in light of this new development we \nheard about yesterday--we can say to the Alcoa plant, we can say it to \nEastman Chemical in Kingsport, we can say it to the two plants making \nmaterials for solar cells: We can move in a 125-megawatt nuclear \nreactor, put it near your site, and supply all the low-cost, reliable \nelectricity you need.\n  Another use for this new reactor could be to help us clean up our \ncoal plants. We have a clean air problem in Tennessee, as does much of \nAmerica. I am very much hopeful the Environmental Protection Agency or \nthe Congress or some combination will reinstate the CAIR rule to deal \nwith nitrogen and sulfur and mercury, for our health in this country.\n  The small reactor might be used as a substitute for coal plants. Some \nof the coal plants we have in the TVA system and around the country are \nvery old and very dirty. The newest ones are much more efficient and a \nlot cleaner. It might make sense to take the nuclear reactor, the small \none, and put two of them together where an existing coal plant is. \nThere are a lot of possibilities for this. Instead of 100 nuclear \nplants in 20 years, we may have another option. We may be able to have \n400 or 500 small nuclear reactors in 20 years. They may be 125 \nmegawatts here or two together or three together.\n  My fellow Tennessean, Al Gore, who won the Nobel Prize for his \ncampaign on the dangers of global warming, has a line he often uses \nabout nuclear power. ``Nuclear power may have a role to play,'' Al \nsays, ``but unfortunately, nuclear reactors come only in one size--\nextra large.''\n  Until yesterday, you couldn't disagree with the former Vice \nPresident. Ever since President Eisenhower beached a 65-megawatt Navy \nsubmarine reactor at Shippingport, PA, in 1967, under the Atoms for \nPeace Program, we have been building reactors bigger and bigger. Most \nof the ones on the drawing board today, as I mentioned, are at least \n1,200 megawatts. I believe we have 17 applications now for new nuclear \npowerplants. Also, one is being built right now and that is completing \nan old plant at Watts Bar.\n  We have not built a traditional large nuclear power plant from start \nto finish in the last 30 years in the United States. That is quite an \nirony. We invented the technology. We have used it successfully since \nthe 1950s and without incident in our nuclear Navy. Twenty percent of \nour electricity comes from our older plants, the ones we built more \nthan 30 years ago. They produce 20 percent of our electricity today and \n70 percent of our clean electricity. But for 30 years we have not been \nbuilding them.\n  In the meantime, France--that we don't usually like to emulate--has. \nFrance is 80 percent nuclear, and they have among the lowest carbon \nemissions--that contribute to global warming--in the European Union and \namong the lowest electric rates in the European Union. They are even \nselling electricity to Germany, which has invested money in solar \nenergy and windmills and stopped nuclear but has found they do not have \nenough electricity to keep their jobs.\n  India and China, with our help, are building nuclear powerplants \nbecause they want clean, reliable electricity at a low cost.\n  We have appropriated money to help do that and sign treaties to help \ndo that. Now even our President said the other day that Iran has a \nright to build nuclear powerplants. Well, if Iran has a right to do it, \nwhy don't we do it? We invented it. We are the ones who want low-cost, \nclean electricity. Let's go ahead and do it. So it will be 20 years, \nbut it takes a long time to get one of those projects through the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission. I mentioned there were 17 applications. \nIt takes another 5 or 6 years after you get through the 2- or 3-year \nprocess at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to build these big plants. \nSo that is a long ways.\n  If you are a utility and all you really need is 300 new megawatts to \nmeet growing demand, this new, more flexible approach--this smaller \nreactor--is going to lower costs and open the door to more widespread \nuse of nuclear power. It will help us achieve the goal of building 100 \nnew nuclear powerplants in the next 20 years in order to deal with \nclimate change.\n  To those who are still skeptical of nuclear power, we must say, if \nglobal warming is an inconvenient problem, then nuclear power is the \ninconvenient solution.\n  Babcock & Wilcox and TVA have shown us this new approach. They have \nproposed a reactor that can be built in a factory in 3 years, shipped \nto the site on rails, and fit together like Lego blocks. That is a very \noriginal idea. The larger reactors are still going to be necessary. We \nare going to need the power. But as B and the TVA have reminded us, \nthere is more than one way to skin a cat. What we are seeing here today \nis what the business schools call a disruptive technology. I hope the \npublic and the press will appreciate how the Tennessee Valley Authority \nis fulfilling its mission as a public utility by taking such a \nprogressive stance on technology.\n  America's nuclear technology has been falling behind. Of that, there \nis no doubt. The French, the Japanese, and the Russians are all selling \nreactors out in the world, to India and China\n\n[[Page S6533]]\n\nand other places. This is going to make them sit up and take notice \nbecause the concept we saw yesterday is perfect for developing nations \nthat do not have the infrastructure to handle the larger reactors. It \nis perfect for small towns and factories all over America that may need \nonly 125 megawatts and cannot afford something larger. It is what is \ncalled ``distributed generation''--producing electricity onsite instead \nof wheeling it from deserts or mountaintops hundreds or thousands of \nmiles away. As the old saying goes, ``Small is beautiful.''\n  One of the things we are going to have to face as we think about what \nkind of electricity we want for the future is the landscape of America. \nYou know, landscape is a part of our environment as well, and the \nlandscape becomes a real concern. When we look at the energy sprawl \nthat could be created by some of the renewable energy projects, it \ntakes a lot of space to produce a little bit of electricity.\n  For example, a big nuclear plant can be located on about 1 square \nmile. That is one that produces 1,000 megawatts. To get that much \nelectricity from biomass, which means woodchips or dead trees, you \nwould need a forest the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National \nPark--that is 550,000 acres--and the number of trucks that would be \ncoming in and out to haul the stuff in and back out would be in the \nhundreds every day. You would be talking about millions of tons of \nwoodchips and dead trees a year. So that is for just one big nuclear \nplant equivalent of electricity. On the other hand, to create the same \namount of electricity from wind turbines that you would get from one \nnuclear plant, you would have to cover about 270 square miles.\n  In our part of the world, in the foothills of the Great Smoky \nMountains, we do not really want to see these 50-story towers with \nblades that are as long as football fields, with flashing lights on top \nthat can be seen for 20 miles. We do not want to see them along the \nfoothills of the Smokies, and I doubt the people of Virginia want to \nsee them along the Blue Ridge Parkway, and I doubt they want to see \nthem in Pennsylvania or in the White Mountains. And in the Eastern \nUnited States, they only work on the ridgetops, and they do not work \nvery well. That is why there is only one wind farm in the entire \nSoutheastern United States. It is in Tennessee and only operates 18 \npercent of the time, and part of that time is at night when we have a \nlot of extra electricity. So that does not work very well.\n  The Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, with whom I work on the \nAppropriations Interior Subcommittee, has expressed her concern about \nthe size of the solar thermal plants proposed for the Mojave Desert, \nwhich she has tried to protect for years. They would have to be 5 miles \non each side in order to get a decent amount of electricity, and that \nis only during the daytime.\n  You have the wind and you have the Sun, but you still need either the \ncoal plant or the nuclear plant. So I believe there is a place for \nwind: far offshore, the middle of Lake Michigan, or in parts of the \nwind corridor. I believe there is a great future for solar because \nsolar power comes during the peak times, during the day when we can use \nit. Perhaps we can use our rooftops to provide the space. So we think \nthat is more promising for our area. I think biomass is useful, but I \nhave already expressed how large an area it would take to produce a \nlittle electricity. And we might be able to get a few hundred megawatts \nout of the Mississippi River by putting turbines in the water.\n  So how are we going to reindustrialize America over the next 25 \nyears? How are we going to keep those auto suppliers and assembly \nplants and aluminum plants and even the new plants making solar in our \ncountry if we have sky-high costs of unreliable electricity? We need \nanother option.\n  While we are cleaning up the coal plants, while we are figuring out \nrenewable electricity, we now have another way to skin the cat; that \nis, the small nuclear reactor, 125 megawatts. That is about the size of \nelectricity that is produced by Fort Loudoun Dam in our State. It is \nsignificant, but it is a lot smaller than the big ones we are used to.\n  What I really hope is that when Americans see this user-friendly \nreactor sitting underground--that is another aspect: A lot of it, \nincluding the storage of the waste, goes underground. Another aspect is \nit is only two stories tall. Most people think nuclear plants, the big \nones--they see these big cooling towers. That is to cool the water that \nhas to be used. But these small ones are air-cooled, so they don't use \nmuch water. That is a great advantage. And they are not an eyesore, \nthey are two stories tall. I mean, remember, the wind turbines are 50-\nstories tall, producing almost no electricity in a consistent way. The \nnuclear reactor is producing low-cost energy 90 percent of the time, \nand it is two stories tall.\n  So I think with this development people may begin to rethink nuclear \npower. It is already happening out there. People are recognizing that \nthe dangers of nuclear have been widely exaggerated, there is nothing \nto be fearful about, and once we realize that, we are going to see \nnuclear power for what it is: an appropriate technology that will \nenable us to meet our future energy needs without overwhelming the \nworld with pollution and warming the planet.\n  So I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in saying \ncongratulations to Babcock & Wilcox and especially to the Tennessee \nValley Authority for leading the country in this renaissance of nuclear \nenergy. Congratulations, good luck, and I hope there are many of these \nprojects on the drawing boards.\n  This is the way for us to clean the air, deal with global warming, \nand at the same time have low-cost, reliable electricity in large \namounts so that we can keep our jobs here.\n  There is one other aspect to this that I ought to mention. As we talk \nabout the different forms of energy, people worry that so much of what \nit takes to build the wind turbines or the solar plants or even the \nlarge nuclear plants, and how they may be manufactured overseas and \nthat the jobs are there and not here. All of the jobs for the small \nnuclear reactors will be in the United States--virtually all of them. \nSo this is not only American-made energy, all of the parts that go to \nbuilding what I hope will be hundreds of these small reactors over time \ncan be made and will be made right here in the United States.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to say I have great concern not \njust about the ownership interests the Federal Government already has \nin financial institutions and in auto companies and in insurance \ncompanies but also about what we are hearing might happen with health \ncare.\n  My view is, having a government plan, a government takeover of health \ncare would again be an intervention into the marketplace on a scale and \non a level I don't think most Americans want to see. It is referred to \naround here as a public plan option, but let's call it what it is: It \nis a government plan. It is a government-run health care system. The \nmore you have the government involved in the decisions with respect to \nhealth care, the more the government is going to dictate many of the \ndecisions that are going to be made and traditionally are made between \na patient and a physician, in consultation with each other, between a \nconsumer and a health care provider. Those types of interactions occur \ntoday in the marketplace. If the government is imposed into that \nparticular situation, it seems to me at least we are going to have the \ngovernment making more and more decisions with respect to health care: \nWhich treatments are going to be approved;\n\n[[Page S6534]]\n\nwhich ones are effective; which ones are cost-effective. And that \ncritical, fundamental relationship between a physician and a patient, \nwe could be creating barriers in that relationship that are not going \nto provide for the high quality, optimum level of health care and \ntreatment we have experienced in this country for a long time.\n  Clearly, I think we all have to acknowledge there are things that \nneed to improve in the health care system in this country. We need to \nreform our health care system. We need to bring the costs down. We need \nto figure out ways to make health care available and accessible to more \nAmericans so that many of those who don't have health care have access \nto it and to get costs under control. But there are lots of ways that \ncan be done by building upon the strengths we have in the current \nsystem; not throwing it completely away in exchange for a government-\nrun system, which would ration health care, limit the amount of choices \nAmericans would have, and cost the taxpayers an awful lot of money. \nBecause I think, at the end of the day, most of the estimates that have \nbeen done--and it is hard to know because we don't have a specific \nproposal out there yet that has been costed or a revenue source that \nhas been identified for it, but I think all the estimates we have seen \nso far suggest that this plan, the health care plan that is being \nproposed by the President and by the Democratic leadership in the \nCongress, is going to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of $1 trillion \nto $2 trillion. We don't know exactly. I have heard $1.2 trillion, $1.5 \ntrillion. I have heard up to $2 trillion, but we know that is an \nenormous amount of money, and that revenue has to come from somewhere. \nOne-sixth of the American economy today, one-sixth of our economy, \nentire economy in this country is health care, headed toward one-fifth. \nSo we are going to hand the keys over to the Federal Government and \nallow them to control an enormously large component of the American \neconomy--one-sixth of it today and it will be one-fifth in just a few \nyears. It seems to me that would be a bad precedent and something, \nagain, that would lead us further and further down a path of greater \ncontrol for the Federal Government in our private economy. I don't \nthink that is good for health care for Americans. I don't think that is \ngood again for American business, for the economy or for our ability to \ncreate jobs.\n  The bill I introduced, as I said, is designed to get at the TARP \nmoneys that are going to be paid back in and hopefully getting the \ngovernment out of the car business, the government out of the banking \nbusiness, and the government out of the insurance business, but I also \nview those as almost what I would characterize as gateway drugs that \nare going to lead the way for the nationalization or the government \ntakeover of health care. A government plan is not a good way to do \nbusiness, and it is certainly not in the best interests of Americans, \nwho, I think, even though there may be those who want to see the costs \nof our current health care system come down, those who have coverage \ntoday, most of them would argue we have a system that is pretty \neffective; that when you need to get seen by a doctor, when you need to \nget treated, when you need to use some of the modern equipment and \ntechnology we have available and that is there today--and I think that \nis very much in jeopardy if you allow the government to intervene and \nto impose itself into that decisionmaking process and begin to ration \ncare.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6534-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6534-S6535]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEBT AND DEFICITS\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, one final point I wish to make is all of \nthis sort of ties back to what I think is the pattern, the precedent we \nhave seen so far in this Congress, and that is incredible amounts of \nspending, incredible amounts of borrowing. The stimulus bill started it \noff to the tune of about $800 billion. The budget we passed this year \non the discretionary, nondefense domestic side was 8.9 percent more \nyear over year than the previous year. The omnibus bill we passed--\nwhich was unfinished business from the last Congress--was 8.3 percent \nover the previous year, which, again, more than doubled the rate of \ninflation. We have all these Federal obligations and liabilities that \nare being created by virtue of these interventions in the marketplace. \nWe have the TARP program; we have all this taxpayer exposure out there, \nall this spending, and this year we know we are going to have a $1.8 \ntrillion deficit which dwarfs anything we have ever seen in history and \nas far as the eye can see. For the next decade, we are looking at about \na $1 trillion, on average, annual deficit.\n  Our debt to GDP is headed to historically high levels if predictions \nare accurate. I think the predictions are optimistic in terms of what \nwe are going to see in economic growth, unemployment, inflation, and \ninterest rates. Even if the projections with respect to the economic \nindicators are accurate, we are going to see, 10 years from now, the \npublic debt, as a percent of the GDP, reach over 80 percent--a rate we \nhave not seen literally since the end of World War II.\n  These are very troubling signs. I think they should be warning flags, \nwarning signs to the people in this country that this level of \nborrowing, the amount of spending, the amount of taxation, with the new \nobligations in the health care bill, is too much for our economy to \nbear and for the American taxpayer to bear.\n  What the President came out with earlier this week is a new \nannouncement that, all of a sudden, we have gotten religion, and we are \ngoing to submit all of the new spending and all of these programs now \nto what is known as pay-go. I will submit for the Record an editorial \nfrom the Wall Street Journal from a couple days ago.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 11, 2009]\n\n                         The ``Paygo'' Coverup\n\n       Some things in politics you can't make up, such as \n     President Obama's re-re-endorsement Tuesday of ``pay-as-you-\n     go'' budgeting. Coming after $787 billion in nonstimulating \n     stimulus, a $410 billion omnibus to wrap up fiscal 2009, a \n     $3.5 trillion 2010 budget proposal, sundry bailouts and a 13-\n     figure health-care spending expansion still to come, this \n     latest vow of fiscal chastity is like Donald Trump denouncing \n     self-promotion.\n       Check that. Even The Donald would find this one too much to \n     sell.\n       But Mr. Obama must think the press and public are dumb \n     enough to buy it, because there he was Tuesday re-selling the \n     same ``paygo'' promises that Democrats roll out every \n     election. Paygo is ``very simple,'' the President claimed. \n     ``Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar \n     elsewhere.''\n       That's what Democrats also promised in 2006, with Nancy \n     Pelosi vowing that ``the first thing'' House Democrats would \n     do if they took Congress was reimpose paygo rules that \n     ``Republicans had let lapse.'' By 2008, Speaker Pelosi had \n     let those rules lapse no fewer than 12 times, to make way for \n     $400 billion in deficit spending. Mr. Obama repeated the \n     paygo pledge during his 2008 campaign, and instead we have \n     witnessed the greatest peacetime spending binge in U.S. \n     history. As a share of GDP, spending will hit an astonishing \n     28.5% in fiscal 2009, with the deficit hitting 13% and \n     projected to stay at 4% to 5% for years to come.\n       The truth is that paygo is the kind of budget gimmick that \n     gives gimmickry a bad name. As Mr. Obama knows but won't tell \n     voters, paygo only applies to new or expanded entitlement \n     programs, not to existing programs such as Medicare, this \n     year growing at a 9.2% annual rate. Nor does paygo apply to \n     discretionary spending, set to hit $1.4 trillion in fiscal \n     2010, or 40% of the budget.\n       This loophole matters, because on the very day Mr. Obama \n     was hailing paygo the House Appropriations Committee was \n     gleefully approving a 12% increase in 2010 nondefense \n     discretionary spending, the third year running that Democrats \n     have proposed double-digit increases. Or consider that the \n     2010 budget resolution included a $2 billion increase for \n     low-income heating assistance as an entitlement change that \n     should be subject to paygo. But Congressional Democrats \n     simply classified it as discretionary spending, thereby \n     avoiding the need for $2 billion in cuts elsewhere. C'est-la-\n     paygo.\n       Mr. Obama's new proposal includes even more loopholes. \n     There's an exception for Congress's annual alternative-\n     minimum tax ``patch,'' which is worth at least $576 billion \n     over 10 years; for any of the Bush tax cuts that Mr. Obama \n     decides he wants to extend past 2010; and to protect against \n     planned cuts in Medicare doctor payments. These carve-outs \n     alone spare Democrats from having to come up with some $2.5 \n     trillion in spending cuts or new taxes. To add insult to \n     profligacy, the rules also allow the Administration to run \n     huge early deficits for its looming health-care bonanza, and \n     only pay for it later--say, after 2012.\n       The President also revived the myth that paygo was somehow \n     responsible for eliminating budget deficits during the \n     Clinton\n\n[[Page S6535]]\n\n     years. In fact, that brief era of balanced budgets was due \n     to: mid-decade spending reductions by a GOP Congress elected \n     on a balanced-budget pledge; an excessive cut in defense \n     spending to 3% from 5% of GDP across the decade; and an \n     unsustainable revenue boom due to the dot-com bubble. But \n     harking back to the 1990s lets Mr. Obama avoid having to \n     defend his own spending record.\n       The real game here is that the President is trying to give \n     Democrats in Congress political cover for the health-care \n     blowout and tax-increase votes that he knows are coming. The \n     polls are showing that Mr. Obama's spending plans are far \n     less popular than the President himself, and Democrats in \n     swing districts are getting nervous. The paygo ruse gives \n     Blue Dog Democrats cover to say they voted for ``fiscal \n     discipline,'' even as they vote to pass the greatest \n     entitlement expansion in modern history. The Blue Dogs always \n     play this double game.\n       The other goal of this new paygo campaign is to make it \n     easier to raise taxes in 2011, and impossible to cut taxes \n     for years after that. In the near term, paygo gives Mr. Obama \n     another excuse to let the Bush tax cuts he dislikes expire \n     after 2010, while exempting those (for lower-income voters) \n     that he likes. In the longer term, if a GOP Congress or \n     President ever want to cut taxes, paygo applies a \n     straitjacket that pits those tax cuts against, say, spending \n     cuts in Medicare. The Reagan tax reductions would never have \n     happened under paygo.\n       The main political question now is when Americans will \n     start to figure out Mr. Obama's pattern of spend, repent and \n     repeat. The President is still sailing along on his charm and \n     the fact that Americans are cheering for an economic \n     recovery. But eventually they'll see that he isn't telling \n     them the truth, and when they do, the very Blue Dogs he's \n     trying to protect will pay the price. And they'll deserve \n     what they get.\n\n  (Mr. BEGICH assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I will make a couple of observations they \nmade in that editorial, as well as similar observations made by some of \nmy colleagues in the Senate, since this announcement was made--that \npay-go is going to now be enforced--statutory pay-go.\n  This editorial from the Wall Street Journal said:\n\n       The truth is that paygo is the kind of budget gimmick that \n     gives gimmickry a bad name. As Mr. Obama knows but won't tell \n     voters, paygo only applies to new or expanded entitlement \n     programs, not to existing programs such as Medicare, which \n     this year is growing at a 9.2 percent annual rate. Nor does \n     paygo apply to discretionary spending, set to hit $1.4 \n     trillion in fiscal year 2010, or 40 percent of the entire \n     [Federal] budget.\n\n  Mr. President, the thing that strikes me about this announcement is, \nit seems it is, as is often said, too much, too little, too late. We \nalready passed an $800 billion stimulus bill, which we financed by \nborrowing from the next generation. That wasn't subject to pay-go nor \nhave many of the spending programs in the past couple of years been \nsubject to pay-go.\n  When the Democrats took control of the Congress after the 2006 \nelections, it was announced by Speaker Pelosi that they were going to \nenact pay-go--saying pay-go is going to be the policy, the rule \nfollowed in terms of the spending done by the Federal Government. But \nthat was quickly ignored. As I said before, if we look at the reality \nof what happened in the last few years, despite all the lipservice paid \nto pay-go, it doesn't apply all that much. It applies to new \nentitlement programs and to tax cuts, but as far as I can tell, it \ndoesn't apply to discretionary spending, to current entitlement \nspending, which, as I said earlier, is growing--Medicare at about a \n9.2-percent annual clip. So what is it really good for?\n  Well, it seems to me it is a statutory excuse to raise taxes. If we \ncontinue to exempt more and more things--one of the things we debated \nin the last year or two is whether an extension or exemption will be \nafforded to taxpayers from the AMT, which would capture more taxpayers, \nand whether it ought to be offset and paid for and the pay-go rules \nought to apply to it.\n  Well, the President, in his announcement a couple days ago, went so \nfar as to say he is going to exempt the AMT fix from pay-go. That is a \n$576 billion ticket item over a 10-year period. The AMT would be \nexempted. The physician fee fix would be exempted, which is something \nwe have had to do recently in Congress on a regular basis to protect \ndoctors from the cuts that would occur under statutes passed many years \nago. So we come in and we do what we call a physician fee fix. That \nwill be exempted from the pay-go rules.\n  So we would be carving out big chunks of Federal spending, of tax \nrelief, and there were a couple of other exemptions that were mentioned \nthat would be exempt from pay-go. If we take them off the table, and if \nwe take entitlement spending off the table--at least current, present \nentitlement spending--and we take discretionary spending off the table, \nit seems to me all we have done is, again, created this gimmick that is \ntrying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people that we \nare really doing something serious about fiscal responsibility which, \nin fact, we all know is not the case.\n  Mr. President, I hope we get serious about fiscal responsibility \nhere. It means we have to get our arms around spending. We cannot fix \nthe fiscal problems in this country when we exempt everything and say \nwe are going to continue to spend--in fact, the appropriations bill \npassed in the House of Representatives the other day; they passed one \nof their appropriations bills with a 12-percent increase over last \nyear. How can we justify that when we have a $1.8 trillion deficit this \nyear and an economy that is in recession? The Federal Government is \nsupposed to be leading the way, setting the example, and we cannot even \nlive within our means. We say we are going to implement pay-go and, \nboom, before the ink is even dry on whatever statement they may have \nsigned, we have a House Appropriations subcommittee passing an \nappropriations bill with a 12-percent year-over-year increase. And, \nagain, because discretionary spending is exempt from pay-go, what \ndifference does this announcement on pay-go really make, other than to \ntry to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people?\n  I hope the American people figure that out. I think they will. I \ncertainly know, around here at least, we get new data all the time \nabout the size of the deficit and what we are going to look at in the \nforeseeable future. It is a very disturbing picture. That is why I \nthink it is so important we get spending under control, that we get the \nFederal Government out of the private ownership of American business, \nand let American business do what it does best: create jobs and make \ntheir own management decisions, not the Federal Government, because it \ncontrols such a big part of these businesses, intervening and trying to \nimpose their political will on this decisionmaking process, and that we \ndo everything we can to prevent a government takeover of our health \ncare system, at a cost of somewhere between $1 trillion and $2 \ntrillion, which will inevitably lead to much higher taxes.\n  Somebody has to pay. These things all have to be paid for or we can \nborrow it, which is what we did with the stimulus bill. So we can have \nhigher taxes or more borrowing. I argue the spending has to stop. That \nis the only way we are going to get our fiscal house in order and make \nit clear to the American people we are serious in Washington about \ngetting spending under control. I hope we get a vote on my exit plan, \nmy bill. I think we need a plan to exit the scene and get government \nout of the ownership of large parts of the private economy and private \nbusinesses in this country. I hope we will do everything we can to \nprevent a government takeover of our health care system, which is one-\nsixth of our economy.\n  I also hope we will not fall for dumb gimmicks like pay-go, which do \nnothing to address, fundamentally, the financial and fiscal problems \nour country faces, but that we will get serious about getting spending \nunder control and putting America on a fiscal path toward fiscal \ndiscipline that is fair and responsible to the people in this country, \nwho pay these bills, the American taxpayers.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, our flag is the most recognizable \nsymbol of the United States, an instant wordless message freighted with \nhistory and meaning. The Stars and Stripes is much more than a war \nbanner. Each flag carries visions of smoke-clouded battles, to be sure, \nbut also visions of brave explorers venturing into new lands, \nastronauts landing on the moon, athletes celebrating Olympic victories, \nand of coffins carried on somber caissons to a final honored resting \nplace. Old Glory also marks every great American moment, from \npresidential inaugurations that celebrate the peaceful transition of \npower in our democracy to the defiant unfurling of flags over the \nbattered ruins of the Pentagon and the Twin Towers.\n  June 14 is Flag Day. Although flags fly every day in front of many \nFederal, State and local office buildings every day, and many flags are \ndisplayed on other holidays such as the Fourth of July, Memorial Day, \nand Veterans Day, only on Flag Day do we honor the flag itself.\n  The first national observance of Flag Day was in 1877, though it was \nnot until 1949 that President Truman signed into law legislation \nrecognizing the anniversary of the adoption, on June 14, 1777, by the \nContinental Congress, of the Stars and Stripes as the official flag of \nthe United States.\n  In earlier years, much more was done to mark the occasion of Flag \nDay. Schools educated students on the rituals and principles of \ncitizenship, and held patriotic programs to honor the flag. These days, \nit is enough to mark the day by flying the flag. I hope that many \nAmericans will do so, and do it properly--hoisting the flag up smartly, \nbringing it down reverently, and folding it away again properly. Once \nit is up and flapping in the breeze, take just a moment to admire it, \nor to say the Pledge of Allegiance.\n  On June 14, 1777, a congressional committee established the design of \nour flag in a few short words. The record notes simply that ``. . . the \nflag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes alternate red \nand white; that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, \nrepresenting a new constellation.'' In the years since, the number of \nstars in that constellation has expanded, but the brave ideals that it \nrepresents--that all men were created equal, endowed by their Creator \nwith certain unalienable rights including life, liberty and the pursuit \nof happiness--shine as true today as they have since 1776.\n  Our flag is a symbol that goes well beyond the cloth out of which it \nis fashioned. It is America, and long may it wave.\n  I close with a favorite poem of mine, by Henry Holcomb Bennett, that \nI like to recite on Flag Day. It never fails to stir my spirits, as I \nhope it does for those listening.\n\n                            The Flag Goes By\n\n                       (By Henry Holcomb Bennett)\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums,\n     A flash of color beneath the sky:\n     Hats off!\n     The flag is passing by!\n\n     Blue and crimson and white it shines,\n     Over the steel-tipped, ordered lines.\n     Hats off!\n     The colors before us fly;\n     But more than the flag is passing by.\n\n     Sea-fights and land-fights, grim and great,\n     Fought to make and to save the State:\n     Weary marches and sinking ships;\n     Cheers of victory on dying lips;\n\n     Days of plenty and years of peace;\n     March of a strong land's swift increase;\n     Equal justice, right, and law,\n     Stately honor and reverend awe;\n\n     Sign of a nation, great and strong\n     Toward her people from foreign wrong:\n     Pride and glory and honor,--all\n     Live in the colors to stand or fall.\n\n     Hats off!\n     Along the street there comes\n     A blare of bugles, a ruffle of drums;\n     And loyal hearts are beating high:\n     Hats off!\n     The Flag is passing by!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6536-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            XLIV COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN.

In accordance with rule XLIV, I provide the following \ninformation relating to my amendment. No. 1181, that was adopted by the \nSenate during consideration of H.R. 2346. The amendment will modify \ninterest limitations allowable in a State, as defined in 12 USC 1831 \nu(f), where the maximum rate of interest is not more than 5 percent \nabove the Federal Reserve discount rate--Arkansas. Specifically, it \nwill relax the maximum rate of interest allowed, increasing it to \nseventeen percent, effective from date of enactment through December \n31, 2010. The provision is generally applicable to any lending \noccurring within that state that is not conducted by an insured \ndepository institution.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on support of S. \n1233, the SBIR/STTR Reauthorization Act of 2009, a bipartisan measure I \nrecently introduced with Senator Landrieu. As former chair and now \nranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I have long championed critical small business \nprograms such as the Small Business Administration's Small Business \nInnovation Research, SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, \nSTTR, programs, which direct more than $2 billion in Federal research \nand development--R each year to\n\n[[Page S6537]]\n\nsmall businesses across our nation to encourage them to innovate and \ncommercialize new technologies, products, and services. Our legislation \nwould provide key improvements to the SBIR and STTR programs, which \nwere last reauthorized in 2000 and 2001, respectively.\n  As our Nation emerges from this devastating recession, the worst \nsince World War II, we must ensure that America once again brings to \nbear the kind of ingenuity, creativity, and innovation that made \nAmerica and our free market economy the greatest, most powerful on \nEarth. Indeed, innovation is the ``space race'' of the 21st century--\nonly this time it is not the U.S. versus Russia; it is the U.S. versus \nevery nation that is jockeying for the lead position and an economic \nfoothold.\n  The bill we have introduced will greatly help America win this race. \nIt is structured upon a comprehensive measure that our committee passed \nunanimously, on a bipartisan basis in both the 109th and 110th \nCongresses. Our legislation includes commonsense enhancements intended \nto incentivize more small businesses to participate in these vital \nprograms. The bill would increase the size of phase I program awards \nfrom $100,000 to $150,000, and phase II awards from $750,000 to $1 \nmillion. It would also peg future award increases to inflation. These \npivotal reforms represent a well-spring of indispensable technological-\nfuel to the small business engines that drive our Nation's innovation.\n  Since the SBIR program was created in 1982, small technology firms \nhave received more than 77,000 awards worth approximately $24 billion. \nThe SBIR program has tremendous job creation potential. A recent \nNational Academy of Sciences study, which focused on firms winning \nphase II SBIR awards in fiscal years 1992 through 2002 found that, as a \nresult of their SBIR award, small firms were able to hire an average of \n2.4 employees, retain 2.1 more, and over time these firms, on average, \neach generated 30 jobs.\n  Our legislation would increase the SBIR allocation--currently 2.5 \npercent of Federal agencies' extramural R funds--by 1 percent over 10 \nyears and double the STTR allocation over 5 years to 0.6 percent. By \ndoubling the percentage of Federal R dollars that the STTR program \nreceives each year, and increasing the SBIR percentage by 1 percent \nover 10 years, we will infuse another $1 billion into the small \nbusiness economy. With our economy reeling, the SBIR and STTR programs \nare more essential than ever, if we are to capitalize on the \ngroundbreaking capacities of our Nation's pioneering small businesses.\n  While innovation in areas such as genomics, biotechnology, and \nnanotechnology present new opportunities, converting these ideas into \nmarketable products involves substantial funding challenges. Many small \nbusinesses simply cannot afford the exorbitant cost of developing and \nbringing a product into the marketplace. In order to confront this \nchallenge, this legislation offers a compromise solution to the venture \ncapital issue that has recently divided members of this committee and \nthe SBIR community. Last Congress, I worked with Senators Kerry, Bond, \nLieberman, Coleman, and others, to develop a key compromise on this \nissue that would permit limited venture capital investment in the SBIR \nprogram.\n  Our bill retains this bipartisan compromise and would allow limited \ninvolvement of firms majority-owned by venture capital companies in the \nSBIR program. Specifically, a maximum of 18 percent of SBIR funding at \nthe National Institutes of Health and 8 percent at all other qualifying \nagencies may be directed to small firms majority-owned by venture \ncapital companies. Our compromise was strongly supported by the \nstakeholder community, and is consistent with the recent findings of \nthe National Academy of Sciences and Government Accountability Office \nregarding venture capital investment in SBIR awardees. Additionally, we \nleave in place well-established SBA ``affiliation'' rules designed to \npreserve the intent of the SBIR program by limiting participation to \nsmall businesses.\n  Other key provisions in this vital legislation include the \nreauthorization and enhancement of my SBIR Defense Commercialization \nPilot Program. Senator Kerry and I created this program in the 108th \nCongress to encourage the award of contracts to SBIR firms. In \naddition, we would offer this program to all other participating \nagencies. The bill also would reauthorize and increase funding from $2 \nmillion to $5 million for the Federal and State partnership program \nwhich would allow each state--including Maine--to receive funding in \nthe form of a grant to make available an array of services in support \nof the SBIR program.\n  Now, more than ever, we in Congress must do everything within our \npower to help small businesses drive the recovery of our economy. It is \nimperative that we reauthorize the SBIR and STTR programs, particularly \nbefore the program terminates at the end of July. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to pass this \nvital measure in the committee and full Senate, as we move forward to \nreauthorize these vital programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6537-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6537-S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF STANLEY McCHRYSTAL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I oppose the nomination of LTG Stanley \nMcChrystal to command U.S. forces in Afghanistan for two reasons. The \nfirst relates to a classified matter about which I have serious \nconcerns. I have conveyed those concerns in a letter to the President. \nThe second issue is interrogation.\n  At his public confirmation hearing, General McChrystal responded to a \nquestion from Chairman Levin regarding interrogation policies that \n``included stress positions, the use of dogs and nudity'' by stating \nthat ``[s]ome of them were in use when I took over, sir, and then, as \nwe immediately began to reduce that.'' When asked whether he was \n``uncomfortable with some of the techniques'' in use, he replied \n``[w]hen I took over, I was.''\n  However, following the hearing, Chairman Levin sent General \nMcChrystal a question for the record describing many of the 14 \ninterrogation techniques not listed in the Army Field Manual that were \nauthorized under General McChrystal's command, up until May 6, 2004, \nwhen CENTCOM Commander General John Abizaid suspended the use of all \nsuch techniques. Chairman Levin's question then described a request \nfrom General McChrystal, submitted 3 weeks after the suspension, to \ncontinue using a number of these techniques, including ``sleep \nmanagement,'' ``environmental manipulation,'' and ``control \npositions.'' The request defined ``control positions'' as ``requiring \nthe detainee to stand, sit, kneel, squat, maintain sitting position \nwith back against the wall, bend over chair, lean with head against \nwall, lie prone across chairs, stand with arms above head or raised to \nshoulders, or other normal physical training positions'' and requested \nthat ``in the most exceptional circumstances, and on approval from [the \ncommander]'' interrogators be allowed to ``use handcuffs to enforce the \ndetainee's position.''\n  Asked to square his public testimony with this record, General \nMcChrystal responded that, when he took command in 2003, he reviewed \nthe interrogation program and, in March 2004, ``reduc[ed] the frequency \nof use of several of the techniques'' by requiring high-level approval. \nHe also looked to ``increase the effectiveness of the entire process \nand make it more humane'' but offered no specifics other than \n``improved facilities'' and improvements in the use of other, non-\n``enhanced'' techniques. General McChrystal then acknowledged that he \npersonally requested approval from General Abizaid to continue using \nseveral of the techniques that had just been suspended, including \n``control positions.'' General Abizaid rejected the use of ``control \npositions,'' and, according to the Senate Armed Services Committee \nreport, the use of ``hooding.''\n  I have numerous concerns, both about this history and about General \nMcChrystal's public testimony. I have long opposed any interrogation \ntechniques, whether conducted by the U.S. military or the intelligence \ncommunity, that are not authorized by the Army Field Manual. I am thus \ndismayed by General McChrystal's personal support for the use of some \nof\n\n[[Page S6538]]\n\nthese techniques, particularly the so-called control positions, and by \nhis efforts to continue the techniques after they had been suspended. \nAnd, while I have no reason to believe that General McChrystal would \nnot adhere to current law and policy, I am troubled by his failure to \nexpress any regret for his previous positions. Finally, I am concerned \nabout General McChrystal's public testimony, which sought to convey \nthat he was ``uncomfortable'' with various interrogation techniques and \nsought to ``reduce'' their use. Given the full history of his approach \nto interrogations, this testimony appears to be incomplete, at best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6538-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     NORTHWESTERN'S NCAA CHAMPIONS\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure and sincere \npride that I congratulate the Northwestern University women's lacrosse \nteam on winning another NCAA Championship.\n  As a lifelong Illinoisan and an avid sports fan, I am happy to \ncelebrate the tremendous accomplishments of these young women.\n  In a crowded field of worthy contenders from across the Nation, this \nWildcat team rose to the occasion and claimed a fifth straight national \ntitle.\n  Their consistency, grit, and determination is exemplified by their \nperfect record for the season: 23 to 0, capped off by a resounding \nvictory over the third-ranked North Carolina Tar Heels.\n  The Northwestern women's lacrosse team also consistently ranks in the \ntop 10 to 15 percent of academic achievement in the NCAA's Annual \nAcademic Report.\n  It is clear from their record that the Wildcats excelled every time \nthey took the field, but, more importantly, they excelled in the \nclassroom and in the community.\n  I am proud of this team because they recognized that ``student'' is \nsupposed to come before ``athlete'' in the phrase ``student athlete.''\n  For many athletes, college sports have become a launching pad for \nfame and fortune, but on this team you may find doctors, lawyers, and \nmaybe even a senator or two.\n  Although the games may not have been broadcast to a national audience \nor as widely covered by the media, the women's lacrosse team deserves \njust as much recognition as their male counterparts.\n  They have sacrificed sleep for early morning workouts, weekends for \ncompetition, and played a sport that practically requires the \ncommitment of a full-time job, but all the while, they continued to \nattend class and maintain their studies.\n  College athletics require a remarkable amount of dedication, and this \nteam deserves notable recognition even if their scores weren't reported \non the nightly news or the front page of newspapers. Their demonstrated \ncharacter and sportsmanship marks them as role models for aspiring \nathletes throughout the State. Their athletic performance and strong \nrecord of academic achievement place them at the pinnacle of \nintercollegiate success. Although several players may be honored with \nindividual awards, this national title belongs to each and every member \nof the team.\n  This victory reminds us that we have the chance to shine only with \nthe support of our comrades, our friends, our teammates. It is through \npersistent and concerted effort that we reach our potential, and when \nwe inevitably fall, it is only through the strength and grace of our \nfriends that we can pick ourselves up and journey onward.\n  The teamwork displayed by these young women throughout the season, \neven under mounting pressure and enormous expectations, allowed them to \ncarry the day. They have done their university, and their State, proud. \nWe should all draw inspiration from their fine example.\n  With this championship, the Northwestern Wildcats have cemented their \nposition as the top Lacrosse program in the country. They are quickly \napproaching the record of seven consecutive titles currently held by \nMaryland, and, like many Illinoisans, I can hardly wait for what will \nsurely be an exciting season next year.\n  It is with great pride that Senator Durbin and I come together to \ncelebrate this national championship. And we are proud to offer a \nSenate resolution congratulating these talented athletes.\n  In the spirit of good sportsmanship displayed by the Northwestern \nwomen's lacrosse team throughout the season, I ask my colleagues to \njoin with us in congratulating these student athletes on their \nremarkable accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6538-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6538]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       COMMENDING JOSHUA FAIRLEY\n\n Mr. COCHRAN.

Blunt. \nFew early railroad towns in South Dakota were able to boast of the wide \nvariety of early establishments, including 6 hotels, 12 grocers, 9 \nlumber yards, 5 saloons, and 4 bakeries.\n  Today, Blunt has come a long way from its days as a railroad supply \ncenter. The town still boasts a variety of businesses, including those \nin both the service and manufacturing sectors. The Graham Mentor Museum \nand the REA building are just two examples of continuous efforts to \nbring the community closer.\n  The people of Blunt celebrate this momentous occasion on the weekend \nof June 26-28, 2009. South Dakota's small communities are the bedrock \nof our economy and vital to the future of our State. It is especially \nbecause of our small communities, and the feelings of loyalty and \nfamiliarity that they engender, that I am proud to call South Dakota \nhome. Towns like Blunt and its citizens are no different and truly know \nwhat it means to be South Dakotan. One hundred and twenty-five years \nafter its founding, Blunt remains a vital community and a great asset \nto the wonderful State of South Dakota. I am proud to honor Blunt on \nthis historic milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6538-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6538-S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              150TH ANNIVERSARY OF ELK POINT, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

Eli Wixson built a cabin in 1859, becoming the first citizen of \nElk Point.\n  Today, Elk Point's location makes it an ideal location for a variety \nof businesses with two Interstate 29 exits, a railway hub with service \nin three directions, and close proximity to the Missouri River for both \neconomic and entertainment purposes.

This historic church has been a cornerstone of both the \ncommunity and the Synod. Immanuel Lutheran Church has seen its share of \nstruggles, but has always grown stronger from them. Today, I pay \ntribute to both the anniversary of the church and to the members who \nhave kept its traditions of service and faith alive for 150 years.\n  The church was founded in 1884 with Rev. J. Reyhout as its pastor. \nThe members, mainly German immigrants, joined the Ohio Synod and built \nthe first church in 1891. The current church was completed in 1914. \nKnown as the ``German Church'' or ``German Lutheran'', the \ncongregation's welcome spirit for recent immigrants led to services \nbeing held in German. In 1940, they transitioned to every other week in \nEnglish and German. In 1952, German services were discontinued. \nImmanuel joined the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in 1988 on \nits founding.\n  Although changes have been coming to this community since its \nfounding, Immanuel Lutheran Church has held steady to the core values \nthat it was founded on. With outreach to the prison, food shelters, and \nthe community, these members have maintained the initial ideals of \nservice and devotion. I congratulate this congregation on reaching this \nmonumental anniversary, and look forward to the future as they continue \ntheir traditions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6539-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6539]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               125TH ANNIVERSARY OF LEBANON, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

In 1889, the Standing Rock \nReservation was formed, with McLaughlin at the center of the \nreservation on the South Dakota side. The town was named after MAJ \nJames McLaughlin, a superintendent of Standing Rock, and the town was \nofficially incorporated October 7, 1909.

The \nRevillo flour mill was built in 1904, where farmers would bring their \nwheat crop to have it made into Monogram flour to meet their annual \nneeds. In the years before World War I, Revillo was booming with \nbusinesses, including two implement dealers, a drug store, two banks, \nthree elevators, and an Opera House.\n  Today, Revillo is maintaining its history with four churches in town, \nmany members having a lineal connection to those who first established \nthe churches.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \noutstanding humanitarian assistance recently provided by Company C, \n153rd Infantry of the Arkansas National Guard.\n  In early April, Mena, AR, was hit by an F3 tornado which devastated \nthis small town in western Arkansas. These severe storms killed 3, \ninjured more than 100, and left thousands of residents without power. \nThe tornado also damaged important emergency response centers in the \ntown and county, including the hospital, the police and fire \ndepartments, and the courthouse, which houses the 911 emergency \ndispatch center.\n  However, under the leadership of CPT Rodney Lay, Company C of the \n153rd Infantry, including team leaders 1LT Brian Lawrence Inman, 1SG \nEric Schnell, SSG James Schnell, SSG Jacob Sullivan, SSG Neal Badger, \nand WO Jeffrey Shores, helped to immediately restore order to the \ndevastated community. Company C provided downtown security during the \naftermath of the tornado and went door to door to check on area \ncitizens. In addition, they provided aid to victims of the storm that \ncould not be transported to the city's hospital.\n  Our military simply could not function without the thousands of \nreservists and guardsmen on bases and armories in communities across \nthis country.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \ntransition to the use of metropolitan statistical areas as fee schedule \nareas for the physician fee schedule in California under the Medicare \nprogram; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation to \ncorrect a longstanding flaw in the Medicare Geographic Practice Cost \nIndex, GPCI, system that negatively impacts physicians in California \nand several other states.\n  This legislation will base California physician payments on \nMetropolitan Statistical Areas, MSAs. Hospital payments are developed \nthis way, and it makes sense to pay our doctors in the same manner.\n  It holds harmless the counties, predominately rural ones, whose \nlocality average would otherwise drop as other counties are \nreclassified.\n  Congressman Sam Farr, along with several California colleagues, is \nintroducing companion legislation.\n  The Medicare Geographic Practice Cost Index measures the cost of \nproviding a Medicare covered service in a geographic area. Medicare \npayments are supposed to reflect the varying costs of rent, malpractice \ninsurance, and other expenses necessary to operate a medical process. \nCounties are assigned to ``payment localities'' that are supposed to \naccurately capture these costs.\n  Here is the problem. Some of these payment localities have not \nchanged since 1997. Others have been in place since 1966. Many areas \nthat were rural even 10 years ago have experienced significant \npopulation growth, as metropolitan areas and suburbs have spread. Many \ncounties now find themselves in payment localities that do not \naccurately reflect their true practice costs.\n  These payment discrepancies have a real and serious impact on \nphysicians and the Medicare beneficiaries they are unable to serve. My \nhome State of California has been hit particularly hard.\n  San Diego County physicians are underpaid by 4 percent. A number of \nphysicians have left the county and 60 percent of remaining San Diego \nphysicians report that they cannot recruit new doctors to their \npractices.\n  Santa Cruz County receives an 8.6 percent underpayment, and as a \nresult, no physicians are accepting new Medicare patients. Instead, \nthey are moving to neighboring Santa Clara, which has similar practice \ncost expense, but is reimbursed at a much higher rate. This means that \nseniors often need to travel at least 20 miles to see a physician.\n  Sacramento County, a major metropolitan area, is underpaid by 2.7 \npercent. The county's population has grown by 9.6 percent, while the \nnumber of physicians has declined by 11 percent.\n  Sonoma County physicians are paid at least 6.2 percent less than \ntheir geographic practice costs. They have experienced at 10 percent \ndecline in specialists and a 9 percent decline in primary care \nphysicians.\n  Health care coverage is not the same as access to health care. \nSeniors' Medicare cards are of no value if physicians in their \ncommunity cannot afford to provide them with health care.\n  Physicians deserve to be fairly compensated for the work they \nperform. California doctors simply want to be compensated at the \ncorrect rate for the practice expenses they face.\n  This is not too much to ask.\n  The underpayment problem grows more severe every year, and the longer \nwe wait to address it, the more drastic the solution will need to be. \nThis legislation provides a common sense solution, increasing payment \nfor those facing the most drastic underpayments, while protecting other \ncounties from cuts in the process.\n  This is an issue of equity. It costs more to provide health care in \nexpensive areas, and physicians serving our seniors must be fairly \ncompensated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1236\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``GPCI Justice Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) From 1966 through 1991, the Medicare program paid \n     physicians based on what they charged for services. The \n     Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 1989 required the establishment \n     of a national Medicare physician fee schedule, which was \n     implemented in 1992, replacing the charge-based system.\n       (2) The Medicare physician fee schedule currently includes \n     more than 7000 services together with their corresponding \n     payment rates. In addition, each service on the fee schedule \n     has three relative value units (RVUs) that correspond to the \n     three physician payment components of physician work, \n     practice expense, and malpractice expense.\n       (3)(A) Each geographically adjusted RVU measures the \n     relative costliness of providing a particular service in a \n     particular location referred to as a locality. Physician \n     payment localities are primarily consolidations of the \n     carrier-defined localities that were established in 1966.\n       (B) When physician payment localities were redesignated in \n     1997, the Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & \n     Medicaid Services acknowledged that the new payment locality \n     configuration had not been established on a consistent \n     geographic basis. Some were based on zip codes or \n     Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs) while others were based \n     on political boundaries, such as cities, counties, or States.\n       (C) The Medicare program has not revised the geographic \n     boundaries of the physician payment localities since the 1997 \n     revision.\n       (4) Medicare's geographic adjustment for a particular \n     physician payment locality is determined using three GPCIs \n     (Geographic Practice Cost Indices) that also correspond to \n     the three Medicare physician payment components of physician \n     work, practice expense, and malpractice expense.\n       (5) The major data source used in calculating the GPCIs is \n     the decennial census which provides new data only once every \n     10 years.\n       (6) This system of geographic payment designation has \n     resulted in more than half of the current physician payment \n     localities having counties within them with a large payment \n     difference of 5 percent or more. A disproportionate number of \n     these underpaid counties are located in California, Georgia, \n     Minnesota, Ohio, and Virginia.\n       (7) For purposes of payment under the Medicare program, \n     hospitals are organized and reimbursed for geographic costs \n     according to MSAs.\n       (8) Studies by the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission \n     (MedPAC) in 2007, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     in 2007, the Urban Institute in 2008, and Acumen LLC in 2008 \n     have all documented this physician GPCI payment discrepancy--\n     specifically that more than half of the current physician \n     payment localities had counties within them with a large \n     payment difference (that is, a payment difference of 5 \n     percent or more) between GAO's measure of physicians' costs \n     and Medicare's geographic adjustment for an area. All these \n     objective studies have recommended changes to the locality \n     system to correct the payment discrepancies.\n       (9) A common recommendation among the GPCI payment \n     discrepancy studies referred to in paragraph (8) is to \n     eliminate the county-based locality and replace it with one \n     determined by Metropolitan Statistical Area.\n\n[[Page S6546]]\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend section 340B of the Public Health Service \nAct to revise and expand the drug discount program under that section \nto improve the provision of discounts on drug purchases for certain \nsafety net providers; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleague from \nSouth Dakota, Sen. Thune, to introduce the 340B Program Improvement and \nIntegrity Act of 2009. This legislation is designed to address the \ngrowing burden faced by our Nation's health care safety net \ninstitutions in being able to provide adequate pharmaceutical care to \nthe most vulnerable patient populations.\n  Communities across the country rely on public and non-profit \nhospitals to serve as the health care ``safety net'' for low-income, \nuninsured, and underinsured patients. With the ever-increasing cost of \npharmaceuticals, these institutions are struggling more and more to \nprovide basic pharmaceutical care to those least able to afford it.\n  Fortunately, many safety net hospitals are currently able to \nparticipate in the federal 340B Drug Discount Program, which enables \nthem to purchase outpatient drugs for their patients at discounted \nprices. These hospitals, known as ``covered entities'' under the 340B \nstatute, include high-Medicaid disproportionate share hospitals, DSH, \nlarge and small urban hospitals, and certain rural hospitals.\n  I am introducing legislation today, the 340B Program Improvement and \nIntegrity Act of 2009, which would extend discounted drug prices \ncurrently mandated only for outpatient drugs to inpatient drugs \npurchased by covered entities under the 340B program. Although the \nMedicare Modernization Act (MMA) of 2003 permitted pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers to offer 340B drug discounts to covered entities, this \nlegislation did not include a mandate. Without a mandate we have seen \nvery little willingness on the part of manufactures to offer 340B drug \ndiscounts for inpatient drugs. As the prices of pharmaceutical drugs \ncontinue to increase sharply, the need for these inpatient discounts \ngrows more and more acute.\n  My legislation would also allow expanded participation in the program \nto a subset of rural hospitals that, for a variety of reasons, cannot \ncurrently access 340B discounts. These newly eligible rural hospitals \ninclude: critical access hospitals, sole community hospitals, and rural \nreferral centers. In proposing this modest expansion to the program, we \nhave struck an important balance between ensuring a close nexus with \nlow-income and indigent care, ensuring that a significant portion of \nsavings are passed on to the Medicaid program, and strengthening the \nintegrity of the program.\n  Specifically, newly eligible rural hospitals would have to meet \nappropriate standards demonstrating their ``safety net'' status, as do \nall hospitals that currently participate in the program. For example, \nsole community hospitals and rural referral centers, all of which are \npaid under the prospective payment system, would be required under this \nlegislation to serve a significant percentage of low-income and \nindigent patients, have public or non-profit status, and, if privately \nowned and operated, to have a contract with state or local government \nto provide a significant level of indigent care. All standards are \ndesigned to reinforce the obligation of these covered entities to \ncontinue serving low-income and uninsured patients.\n  This legislation would also generate savings for the Medicaid program \nby requiring participating hospitals to credit to their State Medicaid \nprogram a percentage of their savings on inpatient drugs. It would \naddress the overall efficiency and integrity of the 340B program \nthrough improved enforcement and compliance measures with respect to \nmanufacturers and covered entities. This is designed to improve program \nadministration and to prevent and remedy instances of program abuse.\n  The 340B Program Improvement and Integrity Act of 2009 would help \nsafety net providers stretch their limited resources through increased \naccess to discounted pharmaceuticals, enhance 340B program integrity by \nmaking sure participants are complying with program rules, and improve \nthe care provided to this Nation's most vulnerable populations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend Public Law 106-206 to direct the Secretary \nof the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture to require annual \npermits and assess annual fees for commercial filming activities on \nFederal land for film crews of 5 persons or fewer; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am introducing legislation today with \nSenator Tester to lessen the burdens for small commercial filming on \npublic lands. Specifically, this legislation provides special \npermitting to small film crews, defined in the bill as 5 persons or \nfewer, to simply pay a reasonable annual fee to be able to film on \npublic lands.\n  Our Nation's public lands are an incredible natural resource, and the \nprofessional outdoor media industry is a valuable way to bring \nawareness to our Nation's resources and bring about awareness of the \nvalue of conservation of our Nation's land and resources through \ndocumentaries, sporting programs, and other productions. Small filming \ncrews can be negatively affected by the current permitting and fee \nschedule because the business of wildlife filming is done on a \nspeculative basis and often relies on unpredictable factors requiring \nmuch patience and time. Last Congress, Chairman Rahall held a Natural \nResources Committee hearing on the fees for filming and photography on \npublic lands. At that hearing, Steve Scott, an independent television \nproducer from Norman, OK, and Chairman of the Professional Outdoor \nMedia Association, probably best described the work of small outdoor \nfilming operations. He testified, ``By its very nature, wildlife \nphotography is extremely time consuming, often done in the harshest \nconditions. . . . While large film and television production crews need \nrelatively little time on public lands to complete their project, our \nnation's professional outdoor media may spend weeks or months in the \nfield in order to capture a few magic seconds of unstaged Nature in its \npristine state. And when outdoor media members spend time in the field, \nunder the current fee structure, we also spend money, and lots of it.'' \nThe small professional outdoor filming industry has enough natural \nbarriers; The Federal Government should not impose itself as another \nthrough daily fees adding to the expense.\n  Last Congress, my colleague from Oklahoma, Congressman Dan Boren, and \nDon Young, introduced H.R. 5502 to\n\n[[Page S6549]]\n\naccomplish the same aim of the legislation Senator Tester and I are \nintroducing today. That legislation was supported by nearly 30 outdoors \nand sportsmen's organizations.\n  Those organizations supporting last Congress' legislation include the \nAmerican Fisheries Society, the American Sportfishing Association, the \nArchery Trade Association, Bass Pro Shops, the Berkley Conservation \nInstitute, Boone and Crockett Club, Bowhunting Preservation Alliance, \nCampfire Club of America, Catch-A-Dream Foundation, the Congressional \nSportsmen's Foundation, Conservation Force, Dallas Safari Club, Mule \nDeer Foundation, the National Assembly of Sportsmen's Caucuses, the \nNational Rifle Association, the National Shooting Sports Foundation, \nthe National Wild Turkey Federation, the North American Bear \nFoundation, the North American Grouse Partnership, Pheasants Forever, \nPure Fishing, Quality Deer Management Association, Quail Forever, the \nRuffed Grouse Society, Safari Club International, the Texas Wildlife \nAssociation, the Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership, the U.S. \nSportsmen's Alliance, the Wild Sheep Foundation, and Wildlife Forever.\n  This Congress, Congressmen Boren, Ryan, Courtney, Miller, Putnam, and \nRoss introduced H.R. 2031 on April 22, 2009, which is identical \nlegislation to the legislation Senator Tester and I are introducing \ntoday. I am sure it will enjoy the same support from our outdoor and \nsportsmen's organizations, and I look forward to its consideration in \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1241\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the Federal Government from holding \nownership interests, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, over the past 15 months, the Federal \nGovernment has taken unprecedented actions to stabilize the U.S. \neconomy. Unfortunately, these actions include the Federal Government \nacquiring direct ownership stakes in private companies, which exposes \nthe American taxpayer to significant liabilities and creates a \ndangerous conflict of interest between the Federal Government and the \nprivate sector.\n  Thanks to the fact that the government has intervened in all these \nprivate companies, we now have about 500 banks, we have auto \nmanufacturers, financial institutions, and insurance companies that the \ngovernment now has an ownership interest in. President Obama has become \na de facto CEO managing large segments of our economy, and Congress is \nnow acting as a 535-Member board of directors.\n  I think it is fair to say when you combine business with politics, it \ninevitably leads to harmful conflicts of interest--which we are already \nbeginning to see--because political decisions get substituted for \nbusiness decisions.\n  As everyone in this Chamber knows all too well, government control of \nprivate business hampers investments. It hampers innovation, job \ncreation. It diminishes the entrepreneurial spirit on which our economy \nis based.\n  Having the Federal Government call the shots for private industry is \nplain bad for business. It is bad for the economy, and it is bad for \nthe American taxpayer.\n  So today I am introducing a piece of legislation, S. 1242, which \ngives the Federal Government an exit plan, a way of exiting the scene \nfrom the ownership that the Federal Government now has in all these \nvarious private companies in our economy. It essentially has four basic \nprovisions.\n  The first provision is that upon enactment of the legislation, the \nTreasury Department may not purchase any additional ownership stake of \nprivate entities, such as warrants, preferred stock, or common stock \npurchased through the TARP program.\n  The second provision is this: The legislation would require the \nTreasury to sell any ownership stake of a private entity by July 1, \n2010. Any revenue that comes in from the sale of those TARP assets \nwould have to be used for debt reduction.\n  The third provision of the bill is that if the Treasury Secretary \ndetermines the assets are undervalued and there is a reasonable \nexpectation that the assets will increase to their original purchase \nvalue, the Secretary may hold the assets for up to 1 additional year.\n  Finally, the fourth provision of the bill is that beyond July 1 of \n2011, the Treasury Secretary may not hold any direct ownership of \nprivate companies unless Congress grants additional authority.\n  Essentially, what we are doing is saying that all this ownership \ninterest the Federal Government now has acquired in all these private \ncompanies would have to be wound down, if you will, divested, by that \nJuly 1 deadline in the year 2010. If the Treasury Department determines \nthat, in fact, doing so would impair the ability of the Treasury to \nrecover the full value of those assets or if those assets are expected \nto appreciate, there is an additional year, up to a year of \nflexibility--essentially a waiver--from the July 1, 2010, deadline that \nwould extend it to July 1, 2011. So it buys an additional year. But it \ndoes put a time certain out there, a deadline, if you will, by which \nthe Federal Government has to dispose of and divest itself of all these \nownership interests it has in our private economy.\n  The other issue I think is important is it prevents the Federal \nGovernment from acquiring an ownership stake going into the future. As \nI said before, any funds that are returned to the Treasury as a result \nof these assets being sold would have to be used for debt reduction. \nThey cannot be recycled; they cannot be reused; they cannot go into \nsome fund that is going to be used for additional acquisition of \nprivate sector assets.\n  I think the reason why this is important is if you look at what \nSecretary Geithner has said, he has indicated before that their \nintention is that when\n\n[[Page S6550]]\n\nsome of these funds come back into the Treasury--and we saw this \nrecently with banks that agreed to pay this money back--they are going \nto reuse it. I don't believe that is what was intended in the first \nplace. I don't think this was at any point designed to become a slush \nfund that could be used for the acquisition of other assets; it was \ndesigned to be used--at least initially, the way it was presented--for \nthe purchase of toxic assets, illiquid assets on the balance sheets of \nmany of our financial institutions. It quickly evolved into something \nelse. It became a fund that was used to acquire an equity stake, equity \ninterest in many of these companies. So I don't think that was the \npurpose for which it was intended.\n  I think a lot of people who made votes assumed at the time it \nwouldn't be used to buy toxic assets. It ended up being used to buy an \nownership interest in these companies, and I think, again, the American \npeople are uncomfortable with the notion of the Federal Government \nowning a big share of our private economy. I also do not think it was \nintended in the first place to be used to buy the assets of other types \nof industries--essentially, to do industrial policy, as some people \nhave referred to it--to acquire assets of auto manufacturers, for \nexample; it was designed specifically for the financial services \nindustry.\n  There is no real exit strategy out there. In fact, Secretary Geithner \nwas asked in front of the Senate Banking Committee a couple weeks ago \nabout whether there was a plan to dispose of some of these assets, and \nhe said there isn't a plan; it is not necessary at this point.\n  Well, I think we need to have an exit strategy. Everybody talks about \nan exit strategy. The President needs an exit strategy in Iraq. It \nseems to me we need to have an exit strategy that would allow the \nAmerican taxpayer to recover funds they have been investing through the \nTARP program in all these various companies that would get the Federal \nGovernment out of the way of these companies and out of the day-to-day \ndecisionmaking and management of these companies. My bill would \nprohibit that as well, in addition to some of these other provisions I \nmentioned.\n  It would prohibit or bar the Federal Government from dictating to \nthese companies with respect to hiring decisions when it comes to \nsenior executives, when it comes to boards of directors, when it comes \nto where to relocate or locate or close certain plants. Those are \ndecisions that should not be made by politicians in Washington. They \nshould not be made by bureaucrats in Washington, DC. They ought to be \nbusiness decisions and not political decisions.\n  The bill, as I said, is very straightforward.\n  There are a number of folks who have commented on, made observations \nabout what is happening in the economy right now, and this sort of \nproliferation of companies in which the Federal Government now has an \nownership share. I wish to read for my colleagues some of what has been \nsaid by folks who I think know a lot about the private economy and \nwhether it is a good idea to have the Federal Government owning and \ncontrolling as much as they do currently of some of these companies. If \nyou look at the various percentages, they are significant. Of course, \nwe know most recently General Motors, a $50 billion investment there \ngets the taxpayer ownership interest to about 60 percent; Chrysler, \nabout 12 percent; Citibank, about 36 percent, and you can go down the \nlist of all these various private companies in which the government now \nhas an ownership interest.\n  There was an editorial in the Kansas City Star that said that:\n\n       What's worrisome is that while the administration said it \n     isn't interested in running car companies, it has said little \n     on an exit strategy.\n\n  It went on to say:\n\n       Any government bailout of private industry should be \n     temporary and as brief as possible.\n\n  Anne Mulcahy, chief executive of Xerox--I am sure I just butchered \nthe name--said recently:\n\n       I think all of us understand the need for the government to \n     intervene and to take the actions they did, but I also think \n     there's a need for an exit plan.\n\n  Jim Owens, who is the chief executive at Caterpillar, said:\n\n       I think that's fundamentally unhealthy. The Federal \n     Government needs to be in and out.\n\n  Google's Eric Schmidt noted that the U.S. stimulus package was \ndesigned to cover a 2-year period. He said:\n\n       It's very important that government get out of business and \n     let business do its thing. The most important thing to \n     remember, I think, is that jobs, wealth, are created in the \n     private sector. That's about capitalism.\n\n  In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, Paul Ingrassia argues:\n\n       . . . must have a clear exit timetable for the government \n     to sell its shares for both Chrysler and GM and get the \n     companies back in the hands of private investors. Mr. Obama \n     has an exit strategy for Iraq; he needs one for Detroit, too.\n\n  So there are a lot of people who have a lot of experience when it \ncomes to running companies who have concluded that the government does, \nin fact, need an exit strategy. I think, as I said before, it is fair \nto say that one doesn't exist today, and when Secretary Geithner \ntestified in front of the Senate Banking Committee a couple weeks back \nhe admitted as much, that there isn't an exit plan.\n  What my bill does is it gives us an exit plan. It gives us an exit \nplan with a deadline, with a little flexibility in the deadline, some \nability to provide a waiver for the Treasury Department that would \nallow for an additional year, if necessary; if those assets the \ngovernment holds are considered to be assets that could appreciate over \ntime and, therefore, yield a higher return for the Federal Government \nbut, at some point, we have to say enough is enough. We have to put an \nend to this practice we have gotten involved with, this precedent we \nhave now created of having the Federal Government own more and more of \nour private economy.\n  I would argue, again, that is not good for business, it is not good \nfor the economy, it is not good for job creation; it stifles the \nentrepreneurial spirit which has built this country and made it great, \nand I don't think it does anything to create jobs and get our economy \nback on track.\n  I hope we will have an opportunity to debate this. It seems to me at \nleast that in the days ahead there will be various bills that will be \ndebated on the floor of the Senate that would give us a chance to \ndebate this issue. I intend to offer this, if I can't get some interest \nin moving it as a freestanding bill, as an amendment to other vehicles \nthat might be moving through the Senate in the days and the weeks and \nthe months ahead. But I do think it is important. I think it is \nimportant to the American taxpayer. I think it is important to the \nAmerican economy. I think it is important to American business that the \nFederal Government have an exit strategy. We have a plan whereby we can \nmove and get away from this practice we have undertaken now with great \nregularity and great frequency of acquiring even more and more \ninterests in American business.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln):\n  S. 1243. A bill to require repayments of obligations and proceeds \nfrom the sale of assets under the Troubled Asset Relief Program to be \nrepaid directly into the Treasury for reduction of the public debt; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Stop TARP \nAsset Recycling Act, or the STAR Act, a bill that would require any \nfunds returned to the Treasury Department that were originally \nallocated under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, to be placed \nin the general fund rather than being put back into TARP. I am proud to \nsay that this is a bipartisan bill, cosponsored by my friend from \nArkansas, Senator Lincoln.\n  It is apparent that TARP has become a slush fund for the Obama \nadministration to acquire banks, insurance companies and auto \nmanufacturers. We need to ensure that the original purpose of TARP is \nmaintained and Treasury is prevented from unilaterally and arbitrarily \nnationalizing our nation's private sector.\n  The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, which was signed into law \nlast October, created TARP. This act authorized TARP to purchase up to \n$700 billion in troubled assets from financial institutions ``to \nrestore liquidity and stability to the financial system.'' However, \nsince its inception,\n\n[[Page S6551]]\n\nTARP has taken on a different role in our free enterprise system. It \nseems to have become the go-to solution for all of our problems. It has \nbeen used to bail out banks, insurance companies and automobile \nmanufacturers. What is next, Mr. President?\n  Some of our healthier banks are now returning this money because, I \nbelieve, of the unreasonable regulations that have been and could be \nplaced on firms with TARP funds. While it is clear that proceeds from \nTARP sales must be placed in the general fund to pay down our \nincreasing debt, it is unclear under the law whether or not the \noriginal investment from TARP must be placed in the general fund or can \nbe recycled back into TARP. The latter option would result in an ever-\nrevolving slush fund for TARP and could provide this administration \nwith the means to pick and choose which company it would next like to \nnationalize.\n  For example, the Treasury Department recently used $30 billion to \npurchase up to 60 percent of General Motors' shares. If, in the future, \nTreasury sells these shares at a gain, let us say $32 billion, the $2 \nbillion profit must be put back into the general fund, but it is \nunclear whether the original $30 billion investment recovered from the \nsale can be put back into TARP.\n  I do not believe any of my colleagues intended TARP to get this out \nof control. It is time that we reestablish the purpose of TARP by \nrequiring Treasury to put the original investment back into the general \nfund. Congress must no longer stand by and watch Treasury amass an \neverlasting fund it can use to bail out any industry it deems ``too big \nto fail'' without congressional approval.\n  Ten large banks have recently received Treasury approval to repay $68 \nbillion received under TARP. I believe now is the time to start \nrestricting Treasury's access to these funds. My bill would force \nTreasury to put this money back into the general fund once it is used. \nIt would not prevent Treasury from using up to $700 billion already \nauthorized under TARP, but it would force Treasury to make sure that \nthe taxpayers' investment is spent wisely.\n  The American taxpayer has been told to foot the bill for rescuing the \nfinancial sector, but now they are being forced to bail out any company \nat the discretion of the Department of Treasury. Many Utahns are saying \nit is time to be fiscally conservative, and I agree. So do millions \nelsewhere across the Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues would agree as well and support this \nlegislation; otherwise, we have not only written a blank check to \nTreasury, but we have delegated an enormous amount of power over our \nfree enterprise system. This money belongs to the people, not the Obama \nadministration. I think it is time Congress acts to ensure that TARP is \nbeing used for its intended purpose.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY:\n  S. 1244. A bill to amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to protect \nbreastfeeding by new mothers, to provide for a performance standard for \nbreast pumps, and to provide tax incentives to encourage breastfeeding; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill to help \npromote and protect breastfeeding in the workplace.\n  The science is undisputable--babies who are breastfed the first 6 \nmonths of life have a greatly reduced risk for acute and chronic \ndisease--yet only ten percent of all infants receive this nourishment \nthat they need to remain healthy. One of the primary reasons for this \nis that working moms face real and serious challenges to expressing \nmilk when they return to work.\n  Well, today is a day to change that. In Oregon, we have enacted \nstrong legislation to make sure that working moms are afforded the time \nand space they need at work to express milk. In fact, my first event as \na candidate for U.S. Senate was at a luncheon celebrating the success \nof Oregon's breastfeeding promotion law. I said that day that I would \nwork to expand Oregon's efforts nationwide, and today we take the \nimportant first step towards enacting legislation to protect working \nmoms across the country.\n  First, I want to thank Representative Carolyn Maloney of New York for \nher strong leadership on this issue. For years, she has been a champion \nfor working moms everywhere, and I applaud her determination to make it \neasier for women.\n  We know that 72 percent of moms work full time, and that number is \ngrowing. In fact, according to the Center on Work and Family at Boston \nCollege, the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. workforce is women \nwith children under three years of age.\n  Women who decide to breastfeed often face unique challenges and at \ntimes, social stigmas, for trying to give their baby the healthiest \nstart in life.\n  In an environment where mothers return to work as early as 3 to 6 \nweeks post-partum, often driven by economic necessity, it is simply an \nact of human decency to protect their right to continue breastfeeding \nafter they return to work to help meet their basic needs with regard to \nthe care and nourishment of their children. But for most, it is an \nunachievable goal.\n  If we are to have any hope of increasing the number of babies being \nbreastfed, we need to implement a strategy that addresses workplace \nconditions.\n  The Breastfeeding Promotion Act that Representative Maloney and I are \nintroducing today is a measured step in this direction.\n  It protects breastfeeding women from discrimination in the workplace, \nprovides tax credits to employers who make accommodations for \nbreastfeeding moms, and most importantly, it affords working moms with \nthe time, space, and privacy they need to express milk.\n  Many of these changes have been successfully implemented in my home \nState of Oregon where we have seen a tremendous difference in the \nexperiences of mothers, as well as positive impacts for employers, as a \nresult of this type of legislation.\n  Tonya Hirte, a senior customer service representative in Portland, \nsaid that before the law took effect, she had to express breast milk in \na bathroom on a separate floor from her worksite, but that after \nimplementation of the law, her company converted a storage closet into \na private, simply-furnished room, bringing dignity to her experience as \na mother, and helping her feel valued as an employee.\n  A Lane County employee said that having a breastfeeding-friendly \nworkplace allowed her to focus better on her work, knowing her \ndaughter's needs were being met emotionally and physically because the \nwork breaks to express breast milk facilitated their breastfeeding \nrelationship when they were together.\n  But it's not just the employees who are seeing positive changes as a \nresult of the Oregon law. Jim Rochs, General Manager of Carinos Italian \nRestaurant in Bend, Oregon, says that they create a better team overall \nif they take care of one another. The time and space his employee \nneeded to express breast milk was not difficult to provide.\n  Gretchen Peterson, Human Resources Manager for Hanna Andersson \nclothing design, manufacturer and retail store, said that ``legislation \nto encourage longer-term breastfeeding by eliminating potential \nworkplace barriers has been successfully passed and implemented in \nOregon with no negative impact to business.'' She goes on to say, \n``Without this opportunity, our employees may have made the choice to \nstay at home or choose to work for another company which would have \ncaused a significant disruption to our business.''\n  Research from the Maternal Child Health Bureau demonstrates a \nsignificant return on investment when businesses support worksite \nlactation programs.\n  The Mutual of Omaha insurance company conducted a study that found \nhealth care costs for newborns to be three times lower for babies whose \nmothers participate in their company's maternity and lactation program. \nPer person health care costs were $2,146 more for employees who did not \nparticipate in the program, with a yearly savings of $115,881 in health \ncare claims for the breastfeeding mothers and babies.\n  This is truly a public health issue. Encouraging breastfeeding for \nworking mothers will help alleviate the negative effects of low \nbreastfeeding rates, including a 21 percent greater infant mortality \nrate for babies not exclusively breastfed for 6 months, and\n\n[[Page S6552]]\n\ngreater risk over a lifetime for many illnesses including asthma, \ndiabetes, obesity, and certain cancers.\n  Finally, the timing could not be better as we ramp up our efforts to \nreform our health care system and work to contain costs. A 2001 USDA \nstudy found that if half of the babies in the U.S. were exclusively \nbreastfed for 6 months, we would realize a savings of $3.6 billion in \nhealth care costs for the three leading childhood illnesses alone. \nAccording to the U.S. Breastfeeding Committee, if we replicate that \nstudy based on current breastfeeding statistics, the savings could \nreach nearly $14 billion in health care costs for all childhood \nillnesses.\n  Colleagues, I look forward to passing the Breastfeeding Promotion Act \nto help make it easier for moms to breastfeed, which will lead to \nhealthier babies, stronger families, and happier workers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 1245. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na tax credit for property owners who remove lead-based paint hazards; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today along with my friend Senator \nWhitehouse to introduce the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act. \nUnfortunately, lead paint remains a serious risk to families across the \ncountry and poses an especially dangerous hazard for children. \nAccording to the Department of Housing and Urban Development, HUD, 23 \nmillion homes in the United States currently have a significant amount \nof lead-based paint, and exposure has caused 240,000 children under the \nage of six to have blood-lead levels high enough to cause irreversible \nneurological damage and learning disabilities.\n  The current Federal abatement programs are simply inadequate to \naddress the home repair requirements of millions of families who remain \nexposed to lead. In fiscal year 2008, HUD's Lead Hazard Control Program \nprovided for lead abatement of only 12,600 homes. It doesn't take an \nadvanced degree in mathematics to know that 12,600 is an insufficient \nabatement number when 240,000 children have already been exposed to \nharmful levels of lead-based paint.\n  The tax credit in the Whitehouse-Snowe bill would be worth up to \n$3,000 per eligible housing unit for abatement costs or up to $1,000 \nfor each unit for interim control costs--which reduce but do not \neliminate the hazard. These incentives will encourage property owners \nto make their homes and properties lead-safe. According to the Maine \nIndoor Air Quality Council, almost 80 percent of homes and apartments \nin Maine built before 1978 could have lead paint. That being said, the \ntax credit in our legislation will help greatly reduce that number and \nin turn reduce the number of children who require medical treatment as \na result of lead exposure.\n  The Whitehouse-Snowe bill will provide a powerful tax incentive to \nlandlords and make a much greater impact in reducing household lead \nexposure. It is no surprise that many of our poorest residents are the \nmost affected by lead-based paint illnesses. Whatever their economic \nsituation, no family should be forced to choose between affordability \nand the safety of their children. Our citizens are facing a multitude \nof difficult financial decisions in the midst of the current recession, \nand many people are unable to bear the costs of lead abatement.\n  It is not news that health care costs are spiraling out of control, \nand Congress is working hard to find a solution to this complicated \nproblem. Lead-based paint does not require such a complicated solution, \nand the Home Lead Safety Tax Credit Act takes a proactive role in \npreventing an illness that doesn't have to exist at all. Children \nexposed to lead-based paint will pay thousands of dollars in health \ncare costs. Our legislation will not only save the lives of children \nacross our country, but help mitigate the unnecessary burden of lead-\nbased paint poisoning on our health care system. We must do everything \nin our power to encourage landlords an property owners to rid homes of \nharmful lead-based paint and I hope my colleagues will join us in \nsupporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 1246. A bill to establish a home energy retrofit finance program; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce legislation to \nestablish a Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program. My office has worked \nclosely with a number of stakeholders and experts in developing this \nProgram. It is supported by the Vermont Energy Investment Corporation, \nthe National Trust for Historic Preservation, Green for All, the Apollo \nAlliance, and the Union of Concerned Scientists, because they know that \nimproving residential sector energy use is a strategy to address global \nwarming, save families on their utility bills, and create jobs.\n  Households across the Nation will be able to lower their energy bills \nand generate their own renewable energy through the Program. It would \nprovide initial capital to States, according to the established State \nenergy program formula, to set up state revolving finance funds. These \nState funds would in turn provide financial support for local \ngovernment programs, such as clean energy district financing, and \nenergy utility programs, such as on-bill financing.\n  There are already a number of innovative programs to help finance \nresidential energy efficiency and renewable energy across the country. \nFor example, States such as Vermont, New Mexico, California, Virginia, \nTexas, and Maryland have authorized local governments to provide \nfinancing to homeowners for energy improvements. Homeowners then can \npay back the cost of the improvements over time on their property tax \nbills.\n  The Home Energy Retrofit Finance Program would give these efforts a \nboost by supporting local government and utility programs that provide \nhouseholds with cost-effective financing for energy efficiency measures \nand renewable energy. This Program offers a win-win situation where we \ncan achieve our economic and environmental goals. I ask that my \ncolleagues consider the merits of the Home Energy Retrofit Finance \nProgram as we move forward with comprehensive energy and climate change \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Home Energy Retrofit Finance \n     Program Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) many families lack access to upfront capital to make \n     cost-effective energy improvements to homes and apartments;\n       (2) a number of States, local governments, and energy \n     utilities are considering enacting, or have already enacted, \n     innovative energy efficiency and renewable energy finance \n     programs;\n       (3) home retrofits create and support jobs in the United \n     States in a number of fields, including jobs for \n     electricians, heating and air conditioning installers, \n     carpenters, construction, roofers, industrial truck drivers, \n     energy auditors and inspectors, construction managers, \n     insulation workers, renewable energy installers, and others;\n       (4) cost-effective energy improvements pay for themselves \n     over time and also save consumers energy, reduce energy \n     demand and peak electricity demand, move the United States \n     towards energy independence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, \n     and improve the value of residential properties;\n       (5) modeling has shown that--\n       (A) energy efficiency and renewable energy upgrades in just \n     15 percent of residential buildings in the United States \n     would require $280,000,000,000 in financing; and\n       (B) the upgrades described in subparagraph (A) could reduce \n     carbon dioxide emissions by more than a gigaton; and\n       (6) home retrofits--\n       (A) are a key strategy to reducing global warming \n     pollution; and\n       (B) create and support green jobs.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to establish a program in the Department of Energy to \nencourage consumers to trade in older vehicles for more fuel-efficient \nvehicles and motorcycles, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Green \nTransportation Efficiency Act of 2009. This bill would establish a \nvoucher program in the Department of Energy to encourage American \nconsumers to trade in their older, less fuel-efficient vehicles for \nnew, more fuel-efficient vehicles, including motorcycles.\n  This act is very similar to other ``cash for clunkers'' bills offered \nin the House and Senate in that it will help stimulate the economy by \nproviding a much needed boost to our struggling automobile industry, \nbut will go a step further by bolstering the U.S. motorcycle industry \nas well. After 14 straight years of growth, sales of motorcycles in the \nU.S. declined eight percent in 2007, and, 10 percent in 2008. Due in \nlarge part to the downturn in our economy, motorcycle sales have \ndropped 30 percent in the first quarter of 2009, according to the \nMotorcycle Industry Council. In my home State of Pennsylvania, Harley-\nDavidson has had to cut production and reduce its work force as a \nresult of these declines in motorcycle sales. Established in 1973, the \nHarley-Davidson assembly plant in York, PA, is the company's largest \nmanufacturing facility and is the third largest employer in York \nCounty, PA, employing over 2,200 people. It has been reported that it \nis probably the leanest time that Harley has faced since the company \nwent public in 1986. Harley-Davidson, like the auto makers and other \nmanufacturing sectors, is fighting hard to maintain its workforce and \nto continue to produce a high quality, American-made product during \nthese tough economic times. However, the specter of further reductions \nin motorcycle sales could lead to further job losses in my State, a \nState already hard hit by the current economic crisis.\n  Indeed, the economic impact of the American motorcycle industry also \nextends far beyond the direct employment at facilities such as the \nHarley-Davidson manufacturing plants in Pennsylvania, Missouri, or \nWisconsin. Many of the same parts suppliers that provide the critical \nsupply chain for our American auto manufacturers, in States such as \nMichigan, Indiana, Ohio, and many others, also rely upon motorcycle \nmanufacturers as critical customers. These parts manufacturers and \nsuppliers will also be aided by increased motorcycle sales. The effect \nof increased motorcycle sales will be immediate and meaningful. For \nexample, Harley-Davidson utilizes ``Just In Time'' manufacturing \nprinciples, meaning they do not hold parts inventories. So, every new \nbike ordered triggers new orders for parts--there is very little \nelasticity in the supply chain, so the economic benefit down the line \nis immediate.\n  Finally, in terms of economic activity, this act recognizes the \nchallenges faced by our auto dealerships and the best way to help those \ndealerships is to encourage the purchasing of new, more fuel-efficient \nvehicles. The same principle applies to our motorcycle dealers.\n  In addition to helping to spur economic recovery and protect \nmanufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania and other parts of the country where \nmotorcycles and motorcycle parts are manufactured and assembled, the \ninclusion of motorcycles in this act will help America move away from \nits dependence on foreign sources of oil. Motorcycles are inherently \nfuel efficient. Average miles-per-gallon for motorcycles ranges from \n40-50 MPG, even higher for smaller bikes.\n\n[[Page S6554]]\n\n  Allowing consumers the option of trading in their older, inefficient \nvehicles for newer, more fuel efficient cars, trucks, and motorcycles \nwill help the Nation achieve the dual goals of reducing our demand for \nimported oil and reducing our emissions of greenhouse gases--both \ncritical components of our energy future. Just as importantly, the act \nwill provide a much needed jump start to the auto and motorcycle \nindustries at a time when their sales are at historic lows, plants are \nclosing, and jobs are being lost.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in support of this Act so that \nconsumers are given a strong signal from Washington to trade in their \nolder, inefficient vehicles and purchase new, high-fuel-efficient cars, \ntrucks, or motorcycles.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1248\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue code of 1986 to expand \nthe definition of cellulosic biofuel to include algae-based biofuel for \npurposes of the cellulosic biofuel producer credit and the special \nallowance for cellulosic biofuel plant property; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with \nseveral of my colleagues, the Algae-based Renewable Fuel Promotion Act.\n  The energy, environmental, and food supply challenges confronting our \nnation are immense. The United States imports roughly 60 percent of the \ncrude oil consumed domestically, much of it from unstable parts of the \nworld. As global demand continues to rise, price shocks in oil markets \nare increasingly common, causing economic pain and hardship for \nAmerican consumers. Our overwhelming reliance on traditional fossil \nfuels contributes to unsustainable greenhouse gas emissions levels and \nthe damaging effects of global warming. Ethanol made from corn or \nsoybean--also called first generation biofuels--serve an important \nfunction in diversifying our energy base, but their benefits are \nlargely offset by their adverse effects on food prices and the \nenvironment.\n  Addressing these challenges requires a multi-faceted strategy that \ninvests in renewable and alternative energy sources, green technology, \nand conservation measures. If we succeed, the payoff will be a cleaner, \nhealthier, and more economically prosperous future.\n  I was pleased that the economic stimulus legislation enacted earlier \nthis year included important investments in renewable energy and green \ntechnology programs. It also included a number of expanded tax \nincentives, including tax credits for renewable energy sources, such as \nwind, geothermal, hydropower, and biomass; energy-efficient home \nimprovements; and plug-in electric vehicles, to name just a few.\n  The legislation I am introducing today with six of my colleagues in \nthe Senate--three on each side of the aisle--builds on these \ninvestments and incentives by recognizing the powerful potential of a \nnew and emerging energy source, algae.\n  After years of basic research at the academic and governmental level, \nnew algae-based fuels are poised to move from the experimentation stage \nto commercial development. These fuels have the potential to make a \nsignificant contribution to our energy future. Algae are one of \nnature's most prolific and efficient photosynthetic organisms. They \nhave a short growing cycle, high oil content, and can require little \nland or potable water. An algae-based fuel needs only sunlight, \nCO2, and in some cases, other nutrient inputs to produce \nbiomass that can be converted into readily usable liquid transportation \nfuels--gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel. Unlike some of the other energy \nsources currently under development, algae-based fuels are ``drop-in'' \nfuels, that is to say, they can be incorporated into our existing \nenergy infrastructure, including our pipelines, terminals, and our \nfleet of trucks, cars and jets.\n  For example, over the past several months, commercial airlines have \nflown four successful test flights using a variety of biofuel jet fuel \nblends, including a Continental Airlines flight using a blend of algae- \nand jatropha-derived biofuel and a Japan Airlines flight using a \nsimilar blend that also included camelina.\n  Moreover, some algae-based fuel production processes even sequester \nand consume CO2. Algae production facilities can use \nCO2 emitted by a coal-fired electric utility as a feedstock \nfor the production of the fuel. As a result, algae-based fuels can help \ntransform the energy landscape by shifting our energy consumption to a \nrenewable, home-grown fuel that is carbon neutral or better.\n  Unfortunately, current Federal tax policy inhibits the production of \nalgae-based fuels by failing to provide a level playing--field relative \nto other alternative and renewable fuels. Tax incentives currently \napply to the production of liquefied petroleum gas, compressed or \nliquefied natural gas, ethanol, liquefied hydrogen, biodiesel, liquid \nfuels derived from coal, and other alternative fuels. Many of these \nincentives were added to the tax code well before recent technological \ndevelopments demonstrated the extraordinary promise of algae as a \nrenewable fuel source. In order to ensure that Federal tax incentives \nstimulate the most promising and environmentally beneficial energy \nsources available, the tax code should be updated to incorporate and \npromote algae-based fuel production.\n  The Algae-based Renewable Fuel Promotion Act would make two modest \nchanges to the tax code to promote the development and \ncommercialization of algae-based fuels in the U.S. First, the bill \nwould expand the $1.01 per gallon income tax credit for cellulosic \nbiofuels to cover algae-based biofuels. The bill retains the current \nlaw December 31, 2012, expiration date for the cellulosic biofuel \nproducer credit. Second, the bill would extend the capital investment \ntax incentives for cellulosic biofuels to cover equipment used to \nproduce algae-based fuels. Specifically, the bill would modify the 50 \npercent bonus depreciation provision for property used to produce \ncellulosic biofuel by extending the provision to qualified algae-based \nbiofuel plant property. The bill retains the current law requirement \nthat qualified property must be placed in service before January 1, \n2013. By ensuring that algae-based fuels fully benefit under Federal \ntax policies that promote renewable and alternative fuels, the \nlegislation will encourage investment in this sustainable energy source \nand make an important contribution to our energy landscape for years to \ncome.\n  Algae-based fuels are just one of the many renewable and alternative \nenergy sources under development by aggressive and entrepreneurial \nstart-up firms. These firms seek to capitalize on the commercial \nopportunities presented by the transition away from reliance on fossil \nfuels. It is critical that we regularly review the tax code to ensure\n\n[[Page S6557]]\n\nthat it encourages and promotes the most promising renewable energy \nsources available. The Algae-based Renewable Fuel Promotion Act is one \nstep in this direction. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1250\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nAlgae-based Renewable Fuel Promotion Act.\n  I would first like to thank Senator Bill Nelson for his leadership on \nthis extraordinary piece of legislation, which gives algae-based \nbiofuels the same tax incentives that cellulosic biofuels currently \nenjoy. Specifically, the bill would provide a $1.01 per gallon tax \ncredit and offer 50 percent bonus depreciation for property used in the \nproduction of algae-based biofuels. In short, this legislation will \nlevel the playing field for algae, resulting in enhanced development \nand commercialization.\n  Recent technological advances have showcased the tremendous potential \nof algae as a renewable fuel source. Algae-based biofuels can be \nrefined into gasoline, jet fuel and diesel. These fuels are renewable, \nhave a low-carbon footprint, and can fit seamlessly into our existing \nenergy infrastructure. Additionally, algae does not compete for arable \nland or potable water. Algae grows best in very sunny climates, making \nthe desert an ideal place for production, and it utilizes saltwater, \nnot freshwater, to grow. It also has a short-life cycle and high oil \ncontent.\n  Algae-based renewable fuels will play an important role in America's \nclean energy portfolio, and provide an answer to the question of how we \nwill decrease our dependence on foreign oil and increase our domestic \nsecurity. Again, I thank my colleague, Senator Bill Nelson, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate on this important \npiece of legislation.\n\n[[Page S6558]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER:\n  S. 1251. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for advanced illness care management services for Medicare \nbeneficiaries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nhelp seniors navigate through a complicated and often overwhelming \nhealth care delivery system. Because of the fragmented nature of our \nhealthcare system, we often fail to provide patients, their families, \nand caregivers with the necessary tools, information, and support to \nage well and with dignity in the setting of their preference. I believe \nthat if we provide patients with better information about advance care \nplanning in non-crisis situations, they will make decisions for \nthemselves and their families that result in better care and better \nquality of life.\n  Our health care system is in need of sweeping reforms that will not \nonly provide broader coverage but will also increase value and \nefficient access to quality care. As we provide meaningful reforms for \nthe healthcare system, we should take the opportunity to refine and \nenhance those parts of the Medicare system that work well for seniors.\n  Currently, Medicare beneficiaries with advanced illnesses have a good \noption in the Medicare hospice benefit to receive care, family support, \nand counseling during the last six months of life. For those who are \nill or in need of advanced illness care, but are not eligible for the \nhospice benefit, there are very few options for counseling and services \nthat would help them make informed choices about their care options. \nOften, they are left in the dark about their treatment alternatives and \nwithout the support they and their family members need to prepare and \nplan for the care they want and need. Frankly, it is unconscionable to \nleave it to families to resolve these extraordinarily difficult \ndecisions, often in moments of crisis, without appropriate information, \nmaterials and supportive services. The Senior Navigation and Planning \nAct of 2009 will help seniors and their families navigate through an \nextremely complex system and will help them make informed medical \ndecisions.\n  My legislation would provide access to an advanced illness care \nmanagement benefit, increase the awareness of advance care planning \nthrough a national education campaign and clearinghouse, reduce legal \nhurdles to the enforcement of advance directives, create incentives for \nhospitals and physicians to get accredited and certified in palliative \ncare, increase compliance with medical orders and discharge \ninstructions, educate entities including faith-based organizations on \nadvance care planning issues, and increase integration and coordination \nbetween the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Collectively, these \ninitiatives will create a more accessible environment for seniors to \nreceive the care they need, when they need it, in the setting they \nprefer.\n  Specifically, the advanced illness care management benefit would \nallow Medicare beneficiaries who have been diagnosed with a life \nexpectancy of 18 months or less to have access to the guidance and \nexpertise of a hospice team and receive services such as consultations \non palliative care, advance care planning that is patient-centered, and \ncounseling, respite, and care giving training for their family members. \nThis new advanced illness care management benefit will provide seniors \nwith the support they need to make informed decisions.\n  This initiative builds upon the efforts of the hospice community and \nthe private sector. For example, United Health Group has created an \nAdvanced Illness model in their benefit design and offers this program \nto the seniors they serve in Medicare Advantage and Special Needs \nPlans. They have found by providing access to the hospice and \npalliative care teams earlier, patients experience an increase in the \nquality of their life and duplicative or futile care is reduced. Aetna \nand Kaiser Permanente have also implemented these types of programs \nwith similar results.\n  In addition to the impact a lack of advance care planning and access \nto supportive services has on a patient's quality of life, inadequate \naccess to advance care planning services contributes to 27 percent of \nMedicare costs spent in the last year of life. Advanced illness, \npalliative, and hospice care have been shown to improve quality of care \nat a reduced cost. Specifically, studies demonstrate that if an \nadditional 2 percent of hospitalized Medicare beneficiaries received \npalliative care, direct cost savings to the Medicare program would be \n$1.57 billion. Given health care costs are growing at an alarming rate \nand that seniors may not be getting the necessary information they need \nto make appropriate treatment decisions, we need to act now to provide \nthem with access to advanced illness and advance care planning \nservices.\n  I believe that rather than deny or withhold healthcare services, \noverall health reform should include a thoughtful process that informs \npatients, their families, and caregivers on how to navigate and think \nthrough decisions about when and how long to pursue treatments at the \nend-of-life. By doing this, we will provide a culture in which all of \nus will have the ability to age well, with dignity, in the setting of \nour choosing.\n  It is my hope that this legislation will be incorporated into the \nbroader health care reform effort that is underway in the Finance and \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees. I look forward to \nworking with Chairmen Baucus and Kennedy to implement these meaningful \nreforms so seniors have access to the information and services they \nneed to receive the care they deserve.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mr. Inouye, and Ms. Cantwell):\n  S. 1252. A bill to promote ocean and human health and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, oceans affect human health both \ndirectly and indirectly from the water quality at our beaches to the \nsafety of seafood at U.S. markets; therefore, it is important to \nunderstand the relationship between environmental stressors, coastal \nconditions, climate change, and human health. Over the last several \ndecades ocean and coastal waters have become channels for environmental \nthreats to human health including infectious disease, harmful toxins \nfrom algae, and chemical pollutants from contact with contaminated \nseafood, polluted drinking water, and dirty beaches. Since the 1960s, \nscientists have realized that marine plants, animals, and microbes can \nalso produce substances that benefit human health, such as anticancer, \nanti-inflammatory, and antibiotic medicines.\n  Through well designed research and monitoring programs, we can \nmaximize the health benefits derived from the oceans, improve the \nsafety of American seafood, reduce beach closures, and detect emerging \nthreats to human health in a proactive rather than reactive manner.\n  In 2004, Congress enacted the Oceans and Human Health Act which \nauthorized the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the \nNational Science Foundation, and the National Institutes of Health to \nconduct research to improve understanding of the connection between the \noceans and public health. Today, Senator Inouye, Senator Cantwell, and \nI are introducing the Oceans and Human Health Reauthorization Act of \n2009.\n  This legislation would direct the President, working through the \nNational Science and Technology Council, to coordinate a national \nresearch program to improve understanding of the role of the oceans, \ncoasts and Great Lakes in human health and deliver information, \nproducts, and services to assist the nation in reducing public health \nrisks, including those related to climate change, and enhancing health \nbenefits from the ocean. It would establish the Oceans and Human Health \nTask Force that will include a number of federal agencies, such as the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National \nInstitutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, the National \nInstitute for Environmental Health Science, and the Center for Disease \nControl. It would direct the Interagency Oceans and Human Health Task \nForce to develop an implementation plan that: establishes the goals and \npriorities for federal research that advance scientific\n\n[[Page S6559]]\n\nunderstanding of the connections between oceans and human health; \nprovides information for the prediction, surveillance, and forecasting \nof marine-related public health problems, including those related to \nclimate change; and uses the biological and chemical potentials of the \noceans to develop new products for the prevention and treatment of \ndiseases and to increase our understanding of the biological properties \nof ocean resources. The legislation would also reauthorize the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Oceans and Human Health \nInitiative and establish a Distinguished Scholars program for \nscientists to work with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration on the oceans and human health initiative.\n  Importantly, this bill would recognize the effects of climate change \non oceans and human health. The effects of climate change do not stop \nwith sea level rise and increased water temperatures. Without physical \nand ecological boundaries, climate change causes a cascade of effects \nthroughout ocean environments that can result in surprising impacts on \nocean and human health. This reauthorization bill would include climate \nchange and oceans and human health as a new research area.\n  Our oceans impact every American and they are a foundation of \nAmerica's economy. The research and monitoring supported by this bill \nwill help make sure we have healthy oceans where people can swim, fish, \nplay, and eat seafood. It will also help us develop new blue jobs in \nmarine natural products and lead to new discoveries in medicines to \ncure deadly diseases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1252\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nestablish financial incentives for States to expand the provision of \nlong-term services and supports to Medicaid beneficiaries who do not \nreside in an institution, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Home and \nCommunity Balanced Incentives Act of 2009, together with my colleague \nfrom Wisconsin, Senator Kohl. As we in the Senate embark on reforming \nAmerica's health care system, we cannot forget those who are dependent \non daily care in order to survive: those in long-term care. Long-term \ncare provides health care and daily living services to the elderly and \ndisabled population, providing them with the ability to live happy, \nproductive lives that age, illness and disability would otherwise \nprevent.\n  In 2007, the U.S. spent close to $109 billion on long term \ninstitutional care services under the Medicaid program; in my state of \nWashington it was approximately $2 billion. This amount represents more \nthan 30 percent of all Medicaid payments, and is a number we can easily \nreduce. This legislation seeks to rebalance how states handle long term \ncare by providing the tools they need to shift people out of expensive \ninstitutional care facilities and into home and community based care, \nwhere they can remain vibrant, active members of their community.\n  As Dorothy from the Wizard of Oz once said: There is no place like \nhome. I could not agree more, which is why I believe in providing \nindividuals and\n\n[[Page S6561]]\n\nfamilies with the option to remain in their home, where studies have \nshown the overall quality of life is far superior to that in an \ninstitutional facility. Additionally, home and community based care is \nfar more cost efficient than institutional care; by diverting just 5 \npercent of the long term care community away from institutional care \nand into home and community based services, we would see a net savings \nof more than $10 billion dollars over five years. In a time when rising \nhealth care spending plays such a pivotal role in the health of the \noverall economy, these savings represent a giant step towards reining \nin unnecessary health care spending.\n  The Home and Community Balanced Incentives Act would achieve the goal \nof transitioning to home and community based services by offering \nstates modest increases to their federal medical assistance payment, \nFMAP, for home and community based services. States would have to use \nthese increases to develop the programs needed to provide effective \nhome and community based services. These services will reduce barriers \nthat currently prohibit people from accessing home and community based \nservices.\n  This bill succeeds in not only saving the Medicaid program a \nsignificant amount of money, but it will empower families to make \ninformed decisions about their long term care needs.\n  Specifically, this bill would: improve case management to help people \nremain in their homes and communities and out of nursing homes; provide \nconsumer empowerment helping to put individuals in charge of their \ncare; provide a coordinated transition structure for those wishing to \nleave institutional care and return to their homes and communities; \ncreate a clear and well coordinated system for providing long term care \ninformation and support; improve methodology for determining \neligibility and tracking provider data on services and quality \noutcomes.\n  Senator Kohl and I are excited to introduce this important \nlegislation and to begin working with our colleagues on improving the \nlong term care system in America.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1256\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to build on the \naging network to establish long-term services and supports through \nsingle-entry point systems, evidence based disease prevention and \nhealth promotion programs, and enhanced nursing home diversion \nprograms; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce Project 2020: \nBuilding on the Promise of Home and Community-Based Services Act with \nmy colleague from Michigan, Senator Stabenow. By the year 2020, almost \n1 in 6 Americans will be over the age of 65 and the population of \npeople over the age of 85, the fastest growing segment of the \npopulation, will double. Our current long term care financing structure \nis unsustainable as the population in need of such services rapidly \nincreases. As such, we must turn our focus to reforming the long term \ncare system to provide the best care available to this vulnerable \npopulation.\n  The average cost of a nursing home in this country is $70,000 a year, \nmaking this an unrealistic option for most Americans. In fact, most \npeople who end up in a nursing home last just six months before they \nhave spent so much they become poor enough to qualify for Medicaid. \nThis situation is expensive for consumers, for states, and for the \nfederal government. Fortunately, there is a clear answer. It costs \nMedicaid one third as much to provide someone with home and community \nbased care as it would cost to care for them in a nursing home. In \naddition, most people want to stay in their own home or community \nwhenever possible. An independent analysis conducted by the Lewin Group \nshows that Project 2020 would reach over 40 million Americans, while \nsimultaneously reducing Medicare and Medicaid costs by more than $2.8 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  Project 2020 addresses the urgent need to shift away from \ninstitutional care and towards home and community based services in \nthree distinct ways: through enhanced nursing home diversion; by \nincreasing the use of person-centered access to information; and by \nutilizing evidence-based disease and injury prevention. As I previously \nmentioned, increased nursing home diversion will not only provide \nsignificant savings to the Medicaid program, it will also allow \nfamilies to stay together and let people be active members of their \ncommunities. Through the creation of a person-center access point to \ninformation, consumers, family members, and caregivers will be given \nthe tools necessary to make well informed decisions about long term \ncare. Finally, this bill will provide for programs that help consumers \nget proven education about avoiding preventable diseased and injuries, \nsuch as falls and malnutrition, which result in thousands of \nunnecessary hospitalizations every year.\n  As you can see, these three programs constitute a common-sense, \nmultifaceted approach to improving the quality of life of individuals \nand their families, while providing a substantial amount of savings to \nthe health care system.\n  I am pleased to introduce this important legislation along with my \ncolleague Senator Stabenow and I look forward to working with the rest \nof my Senate colleagues to provide families with the long term care \nservices and support they need.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1257\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 26\n\n       Whereas, during the history of the Nation, the United \n     States has grown into a symbol of democracy and freedom \n     around the world;\n       Whereas the legacy of African Americans is interwoven with \n     the very fabric of the democracy and freedom of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas millions of Africans and their descendants were \n     enslaved in the United States and the 13 American colonies \n     from 1619 through 1865;\n       Whereas Africans forced into slavery were brutalized, \n     humiliated, dehumanized, and subjected to the indignity of \n     being stripped of their names and heritage;\n       Whereas many enslaved families were torn apart after family \n     members were sold separately;\n       Whereas the system of slavery and the visceral racism \n     against people of African descent upon which it depended \n     became enmeshed in the social fabric of the United States;\n       Whereas slavery was not officially abolished until the \n     ratification of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States in 1865, after the end of the Civil War;\n       Whereas after emancipation from 246 years of slavery, \n     African Americans soon saw the fleeting political, social, \n     and economic gains they made during Reconstruction \n     eviscerated by virulent racism, lynchings, \n     disenfranchisement, Black Codes, and racial segregation laws \n     that imposed a rigid system of officially sanctioned racial \n     segregation in virtually all areas of life;\n       Whereas the system of de jure racial segregation known as \n     ``Jim Crow'', which arose in certain parts of the United \n     States after\n\n[[Page S6569]]\n\n     the Civil War to create separate and unequal societies for \n     Whites and African Americans, was a direct result of the \n     racism against people of African descent that was engendered \n     by slavery;\n       Whereas the system of Jim Crow laws officially existed \n     until the 1960's--a century after the official end of slavery \n     in the United States--until Congress took action to end it, \n     but the vestiges of Jim Crow continue to this day;\n       Whereas African Americans continue to suffer from the \n     consequences of slavery and Jim Crow laws--long after both \n     systems were formally abolished--through enormous damage and \n     loss, both tangible and intangible, including the loss of \n     human dignity and liberty;\n       Whereas the story of the enslavement and de jure \n     segregation of African Americans and the dehumanizing \n     atrocities committed against them should not be purged from \n     or minimized in the telling of the history of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas those African Americans who suffered under slavery \n     and Jim Crow laws, and their descendants, exemplify the \n     strength of the human character and provide a model of \n     courage, commitment, and perseverance;\n       Whereas, on July 8, 2003, during a trip to Goree Island, \n     Senegal, a former slave port, President George W. Bush \n     acknowledged the continuing legacy of slavery in life in the \n     United States and the need to confront that legacy, when he \n     stated that slavery ``was . . . one of the greatest crimes of \n     history . . . The racial bigotry fed by slavery did not end \n     with slavery or with segregation. And many of the issues that \n     still trouble America have roots in the bitter experience of \n     other times. But however long the journey, our destiny is \n     set: liberty and justice for all.'';\n       Whereas President Bill Clinton also acknowledged the deep-\n     seated problems caused by the continuing legacy of racism \n     against African Americans that began with slavery, when he \n     initiated a national dialogue about race;\n       Whereas an apology for centuries of brutal dehumanization \n     and injustices cannot erase the past, but confession of the \n     wrongs committed and a formal apology to African Americans \n     will help bind the wounds of the Nation that are rooted in \n     slavery and can speed racial healing and reconciliation and \n     help the people of the United States understand the past and \n     honor the history of all people of the United States;\n       Whereas the legislatures of the Commonwealth of Virginia \n     and the States of Alabama, Florida, Maryland, and North \n     Carolina have taken the lead in adopting resolutions \n     officially expressing appropriate remorse for slavery, and \n     other State legislatures are considering similar resolutions; \n     and\n       Whereas it is important for the people of the United \n     States, who legally recognized slavery through the \n     Constitution and the laws of the United States, to make a \n     formal apology for slavery and for its successor, Jim Crow, \n     so they can move forward and seek reconciliation, justice, \n     and harmony for all people of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That the sense of the Congress is the following:\n       (1) Apology for the enslavement and segregation of african-\n     americans.--The Congress--\n       (A) acknowledges the fundamental injustice, cruelty, \n     brutality, and inhumanity of slavery and Jim Crow laws;\n       (B) apologizes to African Americans on behalf of the people \n     of the United States, for the wrongs committed against them \n     and their ancestors who suffered under slavery and Jim Crow \n     laws; and\n       (C) expresses its recommitment to the principle that all \n     people are created equal and endowed with inalienable rights \n     to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, and calls on \n     all people of the United States to work toward eliminating \n     racial prejudices, injustices, and discrimination from our \n     society.\n       (2) Disclaimer.--Nothing in this resolution--\n       (A) authorizes or supports any claim against the United \n     States; or\n       (B) serves as a settlement of any claim against the United \n     States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6569-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           NOTICE OF HEARING\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

I ask unanimous consent the Senate now proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 184.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 184) offering deepest condolences to \n     the family and friends of Officer Stephen T. Johns and \n     calling on the leaders of all Nations to speak out against \n     the manifestations of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and hatred.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I have submitted a resolution \ncondemning yesterday's heinous, horrific act of violence at the U.S. \nHolocaust Memorial Museum.\n  I want to offer my deepest condolences to the family and friends of \nOfficer Stephen Tyrone Johns. Officer Johns, of Temple Hills, in Prince \nGeorge's County, MD, died in the line of duty. He ably served as a \nguard of the museum for 6 years. He was just 39 and leaves behind a \ngrieving family. He gave his life to save the lives of numerous others. \nWe must perpetually honor that ultimate sacrifice. I also want to \ncommend all the staff of the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum and the \nauthorities who responded to the scene for their bravery.\n  I have visited the Holocaust Memorial Museum many times with my \nfamily and friends. It is clear that the gunman's despicable rampage \nwas intended to frighten and intimidate all people who care about \nequality and liberty.\n  I introduced this resolution to affirm my commitment to ending the \nbigotry and hatred that led to this heinous act. There is no place in \nour society for individuals who would harm or deny rights to others, \nespecially based on religion, race, gender, or ethnic identity. It is \nheartening that each and every U.S. Senator has cosponsored this \nresolution.\n  Let there be no mistake about it, anti-Semitism and other hate crimes \nremain a pressing problem in our society. Anti-Semitism spawns from \ncenturies of hatred, persecution, and the repeated attempts to destroy \nthe Jewish people from their early days of slavery, through the \nInquisition to the Holocaust and beyond. Hate crimes send a powerful \nmessage because they affect more than the individual victims; they are \nmeant to intimidate and instill fear in entire groups of people. They \ncreate a sense of vulnerability and insecurity in others who may share \ncharacteristics with the victims. And that is precisely the intent of \nthose who commit these crimes.\n  I am privileged to be chairman of the Helsinki Commission and a \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee. In those capacities, and as a \nU.S. Senator generally, I am afforded numerous opportunities to speak \nout against the scourge of anti-Semitism, racial bigotry, and ethnic \nhatred worldwide. Part of the battle is to publicize the intolerance \nand hateful activity. As Oliver Wendell Holmes remarked,\n\n       The mind of a bigot is like the pupil of an eye. The more \n     light you shine on it, the more it will contract.\n\n  This resolution is meant to be such a light and I am grateful that \neach and\n\n[[Page S6571]]\n\nevery other Senator has seen fit to cosponsor it. We truly speak as one \nin our anguish at the tragic event yesterday and in our determination \nto root out its causes so that it will not be repeated.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I rise to \nmark the death of security guard Stephen Tyrone Johns, whose senseless \nmurder yesterday afternoon at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum \nshocked us all.\n  My heart goes out to his family and friends on this tragic day and to \nhis colleagues and fellow security officers who must return to a \nworkplace that will surely never be quite the same.\n  Even as we mourn his death, we must commend Officer Johns, his \ncolleagues, and all emergency personnel who responded quickly to \nprevent additional violence and protect the safety of museum visitors.\n  In the aftermath of this killing, how can we make sense of that which \ncan only be described as senseless?\n  How can we comprehend the forces that would drive a person to such \nhatred, to such violence?\n  The simple truth is that most of us will never be able to fully \nunderstand this tragedy. We can only comfort one another as we struggle \nto confront a world in which Officer Johns has been taken from us far \nbefore his time.\n  The same incomprehensible hatred to which the Holocaust Memorial \nMuseum bears silent witness.\n  We must honor the memory of Officer Johns by continuing the work he \nsupported at the museum, preventing further violence, and standing tall \nin the face of intolerance.\n  It will not be easy to move on, but we can start by asking ourselves \nwhat we can do to prevent guns from falling into the hands of killers, \nto stop those who would commit hate crimes before more innocent people \nare slain. That is what we owe the legacy of Officer Stephen Tyrone \nJohns. That is how we can celebrate his memory, honor his sacrifice, \nand pay tribute to the spirit of his work and the continuing mission of \nthe place where he died.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, \nwith no intervening action or debate, and any statements be printed in \nthe Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Johns of Temple Hills, Maryland, was fatally wounded and \n     died heroically in the line of duty;\n       Whereas, in the wake of this heinous act of violence, the \n     people of the United States should renew the commitment to \n     end bigotry, intolerance, and hatred; and\n       Whereas there is no place in the society of the United \n     States for individuals who seek to harm or deny rights to \n     others, especially based on religion, race, or ethnic \n     identity: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) offers deepest condolences to the family and friends of \n     Officer Stephen T. Johns;\n       (2) commends the staff members of the United States \n     Holocaust Memorial Museum for their courage and bravery in \n     responding to the attack on June 10, 2009;\n       (3) condemns anti-Semitism and all forms of religious, \n     ethnic, and racial bigotry;\n       (4) condemns acts of physical violence against, and \n     harassment of, people based on race, gender, ethnicity, or \n     religious affiliation; and\n       (5) calls on the leaders of all Nations to speak out \n     against the manifestations of anti-Semitism, bigotry, and \n     hatred.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/11/senate-section/article/S6571-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 15, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
