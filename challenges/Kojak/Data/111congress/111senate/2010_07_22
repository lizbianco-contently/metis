The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                    Small Business Lending Fund Act\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, Republicans today will continue to \nlook for a way forward on the small business bill. This is an \nopportunity to deliver some real relief to small businesses struggling \nto dig themselves out of the recession.\n  Ultimately, Democrats seem to have other priorities. In the middle of \na debt crisis, Democrats cannot seem to pass trillion-dollar spending \nbills fast enough. In the middle of a jobs crisis, they continue to \npush one bill after another containing job-stifling taxes, new rules \nand regulations, and government intrusion into business.\n  Their signature piece of jobs legislation appears to be a bill that \nborrows $34 billion from our grandchildren to help folks who cannot \nfind a job in the environment Democrats have created over the last year \nand a half.\n  This small business bill gives us an opportunity to have a real jobs \ndebate. But Democrats clearly do not want to have that debate. That is \nwhy they have repeatedly pulled this bill from the floor to move on to \nwhat they consider more important things or to get together downtown to \npat themselves on the back after signing another job-killing bill.\n  Let's have a real debate about jobs. Let's consider amendments that \nwould help small businesses--amendments like the one Senator Johanns \nwants to offer to eliminate a burdensome paperwork mandate and that \nsmall businesses are pleading with us to approve.\n  Our leader on the Small Business Committee, Senator Snowe, is \nfighting to keep a provision out of this bill that amounts to another \nbailout. Members of both sides oppose it.\n  There is no evidence this new lending program will work. Even the \nCongressional Oversight Panel has expressed skepticism it will even be \neffective in increasing small business lending. The panel's report is \nskeptical it will improve access to credit. Moreover, the panel says \nthis provision looks uncomfortably similar to the TARP bailout.\n\n  The problem banks and small businesses are facing is not that they \ndon't have incentive to lend; it is that the government is threatening \nthem with a 2,300-page bill full of new rules and regulations while \ntheir customers--small businesses--are threatened by pending tax hikes \nand more government intrusion.\n  For more than a year and a half, the President and his Democratic \nallies on Capitol Hill have pushed an antibusiness, antijobs agenda on \nthe American people in the form of one massive government intrusion \nafter another. Then there is a celebration. Here is an opportunity to \nhave a real debate about job creation. Here is an opportunity to do \nsomething that might actually make a positive difference.\n  Small business owners are already being hammered by the health care \nbill. They are about to get hammered by the financial regulatory bill. \nIt is time to do something they actually want for a change.\n  The American people are connecting the dots. They don't think the \nfinancial regulatory bill will solve the problems in the financial \nsector any more than they think the health care bill will be able to \nlower costs or lead to better care; any more than the stimulus lowered \nunemployment.\n  Republicans had offered amendments that would create the conditions \nfor real private sector job growth. If Democrats shared this priority, \nthis bill would have been law by now. Instead, they seem committed to \nthe same approach that has led to 3 million lost jobs in the past year \nand a half.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have come to the floor today--and we \nhave a couple hours now--to introduce a Senate resolution which is now \nat the desk recognizing and celebrating the 20th anniversary of the \nAmericans With Disabilities Act. Twenty years ago, the ADA was a great \nbipartisan legislative initiative. I am pleased this resolution also \nenjoys broad bipartisan support. I am grateful to all those who have \ncosponsored this resolution, including my chief cosponsor, Senator \nHatch, and 31 other Senators.\n  Other Senators who are watching and would like to be added as \ncosponsors, I ask them to please call their respective cloakrooms and \nwe will add their names to the list. Right now, I think we are at 22 or \n23.\n  The Americans With Disabilities Act--signed into law on January 26, \n1990--has been described as the Emancipation Proclamation for people \nwith disabilities. The ADA set four goals for people with disabilities: \nEqual opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic \nself-sufficiency. But as the chief Senate sponsor of the ADA, I can \ntell my colleagues that at its heart, the ADA is very simple. In the \nwords of one disability rights advocate, this landmark law is about \nsecuring for people with disabilities the most fundamental of rights: \n``The right to live in the world.'' It is about ensuring that people \nwith disabilities can go places and do things that other Americans take \nfor granted.\n  I will always remember a young woman by the name of Danette Crawford \nfrom Des Moines, IA. In 1990, she was just 14 years old. She used a \nwheelchair. She lived with constant great pain, but she worked and \ncampaigned hard for passage of the Americans With Disabilities Act. \nWhen I told her the ADA would mean better educational opportunities, \nprevent discrimination in the workplace, better mobility--I was going \nthrough all these things the ADA would do--Danette said to me:\n\n       Those things are very important. But, you know, what I \n     really want to do is just be able to go out and buy a pair of \n     shoes like anybody else.\n\n  Well, two decades later, people with disabilities can do that and so \nmuch more.\n  Our society is so dynamic and changes so rapidly that we are often \noblivious to quiet revolutions taking place in our midst. One such \nrevolution has been unfolding for the last 20 years since the signing \nof the Americans With Disabilities Act. How soon we forget that, prior \nto ADA, Americans with disabilities routinely faced prejudice, \ndiscrimination, and exclusion, not to mention the physical barriers to \nmovement and access in their everyday lives. In hearings prior to \npassing the law in 1990, we heard heartbreaking testimony about the \nobstacles and the discrimination that people with disabilities \nencountered every day of their lives. We heard stories of Americans who \nhad to crawl on their hands and knees to go up a flight of stairs or to \ngain access to their local swimming pool, who couldn't ride on a bus \nbecause there was no lift, who couldn't go to a concert or a ball game \nwith their families because there was no accessible seating, who \ncouldn't even cross the street in a wheelchair because there were no \ncurb cuts. In short, we heard thousands of stories about people who \nwere denied ``the right to live in the world.''\n  The reach and the triumph of the ADA revolution is all around us. It \nhas become a part of America. Today, streets, buildings--think about \nthis--every building designed and built in America since the passage of \nthe ADA is fully accessible--every building. Sports arenas. I just went \nto a sports arena the other day for a ball game and everything is \naccessible. There is seating for people, where they can sit with their \nfamilies--not segregated out someplace, but they can sit with their\n\n[[Page S6133]]\n\nfamilies. The same is true in movie theaters. Transportation systems: \nEvery bus delivered in America today is fully accessible. It has a \nlift--every single bus. All our Metro systems today are fully \naccessible. But that is not all. Information is offered in alternative \nformats so it is usable by individuals with visual or hearing \nimpairments. New communications and information technologies that are \naccessible to people with disabilities continue to be developed. It is \nhard to imagine we lived in a time without closed captioning on \ntelevision. Think about it. I will talk more about my brother Frank, \nwho is deaf and who never could understand what was on TV until we got \nclosed captioning. That is what I mean. New technologies, new ways of \ndoing things are now making life so much better. Thanks to the \nemployment provisions in the ADA, many individuals with disabilities \ncan get reasonable accommodations so they can do a job, they can get \nassistive technology, accessible work environments or more flexible \nwork schedules.\n  But the ADA is more than accessible buildings and books that speak \nand traffic lights that talk to you. It is also hundreds of stories of \nopportunities and hope.\n  These changes are all around us. They are so integrated into our \ndaily lives that sometimes it is hard to remember how the world was \nbefore.\n  Just as important, we have seen a big change in attitudes--\nattitudes--toward people with disabilities. Our expectation is we will \ndo what it takes to give individuals with disabilities not just \nphysical access but equal opportunity in our schools, in our \nworkplaces, and in all areas of our economy and our society. The \nattitudes are so different today. A lot of it has to do also with the \nIndividuals With Disabilities Education Act which preceded the ADA \nbecause now kids go to school with kids with disabilities. Kids grow up \nwith kids with disabilities, so it is no big deal if they work \nalongside them later on. So the whole attitude has changed on how we \ndeal in our society with people with disabilities. Perhaps that may be \none of the biggest changes of all.\n\n  It is important for us to remember also--with all the political \nfirefights that go on around here and the partisan bickering that goes \non around here all the time that we bemoan--it is important to remember \nthe passage of the ADA was a bipartisan effort and a bipartisan \nvictory. Here in the Senate, I worked shoulder to shoulder with Senator \nBob Dole and others from both sides of the aisle. We had invaluable \nassistance from Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, who will be speaking \nshortly, Senator McCain, and others, including leaders who are no \nlonger in this body, people such as Dave Durenberger and Lowell \nWeicker. The final Senate vote on the ADA conference report was 91 yeas \nand only 6 nays.\n  I just mentioned Senators Hatch and McCain. I also wish, at this \npoint, to mention the other Senators currently serving who voted for \nthe ADA conference report on July 13 of 1990. They are Senators Akaka, \nBaucus, Bingaman, Cochran, Conrad, Dodd, Grassley, Inouye, Kerry, Kohl, \nLautenberg, Leahy, Levin, Lieberman, Lugar, McConnell, Mikulski, \nSpecter, and Reid. That is truly, I believe, a roll of honor.\n  As I said, one of those who helped manage the bill when we put it \nthrough back in 1990 and who has always been there helping to make sure \nwe did this in a bipartisan fashion, get the bill through, and get it \nsigned is Senator Orrin Hatch. Later, we worked together on the ADA Act \namendments that we just passed 3 years ago and that President Bush \nsigned just 3 years ago. I couldn't ask for a better friend personally, \nbut people with disabilities couldn't ask for a better friend either \nthan the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Orrin Hatch.\n  I yield the floor at this time to Senator Hatch.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my dear colleague for his kind \nremarks. I remember those days we spent on this floor, and the days \nbefore that, when we had to convince people throughout the Congress \nthat this was the right thing to do; that civil rights for persons with \ndisabilities were absolutely necessary if we were going to be a \ngracious and understanding country, setting an example for all the rest \nof the world.\n  I remember when Senator Harkin and I, after the vote, walked out into \nthe anteroom out there, and there were hundreds of persons with \ndisabilities in their wheelchairs and crutches, with various forms of \ndisability, and both of us stood there and broke down and cried--two \ntough guys. You know that Senator Harkin was a pilot and went through \nthe war and has a tremendous reputation. I have been tough--too tough \nfor some people around here--from time to time. But we both broke down \nand cried. And they cried. It was such a wonderful day, as far as I am \nconcerned.\n  I thank my dear colleague from Iowa for his leadership in this \nmatter. He mentioned all of the others we both want to recognize today. \nI will not repeat those. I will incorporate that in my remarks today.\n  This is a very special anniversary. Twenty years ago last week, we \nstood on the floor of the Senate and voted 91 to 6 to pass the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act. Twenty years ago next Monday, \nPresident George H.W. Bush signed it into law.\n  The ADA is landmark civil rights legislation that represents our \nongoing commitment to equality and opportunity for our fellow citizens \nwho suffer with disabilities. The ADA is a special type of civil rights \nstatute. On the negative side, it prohibits discrimination and provides \nfor remedies when wrongs occur. But more important, on the positive \nside, the ADA requires reasonable accommodation for individuals with \ndisabilities in the areas covered by the statute, such as employment. \nThis accommodation obligation is what quite literally opens doors and \nkeeps them open, improving lives in innumerable practical ways on a \ndaily basis.\n  The original ADA in 1990 and the revision enacted 2 years ago are \nexamples of both how hard legislating can be and the results sticking \nwith it can produce. I know of few policy areas in which--on the \nsurface, at least--political or ideological interests appear to be more \nat odds. I also know of few policy areas in which the objectives are \nmore important and for which a deep and broad consensus is more crucial \nto achieve those objectives. Keeping our eyes on the goal helped keep \neverybody willing to listen, to compromise, and to do what had never \nbeen done before. The result has been a transformation in attitudes, \nperceptions, and actions throughout our society that have helped make \ncountless lives better.\n  These two statutes, ADA and the ADA Amendments Act, also demonstrate \nthat it is Congress that is responsible for national disability policy. \nLawsuits, of course, bring the courts into the picture, and the Supreme \nCourt was called upon to construe and apply the ADA on some questions \nthe ADA itself did not clearly or directly address. I, for one, believe \nthe courts must take statutes as they are and may not make or change \nthem in order to achieve certain results. But whether or not the Court \ndid its part properly, the Constitution gives the power to legislate to \nCongress. That is why, even if the Court had not had any such cases at \nall, we have the authority and the ongoing responsibility to establish, \nrevise, and refine laws that help Americans with disabilities. That \nresponsibility will never end.\n  I am pleased with my role in developing and passing both the ADA and \nthe ADA Amendments Act. I am pleased to have been able to partner with \nmy friend Senator Harkin from Iowa. I am proud to stand here today with \nthat friend, Senator Harkin, without whom these statutes would not have \nbeen possible. I know these are more than simply statutes, more than \npieces of legislation; it is what they represent--our ongoing \ncommitment to making sure individuals with disabilities can participate \nin the American dream--that makes these statutes so important and this \nanniversary so very special.\n  I have seen those who are blind now taken care of, in many cases. I \nhave seen those with various disabilities who are able to get jobs and \nshow they are capable--not only capable but better than capable--of \ndoing some things people never thought they could do. I have seen \npersons with serious disabilities who have become productive members of \nour society because they\n\n[[Page S6134]]\n\nhave been given a chance. I have seen persons of courage in this area \nthat I have never seen before, who literally live with their \ndisabilities every day with smiles on their face, with an ability to be \nable to encourage others, and with an exemplary approach to life that \nmakes all of us better people. I think these things have been magnified \nand blessed by these two acts that my colleague and I and others have \nbeen able to put through. I am proud of what we have done. I believe \nmillions of people are better off because of what we have done.\n  This is a very appropriate thing to do--to recognize the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act, and the other statute as well, so that everybody \nin this country realizes they are part of making these statutes work. I \nam so pleased with all of our American citizens who have pitched in and \ndone what they could, from architects, to engineers, to skilled \ntradesmen, as I used to be, who have really made it possible for people \nto not only embrace life but to be a part of life and to be able to \nhave the accessibility they never had before, and we are a better \nnation for it. Our people are better for it. Above all, these folks who \nhave suffered with disabilities, who are so courageous, are better for \nit.\n  I will never forget, I mentioned when we passed the original ADA that \nI carried my brother-in-law, who was afflicted with both types of polio \nand, of course, lived in an iron lung but went on to get his college \ndegree in engineering and a master's degree in electrical engineering--\nhe worked for Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier in Las Vegas, went to \nwork every day and at night got into an iron lung at home. He was a \nmember of my Mormon faith, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day \nSaints, and I can remember carrying him, with his very light weight, \nthrough the Los Angeles Temple for church. It was meaningful to both \nhim and me. I carried him in my arms all the way through that temple. \nIt was a spiritual experience for both of us.\n  I have seen so many others who have suffered from disabilities whose \nlives have been improved and are better because of what has been done \nin the Congress of the United States. Again, I pay tribute to my friend \nSenator Harkin. He understands this as well as anybody and has played a \nsignificant and perfect role in helping to bring these things to pass. \nI have nothing but respect and great love for my colleague and for the \nothers who voted for this particular bill. I am glad to be able to \nsupport this resolution, to cosponsor it, and I hope and pray that all \nof us will continue to help those who may not be as fortunate as are \nwe, who suffer from disabilities, and realize that they are just as \nproductive in our society, in most ways, as we are.\n  I am grateful to be able to stand here today and make these comments.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, let me say to my friend, I was proud to \nstand with the Senator from Utah 20 years ago. We stood here together. \nWe got the bill through. I remember so vividly, in my mind's eye, when \nwe walked out to that anteroom. I mean, few people are blessed in their \nlifetimes to have that kind of a moment where something so meaningful \nwas done and to see so many people whose lives before that were stunted \nbecause they didn't have the accessibility. Now to see this sort of \nwall come tumbling down--I remember our association so well.\n  I know my friend would agree this was not a slam dunk; it was not a \nvery easy thing that we brought out on one day and it just happened. \nSenator Hatch and I worked on this for years. It took a long time to \nwork out. But through the good faith of people on all sides with whom \nwe worked--the disability rights community, all the different \ndisability groups, and the chamber of commerce supported the bill--in \nthe end, we worked together to bring everybody together. But it was a \nlong process, as the Senator remembers.\n  Mr. HATCH. It was.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend from Utah, I cherish those memories. I \nwas honored to stand with him 20 years ago. I am honored to stand with \nhim again today. I cherish the friendship we have developed over all \nthose years. The Senator from Utah is a true friend, not only \npersonally but also professionally, and he has always lent his weight \nand his seniority and his expertise in the Senate to making sure people \nwith disabilities have that same equal opportunity and equal access. I \nthink maybe both of us, because of our brothers who were disabled, were \naffected greatly. I think it imbued us both with a spirit of working \nhard to make sure people with disabilities had all the access and all \nthe opportunities everybody else enjoyed. I thank my friend for his \nstatement, and, more than that, I thank him for his great support of \npeople with disabilities through all of his lifetime.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his kind remarks, \nbut I also recognize his great leadership. This is a complex set of \nissues. We had complexities among the groups. We had to bring them all \ntogether and work with them. We had to try to resolve conflicts between \nliberals and conservatives, as usual. We also had to work very \ncarefully with various personalities. But we were able to get it done. \nIn large measure, it was due to the work of my friend from Iowa. I \nthink people in the disability community and really throughout the \ncountry ought to be very grateful for what he has done. I am grateful \nto have been able to have played a small role in helping him to do it.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, it was not a small role; the Senator \nfrom Utah played a gigantic role in making sure we got this done. \nWorking to get the ADA Amendments Act passed 3 years ago--we worked on \nthat for something like 4 years to get it done. We were down at the \nWhite House, and it is interesting that the first President Bush signed \nthe first ADA into law and the second President Bush signed the ADA \nAmendments Act into law. That is an interesting juxtaposition--father \nand son.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I mentioned earlier all of the Members \nof the Senate who have been so helpful.\n  On the House side, we prevailed because of outstanding leadership of \npeople such as Congressmen Steny Hoyer, Tony Coelho, and Steve \nBartlett, a Republican leader in the House at that time. The final vote \nwas 377 to 27 in the House.\n  At the White House, Boyden Grey, counsel to President George H.W. \nBush, worked with us every step of the way. As I have said so many \ntimes, without Boyden Grey being there, we could not have gotten this \ndone. I am always grateful to him for his leadership, working from the \nWhite House with us.\n  One other person who was with us every step of the way and continues \nto provide so much leadership in the area of disability rights is then-\nAttorney General Dick Thornburgh.\n  What a champion he was and is. I should not put it in the past tense. \nDick Thornburgh remains today one of the preeminent people in America \nwho keeps focus on what we are doing in society to make sure that \npeople with disabilities have full access and opportunity.\n  Then there is the disability rights community. This would not have \nhappened without the tireless, courageous, and unstoppable work of so \nmany activists in the disability community. I think of people such as \nEd Roberts, now passed on, Bob Williams, Pat Wright, Wade Blank--so \nmany others. Of course, everyone recognizes the indispensable \nleadership of the late Justin Dart who was the chairperson of the \nPresident's Committee on Employment of People with Disabilities. Only \none person's name is specifically mentioned in the resolution on which \nwe will be voting this morning, and that name is Justin Dart.\n  As I have said many times, I may have been the principal author of \nthe ADA, but Justin Dart was the father of the ADA and history will \nrecognize and honor his great contribution.\n  Here was an individual who used a wheelchair most of his life, who \nwas unstoppable. Justin Dart traveled to every single State in this \nNation more than once, well over 100 different cities and communities, \nto promote the Americans with Disabilities Act for about 2 or 3 years \nprior to us bringing it up, to get that kind of national support for \nit. He was everywhere, and he would never give up. We remember Justin \nDart as the father of the ADA.\n\n[[Page S6135]]\n\n  No listing of those who made the ADA possible would be complete \nwithout also talking about my disability counsel at the time, Bobby \nSilverstein. Again, he was tireless in his work in both the drafting \nand the revising. As Senator Hatch and I were reminiscing, there was \nnot even agreement among disability groups on how to do this. We would \ncome up with a draft. We would meet with disability groups. We would \nhave to revise it. We would meet with other disability groups. We would \nhave to revise it. We would meet with business groups. We would have to \nrevise it, and on and on.\n  Slowly, methodically, tirelessly, we got it done, and Bobby \nSilverstein was there every step of the way, as I said, drafting, \nrevising, making sure we did not lose sight of the goals, making sure \nwe had a bill that could muster bipartisan support. No words of mine \ncan express the deep gratitude I have to Bobby Silverstein for all he \ndid to make this possible.\n  I will never forget the pre-ADA America. I remember how it used to be \nperfectly acceptable to treat people with disabilities as second-class \ncitizens, exclude them and marginalize them.\n  I will digress a bit and talk about my brother Frank, who was the \ninspiration for all of my work on disabilities both in the House before \nI came to the Senate and in the Senate.\n  My brother Frank passed away 10 years ago, a month before the 10th \nanniversary of the ADA. He always said he was sorry the ADA was not \nthere for him, but he was glad it is here now for the younger \ngeneration, for those who are now coming so they would have a better \nfuture.\n  My brother lost his hearing at a very early age. Actually, he was \nabout 6 years old. At that time, there were no mainstream schools, so \nhe was taken from his family. We lived in a small town. He was taken \nfrom the family and shipped halfway across the State to the Iowa School \nfor the Deaf.\n  Think about how traumatic this would be. First of all, you lose your \nhearing. You cannot hear anything because of spinal meningitis. Then \nall of a sudden he is picked up, taken away from home, and sent to a \nschool over by Omaha. Think how traumatic that is for a little kid.\n  In school--and I remember people always spoke about my brother being \nat the school for the deaf and dumb. Young people do not realize this, \nbut it used to be very permissible, when I was the age of the pages, \nfor people to speak about people who were deaf as deaf and dumb. \nSchools for the deaf were referred to as schools for the deaf and dumb.\n  I will never forget my brother coming home from school once--it was \nlater on when he was in high school--and people were referring to that. \nThey would actually ask him: How are things going at the school for the \ndeaf and dumb?\n  My brother would say: I may be deaf but I am not dumb. He refused, he \nstubbornly refused--he was kind of a stubborn guy, my brother was--he \nstubbornly refused to accept the cloak that society put on him.\n  In school, he was told he could be one of three things. He could be a \nbaker, a printer's assistant, or a shoe cobbler. He said he did not \nwant to be any of those things. They said: OK, you are going to be a \nbaker then. So they made him into a baker. That is not what he wanted \nto do, but that is what they said.\n  He kept fighting. He kept fighting against it. I remember once when I \nwas younger--he was now out of school--he went to a store. I will never \nforget this. When the sales person found out he was deaf and could not \nhear, she looked right through him at me and asked me what he wanted. \nHow do I know what he wants? Ask him. That is the way people were \ntreated.\n  He went to get a driver's license. He was told deaf people do not \ndrive. He broke that barrier down, too. He got a driver's license and \nbought a car.\n  I remember when my brother finally found employment at a plant called \nDelavan Corporation. I got to know Mr. Delavan later on when I was in \nhigh school and later on when I was in college. He went out of his way \nto hire people who were disabled. It was a manufacturing facility with \na lot of noise. So he hired a lot of deaf people. They did not care if \nit was noisy.\n  My brother got a good job running a very delicate machine that \ndrilled tiny little holes in engines for jet engine nozzles. It had to \nbe finely made. Later on, when I was a Navy pilot, I found out the \nplanes I was flying at the time were using the very nozzles made by my \nbrother.\n  I came home one time for Christmas--my brother never got married. I \nwas not married at the time--I came home for Christmas. Delavan always \nhad a big Christmas dinner for all of the workers. I went with my \nbrother to the Christmas dinner. Lo and behold, unbeknownst to either \none of us, they honored him that night because he had worked there 10 \nyears and in 10 years, he had not missed one day of work or late one \nday. They gave him a nice gold watch. It was very nice. In the 23 years \nmy brother worked there, he missed 3 days of work because of a \nblizzard. He could not make it.\n  I tell that story for a couple of reasons. One, because I am very \nproud of my brother, but also because so many people I have talked \nwith--employers who have employed people with disabilities--will tell \nyou that the hardest workers, the most loyal workers, the most \nproductive workers they have are many times people with disabilities. \nBut they have to get over the hurdle of hiring them in the first place. \nWith a little bit of support, some accessibility issues, maybe \nmodifying the workplace a little bit, we can get a lot done and they \ncan be the best workers.\n\n  I have one more story about my brother I have to relate, since I have \nthe floor, and he was such an inspiration to me.\n  I was elected to the Senate in 1984. I was sworn in January 1985. No \none in my family had ever been in politics. First of all, to be a \nCongressman is one thing, but to be a Senator--wow. My whole family \ncame for the swearing in, and my brother Frank. I remember I put him in \nthis gallery right behind me. This was January 1985. I put him up \nthere, and I had gotten an interpreter, a sign language interpreter. I \nhad gotten an interpreter for my brother for this gallery right back \nhere. I got him seated up there, and I came back down on the floor. I \nlooked up and I saw one of my other brothers--one of my hearing \nbrothers--motioning to me. So I went back up there.\n  My brother John said the guard would not let the interpreter stand up \nthere. I went out to see the guard, the doorkeeper. I said: My brother \nneeds an interpreter. No, we cannot allow people to stand in the \ngallery and interpret.\n  I said: It can't be so.\n  Rules are rules.\n  I came down to the floor. At that time, Senator Bob Dole was the \nmajority leader of the Senate. Senator Dole had a disability himself \nbecause of his war wounds and his maiden speech on the Senate floor \nwhen he was first elected was about disability rights. I go to the \nmajority leader, the Republican leader. I did not know him that well. I \nsaid: Mr. Leader, here is the situation. My brother is up there. I am \nbeing sworn in. He needs an interpreter and they will not let the \ninterpreter in.\n  Senator Dole said: I will take care of it. He did, and we got the \ninterpreter.\n  Now we have places for people with disabilities to come and sit with \ntheir families. We have interpreters. We have closed captioning. No \nlonger do we discriminate against people who are deaf or disabled and \nwant to come into the Capitol.\n  So many changes have been made to the Capitol. We have a full office \nin the Capitol now just for people with disabilities to take tours of \nthe Capitol. We have interpreters for people who are blind. We have bas \nrelief models of all the floors so as they go through the main Rotunda, \nthe Old Senate Chamber, the House Chamber, the old Supreme Court, they \ncan feel with their hands what it looks like. It is all accessible now.\n  I talk about the things that happened to my brother. It sounds like \nsomething out of the medieval past. We are hopefully overcoming--I do \nnot say we are complete--we are overcoming this false dichotomy between \ndisabled and able. We recognize that people with disabilities, like \neveryone, have unique aptitudes, unique abilities, talents. And we know \nAmerica is a better and a fairer and richer nation when we make full \nuse of the gifts people have.\n  One of the things that ADA has done is it has infused in so many \npeople the\n\n[[Page S6136]]\n\nidea that we should look at people not for their disabilities but what \nare they able to do, what are their abilities. Do not tell me what your \ndisabilities are. What are your abilities? That is a major step \nforward.\n  The day the ADA passed I can honestly say was the proudest day of my \nlegislative career. I also say to the occupant of the Chair, I stood at \nthis podium at that time and gave my entire speech in sign language. \nSenator Bob Kerrey, a Senator from Nebraska, was the occupant of the \nchair at the time. He has never forgotten that. I guess maybe I haven't \neither. It was the first time anyone ever gave a long-winded speech on \nthe Senate floor and no one ever heard him. Perhaps a lot of people \nwish we would do that more often.\n  It was a great day. I think every Senator who was there who voted yes \ncan look back 20 years with enormous pride in this achievement. We were \npresent at the creation, but it had a robust life of its own. It has \nbeen integrated into the very fabric of American life. It has changed \nlives and changed our Nation. It has made the American dream possible \nfor tens of millions of people who used to be trapped--trapped--in a \nnightmare of prejudice and exclusion.\n  I am reluctant in many ways to detract from the joy that we all feel \nabout what has happened over the last 20 years and how far we have come \nin our country. But I am obliged to point out, because of my close \nassociation with so many people in the disability community and so many \ndifferent parts of the disability community, that the promise of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act is not quite complete.\n  When we passed the ADA we had four goals: equal opportunity, \nindependent living, full participation, economic self-sufficiency. \nThere is more work to be done to fulfill those goals. For example, \nevery person with a disability deserves the right to live where he or \nshe wants to live. You might say everybody has a right to live where \nthey want to in America. But think about what I said earlier, people in \nthe disability community want the right to live in the world.\n  Here is what I am referring to. For years a person with a disability \nwho qualifies for care in a nursing home, can get that care in a \nnursing home fully refunded, fully paid for by the Government. If you \nhave a disability and you qualify for that level of care and you go to \na nursing home, Medicaid picks that up. But let's say you don't want to \ngo to a nursing home. Let's say you are disabled and you want to live \nin a community. You want to live near your family and your friends and \nyou choose to do so. Medicaid doesn't pick up that bill. If you live in \na nursing home, they will, but not if you live independently, on your \nown. This is something we have been trying to overcome for a long time.\n  Finally, 10 years ago, there was a Supreme Court case. It came to the \nSupreme Court. It was called the Olmstead case, a case out of Georgia. \nListen to this. The Supreme Court held that people with disabilities \nhave the right to live in the least restrictive environment and to make \ntheir own choice to receive their care in the community rather than in \nan institutional setting. In Olmstead, the Court held that the \nunnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disability \nconstitutes discrimination under the ADA.\n  Listen to what the Court said. The Supreme Court said:\n\n       Recognizing that unjustified institutional isolation of \n     persons with disabilities is a form of discrimination \n     reflects two evident judgments. First, institutional \n     placement of persons who can handle and benefit from \n     community settings perpetuates unwarranted assumptions that \n     persons so isolated are incapable or unworthy of \n     participating in community life; secondly, confinement in an \n     institution severely diminishes the everyday life activities \n     of individuals, including family relations, social contacts, \n     work options, economic independence, educational advancement \n     and cultural enrichment.\n\n  Ten years ago the Supreme Court said that. I am obliged to stand here \nand say, 10 years later, we have not gotten there. Ten years ago the \nSupreme Court said that putting people in institutions against their \nwill when they want to live in the community is discrimination. Yet it \nis still going on. Under current law, Medicaid is required--required--\nto pay for nursing home care for a person with a disability who is \nfinancially eligible. But there is no similar obligation to pay for the \nsame person to receive their care at home. This makes the promise of \nthe Olmstead decision hollow for many residents of many States.\n  I will have more to say about this later but I see another champion \nwho, during his career in the House and even before that in his own \nState of Ohio, but for all of his life and his career, has been one of \nour stalwarts in fighting for the rights of people with disabilities. \nSenator Brown could not be harder working and more devoted to making \nsure that the ADA actually works and is not put on the shelf someplace.\n  I thank the Senator from Ohio for all of his support over all the \nyears, for support of the ADA, the ADA Act Amendments which he was here \nfor and helped us get through, and for all the things we do to try to \nmake life better, more fair, and more just for people with \ndisabilities.\n  I yield the floor to the Senator from Ohio.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank Senator Harkin.\n  Before I was in the Senate, for several years in the House I watched \nfrom afar the work Senator Harkin did. No one, and I mean no one--we \nhear a lot of accolades here; not always as genuine, perhaps, as they \nshould be, but this one absolutely is--no one has worked as hard or as \neffectively as Senator Harkin has on issues affecting people with \ndisabilities. It is personal for him, but Senator Harkin has taken up \nwhat was a personal issue for him growing up, about his brother and now \nabout his nephew, and the impact it has had on him and the impact it \nhas had on America is terrific and is unmatched.\n  I know Senator Kennedy, about whom we still think so often, was a \nmajor driver of this and other civil rights issues. But I would say \nSenator Harkin has been second to none, advocating for his brother, for \nhis nephew, but for Iowans and Ohioans and Californians and North \nDakotans--all over this country, New Yorkers--everyone, those Americans \nwith disabilities who typically make less money or are less likely to \nbe employed because of discrimination and because of biases that we all \nprobably too often too much hold.\n  Senator Harkin has always risen above that and challenged people to \ndo the right thing on this civil rights issue and on so many other \ncivil rights issues. For that I am grateful, as a protege, to Tom \nHarkin, as a mentor and well beyond that.\n  We know this coming month marks the 20th anniversary of the passage \nof one of our Nation's most important civil rights laws. It is always \nimportant to reiterate this is a civil rights issue. It does not always \nget as much attention as a civil rights issue, but it absolutely is a \ncivil rights issue that affects the human right and civil right of all \nAmericans, especially those people with disability. For the last 20 \nyears the Americans With Disabilities Act has helped educate a child \nwith cerebral palsy or multiple sclerosis. It has broken down \nemployment barriers for all kinds of people with disabilities--those \nwho are blind, those who are deaf--so many Americans. Places of work \nand recreation, from a courthouse to a ball park, because of this \nAmericans With Disabilities Act, are more accessible to the wheelchair \nbound. So, too, are public accommodations and public transportation.\n  Those in this body who are as old or older than I can remember how \ndifferent the world looked in terms of curbs, in terms of stairs, in \nterms of access, just physical access to all kinds of public \nfacilities, let alone private facilities; how different things were \nbefore 1990 when the Americans With Disabilities Act was signed into \nlaw by the first President Bush.\n  Modern conveniences from the telephone to the Internet are not \ntechnological barriers but means, now, of social inclusiveness and \neconomic opportunity. The ADA has increased graduation rates for \nAmericans with disabilities, and it has increased public safety on our \nstreets and in our hospitals. Simply put, since the ADA passed 20 years \nago, more than 50 million--1 out of 6 of our 300 million citizens in \nthis country--more than 50 million Americans in this country have had a \ngreater opportunity to enjoy basic rights and\n\n[[Page S6137]]\n\nprivileges afforded to every American. That is due in large part to \nSenator Harkin's leadership on this bill.\n  He speaks about the lack of opportunities his deaf brother Frank had \nin school and in the workplace. At the same time he speaks about his \nnephew, a quadriplegic veteran, who used the GI Bill to go to school, \nused a wheelchair and accessible van to live a self-sufficient life. \nThat is the difference when government chooses to assert its \nresponsibility to extend equal opportunity to all its citizens. I \nunderstand Senator Harkin's office is currently conducting a tour of 99 \ncounties to collect the stories of Iowans who have benefited from the \nADA. In many ways, these stories also honor the activists in the \ncommunity, advocates in the courtroom, the physicians and nurses' aides \nand physical therapists and occupational therapists in hospitals, who \npushed for change decades before the ADA.\n  The ADA was not the culmination of our work because it continues. But \nunderstand how many people worked so many years, working side by side \nwith the Senator Harkins of this body and others, to bring forward that \nlegislation 20 years ago.\n  In my State, in Ohio, independent living centers and ability centers \nacross the State have long provided the support services for Ohioans \nwith disabilities that the law had failed to do. Ohio's school for the \ndeaf was established in 1829 in a small house across from what is now \nthe Capitol on Broad and High Streets in downtown Columbus. It provided \nthe education the law did not require, in those days, of all education \ninstitutions. Through much of the last century, the 20th century, \nfriends and families of Americans with disabilities were forced, day in \nand day out, to overcome daily obstacles because there was no law to \nhelp.\n\n  In the absence of a law remained the incessant bias and the chilling \nstigma that held back our Nation's progress--as it did with voting, \nwith gender discrimination, as it did with racial discrimination. \nPassage of the ADA teaches us that wisdom and goodness persist in each \nof us, despite efforts to marginalize and discriminate by some of us.\n  Across Ohio on Monday--at the Statehouse in Columbus, independent \nliving centers in Dayton and Cincinnati, and at the Great Lakes ADA \nCenter in Cleveland--Ohioans will celebrate the importance of the ADA \nwith friends and family.\n  In Toledo, the ability center will celebrate its 90th anniversary \nwith an ADA celebration at the Toledo zoo, bringing together children \nand families to celebrate a ``Journey Together--Justice, Equality and \nCommunity.'' Such demonstrations celebrate how far laws protecting \nthose with disabilities have come and how much work we still need to \ndo.\n  We know that Americans with disabilities continue to face employment \nbarriers, sometime legal, more often not, but based often on bias and \nprejudice and stigma and all the mix of human emotions that are not \nalways so admirable in all of us. Americans with disabilities are twice \nmore likely to live in poverty than their fellow citizens, with higher \nrates of unemployment and, don't forget, higher rates of \nunderemployment. We know like all progress in our Nation the march for \njustice and equality for the disabled was not easy. Passage of civil \nrights, voting rights, labor rights is not ever easy. The fight for \nwomen's rights and fair pay was not easy. The passage of Medicare and \nMedicaid, recent health insurance reform was not easy. The fight is \nalways worth it.\n  I wear in my lapel a pin depicting a canary in a birdcage. It was \ngiven to me 10 years ago at a workers Memorial Day rally celebrating \nthose workers who had lost a limb or even their lives on the job. The \ncanary says to me 100 years ago workers in this country who went down \nin our mines had no union strong enough or government that cared enough \nto protect them. They were on their own. That is why they took the \ncanary down in the mine. If the canary died from toxic gas or lack of \noxygen, the mine worker on his own had to get out of that mine.\n  We know what has happened in the hundred years since--mine safety \nlaws, although obviously not quite good enough and not enforced often \nenough and effectively enough. We know what else happened: Medicare/\nMedicaid, civil rights, Social Security, ban on child labor, safe \ndrinking water, clean air, seatbelts, airbags--all the kinds of things \nthat have made our lives richer and better and longer in a way that no \ncountry on Earth before us had ever achieved.\n  Add the Americans With Disabilities Act to that long line of success, \nof a fight for justice in human rights that was not easy. Every one of \nthose whom this canary pin represents, every one of those pieces of \nprogress, whether it is the Food and Drug Administration, safe food, \nclean air, safe drinking water, Americans With Disabilities Act, civil \nrights, prohibition on child labor--every one of those victories came \nat great cost and with great effort. That is the story of the Americans \nWith Disabilities Act. It is part of that lineage of government \nstepping in to extend equality and opportunity to all Americans, \nunderstanding some number of people in this body and in this country \nthink there is not much of a role of government for a lot of things, \nbut they need to think about that canary in the cage.\n  They need to think that 90 percent of this country thinks there \nshould be strong mine safety laws, there should be strong civil rights \nlaws, there should be strong labor laws, there should be strong pure \nfood laws and safe drinking water and clean air and auto safety and all \nthose things we do.\n  On April 4, 1864, President Lincoln signed into Federal law the \nauthorization to confer collegiate degrees to the deaf and hard of \nhearing at a campus here in Washington, DC. To this day, Gallaudet \nUniversity is the only liberal arts university in the world dedicated \nto the pursuit of access to higher education for deaf and hard-of-\nhearing people.\n  For the past year, I have had the honor to serve on the Board of \nTrustees at Gallaudet University. I did so at the behest of Senator \nHarkin, who has reinforced for me the responsibility we all have to \nserving the public good. A visit to Gallaudet University is a visit to \nan institution that is a model for what we should be doing in this \ncountry in civil rights and rights for Americans with disabilities.\n  Three years before signing Gallaudet's charter, President Lincoln \ncelebrated our Nation's 85th year of independence, in 1861, by \ndeclaring to the Congress:\n\n       The principal aim of the US government should be--\n\n  These are Lincoln's words--\n\n       The principal aim of the US government should be to elevate \n     the condition of men--to lift artificial weights from all \n     shoulders--to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all--\n     and to afford all, an unfettered start and a fair chance in \n     the race of life.\n\n  As we celebrate the 20th anniversary of the ADA, let's work so each \nAmerican has that unfettered start and that each American has that fair \nchance, just a fair chance, not a guaranteed result but a fair chance, \nto achieve the American dream, that our Nation be free of prejudice and \nbias and, instead, full of opportunity and access.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. First, let me thank the Senator from Ohio for his kind \nwords. But more than that, more meaningfully, to thank him for all his \nhelp and support on so many broad issues that deal with working people \nin America and, especially now at this time, people with disabilities.\n  I thank him for his service on the board for Gallaudet University. It \nis a great institution. I would hope everybody could pay a visit to \nGallaudet. It is one of the ``crown jewels'' of our government. As \nSenator Brown said, it is the only place in the world where a student \nwho is deaf can go and get a liberal arts education. Quite frankly, as \nthe Senator knows, we do bring students from other countries over here \nwho go to Gallaudet and then go to their home countries after \ngraduating. I thank the Senator for his service on the board of \nGallaudet University.\n  Before Senator Brown spoke, I was talking a little bit about one of \nthe\n\n[[Page S6138]]\n\nunfulfilled promises of ADA; that is, independent living, the idea that \npeople should not be forced to go into a nursing home just to get \nsupport so they can live.\n  I mentioned the Olmstead decision of 10 years ago by the Supreme \nCourt, which basically said that mandating that people have to live in \na nursing home in order to get Medicaid support is discrimination under \nthe ADA, but 10 years later it is still going on. Some States have \nmoved ahead in this regard and have provided the wherewithal to help \npeople with disabilities to live independently.\n  The problem is, most States still limit, they limit people with \ndisabilities who can get this kind of assistance. They either do it \nthrough a waiver program or other exceptions. They include only certain \nparticular types of disabilities, they have cost caps or they just \nsimply limit the number of individuals who can be served. So it kind of \nis almost adding insult to injury. It is sort of the luck of the draw, \nsort of like a lottery. If you fall into a certain group, if you happen \nto have applied before they filled their quota, you can live in the \ncommunity and get support. If you did not, you are out of luck.\n  So this has built up all kinds of tensions within the disabled \ncommunity and among different groups of disabilities because States \nsometimes identify by disability who can get support in the community \nand who cannot.\n  So ever since the passage of ADA, and I can remember shortly after \nthe passage of ADA I took to the floor and I said: Now that we have the \nADA passed, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the next big hurdle is \nto make sure two things: People can live independently in the \ncommunity, and they can get the supportive services they need in order \nto do that and to get employment.\n  So we have been trying to do that now for 16, 17 years. At first, \nthere was a bill called MICASSA. Do not ask me what it stands for, I \nforgot. But it was a bill that would provide for people to be able to \nget the same support, whether they lived in an institution or they \nlived on their own in a community.\n  Well, we could never get that bill passed. CBO gave it all these \nhorrendous costs. It was going to cost so much money. I always thought \nthat was spurious; that the cost estimates were not right. Then we \nfollowed up with a bill called the Community Choice Act. Well, we did \nnot get that. We have not gotten that done either, but we did get a \ncouple of promises in money follows the person. In the recently passed \nhealth care bill, we saw our opportunity to do something, to help, to \ntry to fulfill the mandate of the Supreme Court, a constitutional \nmandate that people should be able to live where they want to live.\n  So what we have now in the health care bill is we have expanded the \nMoney Follows the Person Program; that is, the money to States to \nfollow the person. Rather than money going to a State to go to an \ninstitution to pay for a person, why not the money go to the State to \ngo to the person and let the person decide where he or she wants to \nlive?\n  So that has been extended to 2016 in the health care bill. The other \npart of this, of making sure people can live independently and can have \neconomic self-sufficiency, is personal attendant services. Again, right \nafter the passage of the ADA, I spoke about that. I said: You can have \nall the wonderful accessibilities in your job, you can have transit \nsystems and buses that will take you to your job and back or subways or \nwhatever, and you can have the most enlightened employer that can \nprovide accessible work spaces.\n  But what if you cannot even get out the door in the morning? What if \nyou cannot even get from your bed to the door to get to work? Herein, \nagain, I speak of my own family. My nephew Kelly was only 19, about 20 \nyears old, when he was severely injured. He became almost a \nquadriplegic, severe paraplegic.\n  Well, he is a big strapping kid. Kelly, again, was not going to give \nup. So he went back to school, got his education, and then he wanted to \nlive by himself. He did. Well, he lived at home for a while with my \nsister and her husband, my brother-in-law. But then he wanted to strike \nout on his own. So he got his own independent place to live.\n  Here is what happened to my nephew Kelly. Every morning he would have \na nurse come in. He lived by himself. A nurse came into his house, got \nhim out of bed, got him going in the morning, took care of certain \nfunctions, got him ready to go.\n  Kelly would make his own breakfast, roll his wheelchair out. He had a \nlift on his van. Lift it up, put him in the van. Drive to work. He \nbecame so independent he started his own small business.\n  Then, at night when he would come home, a lot of times he would stop, \nshop in a grocery store or something like that, get in his van, come \nhome. Every evening he would have, again, a personal attendant who \nwould come into his house and do his exercises. He was so determined to \nkeep his muscle activity alive. So he would have a person come in, do \nall his exercises, put him through his routines every day, and then get \nhim ready so he could go to bed. This happened every day.\n  But it enabled him to get up and get out the door and go to work, \nbecome a tax-paying, income-earning citizen. So how was he able to \nafford this? Were my sister and her husband wealthy? Not at all, had no \nmoney whatsoever. So how was Kelly able to afford someone to come in \nevery day and take care of him like that and give him these personal \nattendant services?\n  He was able to afford it because he was injured in the military. He \nwas injured while serving on an aircraft carrier. So the VA--thank God \nfor the VA--the VA paid for this. They paid to have his home modified \nso he could live by himself. Now, for 30 years, the Veterans' \nAdministration has paid for Kelly to have personal attendant services \nso he can go to work, earn a living, pay taxes.\n  But what about people who were not injured in the military? What \nabout people who just got injured in an accident or were born with a \ndisability who do not have the Veterans' Administration to pay for \nthis? Well, they are out of luck. They are just out of luck.\n  So they may want to get a job. They can be very capable of doing a \njob. They can be well educated, know how to run Microsoft and Word and \nall that kind of stuff. They may be qualified for a job. But if they do \nnot have some support during the day to get out the door, how are they \ngoing to get down to that bus stop to get on that accessible bus to go \nto a place of business that is accessible, that has an employer that \nhas made the workplace accessible so they can have a job? Very \nshortsighted. Very shortsighted, to say: No, we will do all those other \nthings, but if you cannot get out the door in the morning, tough luck, \nor if you need something during the day, maybe you need someone to come \nin during the middle of the day to help you with something you may \nneed, whether it is eating or grooming or bathing or toilet activities \nor whatever it may be, maybe you need that once or twice during the day \njust so you can work, they do not have that.\n  That is our next big challenge. That is our next big challenge, to \nhelp with these everyday tasks that most people take for granted. It \nmakes the crucial difference between whether a person can live an \nindependent inclusive life in the community or they have to be sent to \na nursing home to live in isolation.\n\n  So when people tell me this costs a lot of money, I say: Wait a \nsecond. Wait a second. Let's have this again. It costs a lot of money? \nWhat about all these people who are in nursing homes now that could be \nliving by themselves? What about all those people who are living by \nthemselves now, out there but are not getting any support, but they are \nnot working. They want to work. They are capable of working. What if \nthey go to work and become taxpayers, income earners?\n  That is not taken into account, you see. Only the outlay is taken \ninto account. That is why I have always said the cost that we see of \npersonal attendant services is skewed because we do not take into \naccount the other side of the ledger. But we know, we know from \npersonal experience, that people with disabilities, as I have said, can \nbe the most productive, hardest workers in our society, if they are \njust given a chance.\n  Again, these services, these supports, allow them to fulfill the \npromise of the ADA, to have jobs, participate in the\n\n[[Page S6139]]\n\ncommunity, to make their own choices, not having the State or the \ngovernment or someone else tell them how they have to live.\n  Let people make their own choices. Let them govern their own lives. \nThat is why the Community First Choice option that is in the health \ncare bill is so important. So we are starting to move in that \ndirection. We should have done it a long time ago, but we could not, \nbut we got it in the health care bill. So beginning in October of next \nyear, 2011, in the health care reform bill we passed, that we will have \navailable to States, if a State selects and chooses to implement the \nOlmstead decision and to support people with disabilities to live in \nthe community on their own, they will get a bump up in their Federal \nmatching funds.\n  Specifically, the community first choice option in the health care \nbill will cover the provision of personal care services and will also \nhelp support people who live independently, personal care services so \npeople can live independently. For the first time in the health care \nreform bill we passed, the community first choice option will require a \nState to provide all eligible individuals with personal care services \nrather than only serving a small proportion, maybe just certain people \nwith certain disabilities or waiting lists or caps on costs. This bill \nwill require a State to provide all eligible individuals with personal \ncare services rather than serving a small slice, as now, or keeping \nlong and slow moving waiting lists. Some people are on waiting lists \nfor 10, 15 years before the State comes up with the money so they may \nlive on their own and have personal care services.\n  The community first choice option is one that starts next year, but \nit will grow every year. A State that moves in that direction will get \na bump up of 6 percent in their Federal matching funds. That is a big \ndeal. A State that wants to do this says: If we do it, we will get more \nmoney for the FMAP. Without getting into details, what that means is \nthe State will get more Federal money, if it provides for the \nindependent living of people with disabilities in the State. We have \nmade significant progress in increasing home and community-based \noptions; the big step being in the health care bill as it unfolds. But \nwe are still a long way from having a comprehensive and equitable \nsystem for providing personal care services to all Americans who are \neligible for nursing home care.\n  Let's talk a little bit about the issue of employment, perhaps my \nbiggest disappointment in the 20 years since ADA has been in \nemployment. Data surveys show that right now 60 percent or more of \npeople with disabilities who want to work and are able to work are \nunemployed.\n  We hear about all the unemployment figures all the time. We hear \nabout 9 percent unemployment or 18 percent unemployment. Think about \npeople in the disability community, 60 percent unemployment. This is \nshameful, this many years after the ADA was passed, 10 years after the \nOlmstead decision. There are a variety of reasons. Again, one of the \nbiggest is lack of support services. Some employers don't provide \nenough reasonable accommodations. Some people are just reluctant to \nhire people with disabilities. That kind of subtle discrimination still \ngoes on.\n  In the bill, we said employers must provide reasonable \naccommodations. I remember so many stories in the unfolding after we \npassed ADA. I remember the story of one woman who had a big skill set \nin terms of what was then computers, the early 1990s. She had a great \nskill set in that. She had answered an ad for employment, went down and \ninterviewed. She clearly was qualified. Because the job required her to \nwork at different stations, different desks, the employer said he \ncouldn't do that because she used a wheelchair. She had been born with \na disability. She couldn't get under the desks because of the height of \nthe wheelchair.\n  The employer said: I would have to replace all these desks. That \ncosts a lot of money. It is not a reasonable accommodation. So she went \nhome, told her father this. Her father, who was somewhat of a \nreasonable carpenter, had a bright idea. He went down to the workshop \nand cut a bunch of wood blocks about 3 inches high. He took them to the \nemployer and said: If you just put one of these under every leg of the \ndesk, it would not cost very much. Then it will be accessible--simple \nthings like that.\n  I remember the story of a school. The school board was very upset \nbecause they had to make the drinking fountains available. If we have \nkids in school with disabilities, we will have to lower all the \ndrinking fountains or something like that. It will cost a lot of money. \nSomeone pointed out, if they just put a wastebasket and a paper cup \ndispenser by the water fountain, they solve the problem--simple things \nlike that that don't cost much money at all.\n  It took a while for people to start thinking about it. How do we do \nthings in a simple, straightforward manner so that people can go to \nschool or work and we can make reasonable accommodations?\n  Employers I talk to who have employees with disabilities say they are \nthe most exemplary of workers. All they need is an opportunity and \nreasonable accommodations, maybe supportive services. Yet we just \nhaven't made as much progress as I had hoped over the last 20 years. We \nneed to do a better job of ensuring that people with disabilities have \njob opportunities, not just any job but one that is equal to their \ninterests and their talents and pays accordingly. We need to ensure \nthat persons with disabilities have access to the training and supports \nnecessary to be successful.\n  So many times I have heard: I don't have a job in the disability \narea, for a person with a disability. A lot of people think people with \ndisabilities have to work on disability issues. That is not it at all.\n  I always talk about my brother Frank. He didn't do a job that had \nanything to do with being disabled. But he had a talent, and he could \ndo something else. It is time to quit looking at people and focusing on \nthe disability. Look at people and focus on their abilities, what they \nare capable of doing, what their talents are, what they can do. Don't \ntalk to me about disabilities. We can overcome that. What are their \ntalents and abilities? That is why we need the training and support \nactivities, so we can bring that shameful unemployment rate of 60 \npercent down.\n  The ADA is to people with disabilities what the Emancipation \nProclamation was to African Americans. One of the great shames of \nAmerican history is that it was more than a century after the \nEmancipation Proclamation that the Civil Rights Act actually made good \non Lincoln's promise. That is too far and too long to wait. I can't \nthink of a better way to celebrate the 20th anniversary of ADA than by \nrededicating ourselves to completing the promise of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. This means giving people with disabilities not only \nthe right to be independent or the right to have a job but the \nwherewithal to be independent and to hold a job.\n  I don't want to forget all the progress and accomplishments we have \nachieved over the last 20 years. It has been wonderful, monumental. To \nactivists and advocates in the disability community who are out there \nin the States and here in the Nation's Capital, I salute them. I thank \nthem for all the progress they have worked so hard to bring about \nthrough their dedication and tireless efforts. On this day, as on \nMonday, they can be proud of the great things they have accomplished. \nWe all know there is much more work to be done.\n  When I spoke on the Senate floor 20 years ago, I did it all in sign \nlanguage. I have neglected to do so today. I think since my brother \npassed on, I don't speak with sign language very often. I don't \npractice much anymore. I have forgotten many signs. But there is one \nfinal thought I have. In American sign language, there is a wonderful \nsign for America. I want to teach it to all these pages and everybody. \nIt is a wonderful sign for America.\n  You put your fingers together like this, kind of make an A for \nAmerica, and it goes around like this. That is the sign for America. \nThink about it. Not separated, everyone together, one family, no one is \nexcluded. No one is here; no one is there. We are all together. We are \nin this circle, the circle of life. A beautiful sign for America.\n  That is what I think about when I think about the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. It brought people into the circle. It made everybody \npart of a family. It made our family much more complete.\n\n[[Page S6140]]\n\n  That is the historic achievement we celebrate in the Senate \nresolution before us today. It is the historic achievement we must \nsafeguard for generations to come. One America, one inclusive American \nfamily that respects the dignity, the value, and the civil rights of \nall, including Americans with disabilities.\n  When he signed the ADA into law, President Bush spoke with great \neloquence. Just before taking up his pen, he said:\n\n       Let the shameful wall of exclusion finally come tumbling \n     down.\n\n  Twenty years later, that wall is indeed falling. The ADA has broken \ndown barriers, created opportunities, transformed lives. This great law \nis America at its very best. So it is fitting for the Senate to \ncommemorate its great achievement 20 years ago in passing the ADA with \nan overwhelmingly bipartisan vote of 91 to 6. I urge all colleagues to \njoin with the many bipartisan cosponsors in voting for this Senate \nresolution.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 20th \nanniversary of the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nThis legislation, signed into law on July 26, 1990, marked a historic \naffirmation of the principles of equality and inclusion upon which our \ncountry was founded. I was proud to cosponsor this legislation as a \nMember of the House of Representatives, and I am proud of the strides \nmade since that time in protecting and defending the civil rights of \ncitizens with disabilities.\n  When the law was enacted, many Americans believed that it was an \nimpossible dream that all street crosswalks should be wheelchair \naccessible. Employers feared the prospect of having to make \n``reasonable accommodation'' for their employees and customers with \ndisabilities. Frankly, some people found it unthinkable that disabled \npeople would be able to fully participate in our society. I am pleased \nto report that the past 20 years have proven them wrong.\n  Thanks to the ADA, disabled people across the Nation are better able \nto engage in their community, contribute to their workplace, and \nachieve their educational goals. While the ADA increased accessibility \nto public places and addressed physical barriers, it also changed the \nlandscape of opportunities available to Americans of all abilities. \nAttitudes have shifted to recognize people for their abilities and \ntalents, rather than their differences.\n  These advances have contributed to the growth of productivity in our \nNation and have brought an entirely new realm of perspectives and ideas \ninto the workplace. As millions of Americans have received fair \ntreatment because of these laws, so has our Nation benefitted through \nincreased growth and productivity in our workforce.\n  Last Congress, I was pleased to cosponsor and support the passage of \nthe ADA Amendments Act of 2008 to ensure the intent and protections of \nthe ADA were realized. This law extends protections from workplace \ndiscrimination to cover a broader universe of persons living with \ndisabilities. I have supported efforts to expand home and community-\nbased services to ensure individuals can access the necessary health \nand assistive services while still living in their homes. I am pleased \nthe health reform bill included these efforts, as well as other \nprovisions to increase long-term care choices.\n  And yet with all this progress, there is still work left to be done. \nThe disabled community still faces barriers in accessing quality health \ncare, obtaining appropriate education, finding meaningful employment \nopportunities, and securing financial independence. The rising price of \nhealth care has placed financial pressure on all Americans. These \nincreased costs put additional strain on disabled working Americans \nwhen their earnings become a liability rather than an asset. \nIndividuals should have the opportunity to contribute their time and \ntalents without jeopardizing their health insurance benefits and \nchallenging their incentive to work. Our policies should encourage \nvocational promotion, self-sufficiency, and financial independence.\n  Many areas of our country lack reliable and accessible transportation \nfor individuals with a disability. As we all know, without reliable \ntransportation it is difficult to commute to work, the local grocery \nstore, or even the doctor's office. Other obstacles in education, \ntelecommunication, and accessible and affordable housing prevent \nindividuals with a disability from contributing fully to their \ncommunity. As our attitudes and environments continue evolving, we must \nwork to ensure the advances made over the last 20 years continue to \nmove us forward.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nmarking the 20th anniversary of the enactment of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. As the ranking member of the Senate Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor and Pensions, I am particularly proud of this \nlegislation and the impact it has had on addressing the rights and \nneeds of people with disabilities all across the country for the past \n20 years. As we mark this great anniversary, I also want to express my \ngreat appreciation for the hard work and determined effort those with a \nvision of equality and justice put into seeing this bill through the \nlegislative process. It was a courageous and heroic cause and it has \nmade a difference in more lives than we will ever know.\n  Just 20 years ago this month, on July 26, 1990, President George Bush \nsigned the Americans with Disabilities Act into law. It is without \nquestion the most important civil rights legislation that has been \npassed by the Congress since the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It was such \na great achievement because it reflected our fundamental and growing \nconcern for human rights by extending civil rights protections to all \nAmericans with disabilities.\n  Prior to the passage of the ADA, far too many of our fellow Americans \nwith disabilities led isolated lives, artificially separated from the \nmainstream of society, denied the basic opportunity to pursue the \nAmerican dream. Things had to change if we were to remain true to the \nideals and principles upon which our Nation was founded that are \nenumerated so well in the Declaration of Independence and the \nConstitution. By any standard, those with disabilities did not have the \nchance to engage in all that life has to offer including their own \npursuit of happiness.\n  Fortunately, things are different now. Although there is still more \nto do we have every reason to be proud of what the ADA has been able to \nachieve thus far. We can see the vision of the ADA being carried out \nbefore our eyes as it enables our family members, friends, and \nneighbors to go about their daily lives, praying, going to school, and \npursuing their goals in every area of their lives--on every level--in \nlarge part because of what the Americans with Disabilities Act has made \npossible.\n  Twenty years ago, before the passage of this legislation, our country \nwas a much different place for those with disabilities. It was \ndifficult, if not impossible, for them to access the resources in their \ncommunities that we all take for granted. Minor barriers most of us \ncould easily navigate had long been major obstacles for people with \ndisabilities. We needed to do something to make it easier to access the \nplaces we all had long enjoyed with our friends. It wouldn't take a \nlot--just simple accommodations like curb cuts, ramps instead of \nstairs, more accessible stadium features, and better equipped \ntelecommunications devices. Just these few simple changes would have \nmade all the difference. Unfortunately, although easily done they were \nall too scarce and all too often impossible to find. Then the ADA came \nto pass and it raised our awareness of what needed to be done and our \nresolve to do it.\n  When the ADA changed everything it meant a lot to people like \nEllington Herring, a young man from Germantown, MD, who has an \nintellectual disability and uses a wheelchair. Thanks to the ADA and \nthe efforts of people to get it implemented across the Nation, he has \nfull access to all the resources of his community. Without the ADA \nEllington wouldn't be able to spend the day doing what he enjoys most--\ngoing to the mall, going places with his family and friends, getting \nhis hair cut at the local barber shop, taking in a movie, and going to \nchurch.\n  Twenty years ago while students with disabilities had to be included \nin the same school those without disabilities attended, they did not \nhave to be placed with the others in a general education classroom. It \nwas the ADA along with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, \nand the Elementary and Secondary Education Act\n\n[[Page S6141]]\n\nthat has subsequently guaranteed them access to the general education \ncurriculum and we are all the beneficiaries of that.\n  Let me introduce you to someone else--Ted Dawson of Buffalo, WY. \nThanks to the ADA, he was able to graduate with a high school diploma--\nnot a certificate of achievement--but a high school diploma. There is a \ndifference and it meant a lot to him and his parents, teachers, school \nadministrators, and his friends. They all had high expectations for \nhim--and he delivered! It wasn't easy. In Wyoming you have to be \nproficient in at least 5 of 9 common core areas in order to graduate. \nTed, who has Down's syndrome, stepped up and met the challenge because \nthat was what was expected of him. More importantly--it was what he \nexpected from himself. He is an important example of what can happen if \npeople are valued and included instead of being segregated into special \nclassrooms and regarded as less capable. Thanks to the ADA, Ted is 24 \nnow and living and working in his community.\n  Twenty years ago it was not well understood that people with \ndisabilities wanted to work and pursue a career, go to school, be a \npart of the activities in their communities, and be treated just like \neveryone else. Let me introduce you to George Garcia of Cheyenne, WY. \nHe is a 53-year-old gentleman who works part time at a meaningful job, \nsits on multiple boards, volunteers with several organizations and just \nso happens to have an intellectual disability. Mr. Garcia, as the \nGovernor of Wyoming calls him, knows everything about the city he calls \nhome and the State of Wyoming. In fact, he knows just about everyone \nwho lives in Wyoming because he has spent years traveling the roads of \nour State sharing his story and his message about the importance of \nchoice, freedom and independence. Without the ADA George, and thousands \nof people just like him, would not have had the opportunity to hold \nmeaningful jobs, live where they choose, and go anywhere they want to \nin their communities.\n  That was so because 20 years ago people with disabilities were \ndestined to live in an institution--community based services and \nsupport were not an option. Now families have choices and many of them \nhave chosen community living. That brings me to Owen Johnson. Let me \nshare Owen's story with you. He was born with spinal muscular atrophy \nin January of 2008 at Primary Children's Hospital in Utah. When he was \nborn doctors told his dad, Lenn and his mom, Gayle, that Owen's life \nexpectancy would be a mere 2 years. Lenn and Gayle wanted to bring Owen \nhome to Wyoming to be with his family. Unfortunately they were informed \nthat Cokeville, WY, was ``too rural'' and they would not be able to \nfind the services and support they would need to do so. Some doctors \nwere even suggesting they place Owen in a nursing home in Utah. With \nthe support of multiple State agencies and local organizations, after 6 \nmonths Owen Johnson went home to live with his parents on their rural \nranch. Today he is 2\\1/2\\ and he and his family are thriving in their \ncommunity and Owen is going strong--defying the odds of his doctors who \nare amazed and thrilled by his progress.\n  While it is true that we all have our own struggles in life to deal \nwith, it is also true that some face more difficult challenges that \nthey have to work to overcome just to do the things that are part of \nour own daily routine. Such an individual is Cindy Bentley from \nMilwaukee, WI. Cindy is an articulate, engaging, upbeat, and \ncharismatic individual. She is a world traveler, and a national speaker \nand spokesperson for millions of people with disabilities. People have \nno idea about her history. Cindy was born with fetal alcohol syndrome \nwith cocaine, alcohol, and heroin in her bloodstream, resulting in \nlifelong intellectual disabilities, seizures, and some motor control \nproblems. She then received severe burns when she was placed in foster \ncare at the age of 2\\1/2\\ and her foster mother set her shirt on fire. \nShortly thereafter she was placed in the Southern Wisconsin Center for \npeople with developmental disabilities. Cindy now lives independently \nin her own apartment in Glendale, WI. She was chosen as 1 of 12 Special \nOlympics Global Messengers from 2000-2002, and she is an active member \nof two statewide Governor-appointed councils.\n  Twenty years ago people with disabilities could not access public \ntransportation and those that lived in the community couldn't go \nanywhere because they lacked the means to easily travel on their own. \nThe ADA changed all that by removing the barriers that faced those with \ndisabilities when they tried to travel. Such was the case for Richard \nLeslie, the founder and executive director of the Wyoming Epilepsy \nAssociation that is located in Cheyenne, WY. Richard himself has \nepilepsy and he does not have the ability to drive because of his \ndisability. He has used his disability to empower himself and others by \nbecoming an advocate for people with disabilities. The ADA has assisted \nhim and others like him by creating public transit systems that are \nusable and accessible, much like the Cheyenne Transit Program. The \nCheyenne Transit Program offers accessible bus rides at reasonable \nfares as well as curb-to-curb services which not only allows for \nmobility within the city but makes the opportunity for employment \nbetter as well because the service is tailored to the individual's \nneeds.\n  These are just a few of the remarkable stories that can be told \nbecause of the Americans with Disabilities Act which is still making a \ndifference throughout the United States. While no one would ever say \nthat the lives of these people has been easy, the Americans with \nDisabilities Act has helped to make things easier by making the things \npeople with disabilities do every day a somewhat smaller mountain for \nthem to climb.\n  The ADA opened the world to people with disabilities by guaranteeing \ntheir independence, freedom of choice, ability to control their lives, \nand the opportunity to completely, fully, and equally participate in \nthe American mainstream.\n  No law is perfect and some problems still arise with this one. As \nrecently as 2008 Congress had to revisit the ADA. After negotiating \ntogether through the committee process in the Senate, we acted with \noverwhelming bipartisan support to pass the ADA Amendments Act, which \nrestored ADA protections that had been complicated by judicial \ndecisions narrowing the scope of the law.\n  While Congress has continued to address the issue the Capitol complex \nis not fully accessible yet. When I served as the chairman of the \nSenate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions I routinely \nheard from people with disabilities about inaccessible hearing and \nconference rooms on Capitol Hill, the use of offensive terminology by \nMembers and staff and a lack of understanding and awareness about \ndisability issues.\n  That was when I took it upon myself to write a manual to help \ncongressional offices prepare for visitors, interns, and staff who may \nhave accessibility needs. As elected officials it is our role to ensure \nthat everyone who comes to visit the Nation's Capitol or our home \noffices, including people with accessibility needs, are included in our \ndaily dialogue. The manual contains all disability specific resources \noffered by the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, the \nSergeant at Arms, the Capitol Police, the Office of Security and \nEmergency Preparedness, the Architect of the Capitol, and other offices \nin the Capitol Hill complex in an easily available and easy to read \nformat so that if a constituent who is deaf arrives at a meeting and a \nsign language interpreter was not reserved the office can easily \ndetermine who to call for assistance.\n  Just as the Architect of the Capitol is improving signage for people \nwho are blind, and ensuring that all restrooms are accessible by \nwheelchair users I am currently updating the manual to account for such \nchanges and the addition of the Capitol Visitor Center.\n  Today, we recognize and celebrate the anniversary of a law that \nbrought freedom, choice, and independence to many Americans. It is a \nconstant reminder of who we are as a people, and what we stand for as a \nnation. As President Bush noted when he signed the ADA into law: ``This \nAct is powerful in its simplicity. It will ensure that people with \ndisabilities are given the basic guarantees for which they have worked \nso long and so hard: independence, freedom of choice, control of their \nlives, the opportunity to blend\n\n[[Page S6142]]\n\nfully and equally into the rich mosaic of the American mainstream.'' \nThis law makes it clear that all Americans are entitled to the right to \nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. As we continue to make \nthis law more responsive to the needs of those with disabilities, we \nwill continue to ensure that the chance to live the American dream is \nan avenue of opportunity that is available to everyone--without \nexception.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, my friend Senator Tom Harkin has been \nchampioning the rights of Americans with disabilities his whole life. \nHe witnessed the challenges and discriminations of people with \ndisabilities first hand. His brother Frank lost his hearing at a very \nyoung age and he has witnessed the many ways that people with \ndisabilities are prevented from fully participating in activities that \nmost Americans take for granted.\n  Senator Harkin has said that the 1990 signing of his bill, Americans \nwith Disabilities Act remains one of the proudest days of his life. The \nvote I cast for Americans with Disabilities Act was one of my proudest \ndays as a U.S. Senator.\n  This month will mark two decades since the landmark passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act, known as the ADA. This important civil \nrights law seeks to ensure equality rights and opportunities for the \nmore than 54 million Americans with physical and mental disabilities.\n  Prior to the passage of the ADA, people with disabilities faced \nsignificantly lower employment rates, lower graduation rates, and \nhigher rates of poverty than people without disabilities, and were too \noften denied the opportunity to fully participate in society due to \nintolerance and unfair stereotypes.\n  The ADA sought to eliminate the indignities and prejudice faced by \nindividuals with disabilities on a daily basis. Before passage of this \nlaw, individuals with disabilities were prevented from attending \nschools, subject to discriminatory hiring practices, and were unable to \nenter public buildings, safely cross a street, or ride a public bus.\n  On July 26, 1990, the ADA was signed into law signed into law by \nPresident George H.W. Bush with the promise of fostering full and equal \naccess to civic, economic and social life for individuals with \ndisabilities.\n  Upon its passage Senator Edward M. Kennedy, who played an important \nrole in the enactment of this legislation, said:\n\n       The act has the potential to become one of the great civil \n     rights laws of our generation. This legislation is a bill of \n     rights for the disabled, and America will be a better and \n     fairer nation because of it.\n\n  Indeed, over the last 20 years, the ADA has become one of our \ncountry's most important and treasured civil rights laws.\n  The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in \nemployment, public accommodations, commercial facilities, \ntransportation and telecommunications, as well as federal, state and \nlocal government programs.\n  It has been a critical part of our efforts to fulfill the Nation's \ngoals of equality of opportunity, independent living, economic self-\nsufficiency, and full participation for Americans with disabilities.\n  It has played an historic role in allowing over 50 million Americans \nwith disabilities to participate more fully in national life by \nremoving barriers to employment, transportation, public services, \ntelecommunications, and public accommodations.\n  Specifically, it prohibits employers from discriminating against \nqualified individuals with disabilities and it requires that State and \nlocal governmental entities accommodate qualified individuals with \ndisabilities. Because of the ADA, places of public accommodation must \ntake reasonable steps to make their goods and services accessible to \nindividuals with disabilities. And new trains and buses must be \naccessible to individuals with disabilities.\n  All Americans, not just those with disabilities, benefit from the \naccommodations that have become commonplace since the passage of the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act like curb cuts at street intersections, \nramps for access to buildings, greater access to public transportation, \nstadiums, telecommunications, voting machines, and Web sites benefit \nall Americans.\n  The ADA has been one of the most significant and effective civil \nrights laws passed by Congress. We have come a long way in the 20 years \nsince enactment with of the ADA, but children and adults with \ndisabilities continue to experience barriers that interfere with their \nfull participation in mainstream American life.\n  People with disabilities are still twice as likely to live in poverty \nas their fellow citizens and continue to experience high rates of \nunemployment and underemployment. And many people with disabilities \nstill live in segregated institutional settings because of a lack of \nsupport services that would allow them to live in the community.\n  While technology and the Internet have broken down barriers, new \ntechnologies are still not accessible to all Americans. I have \ncosponsored the Equal Access to 21st Century Communications Act by \nSenator Mark Pryor to improve internet technology access for the blind \nand deaf communities. If passed, this legislation would make it easier \nfor deaf and hard of hearing Americans to access the same technologies \nthat hearing people take for granted. In particular, it would require \nall devices to be capable of captioning video and it would require all \nInternet videos to be captioned. No one should be or has to be excluded \nfrom modern communications and the new economy because of a disability.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nSenator Harkin's Senate resolution that recognizes and honors the 20th \nanniversary of the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990. This resolution not only honors passage of the ADA, it also \npledges to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to identify and \naddress the remaining barriers that undermine the Nation's goals of \nequality of opportunity, independent living, economic self-sufficiency, \nand full participation for Americans with disabilities.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am proud to be an original \ncosponsor of Senate Resolution 591 recognizing and honoring the 20th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act.\n  In 1990, congressional members from both sides of the aisle joined \ntogether to denounce disability-based discrimination and demand equal \nrights for the disabled through the Americans with Disabilities Act. In \nthe 20 years since, this landmark law has stood as a proud marker of \nour Nation's collective belief that disabled Americans can and should \nbe full participants in our Nation's civic, economic, and social life. \nThat, as one national disability organization proclaims, ``It's \nability, not disability that counts.''\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act has had profound effects on the \nlives of over 50 million disabled Americans from curb cuts to \nelevators, Braille displays to voice recognition technology, and voting \nassistance to expanded employment opportunities, to name just a few \nexamples.\n  Because of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Americans who are \ndeaf or hard of hearing are now guaranteed the same services that law \nenforcement provides to anyone else. Law enforcement agencies may not \nexclude hearing impaired Americans from their services and must make \nefforts to ensure that their personnel communicate effectively with \npeople whose disability affects their hearing.\n  Thanks to this landmark law, buses are now equipped with reliable \nlifts for wheelchair access; drivers announce stops to inform the \nseeing-impaired of arrival; and paratransit services provide door-to-\ndestination transportation. This increased mobility enables disabled \nAmericans to hold jobs and pursue educational opportunities, to perform \nday-to-day errands independently, and to access medical and social \nservices.\n  As one San Francisco resident said, ``We no longer have to rely on \nthe kindness of strangers to shop for us or feel that we can only \nexperience other cities through films, videos and books.''\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act has enabled disabled Americans to \nvisit and enjoy the grounds of our Nation's cultural and historical \ntreasures such as Mount Vernon, the home of George Washington.\n  This important law has also improved the quality of life for \nAmericans with impaired sight, by requiring\n\n[[Page S6143]]\n\nstores and businesses across the country to accommodate the service \nanimals that guide and assist them. And progress is being made to \nensure that the Web sites and online stores that make up the world of \ne-commerce are accessible as well.\n  Let me offer yet another example: a veteran fireman like Dennis Bell \ndoes not have to quit his job when he loses his leg during a rescue \nattempt, because of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Instead, his \nemployer must provide him with the opportunity to be reassigned. In Mr. \nBell's case, he has been given an opportunity to work in a new division \ninstructing children about fire safety.\n  And because of the Americans with Disabilities Act, a gifted man like \nChris Lenart, who is unable to talk or walk, can pursue a successful \ncareer as a computer programmer and remain economically self-\nsufficient. Employers can no longer deny a job to a qualified applicant \nbecause of a disability.\n  At least 12 percent of Americans live with a disability, but each and \nevery one of us benefits from the skills and talents of disabled \nAmericans who can now contribute to our country's workforce and public \nlife, and whose abilities are not lost for want of an opportunity to \ndemonstrate them.\n  I believe that our country has become a stronger and fairer place \nover the past 20 years because of the Americans with Disabilities Act. \nAs the 20th anniversary approaches, I am proud to reflect with my \ncolleagues on the progress that has been made as a result of this law, \nas well as to acknowledge that there is more work still to be done.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, next Monday marks the 20th anniversary \nof the enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act. The ADA is one \nof America's great civil rights achievements. In its scope and \nintentions, it ranks alongside major victories for equal justice, like \nthe 15th and 19th amendments, the Civil Rights Act and the Voting \nRights Act.\n  I would like to recognize and congratulate my friend and colleague \nTom Harkin for his instrumental role in authoring this legislation 20 \nyears ago. He has been a steadfast advocate for people with \ndisabilities, and with his leadership last Congress we passed the ADA \nAmendments Act of 2008 to restore the full promise of the ADA after it \nbeen distorted and diluted by a series of bad Federal court decisions.\n  I am deeply proud to have voted for the ADA in 1990 because this law \nproduced changes in society--removing physical barriers, prohibiting \ndiscrimination, and changing attitudes--that we might take for granted \ntoday.\n  Before passage of this law, people with disabilities were too often \ndenied the opportunity to fully participate in society. Back then, if \nyou needed a haircut, if you had to see a doctor, if you just wanted to \nmeet a friend for a cup of coffee, you probably had to rely on family, \nfriends, or a social service agency. Very few transit systems in this \ncountry had buses or trains that were accessible to people using \nwheelchairs.\n  We passed the ADA to fulfill the Nation's goals of equality of \nopportunity, independent living, economic self sufficiency, and full \nparticipation for Americans with disabilities. Twenty years later, it \nis clear that this pioneering law is fulfilling its promise in many \nways.\n  You can see it right outside on the sidewalk with curb cuts, ramps, \nBraille signs, and assistive listening devices. The physical changes \nthe ADA has brought about benefit all Americans, not just those with \ndisabilities. We have seen progress in public transportation and public \naccommodations. Because of the ADA and IDEA together, thousands of \nAmericans with disabilities have gone to good schools, received good \neducations, and entered the workforce.\n  The Americans with Disabilities Act does not grant people with \ndisabilities any special status or position. To the contrary, it simply \nremoves certain barriers that for too long had made it difficult--if \nnot impossible for people with disabilities to make the most of their \nGod-given skills and abilities, and to participate fully in their \ncommunities and in the workplace.\n  Despite the important changes made by the ADA, we still have work to \ndo to ensure that people with disabilities achieve the full promise of \nthe law. Twenty years after enactment, people with disabilities still \nexperience barriers that interfere with their full participation in \nmainstream American life.\n  The promise of equal employment opportunity for people with \ndisabilities remains largely unfulfilled.\n  More than 60 percent of working-age Americans with disabilities are \nunemployed. Americans with disabilities who do work tend to be \nconcentrated in lower paying jobs. As a result, individuals with \ndisabilities are three times as likely to live in poverty as \nindividuals without disabilities. That has to change. Most people with \ndisabilities want to work, and have to work.\n  Many people with disabilities continue to live in segregated \ninstitutional settings because the support services they need to live \nin the community don't exist or aren't affordable. And many public and \nprivate buildings still aren't accessible to people with disabilities.\n  It is important to take the time today to recognize the barriers we \nhave eliminated for people with disabilities, and recognize that we \nstill have work to do. We need to continue tearing down the subtler \nbarriers that prevent far too many people with disabilities from \nparticipating fully in our economy, not just because it is the right \nthing to do, but because it is the smart thing to do.\n  When President George H. W. Bush signed the ADA in 1990, people on \nboth sides of the aisle cheered and the President proclaimed: ``With \ntoday's signing of the landmark ADA, every man, woman and child with a \ndisability can now pass through once-closed doors into a bright new era \nof equality, independence and freedom.''\n  That remains our vision, and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to widen that door even further so more Americans can pass \nthrough.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, we are rapidly approaching the time when \nwe will yield the floor to a different resolution, and I guess the vote \nwill be held at around noon on the resolution commemorating the 20th \nanniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act. I didn't say this \nbefore, but there are a lot of activities going on all over this \ncountry this weekend. In every State, certain activities are taking \nplace, although not the same thing. Different States do different \nthings. Senator Brown mentioned that in Iowa we are collecting stories \nfrom all of our 99 counties from people with disabilities, from \nfamilies and friends who know of what has happened in the life of a \nperson with a disability and has been affected by the Americans with \nDisabilities Act. I am participating this weekend in several events in \nIowa commemorating the ADA. In every State we are doing this. It is \nhappening all over the country. Of course, it is happening in \nWashington, DC, as well.\n\n  Next Monday there will be a series of events. At 10 a.m. there will \nbe a panel discussion that will take place in the Kennedy Caucus Room \nin the Russell Building. That is from 10 to 12 noon. Everyone is \ninvited. It will be a discussion, interestingly enough, among a lot of \npeople who were there at the creation, including Steve Bartlett, whom I \nmentioned, Boyden Gray, Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, Bobby \nSilverstein, Pat Wright--a number of people who were there in the \nbeginning--to talk about how this happened but then to also have the \naudience participate in a discussion about what needs to be done and \nwhere we go from here. So that is from 10 to 12 in the Kennedy Caucus \nRoom in the Russell Building.\n  Then at 1 p.m. there is an ADA reception on the House side in \nStatuary Hall. That will start at 1 p.m. Then a very interesting thing \nis going to happen on the House side. At 2 p.m. the House will come \ninto session. The Presiding Officer in the House at that time will be \nRepresentative Jim Langevin from Rhode Island. Congressman Langevin is \na severe paraplegic. I have\n\n[[Page S6144]]\n\nknown Jim for many years. He uses a wheelchair. Congressman Langevin \nhas never been able to preside over the House because, like our podium \nhere, one has to go up a number of steps to get to it. There is no way \nhe could get his wheelchair up there. I understand the House is in the \nprocess now of developing a system so that individuals who use \nwheelchairs can now get to the podium.\n  So for the first time, a Congressperson using a wheelchair will \npreside over the House of Representatives. I intend to be there. As a \nformer House Member, I have privileges of the floor. I want to see that \nhistoric event. That will take place at 2 p.m. on the House side.\n  Then, at 4 p.m., from 4 to 6, President Obama is opening the White \nHouse lawn for a celebration. There will be several hundred people \nthere--people with disabilities and their families and friends, people \nwho have been involved in this. As I understand it, the White House \nwill be making a proclamation at that time. That will be from 4 to 6.\n  At 7 p.m. there will be an ADA anniversary gala at the National Press \nClub from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. thrown by a coalition of disability \nadvocates. So a full day of celebration and remembrance and a day of \ncommitment to moving further and making sure the promise of the ADA is \nfulfilled--not in 100 years but a much shorter time period than that.\n  As I mentioned earlier, it took 100 years, from Lincoln's \nEmancipation Proclamation to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, before the \nEmancipation Proclamation promise was actually put into law. I hope and \ntrust and will work hard to make sure it doesn't take 100 years to make \nthe promise of the ADA complete throughout our society. We have come a \nlong way. We have some more things to do. We are at it and we are going \nto keep at it. We are going to keep doing whatever we can to make sure \nthe four goals of the Americans with Disabilities Act are realized in \nas short of a timeframe as possible.\n  So with that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, first of all, I ask for the yeas and \nnays on the resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I yield back whatever time remains on our side on this resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Again, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6144-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6144-S6146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n RENEWING THE IMPORT RESTRICTIONS IN THE BURMESE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY \n                              ACT OF 2003\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to the consideration of H.J. Res. 83, which the \nclerk will state by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J. Res. 83) approving the renewal of \n     import restrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and \n     Democracy Act of 2003, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, all time \nis yielded back, except for 20 minutes, with the time equally divided \nand controlled between the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, and the \nSenator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, today the Senate considers extension of \neconomic sanctions against the Burmese regime. The Senate should pass \nthis resolution.\n  Aung San Suu Kyi, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and democracy leader \nin Burma, said ``the people in Burma are like prisoners in their own \ncountry.''\n  Dr. Suu Kyi, herself, remains, quite literally, a prisoner. The \nBurmese regime has kept her under house arrest on trumped up charges \nfor 14 of the last 20 years.\n  She persists in her dream of freedom and democracy for Burma. By \nextending economic sanctions against the Burmese regime, we hope to \nmake that dream a reality.\n  The Burmese regime seems intent on keeping its people in chains. \nAccording to the State Department, the regime continues to conscript \nchildren into the military and engage them in forced labor. It \ncontinues to violate freedoms of expression, assembly, association, \nmovement, and religion. It continues to use murder, abduction, rape, \nand torture against its opponents.\n  I have often questioned whether unilateral trade sanctions are the \nbest path. But several trading partners--including the European Union, \nCanada, and Australia--have joined us in imposing sanctions against \nBurma. The State Department has found that these sanctions have made it \nmore difficult and costly for the Burmese regime to profit from \nimprisoning its people.\n  Let us stand with the Burmese people. Let us seek to free them from \ntheir captivity, and let us renew these sanctions.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan resolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, today our colleagues will vote on \nH.J. Res. 83, which would extend sanctions on the Burma regime for \nanother year. As in years past, I am joined in this effort by my good \nfriend, Senator Dianne Feinstein. Alongside the 2 of us are 66 other \ncosponsors, including Senators McCain, Durbin, Gregg, and Lieberman.\n  This overwhelming bipartisan support for sanctioning the junta \nreflects the clear view of more than two-thirds of the Senate that the \ngenerals currently ruling Burma should be denied the legitimacy they \nare pursuing through this year's sham elections.\n  Renewing sanctions against the military regime in Burma is as timely \nand as important as ever. The ruling State Peace and Development \nCouncil is continuing its efforts to try to stand up a farcical new \nConstitution by holding bogus elections. These elections--whenever they \ntake place--will be dubious for a number of reasons. First, the junta \ncontinues to imprison Nobel Peace Prize laureate and prodemocracy \nleader Aung San Suu Kyi. The generals have made it clear they will \nprevent her from participating in any government under the new \nConstitution.\n  Second, the military leadership effectively forced Suu Kyi's party, \nwhich overwhelmingly won the last Democratic election way back in 1990, \nto shutter its operation.\n  Third, the Burmese electoral watchdog, which is essentially an arm of \nthe SPDC, recently issued rules on campaigning that are ludicrous on \ntheir very face. For instance, they prohibit a variety of \nelectioneering activities such as organizing marches, holding flags, \nand chanting slogans.\n  As if things in Burma on the election front were not alarming enough, \nthe potential security threat posed by the regime has become \nincreasingly worrisome. The last several months have continued to \nproduce press reports of ties between Burma and North Korea, including \nparticularly alarming indications of alleged weapons transfers from \nPyongyang.\n  I am hopeful the time will soon come when sanctions against the \nBurmese Government will no longer be needed and that, as did South \nAfrica in the early 1990s, the people of Burma will be able to free \nthemselves from their own government. However, as recent events \nindicate, the Burmese junta maintains its iron grip on its people and \ncontinues to carry out a foreign policy that is inimical to U.S. \nobjectives.\n  For these reasons, the United States must deny this regime the \nlegitimacy it so craves and await the day when the Burmese people will \nbe permitted to govern their own affairs.\n\n[[Page S6145]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I will speak briefly on the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield such time as the Senator from California may use.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I wish to give just a little history \nto back up this resolution.\n  In 1997, former Senator William Cohen and I authored legislation, \nwhich required the President to ban new U.S. investment in Burma, if he \ndetermined that the Government of Burma had physically harmed, \nrearrested or exiled Aung San Suu Kyi or committed large-scale \nrepression or violence against the democratic opposition. In fact, at \nthat time, Secretary Albright met with the ASEAN nations and tried to \nencourage them to be of help. They were of no help, so the President, \nby Executive order, then instituted this investment ban.\n  In 2003, after the regime or some of its quislings attempted to \nassassinate Aung San Suu Kyi when she was on a march in the center of \nthe country, Senator McConnell and I introduced the Burmese Freedom and \nDemocracy Act of 2003, which placed a complete ban on imports from \nBurma. It allowed that ban to be renewed 1 year at a time. That is \nessentially what we are doing today. It was signed into law and has \nbeen renewed 1 year at a time since then.\n  I became involved in this struggle for peace and democracy in no \nsmall part due to the courage and valor of this wonderful woman. I \nthink I admire her as much as any woman in the world. Her message of \ndemocracy, human rights, and the rule of law continues to inspire not \nonly her fellow citizens but people all over this great world, with her \ncourage and her resolve in the face of constant oppression.\n  For the past two decades, Burma's despotic military rulers have \nengaged in a campaign of persecution against Aung San Suu Kyi, \ntarnishing her image wherever they could, unjustly convicting her of \nviolating an illegitimate house arrest last year, and extending her \nunlawful detention.\n  She has spent the better part of 20 years under house arrest. She has \nnot seen her two sons who live in the United Kingdom for years. She was \nnot permitted to visit her husband when he was dying of cancer in the \nUnited Kingdom.\n  Yet Aung San Suu Kyi remains resolute in her dedication to the \npursuit of peaceful national reconciliation, as do the members of her \npolitical party, the National League for Democracy.\n  Now, more than ever, the people of Burma need to know that we stand \nby them and support their vision of a free and democratic Burma.\n  On May 6, her party, the National League for Democracy, closed its \ndoors. Let me be clear. They did not shut down of their own free will; \nit was forced to disband by an unjust and undemocratic constitution and \nelection law, both drafted in secret and behind closed doors by the \nruling military junta.\n  Under the terms of the new constitution, 25 percent of the seats must \nbe set aside for the military. Think about that for a moment. Before \nany vote has been cast, the military is guaranteed one-quarter of the \nseats in the new 440-member house of representatives.\n  How will this new institution be any different from the current \nmilitary regime?\n  If that isn't enough to raise doubts about the military's commitment \nto a truly representative government, it should also be pointed out \nthat the regime's Prime Minister, Thein Sein, and 22 Cabinet Ministers \nresigned from the army to form a new civilian political party, the \nUnion Solidarity and Development Party.\n  Any seats won by this new party in the upcoming election will be in \naddition to the 25 percent set aside for active military members.\n  Does anyone truly believe the regime has embraced democracy and the \nconcept of civilian rule? Unfortunately, it will be business as usual \nfor the people of Burma and the democratic opposition.\n  What about Suu Kyi and her National League of Democracy--winners of \nthe last free parliamentary election in 1990? First, earlier this year, \nthe regime, which has not allowed the party, the NLD, to assume power, \nofficially annulled its victory in the 1990 parliamentary elections, \nwhich would have made Suu Kyi the head of the Burmese Government.\n  Second, under the new constitution, Suu Kyi is barred from running in \nany future election.\n  Why is this? What has she done to deserve this?\n  Well, in 2009, an American swam across the lake to her house, \nuninvited, and remained there for 2 days. She did not know this man. \nShe had never communicated with this man. She had nothing to do with \nhim, but he was obviously exhausted after swimming across the lake, and \nhe remained in her house for 2 days. She was then arrested and \nconvicted for allowing him to remain in her house, which, according to \nthe regime, violated the terms of her house arrest.\n  Because of this conviction, she cannot participate in this or any \nfuture election under the new constitution. So here is the only \ndemocratically elected leader--elected 20 years ago--under house arrest \nfor the better part of those 20 years. She survived an assassination \nattempt. She is ostracized and kept from any interaction with her \npolitical colleagues or her family and, finally, she can never run for \nany office again.\n  As a result, the NLD was faced with a clear choice: either kick Aung \nSan Suu Kyi out of the party and participate in the election or face \nextinction.\n  It should come as no surprise that the party refused to turn its back \non Suu Kyi and give its stamp of approval to the regime's sham \nconstitution and electoral law.\n  I applaud their courage and their devotion to democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law.\n  I am saddened to see the regime close its doors, but the spirit and \nprinciples of this party will live on in the hearts and minds of its \npeople. I know that, one day, they will be able to elect a truly \nrepresentative government.\n  As Tin Oo, NLD's deputy leader and former political prisoner, said:\n\n       We do not feel sad. We have honor. One day, we will come \n     back; we will be reincarnated by the will of the people.\n\n  This is a clear message to the regime that an illegitimate \nconstitution and election law cannot suppress the unyielding democratic \naspirations of the people of Burma.\n  We must send our own signal to the regime that its quest for \nlegitimacy has failed. We must send a signal to the democratic \nopposition that we stand in solidarity with them, and we will not \nabandon them.\n  I also thank former First Lady Laura Bush, who joined with virtually \nall the women of the Senate to hold a press conference back in 2007. \nMrs. Bush was willing to use her First Lady status to support this \ncause. I think it is a gesture that will not be forgotten by any of us.\n  Now is the time to renew the import ban on all products from Burma \nfor another year. The regime has taken many steps in the wrong \ndirection.\n  I live for the time when this military junta will recognize that \nkeeping this brave woman under house arrest, absent any interconnection \nwith any of the people of her party or of her country for 20 years, is \nan unjust penalty.\n  Simply put, we still have hope. Hopefully, the military junta, as \nthey are called, will one day recognize that Burma should be a free and \ndemocratic nation and that an election should be open to all people and \nall runners. Then the opportunity for major change and recognition of \nthe people of Burma in the Council of Nations will take place.\n  I regret very much that we have to do this for another year. I am \ngrateful to Senator McConnell for joining me over the years, as \nannually this has been recognized and a vote has been taken to continue \nthe sanctions.\n\n\n                                  NLD\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I rise for a colloquy with my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from California, to discuss \ninterpretation of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, as amended.\n  I ask my Democratic colleague, who is the lead cosponsor of this \nlegislation, is it her understanding that the prodemocracy National \nLeague for Democracy party has officially decided to boycott the \nupcoming 2010 Burmese elections.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, it is. The National League for Democracy in \nMarch\n\n[[Page S6146]]\n\nof this year indicated it could not participate in the elections due to \nthe junta's repressive election law. It therefore declined to register \nas a political party and consequently under the new law was abolished \nas a political party in early May.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. In light of the NLD's boycott of the elections and its \nconsequent dissolution under Burmese law, is it my friend's \nunderstanding that the NLD may be driven underground as a result of its \ndecision or be forced to reconstitute itself in some other capacity?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, it is. The NLD has indicated it will try to \ncontinue to help the Burmese people in ways other than as a legally \nregistered political party.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it the understanding of the senior Senator from \nCalifornia that the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, as amended by \nthe Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, makes several references to the \n``National League for Democracy''?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes, it is. There are several such references in the \nlegislation as amended.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is it also the Senator's understanding that references \nto the ``National League for Democracy'' should be interpreted to \ninclude any appropriate successor entity to the NLD, be it a \nnongovernmental organization or some other comparable group?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Yes. It is my view the proper statutory construction \ngiven the term ``National League for Democracy'' would be to include \nany appropriate successor entity, group or subgroups that the NLD may \nform in the future.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank my friend for clarifying this matter. It \nappears that both cosponsors are in full agreement on the proper means \nof interpreting this term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we are going to vote momentarily. In the \nmeantime, I thank the Senator from California for her steadfast support \nto the cause of justice and for supporting this resolution and taking \nup the cause of Aung San Suu Kyi. I don't know of anybody else in this \nbody--and Senator McConnell has been forthright in his support, but I \nwant people to know how strongly the Senator from California has been \nan advocate for Aung San Suu Kyi, and I deeply appreciate it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back, both minority and majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Res. 591\n\n       Whereas July 26, 2010, marks the 20th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act has been one of \n     the most significant and effective civil rights laws passed \n     by Congress;\n       Whereas, prior to the passage of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, people with disabilities faced \n     significantly lower employment rates, lower graduation rates, \n     and higher rates of poverty than people without disabilities, \n     and were too often denied the opportunity to fully \n     participate in society due to intolerance and unfair \n     stereotypes;\n       Whereas the dedicated efforts of disability rights \n     advocates, including Justin Dart, Jr., and many others, \n     served to awaken Congress and the American people to the \n     discrimination and prejudice faced by individuals with \n     disabilities;\n       Whereas Congress worked in a bipartisan manner to craft \n     legislation making such discrimination illegal;\n       Whereas Congress passed the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     and President George Herbert Walker Bush signed the Act into \n     law on July 26, 1990;\n       Whereas the purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     is to fulfill the Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, \n     independent living, economic self-sufficiency, and full \n     participation for Americans with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits \n     employers from discriminating against qualified individuals \n     with disabilities, requires that State and local governmental \n     entities accommodate qualified individuals with disabilities, \n     requires places of public accommodation to take reasonable \n     steps to make their goods and services accessible to \n     individuals with disabilities, and requires that new trains \n     and buses be accessible to individuals with disabilities;\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act has played an \n     historic role in allowing over 50,000,000 Americans with \n     disabilities to participate more fully in national life by \n     removing barriers to employment, transportation, public \n     services, telecommunications, and public accommodations;\n\n[[Page S6147]]\n\n       Whereas the Americans with Disabilities Act has served as a \n     model for disability rights in other countries;\n       Whereas all Americans, not just those with disabilities, \n     benefit from the accommodations that have become commonplace \n     since the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act, \n     including curb cuts at street intersections, ramps for access \n     to buildings, and other accommodations that provide access to \n     public transportation, stadiums, telecommunications, voting \n     machines, and websites;\n       Whereas Congress acted with overwhelming bipartisan support \n     in 2008 to restore protections for people with disabilities \n     by passing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008, which overturned \n     judicial decisions that had inappropriately narrowed the \n     scope of the Americans with Disabilities Act;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, children and adults with disabilities \n     continue to experience barriers that interfere with their \n     full participation in mainstream American life;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, people with disabilities are twice as \n     likely to live in poverty as their fellow citizens and \n     continue to experience high rates of unemployment and \n     underemployment;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act and 11 years after the Supreme Court's \n     decision in Olmstead v. L.C., many people with disabilities \n     still live in segregated institutional settings because of a \n     lack of support services that would allow them to live in the \n     community;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, new telecommunication, electronic, and \n     information technologies continue to be developed while not \n     being accessible to all Americans;\n       Whereas, 20 years after the enactment of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, many public and private covered entities \n     are still not accessible to people with disabilities; and\n       Whereas the United States has a responsibility to welcome \n     back and create opportunities for the tens of thousands of \n     working-age veterans of the Armed Forces who have been \n     wounded in action or have received service-connected injuries \n     while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation \n     Enduring Freedom: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and honors the 20th anniversary of the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990;\n       (2) salutes all people whose efforts contributed to the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act;\n       (3) encourages all Americans to celebrate the advance of \n     freedom and the opening of opportunity made possible by the \n     enactment of the Americans with Disabilities Act; and\n       (4) pledges to continue to work on a bipartisan basis to \n     identify and address the remaining barriers that undermine \n     the Nation's goals of equality of opportunity, independent \n     living, economic self-sufficiency, and full participation for \n     Americans with disabilities.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in 160 days, the American people will \nexperience the single largest tax increase in American history unless \nCongress acts. Unless Congress acts, the highest individual tax bracket \nwill rise from 35 percent to just under 40 percent. People in the \nlowest tax bracket will see a 50-percent increase from 10 percent to 15 \npercent. The marriage penalty will go up. The child tax credit will be \ncut in half. Taxes on capital gains and dividends will go up as well. \nEvery single taxpayer in the country will see their taxes go up.\n  Last week in the Senate Finance Committee we heard testimony from \nseveral experts about what these huge tax increases would mean in terms \nof the economy and to small businesses. Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former \nhead of the Congressional Budget Office, reminded us that about $1 \ntrillion in business income will be reported on individual tax returns \nand about half of that will be subject to the two higher marginal \nindividual tax rates. There has been a debate--and I guess it will go \non--about the relationship between the bipartisan 2001 and 2003 tax \nrelief bills and the deficit. Some on the other side of the aisle like \nto argue that our $1 trillion deficits today are the result of tax \nrelief we offered 10 years ago. They also like to argue that they bear \nno responsibility for the deficits they ``inherited.'' We are hearing a \nlot about that these days, very little taking responsibility for what \nhas happened today but, rather, preferring to point the finger of blame \nat others in the past.\n  I have a chart which, if Members will bear with me, tells an \nimportant story. This chart measures the deficit as a percentage of our \ngross domestic product which is the entire economy. The solid lines, \nthe red solid line and the solid green line, represent the historical \nrecord from the OMB. The dotted line represents CBO projections of the \nPresident's 2011 budget. The red line and a portion of the light green \nline also represent the record before the Obama administration took \noffice, and the solid, dark green line represents the record since \nPresident Obama became President.\n  What does this chart tell us? It tells a very interesting and \nimportant story. It is true that deficits went up under the last \nadministration and topped out at 3.5 percent of GDP. Of course, we have \nto remember the dot.com bubble, the recession that occurred about the \ntime the last administration took office and, of course, the horrific \nevents of 9/11. But then, just as the 2001 and 2003 tax relief \nprovisions started to kick in, a strange thing happened to the deficit. \nIt went down to $318 billion in fiscal year 2005. It went down again to \n$248 billion in fiscal year 2006. And it went down to $161 billion in \nfiscal year 2007. That is when our deficit went all the way down to 1.2 \npercent of gross domestic product, from 3.5 percent to just 1.2 percent \nof GDP.\n  People may have different interpretations for why this happened. I \nbelieve--and I think most economists and objective observers conclude--\nthe reason the deficit went down as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct was because the tax relief we passed in 2001 and 2003, which \nwill expire in 160 days unless we act, helped grow the economy and got \nabout 8 million people on the payroll between 2003 and 2007.\n  Not an incidental; it generated a lot more revenue for the Federal \nGovernment. As a matter of fact, it hit historic levels. That is the \nreal record on the deficit. For my colleagues who claim they inherited \na bad fiscal situation, this is what they inherited: a deficit which \nhad reached one of the historic lows of 1.2 percent.\n  The green line here actually shows what has happened since our \ncolleagues on the other side took control of this Chamber and the House \nof Representatives. The deficit shot up from 1.2 percent to 3.2 percent \nof GDP in fiscal year 2008. That was the last year President Bush was \nin office. Then went to 8.3 percent in fiscal year 2009.\n  Am I blaming my colleagues for this? I am saying there is more than \nenough blame to go around. But it is also not fair to suggest that \nprevious administrations or one political party contributed to this \nincreasingly dire fiscal crisis.\n  The reason the deficit rose after 2007 is because of the financial \ncrisis that occurred, the meltdown, particularly in September of 2008. \nWe know the recession we have been going through and, of course, the \nemergency measures that Congress passed on a bipartisan basis to try to \nprevent a systemic economic collapse in America--and other countries \naround the world participated in as well--these emergency measures were \nsupported by then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Biden, and by dozens of \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, as well as colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle. We thought we were acting in a major crisis, \nand we were. My point is, the deficits we have today were not inherited \ndeficits but, rather, because of legislation they helped enact.\n  Beginning January 20, 2009 this Congress and the President delivered \nmuch higher spending. Colleagues will recall the much ballyhooed \nstimulus package, $862 billion of borrowed money, which was supposed to \nkeep unemployment below 8 percent. Obviously, that failed in its stated \ngoal since unemployment has been almost up to double digits, now 9.5 \npercent. In places such as Nevada, it is 14.2 percent. In Michigan and \nother States, it is much higher. Obviously, the stimulus did not \nsucceed in its stated goal. One thing it did succeed in doing is piling \non additional debt on future generations unless we deal with it in a \nresponsible way.\n  What happened as a result of the unprecedented spending we have seen \nsince the Obama administration came into office? We see now that the \nfiscal year 2009 deficit as a percentage of the gross domestic product \nrose from an initial 8.3 percent to 9.9 percent, from 1.2 percent in \nfiscal year 2007 all the way to 9.9 percent.\n\n[[Page S6148]]\n\n  The second important thing to notice about this green line is that it \nwill never get back to the level under a Republican Congress. The \nhighest deficit level under a Republican Congress was 3.5 percent in \n2004. Under President Obama's budget, we will never get back to that \nlevel, even though it includes several, what most people would conclude \nare optimistic assumptions about future employment and economic growth. \nEven under those rosy scenarios, it will never get below 4.1 percent of \ngross domestic product. Once it gets there, the deficit continues to \nrise indefinitely.\n  Some of my colleagues have said they want to make this election in \nNovember about a choice. That is fine with me. To me, the choice on \nfiscal discipline comes down to this: Do we want deficits that are \ngetting lower such as the red line we see here, dropping from 3.5 \npercent down to 1.2 percent, or do we want deficits to get higher, such \nas the dark green line we see here, all the way up to 9.9 percent? The \ntruth is the dark green line is not just an inferior choice, it is an \nunsustainable choice.\n  Last month our national debt topped $13 trillion, up $2.3 trillion \nsince President Obama took office. The CBO reported that our public \ndebt will reach 62 percent of gross domestic product by the end of this \nyear and will be 90 percent of our economy in only 9 years. We are on a \nbudget path that will add $9 trillion in additional debt over the next \ndecade.\n  While some of my colleagues want to let the tax relief we passed \nstarting 10 years ago expire on January 1, we simply cannot tax our way \nto fiscal solvency. Again, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, if spending is off the table--in other words, if we wanted to \neliminate the deficit just as a result of tax increases--we would need \nto raise taxes by 25 percent to create a sustainable fiscal path for \nthe next 25 years. Can Members imagine what a 25-percent increase in \ntaxes would mean to hard-working American families, small businesses, \nwhat that would do to job creation, what that would do to the 9.5 \npercent unemployment rate we see today? It would make it worse, not \nbetter.\n  Tax increases alone don't solve the problem of trillions of dollars \nin unfunded liabilities in our entitlement programs either. They don't \ndeal with the fact that Medicare is $38 trillion short of its promised \nbenefits and now is expected to go insolvent by 2016. Social Security \nwill pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll taxes this \nyear.\n  Yet the CBO has also estimated that individual income tax rates would \nhave to rise by 70 percent to balance the budget while financing the \nprojected spending growth in Medicare and Medicaid. That is assuming no \nother tax increases or spending reductions in the budget. That is based \non our budget outlook for 2007, which has obviously deteriorated since \nthat time. That is based on a pretty optimistic estimate on how fast \nspending will grow in these two programs, just 1 percent higher than \nthe gross domestic product growth, even though these programs have \naveraged growth of about 2.5 percent more than gross domestic product \nover the last 40 years.\n  I do have some good news about our fiscal situation. The American \npeople get it. That is why they believe spending and debt are two of \nthe most important issues they want the Federal Government to address. \nThe American people also understand intuitively the importance of \nkeeping taxes low and what this huge tax increase that would occur, the \nlargest in American history unless Congress acts, would do to the \nfragile economy and to high unemployment and to slow job creation.\n  According to a CBS News poll last week, when asked whether government \nspending or tax cuts would be better in terms of getting the economy \nmoving, Americans preferred tax cuts by 53 percent to 37 percent. That \nis a 16-point deferential. Independents actually favored tax relief by \n20 points.\n  My conclusion is, we need to listen to the wisdom of the American \npeople. We need to stop lecturing them. We need to make permanent the \ntax provisions we passed in 2001 and 2003, not to advantage individuals \nbut to continue economic growth, to continue our ability to reduce the \ndeficit, because people are working and paying taxes and our economy is \ngrowing.\n  The most important message we can send to the small businesses and \nthe job creators in America, when unemployment is at 9.5 percent \nnationally, is we are not going to increase their financial burdens in \naddition to the health care bill that was passed and other onerous \nburdens which have actually constrained job creation and create more \nuncertainty.

The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Madam President.\n  We are now on a very important bill, the small business jobs growth \nbill. It is a bill that actually many of us on both sides of the \naisle--from the Small Business Committee to the Finance Committee, to \nMembers who are not members of either one of those committees--have \ncontributed immensely to the building of a bill that we think holds a \ngreat deal of promise for small businesses throughout our country that \nhave been beaten and battered. But amazingly, in many places, these \nbusinesses, despite all the odds, are hanging on and they are looking \nfor some help.\n  That is what this bill attempts to do--to build strong partnerships \nwith the private sector, to use the resources that are already out \nthere, most notably, our community banks, our small banks.\n  There are over 8,000 of them. We have not heard a lot about those \nbanks. I see the Senator from Florida in the Chamber who is going to \nspeak in just a minute. We have not heard a lot about community banks \non this floor. All we have heard about are Goldman Sachs, Lehman \nBrothers, AIG. We have heard about Wall Street and big banks. We have \nnot heard about small community banks and small businesses--the 27 \nmillion of them that are struggling in America today.\n  This bill finally--finally--has reached the floor of the Senate. The \nHouse has already passed a very strong bill. It has finally reached the \nfloor of the Senate to give us an opportunity to debate what we can do \nto help small business and what we can do to strengthen and support our \nhealthy community banks in all our States.\n  It is an exciting time. I say to the Presiding Officer, I thank her \nas a member of the Senate Small Business Committee for being a part of \nthis effort. Again, the Small Business Committee, in a bipartisan way, \nand the Finance Committee, in a bipartisan way, have contributed to \nthis legislation, and we are moving to the final hours of this debate \nnow.\n\n[[Page S6149]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 4500\n\n  The Senator from Florida, Mr. LeMieux, and I are offering an \namendment which is pending before the Senate now. It is a very \nimportant amendment to the underlying bill. The pending amendment is \nthe LeMieux-Landrieu amendment. It has many other cosponsors whom I \nwill submit for the record in a moment. But this amendment that is \npending now is a small business lending fund amendment that actually \nmakes $1.1 billion for the Treasury. It earns that much over 10 years. \nIt does not cost the Treasury anything. It earns $1.1 billion. It uses \nthe power of the private sector. It uses the power of our community \nbanks that are on Main Streets--whether it is in Tallulah, LA, Lake \nCharles, LA, or right down Canal Street in New Orleans or some of the \nmain streets in Florida and other States.\n  It uses the power of those banks--their knowledge of the small \nbusinesses in their communities--and it leverages that powerful \nrelationship to help end this recession. But we have to be about job \ncreation, and the people who are going to create the jobs are small \nbusinesses.\n  (Mr. BURRIS assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. As I turn the floor over to the Senator from Florida to \nspeak about our small business lending amendment, let me say, again--I \ncould not say it any more clearly--small firms--and this chart is from \n1993 to 2009--small firms in America, those between 1 employee and 499 \nemployees, created 65 percent of the jobs. Only 35 percent of the jobs \nwere created by large firms. These numbers on this chart pertain to the \nlast decade.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, you used to be a banker in Illinois. \nYou have a great deal of expertise here, and I think your own \nexperience would tell you if we updated this chart--which we do not \nhave the figures to do--I think this 65 percent would be increased \nsubstantially because the people out there creating jobs are small \nbusinesses.\n  We have seen news article after news article, just in the last couple \nweeks--the front page of the Washington Post, the front page of the New \nYork Times--headlines: Big Firms Hoarding Cash; headlines: Big Banks \nHoarding Cash. I guess so. They have gotten a lot of cash from this \nCongress. But it is the small businesses out there that are struggling \nto get capital to create jobs, and it is the small, healthy community \nbanks that are out there battling with them to create jobs to \nrevitalize their communities and increase demand.\n  So let's keep our eyes on this chart, and let's keep our minds \nfocused on one clear fact: Small business in America is the most \npowerful job-creation engine, and right now we have to put a little \nfuel in that tank. That fuel is capital to healthy community banks that \ncan then leverage the power of those healthy community banks to get \nmoney to small businesses at reasonable rates--not credit card rates at \n24 percent, 16 percent, not payday lender rates that are at 30 percent, \nsometimes 50 percent but at reasonable rates--with reasonable terms so \nthey can create jobs.\n  That is why the Senator from Florida and I are on the floor. I would \nlike to yield the next 10 or 15 minutes to the Senator from Florida, \nMr. LeMieux, the cosponsor of this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, the chair of the Small Business Committee, \nwho has been a great leader on this topic. It has been my pleasure to \nwork with her on this measure to try to help our struggling small \nbusinesses.\n  I think Florida, maybe more than any other State, relies and depends \nupon its small businesses. We are the fourth largest State in the \ncountry, but we are a State that grew so fast, so quickly, that even \nthough we have 18.5 million people, we do not have a lot of big \nbusinesses.\n  The businesses in Florida--nearly 2 million of them--are small. Not \none Fortune 100 company is headquartered in Florida. Now we are trying \nto get there--we have a couple that are on the cusp--and we will. But \nFlorida had this meteoric rise in population over the past 20 or 30 \nyears. It was built on construction and growth and tourism and all the \nreasons why people want to come to our beautiful State.\n  But the jobs that have been created over the years are from small \nfirms. They are the restaurant, the local diner, the beach shop, the \ntailor, the laundromat, the auto mechanic. These are the businesses \nthat are creating the jobs in Florida. Many of them are centered around \nthe service economy.\n  We are doing a lot to diversify our economy. But the truth of it is, \nthey are the mainstream of Florida's economy, and they are struggling. \nThis is the worst recession in anyone's memory in Florida, even worse \nthan the recession we had in the 1970s.\n  Our unemployment rate peaked over 12 percent. It is still at 11.5 \npercent. While this sounds strange, 11.5 percent may not be better than \n12 percent in this circumstance because what happens on unemployment \nrolls is that after a certain amount of time, people drop off and are \nno longer even looking for work. The truth of it is, if you are walking \ndown the street in Florida and you see another adult walking down the \nstreet who is not retired, there is a one in five chance that person is \nunemployed or underemployed.\n  Times are tough. There are some signs of life. Some things are \ngetting better. But for Floridians, this is the most difficult economy \nwe have ever experienced. We have the second highest mortgage \nforeclosure rate. I read recently that our folks are No. 1 in the \ncountry in being behind in their mortgage payments.\n  So our small businesses, the creators of jobs, the folks who, as \nSenator Landrieu said, create 65 percent of the jobs nationwide--I bet \nyou that number is much higher in Florida--need help. This bill is \ngoing to help those small businesses. It is not going to cure the \nproblem overnight. Let's be realistic. But it is going to help.\n  The base bill does a lot of good things for small businesses. There \nare a lot of tax cuts in this bill. It is going to exclude small \nbusiness capital gains by 100 percent. The bill will temporarily \nincrease further the amount of the exclusion from the sale of \nqualifying small business stock. It is going to help something on \ncarryback interest. It means a lot to small businesses. It will extend \nthe 1-year carryback for general business credits to 5 years for \ncertain small businesses. This alternative minimum tax hurts our small \nbusinesses. This bill will allow certain small businesses to use all \ntypes of general business credits to pay less taxes. When they purchase \nequipment, it is going to allow them to accelerate that depreciation. \nWhen small businesses get to keep more of their money, they get to keep \nmore of their employees, and they get to hire new ones. That is just in \nthe base bill.\n  This amendment Senator Landrieu and I and others are working on is \ngoing to put money into our local community banks that will be lent to \nsmall businesses. There has been a lot of confusion about the bill, and \nsome of my friends and colleagues on my side of the aisle do not like \nit. I hope they are going to come around. There is a concern that this \nis going to be similar to what happened in the TARP bill. But these two \nbills are very different, and this amendment is very different. Let me \nexplain why.\n  TARP went to the big banks that were failing at the end of 2008, a \nlot of which were selling mortgage-backed securities and other exotic \ninvestments they should not have been selling, and they put their \nassets at risk and, therefore, put the American economy at risk.\n  This has nothing to do with that. These are small banks. This is the \nbanker you know down the street, the banker who is at your rotary or at \nyour Kiwanis, whom you see at church or synagogue. This is not some \nGoldman Sachs banker. This is your local community banker who loans to \nthe laundromat, the tailor, the construction business--the folks who \nemploy people in your hometown.\n  This program is optional. No bank has to take it. If they are a small \nbank, though, if they have assets under $10 billion, they will get an \nability to get some more money they can lend out to small businesses \nthat create jobs.\n  That is not a partisan issue. We all should support that. The money \nthat comes back in is going to be repaid, and not only are we not going \nto increase the deficit or the debt, as my colleague from Louisiana \njust said, the\n\n[[Page S6150]]\n\nFederal Government will actually make money. That is not something we \nhear a lot about in Washington.\n  So it is not going to increase the deficit. It is not going to \nincrease the debt. It is not going to increase taxes. It is going to \nlend money to local banks, to loan that money to small businesses, to \nhelp them in this difficult time.\n  When I drive down the streets of Florida--whether it is in Orlando, \nTampa, Pensacola, Jacksonville, Fort Lauderdale, Naples, all across the \nState--we have a lot of strip shopping centers. It is the way Florida \nwas built. It is nice. You get to park in front, go in, buy your goods \nor services, and go home. But you can see them from the roads. When I \ndrive down these main thoroughfares and I look over, what I see are \nempty buildings--empty buildings--because our small businesses have \ngone under because they no longer can pay their rent, because they no \nlonger have the customers they used to have, and because they no longer \ncan get lending from their bank.\n  What is particularly of interest to Floridians about this bill--I am \nsure this is true in other States, such as California and Arizona and \nNevada, other States that had this big real estate-based economy that \nboomed in the past years--what happens to your local businesses is that \na lot of times the loans they are getting now are tied to real estate \nthey own. They may own a small parcel in a small building where they \noperate their business. They have a mortgage against that property. \nThey are paying their payments, but the asset, the real estate, has \nfallen in value tremendously. So now, when the regulators come in and \nlook at the bank's books to make sure the banks are operating OK, they \nsay: Wait a minute. The mortgage that Joe's business has is technically \nin default because the asset their loan is against has fallen in value \nby 50 percent. I have business owners coming to me all the time telling \nme their banks are putting them in technical default because of the \ndepreciation of the asset which is being held against the loan, which \nis their real estate.\n\n  So this is an extreme and an enormous problem in Florida. This bill \nwill put more money in the small banks to help lend to businesses to \nhelp them bridge the gap until this economy recovers.\n  I also wish to speak a little bit about another amendment to this \nbill I have been working on with Senator Klobuchar that talks about \nexport promotion--another issue that is not partisan. We all want more \nexports. Exports in Florida are a big deal. They are a huge part of our \neconomy, being the gateway to Latin America. We sell our goods \noverseas. But small businesses, and even medium-sized businesses, \nwhether they are in Illinois or Louisiana or any other place in this \ncountry, often don't know the services the Federal Government--the \nDepartment of Commerce--can give them to open the doors of trade and \nallow them to sell their products overseas.\n  So what Senator Klobuchar and I are doing with this amendment, with \nexport promotion--and she has done a tremendous job on this issue--is \nputting more resources into the Department of Commerce to go back to \n2004 levels--because we have had to make a lot of cuts there--in order \nto provide more folks who can then go out and show businesses how they \ncan sell their wares, to create more sales, so they can grow their \nbusiness and hire more people.\n  That is good for everybody's economy. I am not a big believer in \ngovernment spending, but when we are spending to help businesses pursue \ntheir economic and entrepreneurial opportunities, that is good for \nAmerica. In fact, when the Department of Commerce spends $1 million on \nexport promotion, their estimated return is $57 million--a 57-to-1 \neconomic return. So that is just another very good part of this bill.\n  I hope we have an opportunity to vote on this bill. We may even have \nan opportunity to vote on this bill and this amendment today. Our \nleadership is working on some other amendments. I hope those \nopportunities will be provided.\n  This is a bill we all should agree upon. It is a bill that should \nhave 70, 80, or more votes in this Chamber, and we should get it done \nbecause it would be good for the small businesses, the job creators of \nour country, in their time of need.\n  I wish to thank my colleague from Louisiana who has been a great \nleader on this issue. I wish to thank her for working with me in order \nto lend my efforts to this bill to help to improve it in ways that I \nthought would be important for this country and for my home State of \nFlorida. I also wish to recognize my colleague, Senator Klobuchar, who \nis here. She has done such great work on the export portion of this \nbill.\n  With that, I will turn back my time to my colleague from Louisiana.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida for \nhis excellent explanation using real stories and terrific visuals \nbecause he just painted a picture for us about what those empty \nshopping centers look like. We have seen those in our own States as \nwell. He is absolutely correct. If we don't do anything, the problem \nis, they are going to stay empty. We just can't wish it to change. We \nhave to act in a way that will help it change. That is what this bill \nis about.\n  Again, this is not a big government solution. This is a potential \nsolution that holds a lot of promise based on strengthening \nrelationships that already exist that are basically in the private \nsector. That is what this effort is. It is exactly as the Senator from \nFlorida outlined.\n  He spoke about--and he is right--one of the arguments we have heard \nwhich we can't seem to understand. If there is somebody who can explain \nthis, they should come to the floor and help us. We keep hearing: This \nis like TARP. So I wish to take just 1 minute to explain the \ndifferences in as simple a way as I can.\n  TARP stands for Troubled Asset Relief Program. It was $700 billion. \nIt was a program that George Bush fashioned initially and was continued \nthrough this administration to give money to big banks that were \ngetting ready to fail. I wish to say that again: $700 billion, \nfashioned first by the Bush administration, available to big banks that \nwere failing and that many people were opposed to. This program is not \n$700 billion, it is $30 billion. It is not going to big banks on Wall \nStreet; it is going to small banks on Main Street. The TARP money went \nto banks that were failing. This is going to healthy banks that are \ntrying their best to lend; that want to help their communities to \nrevitalize. So if anyone thinks this is like TARP, please come talk to \nme because I could explain how it is not anything like TARP.\n  I can show my colleagues many letters and many documents, starting \nwith one, and then I will turn it over to the Senator from Minnesota. \nOne of the main reasons it is not like TARP is because there were a lot \nof bankers who were opposed to TARP. They didn't like the government \nintrusion. They didn't like the rules and regulations. One could argue \nit was necessary, but many bankers weren't for it.\n  This letter I am holding--and I will have it blown up--is from the \nIndependent Community Bankers of America. They represent 5,000 \nindependent banks--5,000. I am just going to read the first paragraph \nof this letter that they sent to Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell. This \nis a letter they sent to Leader Reid and to Mitch McConnell, minority \nleader of the Senate. It reads:\n\n       On behalf of the nearly 5,000 members of the Independent \n     Community Bankers, I write to urge you to retain the Small \n     Business Lending Fund in the Small Business Jobs Act. The \n     SBLF is the core component of this legislation and the \n     provision that holds the most promise for small business \n     creation in the near term. Failure to even consider the SBLF \n     in the Senate would be a missed opportunity that our \n     struggling economy cannot afford.\n\n  Let me go on because this is important:\n\n       The Nation's nearly 8,000 community banks are prolific \n     small business lenders with community contact, underwriting \n     expertise. The SBLF is a bold, fresh approach that would \n     provide another option for community banks to leverage \n     capital and expand credit to small business.\n\n  I can't understand one reason to not support this. This is the core \nof this bill. The bill will be somewhat empty without it. This is the \ncore of the bill.\n\n[[Page S6151]]\n\n  So we are going to put this on this bill, and we are going to urge \nour colleagues to then understand that the bill will then be whole and \nwe can all join together and vote for this very important bill and this \nvery important amendment.\n  I am going to specifically answer the arguments raised by the \nminority leader on the floor in his very brief comments this morning. \nHe made four arguments, and I will try to address each and every one in \njust a moment. Before I do, I will ask the Senator from Minnesota, who \nis a cosponsor of this lending provision and an actual designer and \ncreator of one of the key components of it--because Minnesota, like \nLouisiana--we may be in different parts of the country, but our \nbusinesses depend on exports. Whether you are at the head of the \nMississippi River or the foot of the Mississippi River, which we both \nrepresent in this Nation, and we often talk to each other about how \nnarrow it is up in Minnesota and how wide and wonderful it is in both \nplaces, both north and south. But it really does connect us because it \nis all about exports and trade.\n  So I wish to recognize my friend, the Senator from Minnesota, who \nwill talk about the export provision of this amendment and why it so \ncrucial.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I wish to first commend Senator \nLandrieu for her great leadership. It is true we share this river, and \nwhen you see all the barges go down the river every day, you see the \ntrade and the export firsthand that we are talking about. I am focused \non the export end, but I wish to give my support to the lending part of \nthis. It is so important, and Senator Landrieu, as head of the Small \nBusiness Committee, has worked on it incredibly hard.\n  When we discussed this idea last year of small business lending, I \nwent around to a number of my small businesses and I heard time and \ntime again how much this would be helpful for them. I think it is \nsummed up by a letter I got from Bertha, MN. My colleagues may not have \nheard of it. It is not exactly a metropolis. This letter is from a guy \nnamed Harry Wahlquist of Star Bank in Bertha, MN. This is what he wrote \njust a few weeks ago. He said:\n\n       I am a banker and need capital to continue serving my nine \n     Minnesota towns. Please pass the small business lending bill \n     now. You gave money to Wall Street. How about Main Street in \n     Minnesota?\n\n  I think it has been said that Wall Street might have caught a cold, \nbut Main Street got pneumonia. There are still many issues out there, \nand a lot of it could be helped to create private sector jobs by simply \nallowing credit out there and more loans.\n  The other piece of this which Senator Landrieu and my other great \ncolleague from the Commerce Committee, Senator LeMieux, mentioned was \nexports. I became very interested in this because my State is now \nseventh in the country for Fortune 500 companies. We are 21st in \npopulation, but we have a strong and thriving business community that \nbelieves in exports and believes in innovation. We brought the world \neverything from the Post It note to the pacemaker. While all of these \nthings did not start at the big companies, these big companies started \nin garages--companies such as Medtronic, in Two Harbors, MN, or little \nsandpaper companies such as 3M. They all started small. Sixty-five \npercent of the jobs in this country are due to small business. Yet \nthese small businesses, which now see this world of opportunity out \nthere for them--95 percent of the jobs in America--95 percent of the \ncustomers for America, for American businesses, are outside of our \nborders.\n  Unlike 3M or Medtronic, great Minnesota companies--or Best Buy--that \ncan have people working internally on these issues to identify markets, \na little company in Benson, MN, isn't going to be able to have a full-\ntime person looking at where they can sell their products. They still \nhave managed to do it, and a lot of them have been able to do it by \nworking directly with the Commerce Department. These are not little \ncompanies that necessarily are big government guys. These are people \nwho are conservative businessmen or businesswomen who went out there \nand said: Well, how am I going to figure out where I can sell my \nproduct around the world when I don't speak the languages. I don't have \na trade person.\n  My favorite example is a company called Matt Trucks in northern \nMinnesota, population 900, the moose capital of our State.\n  A little second grader named Matt was in school and he came home to \nhis dad and he drew a picture of a truck. The truck had wheels and he \nput a bunch of tracks on each of the wheels of the truck. His dad said: \nMatt, that is really cute. But as you have seen on TV, the tracks go \nbetween the wheels.\n  This little kid said: No, Dad. This would be a lot better because you \ncan put the tracks on the wheels and take them out and use it as a \nregular truck.\n  His dad is a mechanic. He went into the shop and created this truck \nand these tracks. Then he started a company that he called MATTRACKS, \nafter his second grader. They have about five employees. They are \nchugging along.\n  One day the dad went to Fargo, ND, which is the region of the \nCommerce Department that serves part of Minnesota, and he talked to a \nwoman named Heather. She is with the Federal Government. He went to her \nfor help. She looked on her computer and identified some markets and \ncalled the embassies where he could sell this truck. Now, due to \nexports, due to the fact that they are exporting to dozens of \ncountries, from Kazakhstan to Carlton, MN, they have 55 employees, all \nbecause of exports.\n  We have seen this all over our State. That is why Senator LeMieux and \nI came together to introduce a bill to focus on exports for small- and \nmedium-sized businesses.\n  Do my colleagues know that 30 percent of small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses would like to export more, but they simply don't know how to \ndo it? Well, this amendment helps to fill the gap and assist U.S. \nbusinesses that are looking to export their products but do not have \nthe resources or the know-how to find new international customers.\n  The program focuses on locating and targeting new markets, the \nmechanics of exporting, including shipping, documentation, and \nfinancing, and the creation of business plans. This amendment is \nprojected to create 43,000 jobs. It would do this by making sure this \nU.S. and Foreign Commercial Service, which assists small- and medium-\nsized businesses, is able to carry out its mission to work with these \nbusinesses by having adequate staff.\n  Secondly, it expands the rural export initiative, which helps rural \nbusinesses develop international opportunities. As noted by my \nRepublican colleague, Senator LeMieux, the numbers are clear. Every \ndollar invested in this program creates $213 in rural exports.\n  This part of the small business amendment that Senator Landrieu is \nputting together allows the Department of Commerce to identify known \nexporters that have a capacity to grow their international sales. A \nbusiness that has already been exporting to Canada or Mexico something \nlike 50 or 60 percent of its business only exports to those countries--\nit allows them to look for other countries. It provides matching grants \nto industry associations and nonprofit institutions to underwrite a \nportion of the startup costs for new export promotion projects.\n  This is real jobs. We all know that we helped our country from going \noff the financial cliff. We did that with the stimulus package and by \nbuilding new roads and bridges. The way out of this economic slump will \nbe with private business expanding and with jobs. The way you do it is \nlook across the borders and see where you can sell your goods. They \nhave been selling goods to us, right? I want the United States to be a \ncountry again that makes goods and sends our goods to other countries. \nThat is what this piece of the bill is about.\n  I am grateful to Senator Landrieu and for the leadership she included \nin this package. I thank Senator LeMieux for his leadership on this \namendment. I hope we pass this bill. It is incredibly important.\n  I now turn to my other colleague, who has chosen to wear bright pink \ntoday, the Senator from Louisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for the beautiful \nstories she shared from her State. It makes this all so real. It is. It \nseems as if sometimes it is not when we debate these bills on the \nfloor. But it is so\n\n[[Page S6152]]\n\nreal--the outcome of what we do on the ground in the States that we \nrepresent, and in these small towns. I will remember Matt's story. I am \ngoing to share the speeches that I give around my State, and how \nincredible it is that a young child would present an idea to a father \nand the father is smart enough to recognize what a good idea it was and \ntook it and built a business, and through a great strategic partnership \nwith the father, a private business owner, and a very willing Federal \nemployee, found a program that works to build his business, now with up \nto 55 employees.\n  That happens all over the country. It happens in Louisiana. Speaking \nabout Louisiana, I will read what our bankers at home--the bankers in \nmy State--say about this program. I read the letter to Mitch McConnell \nand to Harry Reid, delivered by the 5,000 community banks in the Nation \nthat are strongly supportive of this small business lending fund--\ncommunity banks that know these businesses. They are standing there \nwatching them and, in many instances, suffering and not able to give \nthem the support they need because of the credit constraints that were \nso beautifully expressed by Senator LeMieux, as falling real estate \nvalues have put the original capital that was their collateral in the \nbank in some jeopardy, or it has to be scored in a different way. This \nbill will help. That is why bankers all over the country are supporting \nit.\n  Let me say what my bankers, who are normally a more conservative \ngroup--they don't agree on everything this Congress has done, either \nwhen Republicans or Democrats are in charge; they tend to be more \nconservative. They don't like big government and a lot of regulation \nand intrusion. This is what they have said on behalf of their small \nbusinesses:\n\n       On behalf of the members of Louisiana bankers, I am writing \n     to express our support for the small business lending fund. \n     Treasury would invest in community banks from this program \n     that would be separate and apart from the Troubled Asset \n     Relief Program. This legislation would serve as another \n     voluntary tool for community banks to meet the needs of small \n     business. Meeting the needs of these borrowers has been more \n     difficult as regulators pressure many banks to increase their \n     capital-to-asset ratios.\n       Given the severity of the downturn, it is difficult, if not \n     impossible, for community banks to find new sources of \n     capital. Thus, the only option for many banks is to shrink, \n     which can mean making fewer loans. This lending provision \n     would allow banks to avoid that result, continue to meet the \n     needs of their communities. With an improving economy and \n     public investment, such as those proposed, lending can \n     increase faster in some of the hardest-hit areas of our \n     country.\n\n  The Louisiana bankers would know about this, because we are in one of \nthe hardest hit areas. Not only is the recession affecting us like \neverybody else, but if we haven't noticed lately, there is a lot of oil \nout in the gulf because of a tragic, unprecedented accident. The Gulf \nCoast community is struggling almost more than any other region of the \ncountry because of it. Now because we have constrictions on drilling--\nwhich I don't agree with but which are in place--we are finding \nemployment harder to come by and businesses struggling even more. So \nour Louisiana bankers know this. They have sent letters to myself and \nto the junior Senator from Louisiana, Senator Vitter, asking us to \nplease be supportive of community banks, saying you have done a lot to \nhelp the big banks and Wall Street, so please help us. That is what \nthis amendment is about.\n  I am going to yield the floor for a few moments. I will come back \nwithin the next 30 minutes or so and continue this debate this \nafternoon. We are on the small business bill. The pending amendment is \nthe LeMieux-Landrieu-Nelson from Florida-Merkley-Boxer-Cantwell-Murray-\nWhitehouse, and other Members are joining us as cosponsors of this \namendment. Senator Burris from Illinois is also joining us on this \namendment.\n  We are picking up support as organizations express themselves today \nto Senators, saying how important this small business lending fund is. \nIt could leverage $30 billion. It will earn a billion dollars for the \ntaxpayers, which is an attractive characteristic. It doesn't cost \nanything and it actually makes money, as any smart banker and business \nwants to do. It doesn't cost money--well, it costs a little on the \nfront end but makes it back on the back end. It is supported by a \ngrowing number of Senators, we hope, on both sides of the aisle.\n  As we continue this debate today, I look forward to answering some of \nthe concerns raised and will try to put those to rest so we can have a \nvery strong vote on this amendment on the underlying bill.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Israel\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to address a relationship \nbetween the United States and our ally Israel. I was glad to see that \nPresident Obama took some time over the July Fourth recess to sit down \nwith Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and discuss the rocky path which \nU.S. and Israeli relations have taken over the past 2 years.\n  Israel is, by far, our strongest ally in the region. This close \nrelationship and friendship is built on a bedrock of common democratic \nvalues, religious affinity, and perhaps most importantly national \nsecurity interests. We are both nations that face threats posed by \nradical Islam.\n  While we have been able to take the fight to the enemy, as we fight \nal-Qaida and Taliban refinements in Afghanistan and Iraq, Israel has \nnot been so fortunate. They face an existential threat. This threat to \ntheir existence is not just Hamas and Hezbollah, who attack Israel with \nsuicide bombs and rocket attacks, but also from radical nations such as \nIran and their allies.\n  When one nation says to another, ``We are going to wipe you off the \nmap,'' we need to take that threat seriously. This is especially true \nwhen that nation says it over and over again, as Iran has. As an ally, \nIsrael should be able to count on us for support. This support is not \nlimited to financial and military support but also diplomatic and moral \nsupport. So when Iran says they are going to wipe Israel off the map, \nthe United States needs to stand up and say, ``No, you will not.'' We \ncannot send mixed messages. That is why what happened at the 2010 \nNonproliferation Treaty Review Conference worries me so much. For when \nwe fail to stand up for our allies on the smaller issues, they begin to \nquestion our resolve when it comes to the large issues, such as their \nexistence.\n  Under the Nonproliferation Treaty, there is a conference every five \nyears to seek ways to strengthen the treaty and advance the goals of \nnuclear non-proliferation. At this conference, Secretary Clinton opened \nby stating that:\n\n       Iran will do whatever it can to divert attention away from \n     its own record and attempt to evade accountability. . . . But \n     Iran will not succeed in its efforts to divert and divide.\n\n  Additionally, a White House official was quoted in the Washington \nPost at the beginning of the conference summarizing: ``This meeting is \nall about Iran.''\n  Based on these comments, one would expect to see some reference to \nthe fact that Iran and Syria are both flagrantly violating their treaty \nobligations. One would expect to hear that Iran has threatened the \nexistence of another sovereign nation. One would expect to hear how \nIsrael was forced to destroy a North Korean nuclear facility located in \nits backyard. We did not see anything of this sort in the final \ndocument. What we did see instead was the name ``Israel'' appearing. I \nam a little bit confused. Why would we agree to a document that does \nnot mention Iran or Syria but does single out our strongest ally in the \nregion? This is even more puzzling considering this is a consensus \ndocument. That means that we, as a nation, had to sign off on it. \nEssentially, we threw one of our closest allies under the bus, in \nexchange for what? I do not believe there is a good answer to this \nquestion. What type of message does this send not only to Israel but to \nour other allies? It says:\n\n[[Page S6153]]\n\nWe will not hesitate to throw you overboard in exchange for a political \ntic mark that gets us nothing.\n  In closing, I believe that based on what Secretary Clinton was hoping \nto achieve and what we actually did achieve--the alienation of an \nally--this conference has to be considered an utter failure.\n  Some over at Foggy Bottom, at the White House, and in Congress need \nto realize how important our relationship with Israel is and start \ntaking steps to strengthen that relationship instead of taking steps to \nweaken it, as we did at the recent Nonproliferation Conference.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for the \nnext 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I know Members are busy around the \nSenate today on various committees and special caucus lunches, talking \nabout many aspects of not just this bill but other things that are \npending. I thought I would come to the floor while we had this time to \nmake a few general remarks about the small business bill and also \nspecifically about the Small Business Lending Fund which is the \namendment that is pending.\n  The Small Business Lending Fund amendment is a bipartisan amendment \nby Senator LeMieux of Florida and myself. It is also sponsored by the \nsenior Senator from Florida, Mr. Nelson, Senator Merkley from Oregon, \nSenator Boxer from California, Senator Cantwell, Senator Murray, \nSenator Whitehouse, Senator Burris from Illinois. We added Senator \nHagan just a few minutes ago as a cosponsor, and we are getting calls \nregularly, throughout the day, from Senators who want to be a sponsor \nof this amendment. We believe we have great support on the floor of the \nSenate, and that support is growing as this debate goes forward and as \nmore people begin to understand that this Small Business Lending Fund \nis really the core of the small business bill.\n  There are three pieces of the small business bill. One piece that \ncame out of the Finance Committee on a very strong bipartisan vote, I \nunderstand, was a $12 billion targeted tax cut for small businesses in \nAmerica. There should be listed, I hope on my Web site and other Web \nsites of the Finance Committee, a list of all those tax cuts. One or \ntwo I am very familiar with would be a real advantage to anyone in \nAmerica who wants to invest in a small business over the course of the \nnext 6 months to a year. You will pay no capital gains if you hold that \ninvestment for 5 years; you will pay zero capital gains because that is \none of the strategic targeted tax cuts in this bill. In addition, there \nis accelerated depreciation for small businesses--not for big \nbusinesses but for small businesses--so small businesses in America, \ndefined as those businesses with under 500 employees, can write off \nsome of the investments they are making to try to grow their businesses \nin these difficult times. We want to help them do that. So one \nimportant part of this bill is $12 billion in tax cuts to small \nbusinesses. This is a very important component.\n  The other important component came out of the Small Business \nCommittee with a bipartisan vote. It strengthens the core programs \nwithin the Small Business Administration. It strengthens the 7(a) \nProgram. It strengthens the 504 Program. These are programs that allow \nlending to small businesses for commercial real estate. They allow \nlending for the capital needs of those businesses--for businesses to \npurchase inventory, to purchase other goods and services necessary to \noperate their business.\n  These are longstanding programs that are very well supported on both \nsides of the aisle and that we find have worked so well we want to \ndouble the limits, we want to eliminate the fees, and we want to \nincrease the guarantee from 75 percent to 90 percent. When we did this \nunder the stimulus program a year ago on an emergency basis, we saw the \nnumber of loans go up dramatically. That time came to an end, and so in \nthis bill we are reinstating that very successful program that works. \nSenator Snowe, the ranking member, and I are very supportive of that \nprovision, and that is in the bill.\n  There are three main pieces. I have talked about two. The third piece \nis what this amendment represents. The third piece, according to the \nNational Bankers Association, is really the core of the bill. That is \naccording to the community banks, not the big banks on Wall Street but \nthe community banks on Main Street. They have written letters to all of \nus--to the majority leader, to the minority leader--saying: Please \nsupport the Small Business Lending Fund. It is not like TARP, it is \ncompletely different, they say, and they are right.\n  As I said earlier this morning, a little bit of opposition we are \nhearing even from the minority leader, Mitch McConnell, indicated that \none of the reasons that maybe some of the Republicans might not be for \nthis is because this is like TARP. The TARP was a $700 billion bailout \nto big banks. This is a $30 billion partnership with healthy community \nbanks. TARP was a $700 billion bailout for failing, unhealthy big banks \non Wall Street. The small business lending program is $30 billion--much \nsmaller, strategic private sector partnership with small community \nbanks that are on Main Street to keep all of our small businesses open \nand operating and growing so we can get out of this recession.\n  I hope the arguments that this is TARP-lite or TARP, Jr., will go \naway because the facts are so completely different from one program to \nthe other. This is a strong strategic partnership that could have been \ndefined as a bailout. It was a bailout. Some of us think it was \nnecessary, some think it was unnecessary, but it was a bailout. This is \nnot a bailout. This is only going to healthy banks that, because of the \nfalling value of collateral they are holding behind some of those loans \nbecause the regulators are looking at it a bit more, giving more \nscrutiny to banks everywhere--some of that is good and some is a little \nbit heavyhanded, but nonetheless it is happening--banks are having a \nhard time generating the capital to have those ratios correct when the \nregulators come in, and so they are cutting back on lending.\n  If we want banks to lend to small businesses, we need to help them, \nand they want us to help them. They are for this. The independent \nbankers have sent us letters. The community bankers have sent us \nletters, as well as the American Bankers Association. That is unlike \nTARP, where there were many banks, even some that received money, that \ndidn't like the program. They didn't like it because there were lots of \nstrings attached. They didn't like it because they thought it would \n``ruin their reputations.'' They didn't like it because they didn't \nwant to have to go through stress tests. I understand that. I think the \nprogram has worked pretty well, but that was that program. That was 2 \nyears ago. This is now. It is a different initiative. It is not even \nreally a government program; it is a private sector partnership between \nthe Federal Government and taxpayers and their community banks that \nthey know and they trust. They see these bankers at the Rotary Clubs \nand Kiwanis clubs. They see them in church, they see them in the \nsynagogues, they see them on Main Street. These are the bankers who \nknow their businesses and want to lend to their businesses. They know \nthe businesses that have the potential to grow and those that \npotentially might not be able to grow. They know the businesses that \nhave readjusted for this economy, this tough economy. We can trust our \ncommunity bankers.\n  I am the chair of the Small Business Committee. I have had the most \nextraordinary opportunity as chair of this committee--on which you \nserve, I say to the Presiding Officer--to listen to small business \nowner after small business owner pleading, saying to me things like: \nSenator, I never missed a payment. Senator, I always sent in my money, \nand they cut my line of credit. Senator, we are desperate out here. We \ndo not have access to credit. Please help us.\n  One argument I have heard some others make is based on a study that \ncame\n\n[[Page S6154]]\n\nout from the National Federation of Independent Business, the NFIB. I \nam going to try to get that study in just a minute because I want to \nrespond to that. The NFIB study is quoted sometimes in this debate. \nHere it is here, the ``Small Business Credit in Deep Recession'' study. \nIt is waved around on the floor by some people who are not sure how \nthey might vote on this amendment because they have heard things. They \nare not sure, but they say: According to the NFIB, the National \nFederation of Independent Business, 40 percent of the banks say credit \nis not a problem. And there is some data here that is going to show \nthat 40 percent of the banks say they were able to get all the loans \nthey needed; 10 percent said they could get almost all the loans they \nneeded. But the rest of the study is what is important. It is about 60 \npercent who say they could not get it, from the National Federation of \nIndependent Business. Their own study showed that 60 percent of their \nbusinesses said they could not get the collateral from the banks that \nthey so desperately need.\n  I know there is this little argument out there that there are no good \nbusinesses to lend to.\n  We all know that is not true. There are businesses in all of our \ndistricts. We are hearing from them. They cannot get credit because of \nnew regulations, because of tightening capital ratios. This is a \npartnership with banks that has absolutely nothing to do with TARP, big \nbanks, Wall Street, unhealthy banks. It has everything to do with \ncommunity banks that are less than $10 billion. Those are the only \nbanks that can even apply to be a part of this. It is completely \nvoluntary.\n  If a community bank in Illinois or Louisiana--and I have talked to \nsome--said, Senator, we are healthy; we have a lot of capital to lend, \nI have said to them, that is wonderful. Then you do not need to apply \nfor this. But if you want to grow your bank in these times, then it is \ncompletely up to you. This will be available to you. You know what, \nthey brighten up. They say, well, we did not realize that. We thought \nit was going to be something forced. Absolutely not. It is completely \nvoluntary.\n  So for the NFIB and the 40 percent of their businesses that said they \ncould not get collateral, this is a solution. I am very proud to offer \nthis solution in this way. I also want to say we have letters from, I \nbelieve, almost 20 Governors who have said, please help us. We are \ntrying to do everything we can in our State to stimulate growth and \ndevelopment. We are trying to do what we can. So they have sent \nletters, both Republican and Democratic Governors. A letter I have that \nI will submit to the Record is from February, from Christine Gregoire, \nthe Governor from Washington State. She writes a very strong letter to \nDr. Romer, our economic adviser for President Obama, to Tim Geithner, \nto Chairman Sheila Bair, saying, this small business lending program is \nwhat the State of Washington needs. We are full, she says, of small \nbusinesses that are knocking on our doors at the State capital that \ncannot get credit. We must open the opportunities for them.\n  If we want our States' economies to grow, which we do, whether it is \nWashington or California, I say to my good friend from Arizona, or from \nTennessee, or from Massachusetts, the way they are going to grow is \nthrough small business.\n  Look at this. From 1993 to 2009, in the last 16 years--I think these \nnumbers would be updated and it would even show more--65 percent of all \nnew jobs in America are created by small business. When we have letters \nsuch as this from Governors who say their small businesses cannot get \ncredit, what are we going to do? Sit here and do nothing? I do not \nthink so. I think we should act.\n  One of the best ideas that has come forward from Republicans and \nDemocrats that has been scrutinized and looked at and torn apart and \nput back together is a $30 billion small business lending fund that \nwill not create a new government program. This is not lending by the \ngovernment, this is lending by the private sector.\n  This is not lending by big banks, who do not lend--by the way, we \nhave seen the bank lending, big bank lending to small business has \ndeclined in the last four quarters by 8.1 percent. Think about that. \nThe banks that got all of the money in the last year of the Bush \nadministration and the first year of the Obama administration, the \nbanks that got all of the money, the reports show, cut lending to small \nbusiness by 8.1 percent.\n  The banks that did not get any help, the healthy community banks in \nour States, even in these times have increased the lending to small \nbusiness because, A, it is smart for them to do so, because when they \ndo it right they make money, which is the whole point of them being in \nbusiness, and because many of them also believe strongly in the \ncommunities in which they have built their business.\n  They helped build these towns. They do not want to see them take \nbankruptcy. They helped build the businesses on Main Street. Do you \nthink they are happy to sit there and watch these businesses close up?\n  But we spent the last 2 years, the last year under Bush and the first \nyear under Obama, bailing out Wall Street. When it comes to helping \nMain Street, it gets very quiet around here. I wonder why.\n  That is what this amendment does. We know small business creates \njobs. We know there are credible small businesses in all of our States. \nEven according to the NFIB, even according to their own survey, 40 \npercent of the businesses said, we did not get all of the credit we \nneed. If we could get it, if we could get credit from our banks, if we \ncould borrow money from our banks, we could grow, even according to \nthis study.\n  We are very proud of this lending provision in this bill. I think the \nwhole bill is very good. Maybe there are some other amendments that \nneed to be included, that could come from Finance or that might come \nfrom someone else. But the core of the bill, the $12 billion in tax \ncuts for small business, the strengthening of the small business \nlending programs and contracting programs and surety bond programs, \nwhich many of our Members have worked on, and this lending piece is \nabsolutely crucial. It is one of the best things that we could do as a \nCongress to help small businesses find their footing, to help them get \nmore certainty about the future.\n  They are the ones that are going to take the risk. We have seen the \nheadlines in the last couple of days. If you are reading the Washington \nPost, if you are reading the New York Times, if you are reading your \nhometown newspaper, what do those headlines say? I will tell you what \nthey say: Big business hoarding cash. Big banks sitting on $1.6 \ntrillion in profits. They are sitting on it. They are holding it. They \nare not lending it.\n  Do you know who is lending? Do you know who is still lending, or they \nare trying to lend? The community banks of America. They are \ndesperately trying to lend. And what are we doing? Sitting here not \nlistening to them or not helping them. We must listen to them. I have \nletters here I have submitted to the Record, independent bankers, \ncommunity bankers, American bankers: Please help the healthy small \nbanks in America to do the job we want to do for you and end the \nrecession.\n  When we vote on this amendment, I hope we get a strong vote. I hope \npeople in this Chamber will not turn their backs on the small \nbusinesses in their districts and the healthy community banks that have \nbeen there for a long time. If we act responsibly, and if we join in \npartnership with them, and we rely on the private sector savvy that is \nout there, I think we can make some real headway. That is what I am \nhoping.\n  There is no silver bullet. I am not 100 percent positive this is \ngoing to work in the way that we think. But I am very confident that it \nhas a great chance of working. Shouldn't we give the benefit of the \ndoubt to our own small businesses and community bankers? A lot of \npeople did not know if TARP worked. A lot of people do not think it \nworked today. But nobody was saying, oh, well, we are not sure; we \nshould not do it. We rushed on out there and gave billions of dollars \nto Wall Street, billions of dollars to big banks.\n  Now when it comes to giving our community banks the benefit of the \ndoubt, when it comes to giving small business people who have risked \neverything the benefit of the doubt, we are\n\n[[Page S6155]]\n\nhaving some trouble. I do not understand that.\n  As the chairman of the Small Business Committee, I promised them I \nwould follow in the good footsteps of the former chairs of this \ncommittee: Senator Snowe has been an outstanding chair; Senator Kerry \nhas been an outstanding chair; Senator Bond has been an outstanding \nchair. They have been very strong advocates for small business in \nAmerica.\n  When this program came across my desk, I wish I could say I designed \nit. I would love to take credit for it. But I did not. It was designed \nby other Senators. But when I saw it, I thought to myself, now this \ncould work. When I heard the President speak about it, I thought, this \nmakes a lot of sense. I thought, my goodness, this sounds like a good \nidea. The more I looked into it, I became convinced, it is not a good \nidea, it is an excellent idea. I am not going to leave it on the \ncutting room floor because of some political argument that makes no \nsense to me, and it should not make sense to anybody in this Chamber.\n  I see other colleagues are on the floor to speak. I have exhausted my \n10 or 15 minutes. I am happy to yield the floor. And then, of course, I \nwill come back to the floor, to come back to speak about this \namendment. I want to say I am very proud of the support of Senator \nLeMieux, as well as a growing list of other Senators who have come \nforward to support this amendment and to speak on the bill.\n  I see the Senator from Arizona and I will yield the floor at this \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise simply to insert into the \nCongressional Record two very interesting pieces from the Arizona \nRepublic. The first is an op-ed, a column, by Bob Robb, who is one of \nthe most erudite columnists I have ever read. He comments on the \nfinancial regulatory reform bill saying, among other things, that this \nnew financial stability oversight council that is created under the \nlegislation will have total control over what a lot of banks and \nbusinesses do.\n  He describes this as being able to tell a company not only what \ncapital it needs to maintain, but what products or services it can \noffer. It can even order a company to divest some of its holdings or \nlines of business, and even take over the company with the intent of \ncompletely liquidating it, and in many cases even without the ability \nto contest these decisions in court.\n  He laments the fact that there will be no rules-based regulation of \ncapital markets anymore; predicts it will be doomed to failure, and \nalso talks about the beginning of the end for an independent Fed, which \nhas significant responsibilities under this law, which he believes, and \nI agree, are inconsistent with its primary task, the entity in our \ncountry that is supposed to take care of the monetary policy of the \ncountry.\n  The other piece is an article in the Arizona Republic of July 21. I \nwill quote from the first three paragraphs:\n\n       State and university employees with families can expect to \n     see their monthly health insurance costs rise as much as 37 \n     percent next year, depending on the type of plan they choose.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       The Department of Administration--\n\n  That is to say, of the State of Arizona--\n\n     cites Federal health reform as the reason the State's health \n     plans will carry greater expenses and higher premiums for its \n     members.\n\n  This is the latest example of the effect of the health care reform \nlegislation on insurance premiums which are going to be rising around \nthe country. But I did not expect them to rise 37 percent on our State \nemployees next year.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the column by Robert Robb and the \nnewspaper article dated July 21 in the Arizona Republic be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, July 21, 2010]\n\n                 An End to Rules-Based Capital Markets\n\n                            (By Robert Robb)\n\n       The financial market reform legislation enacted by Congress \n     last week ushers in a new era in the relationship between \n     capital markets and the government.\n       If the country decides it was a mistake, unwinding it will \n     be very difficult.\n       Until now, regulation of capital markets has been primarily \n     disclosure-based. Investment firms were largely free to offer \n     whatever products they wanted. The role of government was \n     principally to ensure that there was adequate disclosure so \n     that potential investors could make informed decisions and \n     not be hoodwinked. Who made or lost money wasn't the \n     government's concern, except at tax time.\n       The primary exception was banks whose deposits were insured \n     by the federal government. Since the government was \n     ultimately on the hook, it oversaw the prudence with which \n     these banks did their business.\n       The conventional wisdom is that this system failed in the \n     financial market turmoil of 2008. Financial institutions \n     subject to lighter prudential regulation took on too much bad \n     risk with too much leverage. These firms had become big and \n     interconnected enough that their failure threatened the \n     collapse of the entire U.S. financial system.\n       Now, I happen to believe that this narrative overstates the \n     threat that existed in 2008. But I am part of a very small \n     and uninfluential minority on the matter. So, for purposes of \n     discussion, let's assume that the narrative is correct and \n     the goal of reform should be to prevent a reoccurrence.\n       There are several things that Congress could have done to \n     address the perceived threat directly. If financial \n     institutions of over a certain size represent a systemic \n     threat, Congress could have prohibited companies from \n     becoming that large. In the past, the U.S. got by with \n     smaller banks and it could again.\n       If excessive leverage is a systemic threat, Congress could \n     have limited it directly.\n       Instead, Congress decided to vastly expand the federal \n     government's discretionary, prudential regulation of capital \n     markets.\n       A new Financial Stability Oversight Council and the Fed are \n     authorized to prescribe individualized requirements for any \n     company they deem to pose a potential systemic risk. The new \n     council of wise men can tell a company not only what capital \n     it needs to maintain, but what products or services it can \n     offer. It can order a company to divest some of its holdings \n     or lines of business. The federal government can even take \n     over a company with the intent of completely liquidating it.\n       In many cases, the company has no ability to contest these \n     decisions in court. Where there is judicial review, it is \n     limited to whether the regulatory decision was arbitrary and \n     capricious.\n       So, there is no real rules-based regulation of capital \n     markets anymore. The council of wise men will make it up as \n     they go along. Companies of the same size in the same lines \n     of business may have entirely different rules they must \n     follow.\n       There will no longer be a capital market regulated by an \n     arms-length federal regulator, setting the same rules of the \n     game for all competitors. Instead, there will be symbiosis \n     between government and financial institutions, interacting \n     continuously with one another to determine what any \n     particular financial institution can and cannot do at any \n     particular point in time.\n       This approach is doomed to failure. No group of regulators \n     has the wisdom required to do what this new legislation \n     requires.\n       Once the symbiosis is established, however, unwinding it \n     will be very difficult. The politicization of the allocation \n     of capital tends to be addictive.\n       This bill is also probably the beginning of the end of an \n     independent Fed. The Fed cannot play this large of a role in \n     the conduct of every major financial institution in the \n     country without politicians seeking to get into its knickers. \n     The role of primary systemic risk regulator is simply \n     incompatible with that of an independent monetary policy \n     maker.\n       President Obama and Democrats regard this legislation as \n     monumental. I don't think they even partially understand how \n     right they are.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, July 21, 2010]\n\n           State Tells Employees Health Insurance Will Rocket\n\n                           (By Ken Alltucker)\n\n       State and university employees with families can expect to \n     see their monthly health-insurance costs rise as much as 37 \n     percent next year, depending on the type of plan they choose.\n       Figures provided by the Arizona Department of \n     Administration show that health plans for families and single \n     adults with children will shoulder the most-expensive monthly \n     premium increases beginning Jan. 1, while individuals will \n     pay modest increases.\n       The Department of Administration cited federal health \n     reform as the reason the state's health plans will carry \n     ``greater expenses and higher premiums for members,'' \n     according to a June 30 letter sent to about 135,000 state and \n     university employees and their dependents.\n       The letter named two provisions that the state expects will \n     drive health-insurance costs higher. One is a requirement \n     that insurance plans provide coverage for dependent children \n     up to age 26. The other is the federal legislation's ban on \n     lifetime limits, an insurance-industry practice that cuts \n     coverage once an individual's medical expenses exceed a set \n     amount over their lifetime.\n       Because the state is one of Arizona's largest providers of \n     health insurance, its estimates could provide an early \n     glimpse of how large employers will pass along health-reform \n     costs to their employees.\n\n[[Page S6156]]\n\n       Industry analysts say it is too early to tell how much \n     health reform will impact the cost of insurance. Some \n     estimates expect the initial impact on overall cost will be \n     less than 2 percent. Many analysts agree that the true impact \n     won't be known until 2014, when health-insurance exchanges \n     are established to extend coverage to the estimated 32 \n     million Americans who now lack health insurance.\n       ``I don't know if anybody really knows what the (impact) on \n     costs will be,'' said Don Mollihan, a broker and consultant \n     with Arizona Benefit Consultants. ``The entire (health-\n     insurance) industry is trying to react to the reform as \n     regulations are implemented. That is where the rubber meets \n     the road.''\n       One example is the Obama administration's requirement, \n     unveiled this month, that all health-insurance plans cover \n     preventive care free of charge. Such no-charge preventive \n     care ranges from autism screening to colorectal-cancer \n     screening for adults over age 50 to folic-acid supplements \n     for pregnant women.\n       ``The preventive-care requirements could add some costs, \n     but a lot of (insurers) are already providing those services \n     as part of their core'' plans, said Patricia ``Corki'' \n     Larsen, a principal with human-resources consultant Mercer in \n     Phoenix.\n       Alan Ecker, Department of Administration spokesman, said \n     health reform is ``responsible for all increases for employee \n     premiums'' next year.\n       He noted that federal health reform passed after the \n     Legislature approved funding for next year's state's health \n     plan, so with no money left in the state coffers to cover the \n     mandated changes to health insurance plans, the state opted \n     to shift costs to employees.\n\n\n                             Varying impact\n\n       The state pays for most of the premium costs, with the \n     employee picking up a portion of the premium costs. Also, \n     changes in premiums do not reflect other cost-shifting \n     measures, such as increases in co-payments that people must \n     pay when visiting a doctor or filling a drug prescription.\n       University and state employees who get state-sponsored \n     coverage just for themselves won't see much of an increase in \n     their premiums: about $1 each month under three plans offered \n     by the state.\n       Increases in employee premiums for plans that cover couples \n     and families will range from $22 to $43 a month. Single \n     adults with children will see those premiums increase 37 \n     percent for an Aetna insurance plan that includes a health-\n     savings account. The Aetna family plan and the Aetna plan for \n     two adults will also each rise more than 20 percent. \n     Employees who choose the state's EPO and other plans similar \n     to an HMO for families and adults with children also will see \n     their monthly payments rise more than 22 percent.\n\n\n                          Dispute over letter\n\n       Yet, even as Gov. Jan Brewer's administration cited health \n     reform as the chief reason for cost increases, the state's \n     health-insurance premiums for employees have increased at \n     even faster clips in the past.\n       In fact, employee premiums for five of eight plans next \n     year will increase at a lower rate than they did this year.\n       Some lawmakers questioned the Brewer administration's \n     decision to send out a letter that blames health reform for \n     the premium increases.\n       Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Phoenix, who sat on President Barack \n     Obama's health-reform task force, blasted the Department of \n     Administration's letter as politically motivated.\n       ``The Department of Administration is implying that entire \n     increase is a result of the new health-care law,'' Sinema \n     said. ``It is clearly a politically motivated letter that is \n     just not factually accurate.''\n       Ecker, of the Department of Administration, denied any \n     political motivation. He saw no political undertone in the \n     letter, which was drafted by the Department of \n     Administration's benefits-services staff and approved by the \n     agency's director.\n       ``It is simply designed to let members know that rate \n     increases are coming and the reason for those increases,'' \n     Ecker said in an e-mail.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n\n                   National Endowment for the Oceans\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I know my friend and colleague, \nSenator Snowe, is about to deliver some remarks. I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be recognized at the conclusion of her statement. I wish \nto take a moment to thank her for her work with me on the bill I am \ngoing to be talking about. She will be talking about something else, \nbut I will be discussing the National Endowment for the Oceans. While \nwe are in the Chamber together, I express my gratitude for the \ncollegial, thoughtful, helpful way we worked together on this \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I express my profound gratitude to the \nSenator from Rhode Island for his leadership on this initiative. It \nwill have far-reaching implications and importance to our most vital \nresource, the oceans, and all they represent. I look forward to working \nwith him to transform this legislation into a reality that will protect \nthe oceans in perpetuity and understanding and amassing all the \nresources that are essential to the preservation of the oceans and what \nthey represent to our environment and to the ecosystem and, of course, \nto the fisheries that are so important to our respective States and to \nthe country. I thank him for his visionary initiative. I am pleased to \njoin him in that effort. Hopefully, we can bring it to fruition in this \nCongress.\n  There are a number of issues with respect to the small business \nlegislation pending before the Senate, although pending in a way I \nwould prefer otherwise, given the fact that it addresses the foremost \nissue facing the country today; that is, jobs and the status of the \neconomy. The economy is not creating the jobs the American people \ndeserve. That is why I joined across the aisle in extending \nunemployment benefits, because we have a very high unemployment rate of \n9.5 percent, with 8 million people having lost their jobs and more than \n15 million either unemployed or underemployed. We have not seen the \nkind of economic growth that will produce the jobs the American people \ndeserve and create the kind of security they deserve as well.\n  From that standpoint, I thought it was important to extend \nunemployment benefits. I ultimately think it is important to do what we \ncan for small businesses, as the chairman of the Small Business \nCommittee indicated, the job generators in America. Frankly, I would \nhave hoped we could have considered this legislation long before now. \nIt is certainly long overdue. We are in July. I have been urging from \nthe outset of the year, in January, that we should address this most \nprofound issue when it comes to creating jobs. We clearly have to be \nconcerned about the well-being of small businesses.\n  The legislation before the Senate has a number of good provisions \nthat will go a long way in creating incentives and helping and \nbuttressing this key component of America's economy. I regret that we \nare in a position where we have not been able to reach agreement \nallowing the minority to offer amendments, which is confounding and \nperplexing as well as disappointing. After all, I know the majority \nrules. But certainly the traditions of the Senate accommodate minority \nrights as well. That should mean, on the foremost issue facing the \ncountry today, the economy and jobs, that the minority would be allowed \nto offer a few amendments. That is all we are asking. After all, this \nissue has been languishing for the last 6 months. It should have taken \nthe highest priority back in January, as I indicated; It is that \nimportant to the American people, as reflected in the historic low \napproval ratings of Congress. We are not addressing the key issues \nfacing America today, and that is how we will turn this economy around \nand create jobs for the American people.\n  Here we are today in a deadlock because we are not allowed, on the \nminority side, to offer a few amendments. As I look back on the \ncalendar, we had 78 days we were not either in session or voting. We \ncould have spent all that time considering amendments for the key issue \nconfronting America. In fact, over the last 2 weeks, since this bill \nhas been pending, not one amendment has been offered or allowed to be \noffered to the small business bill. We have wasted all this time when, \nin fact, we could have been considering amendments. Last night on the \nunemployment benefit extension bill, we were able to vote on six \ndifferent amendments. We had six votes last night on issues. The \nprocess worked well. That is the way it should work in the Senate, \nwhere we are supposed to accommodate a variety of positions and build \nconsensus on the key issues facing America.\n  I know today we are lacking patience, when it comes to governing and \nlegislating and reviewing issues and working with people with whom we \ndisagree. That is regrettable. The American people understand what is \nhappening here in Washington these days, where it is an all-or-nothing \nproposition. I hope we can turn the corner on this issue above all else \nbecause it does matter to the American people. It matters to people \nwhat is happening on Main Street. That is as true in my\n\n[[Page S6157]]\n\nState of Maine as it is true across the country. It is no wonder more \nthan 70 percent of the American people think the country is going in \nthe wrong direction when it comes to the economy--understandably so. \nBecause they go down on Main Street and see what is happening. They see \nbusinesses closing, the anxiety that permeates not only the main \nstreets but communities and households all across America because of \nthe lack of job security, financial security, personal security, all of \nwhich has created a picture of anxiety and desperation on the part of \nso many, wondering where the next job will come from, if they lose \ntheir jobs, or whether they will get a job having lost a job. That is \nwhat it is all about.\n  I can't understand why we couldn't come together in the Senate, \nconsistent with the tradition of this body, which is to consider a \nvariety of ideas across the political aisle, build consensus, and \nsupport. The more ideas, the better. It will make the legislation \ncertainly much improved because we will have a variety of ideas that \nare important when it comes to improving our economic status in \nAmerica. It is disconcerting when we know that the Federal Reserve has \nadjusted their growth rates for the economy, lowering them because of \nwhat they anticipate in the future in terms of economic growth, \nunemployment, the lack of investments being made by companies today \neither in hiring or capital equipment. The combination has created a \nmuch more pessimistic picture for the future in terms of our economy.\n  Then, of course, we have the uncertainty emanating from Washington, \nfrom Congress, in terms of a variety of policies, whether it is health \ncare, whether we are talking about increased taxes or increased \nregulation, as we saw with the tax extender bill, having subchapter S \nand increasing Medicare payroll taxes and, in fact, applying them for \nthe first time on retained earnings which is the greatest source of \ncapital for a small business investment. Yet we want to tax that as \nwell. We are seeing all that uncertainty.\n  People say: Businesses are not sitting on their cash. Businesses \nwon't sit on their cash, if they think they are going to make money. \nThat is the point. They would invest. They would make the investments, \nif they thought the economy was going in the right direction. But they \nhave to be more conservative, if they don't know exactly what is going \nto come out of Washington in terms of policies and more regulation.\n  I have talked to numerous business people in my State, including \nbankers. They all say the same thing. We don't know what is going to \ncome out of Washington in terms of the types of policies that are going \nto add to the cost of business. I was talking to one individual who is \nin charge of a big corporation in America, making an adjustment of one \nfacet on the close to 1,000 regulations in the health care bill. He \nsaid one adjustment already has cost him $5 million. Multiply that, and \nit grows exponentially. The point is, it is a challenging picture for \nthe private sector in terms of taking steps or taking the risky steps \nin investing in the future for their company. They want to make sure \nthey are making the right decisions, the prudent decisions to make \nmoney and not to lose it. That is where we come in, in terms of \ncreating certainty with respect to our policies, not adding more in \nterms of taxes and spending that adds another overlay to the cost of \ndoing business. Because they are going to be far more reluctant to take \nthose steps that we think are necessary to turn this economy around.\n\n  That gets to the point of the pending legislation and, in particular, \nan amendment I know has been offered by the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Landrieu, with respect to the lending facility. It is a \nprovision I have had a great deal of concern with respect to, this \nlending capacity that would be created that would extend from the \nTreasury to banks across the country. I know the majority leader has \ntaken this provision out of the underlying bill, and I certainly \nappreciate that because I do think it is important that this facility \nis not included in the overall legislation. First, it has not had a \nsingle hearing with respect to the issue. In my view, it certainly does \nresurrect the controversial TARP that we just terminated in the bill \nthat passed last week in the Senate and was signed by the President \nwhich is, of course, the financial regulatory reform bill. It is \ndefinitely a facsimile of that approach and that program that has \ncreated a great deal of concern.\n  The lending fund was debated in the House, certainly on the House \nfloor in the House Financial Services Committee, where significant \nconcerns were raised about the program's similarities to TARP. In stark \ncontrast to the Small Business Committee provisions in the substitute \namendment we are now considering, many of these measures certainly are \ngoing to add a great deal of concern in terms of whether we should be \nextending more than $30 billion to banks across the country. I hope we \nwill rely on the key provisions in the underlying legislation; for \nexample, raising the 7(a) guarantee rate from 80 to 90 percent and \nincreasing and also reducing certain lenders' and borrowers' fees in \nthe 7(a) and 504 loan program.\n  I am pleased those measures that were included in the stimulus plan \nthat we passed last year resulted, as this chart indicates, in a 90-\npercent national increase in SBA lending since Recovery Act's passage \nand a 236-percent increase in Maine. It is a strong indication of the \nvalue of increasing the guarantee rate, which we have now done in the \nunderlying legislation because those provisions expired in May. That is \ncertainly one way of extending the lending capacity of the Federal \nGovernment through existing models that have been proven to be \neffective and workable, and that is a 7(a) guarantee program. As a \nresult, in June the SBA approved $647 billion in 7(a) guarantee loans, \na 56-percent decrease from May's $1.9 billion, because we allowed those \nprovisions to terminate that were included in the stimulus bill. Had we \nallowed them to extend, we would have seen continuity of lending to \nsmall businesses in this country.\n  That is why I think those measures are extremely effective. They have \nalready demonstrated their efficiency and their workability across the \ncountry. That is what will work for small businesses, if we were to \nincrease those guarantee rates and reduce the lenders' and borrowers' \nfees. That is why I am pleased the majority leader included in his \nsubstitute a modified version of my amendment that provides $505 \nmillion in funding to reinstate the fee waivers and increase guarantees \nthrough the remainder of this year. The SBA has estimated that the \nreinstatement of these provisions could leverage $13.2 billion in SBA \nlending. This is precisely the type of effect we could have for the \ntaxpayers that maximizes the efficiency and the return on the dollar \nrather than reincarnating the speculative nature of TARP. These \nappropriations, coupled with the SBA lending provisions in the \nsubstitute amendment, will raise the maximum 7(a) and 504 loan limits \nfrom $2 million to $5 million and the maximum microloan limit from \n$35,000 to $50,000, which play an invaluable role in providing \naffordable credit to small businesses.\n  Obviously, when it comes to expanding access to capital, Congress \nmust work in tandem with the administration and the Treasury \nDepartment. Let me begin by noting that I appreciate the hard work of \nindividuals in the Department of the Treasury in trying to develop \nmethods to spur small business lending. I understand how complicated it \ncan be to devise workable, strong initiatives. The department has \ncertainly attempted to do so. Unfortunately, I continue to have \nsignificant reservations with the lending fund for several reasons.\n  First, regardless of what the proponents will say about this lending \nfund, it is essentially an extension of TARP, known as the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, which, as I said earlier, has been terminated in \nthe financial regulatory reform legislation the President signed into \nlaw just yesterday.\n  But let's look at what some of the experts have to say on this \nparticular issue. In a May 17, 2010, letter that Mr. Barofsky--who is \nthe special inspector general of TARP--wrote to Members of the House of \nRepresentatives, he states:\n\n       . . . in terms of its basic designs, its participants, its \n     application process, and, perhaps its funding source from an \n     oversight perspective, the [small business Lending Fund] \n     would essentially be an extension of TARP's CPP program. . . \n     .\n\n\n[[Page S6158]]\n\n\n  Moreover, in its May Oversight Report, the bipartisan Congressional \nOversight Panel for TARP states that the Treasury lending fund \n``substantially resembles'' the TARP program. They say:\n\n       . . . it is a bank-focused capital infusion program that is \n     being contemplated despite little, if any, evidence that such \n     programs increase lending.\n\n  ``An extension of TARP'' and ``substantially resembles'' TARP--that \nis how the experts of all things TARP--TARP's IG, the inspector \ngeneral, and the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel--characterize \nthis program. So obviously we are talking about the experts who are the \nwatchdogs of the TARP, and they say that regardless of how you want to \ndescribe this program, it is what it is. It is an exact duplicate of \nTARP. That is what it is.\n  In addition to characterizing the Treasury lending fund as TARP, we \nhad three Democrats and two Republicans on the Congressional Oversight \nPanel who also laid out a series of substantive concerns with the \nprogram. I would like to outline these for my colleagues as well.\n  First, the panel explained that the Treasury lending fund will be \n``less relevant if declining business sales play a larger role in \nlending contraction than banks' rejections of loan applications.'' What \ndoes that mean? Well, it means that although lending contraction \nremains a significant concern, the root cause of that contraction may \nprimarily be a lack of demand because borrowers are not as interested \nin taking on debt until their sales increase as opposed to banks' mere \nunwillingness to make loans they otherwise should be making. As the \nNFIB has long maintained, ``What small businesses need most are \nincreased sales, giving them a reason to hire and make capital \nexpenditures and borrow to support those activities.''\n  Secondly, according to the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel, \nthe program will likely be branded with a TARP stigma, which will \ndiminish banks' willingness to participate.\n  Third, additionally, the Congressional Oversight Panel has also \nconcluded that the Small Business Lending Fund may reward banks that \nwould have increased their lending even in the absence of government \nsupport, as the fund's incentive structure is calculated in reference \nto 2009 lending levels, which were low by historical standards.\n  I know the proponents of the lending fund may try to disagree with \nMr. Barofsky and the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Panel's \ncomments, but in doing so they will be arguing against the experts \nestablished to oversee TARP in the first place.\n  Moreover, it is not as if we are talking about partisan entities \nhere. Again, the Congressional Oversight Panel is comprised of three \nDemocrats and two Republicans, who have collectively agreed to include \nthese statements in their report.\n  There are other unintended consequences that may result from \nTreasury's Small Business Lending Fund, which certainly raises a red \nflag for me. It is possible that instead of promoting quality loans, \nthe proposal could encourage unnecessarily risky behavior by banks. The \nTreasury Department proposes to lend funds to banks at a 5-percent \ninterest rate, which then can be reduced to as low as 1 percent if the \ninstitutions in turn increase their small business lending. However, if \nthe banks fail to increase their small business lending, the interest \nrate they would pay could rise to a more punitive rate of 7 percent. \nWell, this could lead to an untenable situation where banks would make \nrisky loans to avoid paying higher interest rates--a behavior known as \n``moral hazard.''\n  Some have argued that the banks will not engage in risky behavior \nbecause they will remain liable for the underlying debt. We know that \ncertainly was not the case with the mortgage crisis that got us into \nthis economic mess in the first place. So in the final analysis, the \npossibility that this program could lead to poor lending decisions is \nsomething that, in the long run, will not help borrowers, lenders, or \nour overall financial system.\n  Incidentally, proponents of the lending fund highlight that several \nmajor banking associations support this initiative. Well, that would \nnot be surprising. Who would not support receiving millions upon \nmillions of dollars from the Federal Government at a 5-percent interest \nrate that could be reduced all the way to 1 percent? While I am in no \nway questioning the bankers' motives, I do point out that they are not \nviewing this from a perspective of objective third parties.\n  Moreover, it does not alleviate my concerns, and that is, obviously, \nthe public's interests when it comes to issuing more than $30 billion \nof taxpayer funds.\n  Another key concern of mine is about the cost of the administration's \nlending fund. I am very apprehensive about whether Congress has taken \ninto full consideration the program's true cost to the taxpayers. The \nprevious scores for the Small Business Lending Fund are convoluted, to \nsay the least. I say this because there are three different \nmethodologies that the Congressional Budget Office has discussed when \nscoring various versions of the lending fund--specifically, the Federal \nCredit Reform Act of 1990 estimates, cash-based estimates, and fair \nvalue basis estimates. So those are the three different methodologies.\n  In the House version that was reported by the House Committee on \nFinancial Services, the lending fund was scored by the Congressional \nBudget Office as costing taxpayers $1.4 billion. That level was \ndetermined by using the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 scoring. That \nFederal Credit Reform Act methodology is used when there is a \ndisbursement of funds by the government to a non-Federal borrower under \na contract that requires the repayment of such funds. In other words, \nthe Federal Credit Reform Act methodology is used when scoring loans.\n  After this score was released, the House modified the lending fund to \neliminate a requirement that the funds be repaid. Of course, there is \nevery intent that the funds will be repaid, and in an effort to make \nthis certain, the dividend rate that banks pay rises to a punitive 9 \npercent after 4\\1/2\\ years. But there is no absolute requirement to \nrepay the loan.\n  Well, this change had two effects: First, it allowed the banks to \ntreat the money it receives as an investment as opposed to a loan and \ntherefore to count the funds as tier 1 capital, the core measure of the \nbank's financial strength. Second, it allowed Congress to claim that \nthese are not loans, although for all intents and purposes they are, so \nthat the bill can be scored under a more favorable cash-based estimate.\n  Once these adjustments were made, CBO issued another score that \nexamined the lending fund as revised. The lending fund provision we are \ndiscussing today remains virtually identical, for scoring purposes, to \nhow it was in that revised version that passed the House. That score is \nbased on a cash-based estimate rather than the Federal Credit Reform \nAct because the funds were no longer considered as loans. Under a cash-\nbased estimate, CBO listed the official score for the lending fund as \nraising $1.1 billion over 10 years. So this is the official score that \nhas been touted by proponents of the lending fund. However, what they \nfail to mention is that very same CBO score stated that ``Alternately, \nthe potential costs of the [Small Business Lending Fund] under [the \nHouse legislation] can be measured using procedures similar to those \nspecified by [the Federal Credit Reform Act] but adjusted for market \nrisk--as is specified by law for estimating the cost of the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program.'' This was referring to a fair value basis \nestimation. CBO goes on to note that when measured in this manner, the \nscore would be a $6.2 billion loss.\n\n  Incidentally, to ensure accurate accounting, the legislation that \ncreated TARP required that it be scored using a fair value estimate. So \nin that case, it would cost--if you were to use the same estimate--it \nwould be a $6.2 billion loss as opposed to a $1.1 billion gain in \nrevenues, as the pending amendment suggests.\n  So putting this all together, we have the Federal Credit Reform Act \nscore which highlights that if these were treated as loans--which for \nall intents and purposes they are--this program would cost taxpayers \naround $1.4 billion. But because of a change to not technically or \nofficially require that the funds be repaid, it is now scored under \ndifferent methodology, on a cash\n\n[[Page S6159]]\n\nbasis, as a $1.1 billion revenue raiser, which is what the underlying \npending amendment does. Moreover, CBO expressed that if it were scored \non a fair value basis, the program would score as costing taxpayers \n$6.2 billion.\n  What does CBO state about which of the three scoring methods is more \ncomprehensive? In the score, it states:\n\n       Estimates prepared on a ``fair-value'' basis include the \n     cost of the risk that the government has assumed; as a \n     result, they provide a more comprehensive measure of the cost \n     of the financial commitments than estimates done on a \n     [Federal Credit Reform Act] basis or on a cash basis.\n\n  So I ask the question, when I hear colleagues claim this is a $1.1 \nbillion revenue raiser, is that accurate? Shouldn't we be concerned \nthat this may not truly be the investment they are claiming? And \ncritically, has all of this been taken into consideration when weighing \nthe effects of this program on the Federal budget and when evaluating \nthe efficacy of this program and utilizing it as an offset in the \nunderlying legislation?\n  So I am concerned with various aspects of this pending amendment that \ncreates this lending facility for more than $3 billion. In my \nconversations with Treasury officials, I stressed how critical it was \nto reach out to colleagues on both sides of the political aisle prior \nto having introduced this piece of legislation and before advancing and \nchampioning it here on the floor of this Senate to obtain input on how \nto devise lending funds in a way that would address the concerns I have \nraised and to structure it in a way that could achieve broad bipartisan \nsupport. Unfortunately, that did not happen, and this, of course, \nproduces the amendment that is pending here today.\n  Also in my conversations with Treasury officials, I was under the \nimpression this was going to be addressed through the Senate Banking \nCommittee. That was the other issue I raised. I think, after all, given \nthe fact that this is a banking initiative--it is the lending of more \nthan $30 billion to commercial banks across this country--clearly the \nSenate Banking Committee should have been involved in examining this \nissue, that it should have been thoroughly reviewed and vetted and \nwhatever objections existed on both sides of the aisle could have been \nexamined and hopefully resolved. I would have been happy to have had an \nopportunity to discuss this issue in a way that could have alleviated \nand addressed these concerns.\n  Let's not forget this is a brand new program, the nature and \nmagnitude of which is more than $30 billion, which justifies a thorough \nevaluation and certainly those that have been raised by the \nCongressional Budget Office in the variety of methodologies that can \nproduce either a $6.2 billion loss or a $1.1 billion revenue increase.\n  The point is we are not using a true, accurate estimate of what this \nlending facility will ultimately cost the American taxpayers. If you \nwould use a similar methodology as they did in TARP--which this is a \nTARP facsimile in terms of duplication and a reflection of TARP--then \nclearly you have to use the same method of addressing how this \nlegislation either is costing the taxpayers money or is raising \nrevenues for the taxpayer.\n  It is clear, if you use the fair cash basis estimate, the fact is, it \nwould lose the taxpayers money because you have to take into account \nall the risks that will be involved during the life of the loan, and \nthat is totally excluded on the estimate and the analysis of the method \nthat was used in the pending amendment.\n  I outline all of these concerns because I do think it is important \nfor my colleagues to consider very carefully the implications and the \nramifications of this lending facility. It is a new program. It is \nsimilar to TARP. And it is not just my saying so; as I said, it is the \ninspector general who oversees TARP, the Congressional Oversight Panel \nthat oversees TARP, which have all expressed that it has similar and \nequivalent features to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that we have \njust terminated in the financial regulatory reform program. It is a \nconcern, and again, it is what the TARP experts call an extension of \nTARP. They call this lending fund an extension of TARP because it has \nall of the components of TARP.\n  So I think we should be very circumspect and hesitant about utilizing \na similar program at a time in which we have to minimize the expansive \nnature of government programs in the spending that occurs here in the \nSenate, in the overall Congress, and on the part of government. I think \nit is important.\n  I have heard that when it comes to the TARP program, that money was \ndistributed to small and medium-sized institutions. But according to \nthe Congressional Oversight Panel, by December 31, 2009--which was the \ndeadline for Treasury's capital purchases--20 percent of all TARP funds \ndid go to small and medium-sized institutions and 98 percent of all \nrecipient institutions were small and medium-sized institutions.\n  It is not whether a bank is good and that is why we should lend this \nmoney. Obviously, there are excellent community banks that do a great \njob; they did not contribute to the problem all across America. It is \nreally a question as to whether this is good policy. That is the bottom \nline. Is this good policy? It raises a number of questions. It raises \nthe specter that we are really recreating TARP in another manner; it is \njust directed to different institutions. I think we have to be very \ncareful and cautious and prudent at this time.\n\n  Is there another way to extend the lending capacity of the Federal \nGovernment? Yes, there is. It is through the small business lending \nprograms which I talked about earlier, and the majority leader has \nincluded some of the provisions that I and the chair recommended, which \nis to increase the guarantee rates that have demonstrated their \neffectiveness, that have demonstrated their workability. They work. \nThey have increased lending across this country by more than 90 percent \nand, in my State, 236 percent. It has demonstrated its capacity for \nworking. So why not use those models we have adopted in the past and \nthat have proven their effectiveness?\n  I think that is what it is all about. How much can we do? Well, we \nknow we are limited in terms of what we have as far as deficits and the \nnational debt is concerned. So I think we have to be very prudent about \nhow we extend taxpayer dollars.\n  I have a great deal of concern in terms of, No. 1, not only spending \nthe $30 billion but the cost to the taxpayers if we use an accurate, \nrealistic measurement similar to what CBO had indicated and similar to \nwhat was used in TARP; and, No. 2, how that legislation works because \nit creates a perverse incentive. It increases the interest rates to \nthose banks that don't increase their small business lending but \ndecreases it for those that do. So we do encourage the prospects of \nmoral hazard and the likelihood that poor, risky loans might be made \nbecause of the fact that their interest rates will be reduced as a \nresult. So I think we have to be circumspect about that.\n  I hope we do not accept this lending facility because I do believe it \ndoes raise serious and significant concerns and that it is duplicative \nof TARP. I think we need to be moving in a different direction in this \ncountry. Also, there are a number of issues that have been raised that \ncannot be addressed. I hope we could, rather, build upon the underlying \namendment, the substitute amendment to be offered by the majority \nleader; allow for some amendments from both sides of the political \naisle so we can strengthen the legislation that is before us with \nrespect to providing incentives, tax breaks, and tax relief to small \nbusinesses that rightfully deserve those initiatives so we can incent \nthem to create jobs and to feel certain about their futures as well as \nthis country.\n  So with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have the floor by virtue of a \nprevious unanimous consent, but I understand the Senator from Louisiana \nwishes to say something briefly while Senator Snowe is still on the \nfloor. So I would be happy to yield. I would be happy if I could have \nthe floor returned to me at the conclusion of their exchange.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Thank you, Mr. President. I will just be 30 seconds.\n  I will respond to the comments made by my ranking member. She and I \nhave worked so closely together, and we just have a difference of \nopinion about this\n\n[[Page S6160]]\n\none particular piece of this bill, which is an important piece, so I \nwill respond to her comments in a minute.\n  I do agree with one thing she said, which is there could be other \namendments offered to maybe make this bill better. But I wish to ask my \nranking member through the Chair: This amendment is pending. We are \ngoing to vote on this amendment. This amendment could potentially get \n60 votes plus. If this amendment is voted in by the will of this \nSenate, even though she has reservations about it which she has \nbeautifully outlined--as she always does--but if this amendment is on \nthe line and let's say other amendments are offered and some pass and \nsome fail, is she inclined to vote for the bill? This is the only \nquestion I am going to ask her.\n  I will restate it. I said to the Senator from Maine, with whom I have \nworked very well--we have worked together, but we have a different view \nabout this particular program.\n  This is an amendment. I agree with her that amendments should be \noffered on this bill. I am hoping our leadership can work that out. If \nthis amendment is agreed to by 60 plus--we may get 70 votes for this \namendment; we don't know. We are picking up support for it. Although \nsome people are opposed, we are getting a good amount of support for \nit. Does the Senator from Maine believe she could then vote for the \nbill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, first of all, I hope that we could offer \nother amendments as well in addition to this. I think that is \ncritically important, first and foremost. Just as you have had an \nopportunity to offer an amendment, our hope is that on our side of the \naisle, we would have the ability and the prerogative to offer \namendments as well, and then we would look at it at the end of the day. \nObviously, I know the Senator from Louisiana feels very strongly about \nthis amendment. Obviously, I have some deep concerns. I certainly hope \nto support this legislation without this amendment, but if it is the \nwill of the Senate, then obviously I will continue to support it and \nhopefully we can move forward.\n  But I just think it is critically important with respect to this \nparticular initiative that a number of these issues have to be \naddressed. In the final analysis, when we are talking about $30 \nbillion, we can't do that lightly. Certainly, there are a number of \nissues that have been raised, ones that I have raised today, that \nclearly would have to be resolved in my estimation.\n  So I think from that standpoint I would have considerable concerns if \nit were left in that manner because I think it raises the costs to the \ntaxpayers indisputably.\n  Secondly, as to whether it is going to create risky behavior on the \npart of banks that are assuming this legislation, and if it does add \ncosts to the taxpayers, we have to think about that very carefully \nbecause, as my colleague knows, it does raise $1.1 billion, at least \naccording to your projections. But if we use a true realistic analysis, \nas we did with TARP, it would cost the taxpayers $6.2 billion.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for those comments. \nShe has left a window of opportunity open for, hopefully, some \ncompromises as we move through the amendments on this bill.\n  I yield back the floor to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, into this arena of discord and \ndivision, I rise to bring happy news. But first I ask unanimous consent \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Whitehouse pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3641 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to get back \nto the issue at hand, which is the small business bill, a job creation \nbill for America. It is something that many of us have worked on now \nfor over a year.\n  This bill has been developed by the work of many committees, both in \nthe House and the Senate, over a long period of time--primarily the \nSmall Business Committee and the Finance Committee, but also members \nfrom the Banking Committee and other committees that have been very \nmuch giving their input into this final product, which is in its final \nstage of passage.\n  This bill passed the House recently with these major components--a \nvery strong, targeted tax cut for small business. The Chair knows how \nimportant that is to small businesses in Minnesota that are watching \nadditional regulations come upon them--some for good reasons and some \nnot for good reasons. They are looking at an increased cost of capital. \nThey need tax relief. This bill provides that because of the good work \nthat has come out of the Finance Committee. Out of our Small Business \nCommittee, as the ranking member so eloquently expressed and outlined, \ncame some key measures in the bill that will improve the core programs \nof the SBA--an agency that is well supported here, particularly on the \nDemocratic side, and even with some Republicans who are supportive of \nthat agency. We believe that by strengthening their programs, we can be \nof some help to small business in America.\n  The debate right now is on the small business lending fund. I have \nthe greatest respect for my ranking member. We have a disagreement on \nthis particular provision. I want to respond specifically to some of \nthe criticisms of the program.\n  First of all, in her arguments against the program--but before I go \ninto that, I want to say how pleased I was to hear--and I believe that \nthe transcript will show this--that she said should this amendment get \non with 60-plus votes, and other amendments are potentially offered, \nshe is supportive of the bill. She has some specific suggestions as to \nhow this program could be made better, in her opinion. Maybe we can \ncome to some terms on that. I believe that, in good faith, on major \nbills such as this we should consider amendments, if we can. This is \none of them. This is the first amendment, a bipartisan amendment. \nSenator LeMieux and I are sponsoring this amendment along with over a \ndozen other colleagues. Senator Cantwell has been a tremendous advocate \nof this program, as have Senator Merkley from Oregon, Senator Murray \nfrom Washington, Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, Senator Nelson from \nFlorida, and Senator Schumer. They will come to the floor later this \nafternoon.\n  We have a growing list--bipartisan list--with Senator LeMieux and \nmyself and others supporting this small business lending program.\n  Let me try to answer specifically some of the concerns the Senator \nfrom Maine expressed. She said there have not been any hearings on this \nprogram. There were two House hearings on this initiative. I am going \nto get the date for the record. But there were two hearings on this \nspecific small business lending program. In one of those hearings, \nwhich I will submit--the House markup--there were more than 16 \namendments discussed and debated and offered. So I don't want to leave \nanyone with the impression that this small business lending program did \nnot receive congressional hearings. It has.\n  This has also received the attention of the Nation, because the \nPresident himself spoke about it in probably one of the most highly \npublicized speeches a President can give, which is the State of the \nUnion. He spoke to the small businesses of America and to the small \nhealthy banks, and said we are going to try to craft a program to be \nyour partner, to work with you, to get jobs created in America. So this \nhas been discussed in hundreds of press conferences, two congressional \nhearings, and any number of Senators--particularly I want to say, \nSenator Merkley, Senator Boxer, and Senator Cantwell have spent hours \nand hours and hours of their time--days, weeks and months--on this \nprovision, trying to work through any particular arguments that others \nmight have.\n  I want to put that argument to rest. There have been hearings. I have \nconducted in my committee probably a dozen hearings on related \nsubjects. I could fill this desk with paper, which I will not do and \nburden the clerk, with letters and comments and e-mails and testimony \nfrom hundreds of business owners who say they can't get capital. Our \nsmall businesses need help. We\n\n[[Page S6161]]\n\nwant to work with our community banks. They ask: Why are you sending \nall of this money to Wall Street? We need some help right here on Main \nStreet.\n  Also, the second argument the Senator from Maine made--and again, I \nhave the greatest respect for my ranking member, and she is a good \nfriend--is that she is concerned because the ``watchdog'' does not like \nthis program and thinks that it might be like TARP--the congressional \nwatchdogs. I don't know those watchdogs. I haven't met those watchdogs. \nI have seen their report, which is here, the May oversight report. I \ncould give you a few summaries from this--that they are not sure this \nprogram would work, but maybe we should give the benefit of the doubt \nto our community bankers, whom we know and trust, and our small \nbusinesses.\n  Ms. Snowe, the Senator from Maine, for whom I have a great deal of \nrespect, was speaking earlier about this provision that is pending \nbefore the Senate. It is a small business lending fund. Those of us \noffering this amendment believe it is time for us to get a focus on \nMain Street, to take our eyes off Wall Street for a minute and start \nfocusing on Main Street, our small community banks that are trying to \ndo their best to not only stay in business and make money, but they \nhelped in many ways to build the towns and communities, and they are \nwatching the businesses they lent money to close their doors. We would \nlike to be a better partner with these community banks, in a strategic \npartnership, to help get money to Main Street businesses.\n  Senator Snowe is saying she has some reservations about this \nprovision, and she outlined about five or six reasons she is not \nenthusiastic to support it. She said, one, that there were not enough \ncongressional hearings or were not any congressional hearings. For the \nrecord, there were two hearings on this issue in the House. They were \non May 18 and May 19. There were amendments offered. There was full \ntestimony and full debate. There have been congressional hearings on \nthis proposal. It is a relatively new proposal. It has been changed \nsince it was first talked about over a year and a half ago. In my view, \nit has been greatly improved, greatly strengthened. There have been \ncongressional hearings.\n  As I said, there has been a tremendous amount of attention on this \nissue. The President himself spoke about it in his State of the Union \nAddress. It has been debated in many different ways over the last year.\n  No. 2, the Senator said her analysis is that this bill will not save \n$1.1 billion; it will cost $6 billion. I do not know the analysis she \nconducted. I have great respect for her ability to analyze numbers and \nunderstand details. She is one of the best around here. All I can tell \nmy colleagues is, the group we go to, the agency, the authority on \nscoring that both Republicans and Democrats acknowledge as the \nauthority on scoring has said this bill will save $1.1 billion over 10 \nyears. That is the official CBO score that I am going to submit for the \nRecord. Other people can do a different analysis. That happens around \nhere sometimes. But when it comes down to the bottom line, the \nCongressional Budget Office is the only score that matters--Mr. \nPresident, you know that--and it says this bill earns, saves over 10 \nyears $1.1 billion.\n  The third argument the Senator made is that the congressional \nwatchdogs are not sure this program will work. This is their report. It \nis the May oversight report, ``Small Business Credit Crunch and the \nImpact of TARP.'' She put up a chart that said TARP-like. This is where \nthat came from.\n  The congressional oversight report said this program, in their view, \nmight be like TARP, and they are not sure there are any creditworthy \nbusinesses in America. That is what this watchdog said. They are not \nsure there are any businesses in America that are creditworthy to lend. \nThat might be their opinion, but I am a Senator from Louisiana. I am \nlistening to my small businesses. I see my small businesses. Many of \nthem are creditworthy, and they most certainly, with a little bit of \nhelp from local community banks infusing capital into their business, \ncould grow and expand.\n  Don't take my word for it. Let's see what Chairman Bernanke says. \nChairman Bernanke said--and this was on July 12, 2 weeks ago:\n\n       It seems clear that some creditworthy businesses, including \n     some whose collateral has lost value but whose cash flow \n     remains strong, have had difficulty obtaining credit that \n     they need to expand.\n\n  This is what the Chairman of the Fed says. He is obviously in a \nposition to see what banks are lending, what banks are not, what he is \nhearing, he is listening, he is traveling. Maybe there are a few \nwatchdogs and appointees in Washington who are having a little \ndifficulty figuring this out. But if you go to the real streets, if you \ngo to the Main Streets, if you get out of Washington and out of the \nbeltway, you are going to hear many hundreds, thousands of small \nbusinesses--and the Chairman himself said there are many creditworthy \nbusinesses out there that are having a hard time getting capital. That \nis what the small business lending program does.\n  Mr. President, you have heard it yourself. In all our States we are \nhearing that. Those were some of the arguments the Senator made. I was \npleased to hear her say that should the Senate vote on this amendment \nand get 60-plus votes--which, as we all know now is the way the Senate \noperates, not by a majority but by a supermajority--if 60 Senators say \nthis is something they want to do to help Main Street, to help small \nbusinesses--this is not about Wall Street, it is not about bailouts, it \nis not about troubled assets, it is not TARP, it is a small business \nlending fund, a strategic partnership with community banks--if 60 of us \nsay that, then she could be persuaded, if that is the will of the \nSenate, to pass the bill because there are other portions of this bill \nthat are extremely important as well.\n  I reiterate the important support we are picking up and to state for \nthe record again the testimony by many business owners. This one comes \nfrom Steve Gordon, president of INSTANT-OFF, Inc, in Clearwater, FL, \nnot from Louisiana but from Florida. He writes:\n\n       I am the owner of INSTANT-OFF. We make water-saving devices \n     for faucets. INSTANT-OFF replaces the aerator on any faucet, \n     and each unit can save up to 10,000 gallons a year. Our \n     market potential in the U.S. is estimated at 50 million units \n     and globally between 100 million and 200 million. We can \n     create 25 green jobs now. Twenty-five percent of those jobs \n     will be people with disabilities. None of these jobs will be \n     created without capital if I can't get the loan.\n\n  This is a common refrain, whether it is businesses in Florida, \nMinnesota or Louisiana. All they have are their credit cards which are \nmaxed out. All they have are their credit cards that charge them 12, \n16, 18, 24 percent. All these small businesses have is equity in their \nhouses or they did have some equity in their homes to borrow against to \nstart or maintain their businesses. They have seen their home equity \ndiminish considerably. The bank calls them and says: Joe, your house \nwas worth $400,000. We had it as collateral backing up your $200,000 \nline of credit or $300,000 line of credit. Now your home is half the \nvalue. I need to call your line of credit.\n  Are we not listening?\n  This small business lending fund, $30 billion, is going to help \nhealthy small banks of $10 billion or less. Goldman Sachs cannot even \napply for this money. AIG cannot apply for this money. National banks \ncannot apply for this money. These are community banks that we know, as \nthe Senator from Florida said, are at our Rotary Clubs, they are at our \nKiwanis Clubs, they are at our business owners banquets and luncheons. \nThese are the community bankers we know and trust and they know the \nbusinesses in their areas and we know them in our districts and in our \nStates.\n  The question is: Will the Republicans stand with a majority of \nDemocrats and vote for small businesses? This is the New York Times. \nThis is terrible. I see my friend from South Dakota in the Chamber. \nThis is a terrible headline for his party: ``Senate Democrats' Plan to \nAid Small Businesses Hits GOP Resistance.''\n  This is CQ Today: ``Democrats Plan to Make Republicans Vote on Small-\nBusiness Lending Fund.'' We did not have to have this vote. We have \nbeen forced to have this vote. Why would we even want to have a vote? \nAfter everything we have done to bail out Wall Street, we now come to a \nplan to lend\n\n[[Page S6162]]\n\nmoney to Main Street and I have to hear from Republican leaders who say \nno.\n  ``Senate Set to Pass Small-Business Bill.'' The reason we are in this \ndeadlock is because Republican leaders, such as my good friend, have \ndecided that we cannot, after all this, after TARP that was designed by \nPresident Bush, extended by President Obama to bail out Wall Street and \nlarge banks, now we have to hear: I don't know. We have either run out \nof energy or run out of will to help Main Street and small businesses.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Will the Senator from Louisiana yield? I ask the Senator \nto yield for a minute.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wanted to come to the Chamber. I was \nwatching on the floor last night, and I watched the Senator a little \nbit ago as I came out of a meeting. I am not scheduled to be here. But \nas a small businessperson all my life--my first business license was at \nage 14. My next big venture was at age 18. I have been in the vending \nbusiness, the real estate business, the developing business. I have \nbeen a restaurant owner. I can go through a shopping list. My wife owns \nfour retail stores, a small business woman. She started her business \nselling smoked salmon on a street corner in downtown Anchorage. She now \nemploys 30-plus people, multiple stores, and works to engage other \nyoung, small business people to move forward.\n  There is no question that the legislation the Senator from Louisiana \nhas been working on--the broader issue on small businesses but \nspecifically the loan fund--is critical. She is right.\n  The Senator's point about how the big banks got theirs and left the \nsmall business community literally, not on Main Street, not even close \nto Main Street--they were kicked off Main Street. I thank Senator \nLandrieu for making this a big issue, pushing forward on it, and also \nworking with Republicans to try to bring them over. It sounds as if she \ngot one so far. I think he has made the right decision. He has seen the \nimpact on small businesses in his communities.\n  The Senator from Louisiana was on fire last night, I have to say. She \nwas making the point that this is the time to stand for small \nbusinesses because they are the ones that are going to rebuild this \neconomy, they are the ones that are going to hire people not next year, \nnot 3 years from now because they want to hoard their profits. They are \ngoing to, as the economy recovers, hire immediately.\n  The small businessperson who has two or three people working for them \nand their business increases 10, 20 percent, the odds are they are \ngoing to hire someone the next day.\n  That is the power of this lending act, this amendment that is \ncritical. I want to emphasize that point and thank my colleague \nbecause, as one of the few small business people in this body, one who \nhas had to knock on those bankers' doors to try to get a few dollars \nout of them to take a dream and make it reality, or one who has seen \nsmall business and helped them expand, I again thank you. This is going \nto have the biggest bang. As to the $30 billion, no one is forcing it \nonto these community banks either; it is an option. If they want to \nhelp small businesses--I know many come to your office, come to my \ncolleagues on the Democratic side--$30 billion leverages to $300 \nbillion. This is a real economic boon and a real opportunity, and is \ngoing to build small businesses.\n  I thank my colleague for giving me these couple of minutes. I thank \nthe Senators from Florida for teaming up and also recognizing the value \nof this.\n  Mrs. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from Alaska. I am extremely \ngrateful to both Senators from Florida, Senator LeMieux and Senator \nNelson, for their support. We all come here as members of political \nparties. Some of us come as Independents. But at the end of the day we \nare here to represent our States. We are here to represent the people \nwho sent us. These Florida Senators are moving around Florida, as my \nfriend is moving around Alaska, as I am moving around Louisiana. We \nknow you cannot go anywhere in this country, from Alaska to Florida--\nand that is about as far as we can get, from Alaska to Florida--and not \nhear of the pain and the fear. It is not just pain, it is downright \nfear on the part of a small businessperson who does not know when their \nnext paycheck will come.\n  Every Monday morning they go to their small business with three or \nfour employees, they turn the lights on, they crank up the computer, \nand they look in the eyes of people with whom they have worked shoulder \nto shoulder and they are thinking, Can I pay them this week?\n  Is anybody not hearing this? I am hearing it. The Senator from Alaska \nis hearing it. The Senators in Florida are hearing it.\n  What are we going to do, close our ears and walk away, go home for \nthe August recess and say I am sorry, we can't do anything, after we \nhave spent a year and a half since President Obama has been elected, \nsending billions of dollars to Wall Street, billions of dollars to the \nautomakers, and now it comes time to spend $30 billion--not $700 \nbillion, like TARP, not the billions that went to the automobile \ndealers--$30 billion? It is a lot of money, but not relative to that--\nto our community bankers whom we know by name. Clyde White was in my \noffice yesterday. Bob Tailor was in my office yesterday. I know these \nmen and women. I trust them. These are healthy banks. They did not have \nderivatives in their portfolios. They did not lend to people they did \nnot know. They did not do the subprime lending.\n  Now it comes time to help them and I have to hear from Republicans \nthat we cannot go there because it might look and smell like TARP. Are \nthey afraid of their own shadows? I don't care what it feels like. It \nis what it is. This is not TARP.\n  The newspapers are starting to say, ``GOP Resistance.'' I am not even \nsure why the Republican Party would be against this. Someone said to \nme: Mary, maybe it is because they don't want anything to succeed so \nthings will be so bad.\n  I said I can't imagine that.\n  We have to do what we can. I understand other people say the other \nparts of the bill are very good, they are very important. Let me tell \nyou about the big picture. There are two other parts of this bill. One \nis a $12 billion tax cut part. The other is at the most, if the \nprograms that Olympia and I put together, and we did it as a team--if \nthey work, the experts, say that it will leverage $30 billion in \nlending--$30 billion. So we have $12 billion in tax cuts, $30 billion--\nthat is $42 billion. That is a lot of money, two parts.\n  This part, if this part works--which is why I am fighting for it--it \nis $30 billion but it will leverage $300 billion. This is a big part of \nthis bill and I am not going to leave it on the cutting room floor \nwithout a real hard fight.\n  Yes, there are three parts. There are two important but small parts \nand then there is one core big part. For some reason the Republican \nParty leadership is saying we don't like this big core part. We want \nyou to go with these two parts.\n  I am saying, you know what, I am not going to do that without a \nfight, so this is the fight. This is the debate.\n  I want to say I am very thrilled to hear we are winning because we \njust got a statement from George Voinovich, who was not on the \namendment, that says:\n\n       There is real need out there to provide some money to some \n     of these businesses and get the banks back involved. We've \n     got to start doing something. Voinovich dismissed claims by \n     fellow Republicans, including Snowe and Republican Leader \n     McConnell, that the lending program resembles TARP because it \n     involves Treasury Department loans to banks. Republicans have \n     named it TARP, Jr. ``I don't buy that,'' Voinovich says. \n     ``It's just messaging.''\n\n  Thank goodness we have some Senators who can cut through, who are not \nafraid, who are very direct. Voinovich is one of them.\n  I think we are going to win this fight. I don't know when the vote is \ngoing to be but I believe we are going to win because the facts are on \nour side.\n  Having said that, I want to go back to some things that Senator Snowe \nsaid because she is one of the most studious and reliable people. \nPeople do follow her. She gave a very good presentation--even though I \nam opposed to her position.\n  I want to say there were three arguments. There were six she made. \nThere were three I want to counter right now. She said there were no \ncongressional hearings. There were two in the House.\n\n[[Page S6163]]\n\n  She said her estimate was it would cost $6 billion. That might be \nfine, I don't know. But the only estimate that counts is from CBO and \nit is $1.1.\n  She said the report of the watchdog--whoever they are, and I am going \nto find out, May oversight watchdog, said they are not sure the program \nis going to work. But the Chairman of the Fed, who should know--he is \nfollowing this pretty closely--said--and I will provide that to the \nRecord--said that it is clear, on July 12, ``it seems clear to me that \nsome creditworthy businesses, including some whose collateral has lost \nvalue but whose cash flow remains strong, have difficulty obtaining the \ncredit they need to expand and in some cases even continuing to \noperate.''\n  Those are three rebuttals to specific criticism.\n  I also want to say I am happy to hear that if this amendment does get \non the bill--there will be other Senators coming down to talk about \nthis later this afternoon--that there might be a willingness, if \npotentially other amendments could, potentially, be offered, to keep \nthis in this important bill. This is an important piece of this bill. \nIt is not something that we should leave on the cutting room floor. The \nHouse has already voted on this. The President spoke about it in the \nState of the Union. Every small community banking organization, as well \nas the ABA, the American Bankers Association, supports it.\n  They didn't support TARP. They didn't even like TARP. They lobbied \nagainst TARP.\n  The big banks liked TARP because they got all the money, but the \ncommunity banks--my community bank hated TARP. They didn't want \nanything to do with it. Do you think they would write me letters of \nsupport? They were furious with me when I voted for it. Do you think \nthey would write me letters of support, which I have, saying they are \nfor this program if it was like TARP? I don't think so.\n\n  I trust my community bankers. I trust my small business people. I \ndon't know what to say about a congressional oversight group that says \nthey are not sure it will work. Heavens, maybe we should give them the \nbenefit of the doubt.\n  That is what we are talking about. Again, I hope this will be a \nbipartisan bill. ``Community Bankers Support Small-Business Jobs \nBill.''\n  ``Senate Set to Pass Small-Business Jobs Bill.''\n  These are headlines this morning. This headline, ``Democrats plan to \nmake Republicans vote.''\n  I didn't want anybody to have to vote on this. I didn't believe we \nshould vote on it because it makes so much sense, but, because the \nRepublicans want us to vote on it, we are going to vote on it. I \nwouldn't want to vote against small business if I were them, but maybe \nthey do.\n  ``Senate Democrats Plan Aid to Small Businesses Hits GOP \nResistance.''\n  These are not good headlines for the other side. But we will see how \ndebate goes. And let me put up the independent bankers. These are 5,000 \ncommunity banks. We have them in all of our States: Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America.\n  Senator McConnell came to the floor today and said he doesn't like \nthis program. He thinks it might be like TARP. I think I have explained \nthat today, why it is not like TARP. But let's see what the letters to \nSenator McConnell's office are saying. This is a letter to Majority \nLeader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell from the Independent \nCommunity Bankers of America:\n\n       On behalf of the nearly 5,000 Members of the Independent \n     Community Bankers of America, I write to urge you to retain \n     the Small Business Lending Fund in the Small Business Jobs \n     Act. The SBLF is the core component of this legislation and \n     the provision that holds the most promise for small business \n     job creation in the near term. Failure to even consider the \n     SBLF in the Senate would be a missed opportunity that our \n     struggling economy cannot afford.\n       The nation's nearly 8,000 community banks are prolific \n     small business lenders with the community contacts and \n     underwriting expertise to get credit flowing to the small \n     business sector. The SBLF is a bold, fresh proposal that \n     would provide another option for community banks to leverage \n     capital and expand small businesses credit. The $30 billion \n     fund could be leveraged to provide as much as a $300 billion \n     line of credit.\n\n  We have letter after letter. Let me say one thing because I \nanticipate my good friend from South Dakota is going to be here to \nspeak against it so I want to say this so he can hear me. If the \nDemocrats had taken the same $30 billion--which we had some support on \nour side to do direct lending. You know the difference. We could have \ngiven $30 billion to the Treasury through SBA. We could have done \ndirect lending. There is a lot of support for that. I have letters in \nmy office that say don't give it to the banks because we are not even \nsure we trust the small banks. We know we don't trust the large banks. \nNobody is giving us money. We think the government could give us money.\n  I said, as a Democrat I might be open to that but I don't think I \ncould get one Republican vote if we did a direct lending program \nbecause they will stand up and say: There you go again, giving money to \nthe government to lend.\n  So I say to my people who are dying for this direct lending: No, we \ncan't do direct lending because I don't think we could get one \nRepublican vote.\n  I said: You know what might work is if we let the private sector do \nthe lending because they worship at the altar of the private sector on \nevery bill, every day. So I say to the people over here: I know that \nyou think direct lending would be better. It might be better. I have \nletters from business owners who are actually mad at their community \nbanks because their community banks are pulling, so they are saying, \n``Senator, don't give the money to the community banks,'' but I am \ntrying to find a compromise. So I think, OK, we will structure the \nprogram so we go to the private sector to lend.\n  They still come to the floor opposed to it. So the only conclusion I \ncan come up with is they don't want to lend money to small business \nbecause they either don't think small business needs it, they don't \ntrust their community bankers to do it, they don't trust the private \nsector to do it, or they don't think there is any demand out there. I \nam going to point again to the NFIB study, which is the most \nconservative organization in America, that says in their own study that \n45 percent of the businesses--their own members report--are not able to \nget all their capital.\n  I don't know what else to say. Maybe that headline is correct: ``GOP, \nTemporarily Lost Their Way.'' I don't know.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire on the floor. Since I have the \nfloor, I want to engage her in a colloquy on this in a moment, because \nthis is a very important issue. She has been extremely helpful as a \nmember of the committee.\n  While she is getting ready, I want to go back to this argument again \nbefore others come to the floor. Maybe they want to speak against it. \nAgain, let me ask people listening: What would you do? How would you \nfashion a bill if you have one group of people who hate the government \nso bad they won't let the government do anything and you have some \npeople over here who want the government to do everything? So we \ncrafted--Senator Cantwell, Senator Klobuchar, myself--something in the \nmiddle, that says OK, we will use the SBA. We will go through the \nprivate sector. We have to help our small businesses, and we can't \nbuild the kind of coalition we need.\n  So I guess the opponents just say we should not do anything, that we \nshould just sort of go home and everybody go get ready for the election \nand pat ourselves on the back for sending money to Wall Street, sending \nmoney to big banks. But when it came to helping our Main Street banks \nand our small businesses, we just walked away.\n  Now, again, this bill has three components. It has a small business \ntax cut, $12 billion of tax cuts. It is not the estate tax cut. It is \nnot the top rate tax cuts. But it is zero percent--you pay zero percent \non capital gains earned if you invest in a small business. It \naccelerates depreciation for small businesses. It is $12 billion \ndirectly in the pocket, not of General Motors, not of General Electric, \nnot of IBM, not big companies all over the world and countries, but \nsmall companies, $12 billion dollars of tax cuts.\n  So I do not want to hear anybody from the other side saying Democrats \nare not for tax cuts. We have $12 billion in this bill. We have \nstrengthened some government programs. I know the people on the other \nside do not think government can do anything well. But\n\n[[Page S6164]]\n\ngovernment can do some things well. The Small Business Administration \nis well run and well resourced and supported. It can do very good work \nfor our people.\n  But there is a private sector component. There is a private sector \ncomponent; that is, depending on our community bankers, that we know. \nWe know their names. We know where they go to church. We know where \nthey live. They know the people in our communities. We can do a private \nsector approach, giving $30 billion that will leverage $300 billion to \nget out to America to create jobs.\n  So I hope we will take this opportunity. The Senator from South \nDakota has been patient, and he deserves his time to speak, even though \nhe will be on the opposite side. So I am going to relinquish the floor \nfor a few minutes and reserve the right to come back.\n  Let me inquire of the Senator, how long might you need?\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, let me, if I might through the Chair, inquire from \nthe Senator from Louisiana, is there any sort of a time agreement for \nthis discussion?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. There is not. But we could enter into one, if you would \nlike. I would be happy to yield up to 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, I do not think--if there is no time agreement, then \nour side, I presume, would have an opportunity to speak. I do not think \nthere would be any limitation on that.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Then I will continue to speak since I have the floor.\n  I am going to just continue to talk about the bill. I see other \ncolleagues who are coming down to speak about it. I would just like to \nread some of the letters that have come to my office supporting the \nprovision.\n  This is from the National Bankers Association:\n\n       Dear Senator Landrieu: I write this letter to you and the \n     Members of the United States Senate in support of the \n     LeMieux-Landrieu amendment. In no segment of the U.S. economy \n     is the need for lending to small business more urgent than in \n     the distressed communities that our banks struggle to serve \n     every day. This recession has hit these communities the \n     hardest. The number of home foreclosures has wreaked havoc on \n     these communities. The small businesses that are the engines \n     for economic activity desperately need access to capital. The \n     U.S. economy will begin to see real growth when small \n     businesses get access to the capital that creates the \n     opportunities for prudent lending. This bill, with your \n     amendment, is a vitally important piece of legislation.\n\n  I would like to say that again, underlined. They do not have to write \nletters like this to me. But it says: This bill, with your amendment--\nit could have just said: This bill without your amendment, or, this \nbill with no reference to the amendment. But they go to the effort to \nsay:\n\n       This bill, with your amendment, is a vitally important \n     piece of legislation. Its swift passage will send a powerful \n     message through the U.S. electorate that Congress is \n     aggressively working with small business to create real \n     economic opportunities and to spur job growth where it is \n     needed the most.\n\n  Why would they write letters like this? Do you think I sit in my \noffice and draft them and then ask them to send them to me? I do not \nwrite these words. My staff does not write these words. They are \nwriting them themselves because what they are saying is, people in \nAmerica are not hearing anything from Congress about small business and \nsmall banks.\n  All we hear about every single day is big business and big banks. \nThis bill gives them hope that we are hearing them, that we are \nlistening, that we are not isolated, and we are trying. This program \nmay not be perfect. But, heavens, it has gotten two congressional \nhearings. It has gotten a positive score. It has gotten endorsements \nfrom every bankers association and almost every small business \nassociation we have.\n  I see my colleague is here. Let me just read one more letter. I know \nshe may have a question or two for me.\n  This is the National Association for the Self-Employed. We talk a lot \nabout small business. Let me be very clear with people listening. There \nare 27 million small businesses in America. If anybody wanted to know, \nthere are 27 million small businesses; 20 million of that 27 million \nare self-employed. That means there is just one person--it could be a \nself-employed lawyer, doctor, accountant, et cetera, et cetera, self-\nemployed fisherman, self-employed social worker, or psychiatrist.\n  The small business self-employed, they really struggle because it is \njust them. So these small businesses we are talking about literally are \njust from one person, the self-employed; 5 people, 10 people, 20 \npeople. We lose sight of them. They are the ones creating the jobs. \nThey are the ones taking the most risk. They are the ones that have \nhocked their house, their boat, their car to start the business. They \nare the ones that depend on this business to work because if it does \nnot, none of their kids go to college. Do you understand that risk? \nThese are the businesses I am fighting for.\n  In these difficult economic climates in which traditional lending \ninstitutions have clamped down, the self-employed and microbusiness \ncommunities have been hit particularly hard, left without essential \nsources of operating capital.\n  Now more than ever, America's self-employed community, representing \n78 percent of all small business in the United States, needs access to \nadditional credit to weather this economic storm and to grow their \nbusiness.\n  The National Small Business Association, America's oldest small \nbusiness advocacy, urges us to support the small jobs bill of 2010 and \nthe LeMieux-Landrieu small business lending fund.\n  After bailing out our big banks and Wall Street, Congress finally has \nthe opportunity to help Main Street. We are going to have opposition \nfrom some people on the other side? The small business lending fund is \nnot a bailout for sinking banks. It is a lifeline to small business \nowners struggling to stay afloat in turbulent economic seas.\n  It is not TARP 202. The small business lending fund is not aimed at \nhelping small banks. It helps the small businesses themselves. The fund \nis designed to help strong community banks. There is a strength test to \nparticipate. The program is not designed to prop up failing firms; it \nmakes loans to solid small businesses struggling to get credit. If we \ncannot do that in this Congress, I do not know what to do.\n  I ask the Senator, my good friend, perhaps she has some stories or \nshe can think of some things that she could add to this debate to help \nme try to explain and to get through because, obviously, we are not----\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I object to the yielding of time to another \nSenator. This Senator has been waiting for 45 minutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer.) The Senator from Louisiana can \nonly yield for a question. So if the Senator from New Hampshire has a \nquestion, she may ask the Chair.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Through the Chair, I would like to ask the Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized \nfor a question to the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I would like to begin by thanking the Senator who is \nchair of the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Committee for her \nleadership and her work to put together, with Senator LeMieux, this $30 \nbillion small business lending fund. I know the Senator made some \nreference to this, but I just wanted to point out and ask her because \nthere has been a lot of criticism about this fund as being so-called, \nthe son of TARP.\n  I voted against TARP because I did not think we ought to be doing \nthat. I think this is not another Wall Street bailout, that this is an \neffort to help small businesses. I would just like to ask Senator \nLandrieu whether she agrees with me that this is not a bailout; that, \nin fact, this is an effort to help Main Street not Wall Street; and \nthat we need to do this so we can make sure our small businesses get \nthe credit and the capital they need to operate?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator for that question. I would like to \nrespond. I do want to be courteous to the other Members who are on the \nSenate floor, and if we could get some kind of timeframe, then I would \nbe very open to that.\n  But let me respond to this question. It is an important one because \nthe Senator did not vote for TARP. The Senator from New Hampshire did \nnot vote for TARP. Yet she is here as a cosponsor of this amendment. So \nit gives us some idea that Members who did not\n\n[[Page S6165]]\n\nvote for the Troubled Asset Relief Program understand this is \ncompletely different. It is for healthy banks, not failing banks. It is \nfor small banks, not large banks. It is for Main Street, not Wall \nStreet.\n  So the Senator is absolutely correct. I know she wants some \nadditional time to speak on the bill. So I would like to ask my good \nfriend from South Dakota, what is his intention? If we can get--I would \nlike to ask unanimous consent that we just go back and forth, 10 \nminutes each, if that would be OK?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would say, through the Chair, to the Senator from \nLouisiana, I do not have an objection to some sort of a time agreement. \nBut the Senator from Louisiana has been speaking now since I have been \nhere, for close to an hour. It would seem to me that if we are going to \ndo this in an equitable way, some speakers on our side would have a \ncomparable amount of time to make our points with regard to the \namendment of the Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. That would be fine. No one was down here except you \nhave been waiting for a while. So I am perfectly happy, through the \nChair, to say, if we can come to some agreement, maybe the next 20 \nminutes on their side, then 10 minutes here, and another 20 there, \nuntil we catch up, would be fine with me for the next hour. So 20 \nminutes, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 10 minutes, and then we will continue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the proposal? The \nSenator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. If I can say through the Chair, to the Senator from \nLouisiana, I was just conferring to see what speakers we have on our \nside. I think Senator Shelby is coming down. I do not know long he \nintends to speak, but I would like to speak for up to 15 minutes or \nthereabouts. My assumption is that he would want to speak for a good \namount of time.\n  So we might want to expand the amount of time the Senator has \nsuggested in terms of the agreement.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Fifteen minutes each? Through the Chair, may I suggest \nthat we just go back and forth 15 minutes each, until the leadership \ndecides how they want to proceed. I think that would be fair. I know I \nhave been speaking.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the proposal made by the \nSenator from Louisiana? The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Let me just say, if I could, to the Senator from \nLouisiana, I do not have any objection, I think, if we got back on a \n15-minute--the ping-ponging back and forth one side to the other. I do \nthink, however, the Senator from Louisiana has spent a good amount of \ntime talking for nearly, since I got over here, an hour. If we might \nhave an opportunity to catch up a little bit.\n  So perhaps we could have a half hour for our side, and then if there \nare speakers who want to come down after that, they could go 15 and 15.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I would agree to that. If the Senator wants to have 30 \nminutes now, then we will alternate, through the Chair, 15 and 15. That \nis fine. But I would say that this Senator has been on the floor of the \nSenate all morning. I have given up a lot of other meetings that I \ncould have been at because this issue is very important.\n  There was no one else on the floor most of the time when I was \nspeaking. So I appreciate that. But I think this issue is important \nenough. I ask unanimous consent, the Senator has said 30 minutes on \ntheir side right now, and then we will go 15, 15 for the next couple of \nhours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. I do appreciate the effort that is being made by the \nSenator from Louisiana to assist small businesses around this country. \nFrankly, there are many provisions in this bill I think people on both \nsides agree with.\n  I have, as a member of the Small Business Committee, a number of \nthese provisions that I have supported in the past. I think many of my \ncolleagues probably have as well. So to suggest for a minute that the \nRepublicans are somehow standing in the way of passing this small \nbusiness bill is just wrong. There is clearly a lot of Republican \nsupport for many of the provisions that are included in this bill.\n  In fact, I will mention the increased loan size and guarantees for \nSBA (7)(A) and 504 loans; temporary fee reductions for (7)(A) and 504 \nloans, updates to SBA's outdated size standards, and much needed tax \nrelief through measures such as bonus depreciation, section 179 \nexpensing, and allowing business credits against the alternative \nminimum tax, those are all things that there will probably be large \nbipartisan support for in the Senate. The issue we are having a debate \nabout now is whether the Senator from Louisiana should be able to amend \nthe underlying bill with a provision that would create a small business \nlending fund.\n\n  The point has been made by the Senator from Louisiana that somehow it \nis just Republicans who are opposed. The fact is, there were objections \nto that provision on both sides. That is the reason it is not in the \nbase bill. It was originally in the base bill. It was dropped from the \nbase bill at the request of the majority leader and the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, it is my understanding. This particular provision is \nnot only objected to by Republicans; there is Democratic opposition as \nwell, which is why it was once in the base bill and is now no longer in \nthe base bill and is being offered as an amendment to the bill by the \nSenator from Louisiana.\n  I rise in opposition to the amendment. I, in all likelihood, \ndepending on how it plays out, may very well end up supporting the \nbill. There are many provisions in here with which I agree. This \nparticular provision, however, is going to make a lot of Members \nuncomfortable. We can say this isn't TARP, but if it walks like a duck, \ntalks like a duck, and acts like a duck, it is a duck. This is TARP. \nAnybody who thinks for a minute they are voting for something that \nisn't TARP when they vote for this is, again, flat wrong. This is \nstructured precisely the way TARP was structured. It is designed to \navoid that label to encourage participation by banks, which I \nunderstand. I don't think there are many banks that would want to \nparticipate if they knew they were getting into TARP. But this is \nessentially TARP. It has been relabeled and renamed, but we can't get \naway from the basic fact that it continues to be an extension of TARP \nsimply to small businesses or to smaller lending institutions, the \nassumption for which the TARP was made available.\n  As to the capital purchase program under TARP, reading from the \nquarterly report of the special inspector general for TARP, it says \nthat of the 707 lending institutions that participated in the original \nTARP, 625 had assets of less than $100 million. I realize $100 million \nis still a lot of money. There are a lot of banks in my State that have \nnowhere close to that amount of assets. But if we take the total number \nof lending institutions that participated in TARP, which is 707, 625 of \nthose or more than 80 percent were banks with less than $100 million in \nassets. There was participation by smaller banks. It wasn't only the \nbig multibanks that were participating in the program. It was a lot of \nthese $100 million and smaller banks that were participating originally \nin TARP.\n  The other point that has been made is that somehow this is different \nin the sense that this is going to actually raise revenue for the \nFederal Government. The TARP, projections are, will cost Federal \ntaxpayers $127 billion when it is all said and done. We hope that is \nnot the case. We hope that number is smaller, but that is what the \nestimates are with regard to how much TARP will cost Federal taxpayers. \nThis particular $30 billion reincarnation of TARP, created specifically \nfor smaller lending institutions, it has been estimated by the CBO, \nwill actually generate a budget savings of $1 billion. How do they come \nat that? CBO, at the request in the House of Representatives, where \nthis originally passed, used a different accounting method in \ndetermining the cost or the budgetary impact of this version of TARP \nversus the original version.\n  The CBO also noted that if the accounting conventions that were used \nto consider the budgetary impact of the original TARP were applied to \nthis $30 billion TARP carve-out, it would cost Federal taxpayers or \nwould score $6 billion. Again, it is because this scored\n\n[[Page S6166]]\n\ndifferently. If this fund were scored as they scored TARP, which was on \na fair market basis adjusted for a market-risk basis, then it would \ncost $6 billion. This is being scored on a cash basis as raising over \n$1 billion. That is what the CBO is saying. If they used the same \naccounting conventions applied to the original TARP, this program would \nhave a budgetary impact of $6 billion, rather than the $1 billion \nsavings being reported by the proponents of the legislation.\n  I make that observation to point out that when people who are voting \nfor this think there may not be any consequence with regard to the \nfiscal impact this could have, they are not taking into consideration \nthe full picture. There was a change made in the way CBO scored the \noriginal TARP and the way they have scored this particular program. If \nwe use the same convention or the same accounting conventions applied \nto the original TARP to this TARP, we would be talking about a $6 \nbillion cost to taxpayers as opposed to $1 billion in savings.\n  It strikes me that there is great effort being made to convince \npeople this is not a TARP program. I wish to point to the White House's \ntalking points that admit that the ``program would be separate and \ndistinct from TARP to encourage participation'' and that ``the \nAdministration's proposal would encourage broader participation by \nbanks, as they would not face TARP restrictions.''\n  These restrictions include executive compensation rules, warrant \nrequirements, and a variety of other things. But my point is, this is \nthe same flawed structure. This is the same basic mechanism used to \ncreate the TARP. Most people here, Members on both sides, have great \napprehension about how TARP was used. Again, to Members who will be \nvoting for this particular reincarnation of TARP, if they didn't like \nvoting for TARP the first time, they probably should not be voting for \nthis. We are essentially doing the same thing, but we are purposely \nremoving some of the very safeguards created under the TARP.\n  There are better ways of helping small businesses. We have 9.5 \npercent unemployment. We are trying to encourage small businesses to \ncreate jobs. Yet here we are talking about going back to the old \nplaybook and trying to somehow make this look better and sound better \nand put different lipstick on it and say this is a new program, when it \nis essentially something we are all familiar with. If we want to help \nsmall businesses, we should get our foot off their throats. Let's get \nWashington's foot off the throats of small businesses.\n  Everything being done here in terms of public policy in the last year \nor year and a half is going to make it more difficult for small \nbusinesses to create jobs. We have passed a $1 trillion expansion of \nhealth care which imposes new mandates and taxes on small businesses. \nWe have passed a $1 trillion stimulus bill which has done very little \nto help small businesses. If we had been having this debate when the \nstimulus debate occurred, there might have been more support. But at \nthe time, a very small fraction of the total amount, about one-third of \n1 percent of the amount that was spent under the stimulus bill to try \nand grow the economy and create jobs, was actually directed at small \nbusinesses. It was a nonfactor in the debate during the stimulus. We \nspent $1 trillion, most of which has been used to create jobs in \nWashington, DC, in the Federal bureaucracy. We haven't done anything to \nprovide the incentive for small businesses to create jobs.\n  It is going to get worse because, as we all know, next year, the 2001 \nand 2003 income tax cuts expire, at which time, if no steps are taken, \nthe rates are going to go up on small businesses. The other side will \nargue that we will insulate and protect people under $250,000 from \nthese tax increases, $250,000 for a married couple and $200,000 if one \nis single. The point Members of this body need to remember is, 50 \npercent of small business income is taxed at those top two marginal \nincome tax rates. When we raise those top marginal income tax rates--\nthe 35 percent rate up to 39.6 percent and the 33 percent rate up to 36 \npercent--we are imposing tax increases on small businesses. That is \nwhat small businesses have to look forward to next year. It is no \nwonder small businesses are not creating jobs. We continue to pile \nthese new mandates, new taxes, new compliance and regulatory burdens on \nthem. We expect them to go out and create jobs.\n\n  Look at the proposal for energy, the cap-and-trade proposal. It would \nput a punishing new energy tax on small businesses. At every turn what \nwe see is Washington, DC, and the Congress taking steps detrimental to \njob creation and making it more difficult for the very small businesses \nthat are the economic engine of our society to create jobs.\n  There are some things in this legislation that are good. There are \nsome tax incentives for small businesses. We are talking about a \nprovision now, an amendment that would be added to this bill, a $30 \nbillion mini TARP which we have all seen work in the past. I don't \nthink anybody here would want to go down that path again, if they knew \nthat is what they were voting for. That is why this incredible effort \nis being made to relabel what this is. That is why they are changing \nthe language in describing this. But the fact is, we are talking about \nthe same thing.\n  I wish to read some quotes from the TARP congressional oversight \npanel, which is headed by the administration's rumored choice to head \nthe new Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and that is Elizabeth \nWarren. She has expressed skepticism that it will be effective in \nincreasing small business lending, the fund we are currently debating. \nShe says:\n\n       The small business lending fund looks uncomfortably similar \n     to TARP. Like the capital purchase program under TARP, the \n     small business lending fund injects capital into banks \n     assuming that an improved capital position will increase \n     lending, despite the lack of evidence that the capital \n     purchase program did.\n\n  That is a direct quote from this report by the congressional \noversight panel. She goes on to say that ``such a fund runs the risk of \ncreating moral hazard by encouraging banks to make loans to borrowers \nwho are not creditworthy.''\n  We have a lot of folks who have followed very closely what happened \nwith TARP who are expressing reservations about this particular lending \nprogram and how it might impact the Federal budget. If we use the same \nscoring conventions applied to the original TARP, it comes in at a cost \nof $6 billion as opposed to a savings of $1 billion. When we completely \nthrow away the accounting manual and use a different accounting \nconvention, we get a different result. But the risk still exists. The \nCBO has made that clear in their analysis. When we look at what the \ncongressional oversight panel says with regard to how this will \nresemble TARP, the risk they recognize inherent in that, as well as the \nlimited effectiveness of the original program in encouraging banks to \nparticipate, this is a path down which we should not go.\n  There are things in this bill that are good. There are things that \nwill attract bipartisan support in the Senate that Members on both \nsides are in favor of. But the reason this provision was stripped out \nwasn't because Republicans alone objected. There were Democratic \nobjections as well. It was taken out of the base bill. It is now being \noffered as an amendment for that reason. It is not Republicans who are \ntrying to stop us from doing things that will help small business. The \nbest thing the Senate can do to help small business is to quit putting \nnew mandates, new taxes, and new regulations on them. Then they will \nsee the kind of certainty they need to create jobs and get the economy \ngrowing again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, who controls the time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republicans control another 14 minutes 50 \nseconds at this point.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise to oppose the Landrieu amendment. \nOnly 1 day after the President signed the Dodd-Frank financial \nregulation bill into law, at that time proclaiming an end to taxpayer-\nfunded bailouts, we find ourselves debating another bailout bill on the \nfloor of the Senate. Just last week, we were told by the majority that \nthe mere passage of Dodd-Frank would help revive our damaged financial \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S6167]]\n\n  The bill was heralded as a thoroughly considered and comprehensive \npiece of legislation that would restore confidence in our financial \nsystem and revive our economy. What a difference a day makes.\n  If Dodd-Frank is really going to revive our economy, why do we need \nthis bill? I think the answer is clear: The majority knows the Dodd-\nFrank legislation is going to reduce lending and undermine economic \ngrowth by imposing more regulations and taxes on banks. They know, I \nbelieve, that Dodd-Frank will do nothing to increase the availability \nor reduce the cost of loans to small businesses. But, rather than \ncreate a new regulatory system to strengthen our private sector, the \nmajority decided to expand significantly the old system, thereby \nincreasing the regulatory burden on American businesses--small, medium, \nand large.\n  I believe this is the same old song and dance: expand the reach of \nthe heavy hand of government, increase taxes and the cost of doing \nbusiness, and then complain that the private sector is not working. We \nhave heard this before. Once the American business owner is \nsufficiently encumbered, the only alternative must be a brandnew big \ngovernment program, such as envisioned here. How do we pay for this new \n``necessary'' government program? We borrow money from future \ngenerations. Does that sound familiar to people here in the Senate?\n  This amendment is intended to help small businesses--a goal we can \nall support. Yet, in practice, the legislation would create a second \nTARP. Remember TARP? A lot of people wish they had not voted for it. \nLike TARP, this program does not lend money directly to small \nbusinesses. It would have the government take ownership interest in \nhundreds of banks and then require that they make loans. This is TARP \nII. In fact, banks could replace original TARP money with funds \nreceived from this program.\n  As I said, just 1 day after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, which \ncontained a provision to speed up termination of TARP, we are voting on \nan amendment to extend TARP for at least another 10 years.\n  To force banks to participate in this program, this legislation would \nsubsidize bank financing. Banks would generally pay dividends on the \ngovernment equity investments at rates ranging from 1 to 5 percent. The \ncurrent market yield on such investments, however, is between 7 and 8 \npercent. Hence, any bank that chooses not to participate could find \nitself at a competitive disadvantage. Moreover, this legislation forces \ntaxpayers to what? Subsidize banks once again. In effect, we are taxing \nsmall business owners to pay banks to lend to small businesses. Even \nworse, the government's equity investments would be subordinated to all \nof a bank's existing debt. As a result, if a bank fails, existing \ncreditors would get paid before the government, and taxpayers again \nwould take the hit. I believe American taxpayers have lost their \nappetite for bank bailouts.\n  Finally, I also want to note that the legislation appears to exempt \nloans made under this program from existing underwriting regulations. \nThe bank regulator would then have the authority to decide what types \nof underwriting standards apply to these loans. I believe this raises \nat least two issues. First, if the multitude of regulations required by \nDodd-Frank are really necessary, why does this bill provide a carve-out \nfor loans made under this program? Second, what statutory protections \nare there to ensure these loans are underwritten in a safe and sound \nmanner so we do not create hundreds of new Freddies and Fannies? The \nanswer, sadly, is none.\n  This legislation would continue the majority's assault on American \nbusiness by having the government dictate how and to whom loans are \nmade. Each participating bank would have to provide the government with \na business plan for review. Rather than having loans approved based on \nthe creditworthiness of a borrower, politics will now play a role. We \nshould let the market, not bureaucrats, decide which businesses get \nloans. Unfortunately, the majority party is once again sacrificing our \ncore economic values for a short-term economic gain.\n  The lack of credit for small business is a problem that needs to be \naddressed. I fully support the Banking Committee examining the issue \nand hope Chairman Dodd would consider holding a hearing on this issue. \nI think it is very important. It is relevant, and it should come out of \nthe committee. I do not, however, believe we should try to solve this \nproblem with another expensive and bureaucratic government program. \nTARP II is something we do not need and I hope will not be supported in \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, how much time is left of our allotment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eight minutes 8 seconds.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his eloquent remarks as a key \nmember and the ranking Republican member of the Banking Committee, as \nsomeone who is very knowledgeable of the impacts these decisions we \nmake here in Washington have on our financial institutions across this \ncountry. I think he is someone who has gone through, as many of us \nhave, this experience with TARP, and his comments are particularly on \npoint. So I thank him for being here and for speaking to this issue.\n  As my colleague from Maine also noted earlier today, I think there is \npretty broad opposition to this particular amendment, notwithstanding \nthe support many of us have for the underlying bill. As I said before, \nthere are tax incentives in the underlying bill, along with some other \nchanges that are being made in some of the Small Business \nAdministration lending programs, that I think will get widespread \nsupport in the Senate. But I believe this particular provision, for \nmany of the reasons I have mentioned and others have mentioned on the \nfloor, is going to find a considerable amount of opposition, and I \nwould expect that to be bipartisan opposition.\n  In the few minutes I have remaining, what I would like to do, if I \ncould, is wrap up with a couple of basic observations.\n  I know the Senator from Louisiana and others have talked about the \ndiscussion they have had with lenders in their States and some of the \nvarious associations that represent their States. I also had the \nopportunity a couple days ago to visit with a number of my bankers in \nSouth Dakota, most of whom believe this legislation is unnecessary \nbecause they think it is not an issue of having funds to lend, that \nthere are funds to lend out there, and the question really is trying to \nfind the types of deals, the types of borrowers who could make payment \nin a timely way. Hopefully, there will be more borrowers who are \nqualified.\n\n  One of the reasons I think they do not qualify is because there is so \nmuch uncertainty about what the rules of the game are going to be going \nforward. If you are a small business in America today, you do not know \nwhat is going to happen on the estate tax, the death tax. I hear that \nall the time from farmers and ranchers and small businesses. You do not \nknow what is going to happen with regard to taxes on income, on capital \ngains, on dividends. All those things are set to go up next year if \nsteps are not taken by Congress to prevent that from happening. You \nhave the new health care mandates which many of the small businesses \nare still trying to react to and figure out--when this gets \nimplemented, what impact is this going to have on my small business and \nmy cost structure? You have the prospect looming out there of a new \nenergy tax under some sort of cap-and-trade or climate change proposal \nthat continues to be discussed here in Washington, DC. So there is this \ncloud of uncertainty surrounding businesses in this country and I think \nalso lenders who are looking at businesses in this country and \nwondering whether these businesses are going to be viable in the future \nif they are hit with all these new taxes, new regulations, and new \nmandates.\n  So I think the better course for us to take is to look at ways we can \nliberate small businesses from regulations and taxes and mandates and \nenable them to go out and do what they do best; that is, create jobs. \nBut, frankly, I do not believe, notwithstanding the arguments that are \nbeing made by the other side, that going down the path toward another \nTARP--again, $30 billion is a significant amount of money. It is tax \ndollars we put at risk.\n\n[[Page S6168]]\n\n  Again, the reason the CBO scored this at a $1 billion savings is \nbecause they did not take into consideration, with the methodology they \nused in scoring it this time, market risk. They did when they scored \nthe original TARP. If they used the same accounting conventions in \nmaking their analysis of the budgetary impact of this particular \nprovision as they did with the original TARP, it would not result in a \n$1 billion savings; rather, it would result in a $6 billion cost to the \nFederal taxpayers. I think that is important to point out in this \ndebate going forward.\n  Let me, I guess just to close, at least temporarily, while other \nspeakers perhaps come down to talk about this, say that the White \nHouse's talking points, as I mentioned earlier, make it abundantly \nclear that this really is a TARP. They are trying to disguise it and \ncall it something else because they want bankers to participate and \nthey know bankers will not participate if they think they are getting \ninto a TARP.\n  These are the talking points from the White House which admit, again, \nthat the ``program would be separate and distinct from TARP to \nencourage participation.'' It goes on to say that ``the \nAdministration's proposal would encourage broader participation by \nbanks, as they would not face TARP restrictions.'' Again, as I said, \nthese restrictions the White House is referring to include restrictions \non executive compensation and warrant requirements, to name a couple.\n  So this really is--if you look at the way this breaks down and you \ncompare it side by side with how TARP was structured, it very much is \nthe same thing.\n  We can call it something different. We can label it something \ndifferent. We can disguise it. We can try to make people feel better \nabout voting for it. But what you see is what you get, and what you get \nand what you see here is TARP by another name.\n  So I do not think it is necessary for us to be going down this path \nagain. We have tried that once. When we did try it the last time, of \nthe total number of banks--707--that participated in the capital \npurchase program under TARP, 625 had assets of less than $100 million. \nSo this is something that has been tried, and it certainly does not \nseem, in my view, something we ought to be trying again. There are a \nlot of other ways to provide incentives for small businesses to create \njobs. Some of them are in this bill, and for that I congratulate the \nSenator from Louisiana. I worked with her as a member of the Small \nBusiness Committee on some of those provisions. But this one really is \na bridge too far. It is not something we need to be doing. It is not \nsomething the taxpayers of America need us to be doing. I would argue, \nas well--and this is based, again, on conversations I have had with \nlenders in my State of South Dakota--this is not something they think \nis necessary when it comes to making more credit available to small \nbusinesses in this country.\n  So I would, with that, reserve whatever time we have. I guess I yield \nback the remainder of my time--I assume it is about gone--and will wait \nfor some other speakers to come down.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, before my colleague leaves the floor, \nI want to say I did not realize he was such a fan of Elizabeth Warren. \nI was really under the impression that he and some of the leaders on \nthat side had some objections to her style of leadership. But they \nsurely have quoted her today because she was the author of this \noversight report to which they keep referring. So I am so happy to know \nthat the Senator from South Dakota and the other Senators who have \nspoken think so much of Elizabeth Warren because she is the one who \nwrote this report that said this might look like TARP II.\n  Now, that is what Elizabeth Warren says, and evidently my good friend \nfrom South Dakota really appreciates the leadership she is giving on \nthis subject. Because the community bankers--not Elizabeth Warren, not \nbureaucrats in Washington, whom the Senator from South Dakota is \ndefending--his own community bankers--yes, in South Dakota, his \ncommunity bankers--wrote to Harry Reid and Mitch McConnell, his leader, \non behalf of the nearly 5,000 members of the Independent Community \nBankers. A Communist group, a very liberal group this group of \nindependent community bankers is. A big government group independent \ncommunity bankers are. They have written a letter to the Senator from \nSouth Dakota. Evidently, he did not open his mail today.\n  Madam President, they write:\n\n       I urge you to retain the Small Business Lending Fund in the \n     Small Business Jobs Act. It is the core component of this \n     legislation.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Would the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. No, I will not yield.\n  I will say one thing to the Senator from South Dakota. If I took out \nthe words ``big government,'' ``taxes,'' or ``regulations,'' neither \nthe Senator from South Dakota nor most of the Members on the other side \ncould finish a sentence, because they can't debate a specific. He gets \nup and starts talking about higher taxes and more regulations. This \nbill has tax cuts in it. This bill doesn't have any regulations in it. \nThis is a small business lending program. My good friend, the Senator \nfrom Alabama, read the statement written by the political operatives \nbeautifully. I am sure I will hear it on the Rush Limbaugh radio \nprogram today.\n  I don't need a speech to read. I have hardly read one thing except \nthe thousands of letters that are pouring in, asking us to help small \nbusiness. I will say with as much respect as I can to the ranking \nmember of the Banking Committee, because I know I heard him say this \nbill didn't go through the Banking Committee: I wish to agree, and \nthank God it didn't. Because you know the last two bills that did? One \nwas TARP I, which nobody likes. Then TARP II came through that \ncommittee, and then the big bank regulatory bill came through that \ncommittee. So I hope the ranking member isn't trying to convince me or \nthe Republicans that that committee has produced great legislation. I \nsay that with respect to the chairman of the committee. I know he is \ngoing to hear this and be aggravated. But to stand up and say because \nthe small business lending bill didn't go through the Banking \nCommittee, which has been roundly criticized by their side for too much \nregulation, is more than I can stand.\n  Thank goodness, this didn't go through the Banking Committee. It came \nstraight from the hearts of bankers in our communities and small \nbusinesses who don't need any committee in Washington to tell them what \nis going on at home. They don't need any lobbyists to tell us what is \ngoing on. They can't get money. We have given out money to Wall Street. \nWe have given out money to the big auto companies. When it comes to \ngiving out a small $30 billion to our own community banks, the \nRepublicans say no.\n  Then I have to hear the Senator from Alabama and the Senator from \nSouth Dakota--and I want whoever is listening to hear this: They say \nthis is a big government program. The money doesn't even go to the \ngovernment; it goes to the community banks. It is a voluntary program \nto community banks, and it then goes to business.\n  I will say again that there were Democrats who came to me and said--I \nam the chair of the committee--Senator, we don't trust the private \nsector. We don't think that if we give them this money, they will lend \nto our small businesses. Can't you do a direct lending program? There \nis a lot of support for a direct lending program. But knowing the GOP \nthe way I do, I said to my friends, my colleagues: You know, if I \nthought I could get one or two or three Republicans for a government \ndirect program, I might do that because it would be more efficient, but \nthey are so mad at the government right now and they have everybody all \nriled up, so let's do it through our community bankers whom we know, \nwhom they know and support. So we craft the program to be a voluntary \nprivate sector lending program to healthy banks, and they want to say \nno, because, they say, it is like TARP.\n  Well, let me tell my colleagues one Senator who is a Republican who \ndoesn't think it is TARP, and that is Senator LeMieux from Florida. \nAnother Senator who doesn't think it is TARP is the good Senator from \nOhio, George Voinovich, who says it is not TARP.\n  But the Senator from South Dakota, who came to talk about how we \ncan't\n\n[[Page S6169]]\n\nhelp small business, actually voted for TARP. The Senator who just \nspoke against this provision voted for TARP, to give money to banks and \nbig banks with no strings attached. Yet he comes to the floor and now \nhe can't help our community banks in their efforts to help small \nbusinesses. Every community bank, independent bankers, ABA, they are \nall supporting this. They didn't support TARP; many of them did not. \nThey were afraid of it. They didn't like it. They still complain about \nit. This isn't TARP.\n  I know my colleague is here from the State of Washington. How much \nmore time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I wish to yield the 8 minutes to the \nSenator from Washington, who was extremely instrumental in designing \nthis program. Perhaps the Senator knows I am evidently having some \ndifficulty explaining to some of the Senators from the other side how \nthis is not like TARP. Maybe the Senator from Washington can do a \nbetter job than I have been able to do. I wish to thank her for coming \nto the floor. I yield 8 minutes to the Senator from Washington.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank the chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee. I see my colleague from Washington is already here \non the floor. Did she wish to say a few words?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I am happy to yield to the Senator from \nWashington to go first and then I will follow her.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I thank my colleague from Washington. I know she too \nhas been very active in this issue and has spoken on it and has urged \nour leadership, in signing a letter, I believe probably 6 months ago, \nthat we pass this legislation. I wish to thank again the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee for her advocacy.\n  This literally is an issue about Main Street versus Wall Street. This \nis about whether we are going to help Main Street in tough economics \ntimes, or whether we are going to continue to say that Wall Street gets \nthe ear of Congress.\n  I am someone who didn't vote for either of the TARP pieces of \nlegislation. I know my colleague, Senator Shelby, the ranking member of \nthe Banking Committee, was here speaking about this. I can assure my \ncolleagues that this legislation is focused at the problem that was \ncaused by Wall Street. Many people across America are asking when we \nare going to stand up for small businesses in America and help Main \nStreet recover from this economic disaster.\n  How did we get into this situation? We got into this situation when \nlarge banks failed because of their active participation in things such \nas credit default swaps and other derivatives that weren't truly backed \nby financial commitments and basically became a house of cards, and \nthey brought down our entire economic system.\n  So what was our response to that? Our response to that was to bail \nout the big banks and give them assistance.\n  What happened to the community banks? As deposit insurance basically \nwas paid out in various forms, that said to those community banks: You \nnow have to have higher capital standards. Can my colleagues imagine \nthat? Can my colleagues imagine that? We had big banks such as Goldman \nSachs and others that basically had imploded and we gave them taxpayer \nmoney and, basically, then said to the community banks: You need to \nhave more capital within your banks. That is what we said.\n  So what did those community banks do when regulators told them they \nhad to have higher capital requirements? They did what many of them \nonly had one choice to do, which was come up with situations to either \nget more capital or stop their lending. The consequence is that there \nwas a lot of lending that was done to small businesses that suffered as \na consequence of those actions. Imagine that. The practices of the \nlarger banks of investing in credit default swaps and derivatives that \nhad no basis ended up costing small businesses their access to capital \nbecause capital requirements were put on small businesses through their \nbanks at the same time large banks were given a bailout.\n  So no, no, this is not a bailout. This is about a lending program for \nsmall business to save Main Street and save our economy, because this \nSenator believes that job creation happens from small business. That is \na proven fact. Seventy-five percent of the increase in jobs comes from \nsmall business, but right now they can't get access to capital.\n\n  Here is a letter from one of my constituents:\n\n       In unprecedented times I am writing to you to express and \n     urge relief for small business owners who are struggling to \n     survive and who can be one of the key factors to improving \n     the U.S. economy. We have been a small business for over 9 \n     years and have 5 restaurants in Washington State and we \n     currently employ 150 people between five operations. Until \n     September of 2008, our business was stable and we were \n     expanding and adding jobs and tax dollars to the State and \n     Federal coffers. But then in September of 2008, after signing \n     a 20-year lease for our first Arby's project--\n\n  that is a restaurant--\n\n     our lender pulled our financing due to economic conditions. \n     This was the same lender that just 3 months earlier had \n     refinanced over $3 million of our business debt. And even \n     though we had excellent personal and business credit, two \n     business properties as collateral, good cash flow, we were \n     forced to take high-interest equipment leases, advances from \n     credit cards, as well as cash advances with an almost, yes, \n     50 percent interest rate from finance companies with an 18-\n     month term.\n       We tried going directly to the bank to finance the company, \n     but we were told we had no options. Instead, the same bank \n     charged an almost 50 percent interest rate through the \n     finance company.\n       There is nothing worse to an entrepreneur than to have the \n     foundation and determination of their survival caused by this \n     economic calamity and then to feel that State and Federal \n     agencies would rather see your doors shut than work with you. \n     We are honest, hard-working Americans who want to pay all our \n     debt, but these agencies are uncompromising and missing the \n     human factor.\n\n  Missing the human factor. Why is it that the other side of the aisle \nthought it was such a priority to bail out Wall Street, but now a well-\ncrafted piece of legislation that is a lending program that is \nvoluntary--banks don't even have to participate in it if they don't \nwant to; it is not like TARP which was mandated on the banks to \nparticipate--why is it the other side doesn't want to see the success \nof these small businesses?\n  As my colleagues have said, this program is a well thought out \nprogram to help recapitalize the community banks as more requirements \nwere put on to them as it related to the economic crisis of 2008. \nImagine that. No questions asked to the big banks; they were given a \nbailout. Small banks got new capital requirements. They cut thousands \nand thousands--probably millions--of lines of credit; that is, \nperforming loans to businesses across America were cut out from under \nthem.\n  The voices are loud and clear across America. They want us to help \nrestore this kind of stability through access to capital for small \nbusinesses. This is a program that can generate $1.1 billion to our \neconomy and reduce our Federal deficit. It will help stabilize in a way \nthat these other programs have not been able to do, and it will create \nthe job growth we need to see in America.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this important legislation. I know \nsome on the other side of the aisle want to name this some other \nlegislation. But the truth is that this is about Main Street, whether \none's perspective is that Main Street is going to help us. I believe \nMain Street will be that job creator. I hope my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will think about this and the consequence of the \nvotes they have already taken. It is so important for us to say that we \nunderstand their plight, just like the gentleman's letter that I read. \nIt is important for us to say we understand the frustration they have \nbeen through; that we are on their side in making sure small business \ngets access to capital; and that we believe our economy isn't about the \nbig banks. It is about those millions and millions and millions of \nentrepreneurs every day who go out there and are hard working and who \nhave been told no, no, no--told even on their lines of credit, no, you \ncan't have access anymore. We need to right that wrong that happened \nover the last year and a half and get capital flowing again to small \nbusinesses.\n  I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairwoman of the Small Business\n\n[[Page S6170]]\n\nCommittee. I see my colleague from Washington, who has been outspoken \nabout this since January, the importance of getting this done, and has \nwritten many letters to try to emphasize how critical it is to our \nWashington State economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington should know that \nthe 15 minutes for the majority has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \nDemocratic Senator to speak be the Senator from New Hampshire, the \nPresiding Officer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I wish to thank Senator Cantwell, Senator Landrieu, and \nall of those on our side who have been working so hard on this issue \nfor so long.\n  As all of us know, small businesses are not only at the heart of our \ncommunities, they are at the heart of our economic recovery. They \nprovide secure, stable jobs. They drive the innovation that provides \neconomic growth and expands opportunity for all. They are the \nfoundation on which we build our economy.\n  But we also know that this economic downturn has hit our Nation's \nsmall businesses particularly hard. Lines of credit have been cut off, \nbusinesses that were expanding and hiring suddenly slammed on the \nbrakes, employees have been let go, and inventive and original ideas \nhave been put on hold.\n  In communities throughout our country, our small businesses have been \nleft to fend for themselves.\n  A large part of why this has happened can be explained by looking at \nthe health of our community banks, which provide the capital that \ndrives business growth and job creation.\n  The fact is, help has come much too slow for our community banks. \nBecause of that, we have seen these banks fail one after another, \nlending has dried up small businesses, and job growth has suffered.\n  While Wall Street institutions such as AIG and Goldman Sachs were \ndeemed too big to fail, the collapse of our community banks has \napparently been too small to notice. In communities across my State and \nacross the country, the loss of their hometown banks has certainly been \nnoticed. In my State of Washington, just in the past year, there have \nbeen 10 community banks that have failed. Believe me, their communities \nhave felt the loss of these banks.\n  Earlier this year, the FDIC closed American Marine Bank, a small bank \nthat serves small communities in my State, including Bainbridge Island. \nIt was a bank that had served small businesses and families in the \ncommunity since 1948. It was the first bank that allowed the people who \nlived there to do their banking without having to take a ferry ride all \nthe way to Seattle.\n  Over the years, American Marine provided the capital that allowed \nBainbridge Island and other areas of our Olympic Peninsula to grow into \nself-sustaining economies, to grow from very sparse farm areas into \nsuburbs that included thriving small businesses and family-wage jobs.\n  An article that ran in the hometown Kitsap Sun newspaper after the \ncollapse captured what the bank's failure meant for local businesses \nand families.\n  In the article, Larry Nakata, president of a local grocery chain, \nsaid American Marine had been his bank since the day his store opened \nand noted that over the past 52 years he has gotten repeated loans from \nAmerican Marine over time to build new stores, expand, and hire new \nworkers. In that same article, Mary Hall, a local business owner, \ntalked about how a former CEO of American Marine believed in her enough \nto give her a loan to start up her paint company back in 1984, which \nstill serves the community today.\n  Jeff Brian, a movie theater owner there, talked about how American \nMarine provided the loans he needed to buy new land and open new \ntheaters. He said:\n\n       They were there for us from the very, very beginning.\n\n  Madam President, it is not just that community banks are failing, it \nis that they simply don't have the capital to lend to even very \nsuccessful small businesses in their communities.\n  This is something I have heard repeatedly talking to small business \nowners in every community of my State.\n  In Vancouver, WA, I heard from Tiffany Turner, who, with her husband, \nowns a growing inn. She told me they have grown close to 10 percent, \ndespite the economic recession. But they have now been told by their \nbank that ``we are not lending in your sector.''\n  In Seattle, I heard from Dani Cone, the owner of a local coffee \ncompany, whose credit ran dry and has been forced to borrow money from \nfamily members to keep her business afloat.\n  I heard from a bookstore owner who had taken out $60,000 on her own \npersonal credit card to keep her business afloat.\n  I heard from a husband and wife who opened a local restaurant about \nhow they finally had to close up shop for good.\n  I heard from people who were driven by their passions, who wanted to \ngrow their business and wanted to hire but have been stymied by the \nlack of credit flowing from their banks.\n  Obviously, at a time when we are now relying on our small businesses \nto drive job growth, this is unacceptable. Right now we ought to be \ndoing everything we can to make sure small business owners have the \ncredit they need to grow and hire.\n  That is, in fact, why last year I introduced the Main Street Lending \nRestoration Act, which would direct $30 billion in unused TARP funding \nwhich was supposed to go to Wall Street, back to our community banks \nthat are under $10 billion, so they can unlock the vaults and start to \nlend to small businesses in their communities again.\n  It is exactly why I spoke to Secretary Geithner and President Obama \nabout this directly--and why I have been pushing so hard to make small \nbusiness lending a priority.\n  I have felt strongly that we have to be more focused on community \nbanks if we are going to make progress and bring true recovery to Main \nStreet businesses again. It is why I am so proud to stand here today \nand support this amendment that will create the small business lending \nfund and State small business credit initiative.\n  The small business lending fund takes a most powerful idea from my \nMain Street Lending Restoration Act and sets aside $30 billion to help \nour community banks--those with under $10 billion in assets--to help \nthem get the capital they need to begin lending money to our small \nbusinesses again.\n  It would reward the banks that are helping our small businesses grow \nby reducing interest rates on capital they receive under this program.\n  It would help support small business initiatives run by States across \nthe country that are struggling now due to local budget cutbacks.\n  My State of Washington is one of the most trade-dependent States in \nthe Nation. So I am very glad this amendment also includes the Export \nPromotion Act, which would provide support and resources to small \nbusinesses that are trying to ramp up their exports.\n  Small businesses are the lifeblood of our economy, and this amendment \nwill help them get back on their feet, expand, and, importantly, add \njobs to our communities.\n  I grew up working in a small business. My dad was the manager of a \nfive-and-dime store in Bothell, WA. As a kid, I did everything from \nsweeping the floor, to working the till, to taking out the trash. I \nremember how our little businesses and those around us on Main Street \nwere the cornerstones of our community and how, in fact, they were \nactually the cornerstone of our local economy.\n  My experience is certainly not unique. For many decades, the defining \nstrength of our financial system has been our small businesses and \ntheir ability to access credit at affordable rates, grow beyond their \nwalls, and provide good-paying jobs.\n  It is time for us to get back to ensuring that our small businesses \nare the backbone of our economy. This amendment is a very important \nstep in that direction.\n  I thank Senator Landrieu for her outstanding leadership on this \nissue. I\n\n[[Page S6171]]\n\nam here today to urge all of our colleagues to support this amendment, \nand let's get Main Street back to work again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                      Supplemental Appropriations\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, very soon, we will be voting to move to \nconsider the House-passed version of the 2010 supplemental \nappropriations bill.\n  I will vote against proceeding to the bill for one simple reason: It \nis not fully offset and now has a pricetag of $80 billion. When will \nthe spending stop?\n  When the Senate considered the supplemental in May of this year, the \nbill totaled nearly $60 billion. Again, I opposed it because our \nversion was not paid for, and it added to the ever-growing deficit for \nfuture generations. Those who say we oppose small business and all the \nmotherhood and apple pie provisions of this bill, all we want to do is \nhave it paid for.\n  Dr. Coburn and I had two reasonable amendments to fully offset the \ncost of the bill when it was $60 billion. I am sure we could find \noffsets for this $80 billion bill--if amendments were in order.\n  Our amendment would have saved taxpayers a combined total of nearly \n$120 billion by freezing raises, bonuses, and salary increases for \nFederal employees for a year; collecting unpaid taxes from Federal \nemployees, which is $3 billion; reducing printing and publishing costs \nof government documents; eliminating nonessential government travel; \neliminating bonuses for poor performance by government contractors, \nwhich is $8 billion. The list goes on and on. It also includes cutting \nbudgets of Members of Congress, which would save $100 million; \ndisposing of unneeded and unused government property, which would save \n$15 billion.\n  In other words, the size of government has doubled since 1990. \nSurely, it is time we started paying for these spending bills.\n  Our efforts failed. The majority, once again, succeeded in preventing \nthe elimination of a single dime of wasteful and unnecessary and \nduplicative spending.\n  I remind my colleagues that in April of 2009, well over a year ago, \nthe President wrote to Speaker Pelosi and said this:\n\n       As I noted when I first introduced my budget in February, \n     this is the last planned war supplemental.\n\n  That was in April of 2009 when the President said last year, April, \nwas the last planned war supplemental.\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Since September 2001, the Congress has passed 17 separate \n     emergency funding bills totaling $822.1 billion for the wars \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan. After 7 years of war, the American \n     people deserve an honest accounting of the cost of our \n     involvement in our ongoing military operations.\n\n  I could not agree more. That is why I am disappointed to see yet \nanother supplemental spending bill--designated as an emergency--and \nwithout offsets.\n  Now the majority leader wants us to take up the House-passed bill, \nwhich exceeds the cost of the Senate version by $22 billion--nearly $23 \nbillion. The House added $10 billion for an education jobs program and \n$4.9 billion for Pell grants. Other items added by the House include \n$80 million for energy loans, $142 million for the gulf oilspill--the \nlist goes on and on. Many of these are very worthy causes, very worthy \nitems. But it should not be added to a must-pass bill to fund our \ntroops, and it should be fully offset. That is what this debate has \nbeen all about for a long time--not whether these are worthy items, not \nwhether we should have $10 billion for an education jobs program--\nalthough I seriously question that one--but the question is, Are we \ngoing to pay for it?\n  When are we going to stop mortgaging our children's and \ngrandchildren's future and start balancing the budget and reducing and \neliminating spending? Our soldiers and their families are making \ntremendous sacrifices. Why don't we make some sacrifices? Why don't we \nforego the earmarks and the special interests and the special deals \nthat continue to characterize our behavior?\n  I don't need to remind my colleagues that we are fighting two wars. \nBut the House has proposed reduced defense spending for this fiscal \nyear and prior year funding by $3.2 billion to help pay for the $22.8 \nbillion added by the House for domestic programs.\n  Subsequent to House action on the supplemental, the chairman of both \nthe House and Senate Appropriations Committees further reduced the \nDefense Department's fiscal year 2011 discretionary base allocations \nbelow the President's request by $7 billion and $8 billion, \nrespectively.\n  In other words, we are increasing domestic spending, larding it on \nthis, by some $60 billion, and at the same time we are cutting defense.\n  One issue of concern is a provision contained in the Senate-passed \nbill to provide funding for the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nexercise his authority to expand the number of service-related \nillnesses presumed to be connected to exposure to Agent Orange. The \ncost of that provision is $42 billion over 10 years and will most \nassuredly have a detrimental impact on the ability of the VA to process \ncurrent and backlogged claims in a timely manner.\n  Perhaps the most controversial provision added by the House is the \n$10 billion for an education jobs fund. This money would be used to \nsupplement State budgets to pay the salaries of teachers, \nadministrators, janitors, and other school personnel.\n  I fully support the goal of saving teachers' jobs, but this certainly \nisn't the way to do it. In fact, the government should be incentivizing \ndistricts to make crucial reforms so that effective teachers are \nrewarded.\n  The proposed Education Jobs Fund would continue the archaic seniority \nsystem that many say rewards bad teachers instead of the most effective \nteachers.\n  Additionally, the House proposed $800 million in spending cuts to \nhelp offset the cost of this $10 billion fund--an act which quickly \ndrew a veto threat from the President. The bill proposes to cut $500 \nmillion from the Race to the Top Fund. I don't know of a better \neducational incentive in recent years than the Race to the Top Fund. \nYet they are going to cut $500 million from it.\n  The bill proposes to cut $200 million from the Teacher Incentive Fund \nthat supports creation of pay-for-performance programs and $100 million \nfrom the Charter Schools Program. All these are proven ways to help \neducation in America, so they are going to cut them.\n  They are going to cut the Charter Schools Program. In my State, \ncharter schools have worked and have provided competition to the public \nschool system. If the cuts to the Charter Schools Program in the House-\npassed bill are enacted, as many as 200 fewer charter schools could \nstart next year and approximately 6,000 charter school employees could \nbe in jeopardy of losing their jobs. There are 420,000 children on \ncharter school waiting lists nationally. Now is not the time to stop \nsupporting the growth of new charter schools.\n  I could go on and on about what this bill does. Of interest is the \nHouse decreased by $27 million the funding for the hiring of additional \nBorder Patrol agents for the southwest border, decreased by $63 million \nthe funding for the acquisition of unmanned aerial vehicles and \nhelicopters, and decreased by $1 million the construction of forward \noperating bases for use by the Border Patrol. Every one of those \nprograms that have been cut are effective in securing our border.\n  Even more egregious is that the House cut $100 million more than the \nPresident requested from the account that funds the construction of and \nrepairs to the border fence. I support the President's request to \nrescind $100 million from the failed virtual fence project, but this \nmoney should go toward increased Border Patrol and Customs agents and \ntechnology. I do not support the House's effort to cut an additional \n$100 million in funding that is currently available and being used to \ncomplete construction of the border fence and repair the constant \ndamage done to the fence by those trying to illegally cross into our \ncountry.\n  In summary, in the past 2 years, America has faced her greatest \nfiscal challenges since the Great Depression. When the financial market \ncollapsed, it was the American taxpayer who came to the rescue of the \nbanks and big Wall Street firms. But who has come to the rescue of the \nAmerican taxpayer? Not Congress.\n  What has Congress done? We have saddled future generations with \ntrillions of dollars of debt. Since January\n\n[[Page S6172]]\n\n2009, we have been on a spending binge, the likes of which this Nation \nhas never seen. In that time, our debt has grown by over $2 trillion. \nWe passed a $1.1 trillion stimulus bill. Has anybody seen any good \nthings from that? We spent $83 billion to bail out the domestic auto \nindustry. We passed a $2.5 trillion health care bill. We now have a \ndeficit of over $1.4 trillion and a debt of $13 trillion. That amounts \nto more than $42,000 owed by every man, woman, and child in America.\n  This year, the government will spend more than $3.6 trillion and will \nborrow 41 cents for every $1 it spends. Unemployment remains around 9.7 \npercent. According to forbes.com, a record 2.8 million American \nhouseholds were threatened with foreclosure last year, and that number \nis expected to rise to well over 3 million homes this year.\n  Now with this bill, the majority wants to tack on another $80 \nbillion. When is it going to end? It may end next January. It may end \nnext January because the American people will not stand for this \ncontinued crime we are inflicting on our children and our \ngrandchildren.\n  The greatness of America is that every generation has passed on to \nthe next generation a better one than that generation inherited. I \ncannot say that about the next generation with the debt with which we \nhave saddled them. This kind of legislation has to be soundly rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to be on the floor this \nafternoon to join the Senator from Louisiana, who has been such a \nchampion for small business in America, to join my colleagues from the \nState of Washington who were here earlier, to support the proposal that \nis before to address an issue that I have been hearing about in New \nHampshire for months now. This is something that all Senators have been \nhearing about in their home States for the last 18 months if they are \nwilling to be honest about it.\n  That issue is that creditworthy businesses, small businesses are \nfrustrated because they cannot access the capital they need to expand \ntheir businesses and hire new workers.\n  Wherever I go in New Hampshire, small businesses tell me they are \nhaving trouble accessing the credit they need to either stay afloat or \nto expand their businesses. While the community banks have increased \ntheir lending in New Hampshire, they can only do so much.\n  As my colleagues have outlined so eloquently, they have been affected \nby the financial crisis that struck this country. We have an \nopportunity to address this issue with the Landrieu-LeMieux amendment \nthat will create a Small Business Lending Fund to put capital into the \nhands of small businesses.\n  This $30 billion Small Business Lending Fund will help our community \nbanks put over $300 billion of capital into the real drivers of our \neconomic recovery and give to the small businesses that will make that \nhappen.\n  I wished to be on the floor today, as we discussed earlier, because I \nhave heard some of my colleagues--and we heard it earlier this \nafternoon from the Senators from South Dakota and Alabama--criticize \nthis fund as being like TARP. It has been called the son of TARP. I \nvoted against TARP. Let me say this as clearly as I can, something the \nPresiding Officer has said in her remarks, something we heard Senators \nCantwell and Murray say: This program is not TARP. This is not another \nWall Street bailout.\n  I am going to support this fund because it is about helping Main \nStreet, not Wall Street. Small banks and businesses in our communities \ndid not cause the financial crisis in this country, but they have too \noften suffered the terrible consequences of the reckless behavior of \nWall Street. Credit on Main Street has been extremely tight since the \nfinancial collapse, and that has devastated too many small businesses \nacross this country.\n  One of the reasons our economy has not been able to emerge from the \nrecession fully is that larger banks that benefited from TARP have \ndecreased their lending. I heard from one small business owner in New \nHampshire. He owns a sheet metal manufacturing company. The company had \nits line of credit pulled by a large national bank that had been a TARP \nrecipient. This sheet metal company was a creditworthy business. It had \nnever missed a payment. It had never defaulted on its mortgage. Losing \nthat credit line was devastating for this business.\n  Similar to so many small businesses, it needed a line of credit to \nbuy new equipment so it could make a transition and increase its \nproductivity. But with the credit line gone, this business had nowhere \nto turn. It is companies such as the sheet metal manufacturing business \nin New Hampshire that this bill will address.\n\n  This proposal provides community banks, which have stepped up their \nlending but can only go so far, with the support they need to increase \nlending to small businesses.\n  Unlike TARP, this program has strong taxpayer protections to ensure \nthe fund serves its purpose. The very structure of the program ensures \nthat community banks that participate in this program will use the \ncapital for small business lending. Only banks that do a vast majority \nof their lending to small businesses are eligible for this program, and \nunlike TARP, there will be terms and conditions for repayment. \nTaxpayers will not be on the hook.\n  This fund will not add to the Federal deficit. In fact, it is \nestimated to raise $1 billion over 10 years. The terms of the program \nwill ensure that taxpayers will not be put at risk.\n  Let me say this one more time because there has been a lot of \nmisinformation thrown out on the floor: The terms of this program will \nensure that taxpayers will not be put at risk.\n  At the end of the day, this proposal is about standing for small \nbusinesses in this country. We have all heard from small businesses in \nour home States that have suffered from a recession they had no part in \ncreating. This is our chance to stick up for the millions of \ncreditworthy small businesses across this country that need capital to \noperate or grow but that have been shut out.\n  It is also about turning our economy around. Over 75 percent of new \njobs in America are created by small businesses, and since the \nfinancial collapse, the majority of jobs lost have been with those \nsmall businesses.\n  If there is one place we should be able to agree to invest, it is our \nsmall businesses. If we do not extend credit to them, they will not be \nable to get the capital they need to expand and create the jobs that \nwill finally get us out of this recession.\n  This is not TARP. Saying this program is like TARP is just a red \nherring. This fund is what we should have been doing in the first \nplace--providing capital to community banks so they can extend credit \nto the small businesses that need this capital to create jobs on Main \nStreet.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Landrieu amendment \nto include this critical investment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the \nbipartisan amendment to the small business bill offered by Senators \nLandrieu and LeMieux. The amendment would make $30 billion of capital \navailable to community banks across the country, incentivizing them to \nlend several times that amount to small businesses in desperate need of \ncredit.\n  There is no question about it: Small businesses are the great engines \nof growth in our economy. They employ over half our workers. In the \npast two decades, they have created over two-thirds of the Nation's new \njobs.\n  Our economy is starting to show signs of life again, but we still \nhave a long way to go. The HIRE Act, especially the payroll tax cut \nSenator Hatch and I authored, has been a good success, saving \nbusinesses billions in taxes. I recently introduced a bill to extend \nthe tax cut for 6 months.\n  Congress should be focused like a laser on bringing unemployment down \nand getting the economy humming on\n\n[[Page S6173]]\n\nall cylinders again. The bill before us today is an important part of \nthat ongoing effort. It is a targeted bill that will help small \nbusinesses expand and hire.\n  The small business lending fund was once a part of the legislation. \nActually, it was not merely part of the legislation, it was the heart \nof the legislation.\n  There are many worthy ideas and programs in this bill from bonus \ndepreciation to increasing the loan limits on the SBA's flagship \nprograms to providing grants to help States expand innovative small \nbusiness initiatives.\n  These provisions will encourage entrepreneurs to start new businesses \nand help existing businesses prosper by reducing taxes and streamlining \nsome of the burdens on small businesses.\n  But a core mission of this bill was always to jump-start lending. \nWhen I travel around New York and talk with business owners about \ncreating jobs, the No. 1 thing they bring up is they do not have access \nto credit.\n  In his testimony before the Banking Committee yesterday, Ben Bernanke \nnoted that while big businesses can borrow money by accessing the \ncapital markets, small businesses must rely on bank loans and are \nhaving a much harder time. The Landrieu-LeMieux amendment goes to the \nheart of this problem. According to Bernanke, in a series of 40 \nmeetings the Fed conducted with community banks and small businesses \nfrom coast to coast, participants expressed unambiguous support for the \n$30 billion lending fund.\n  There are several explanations for why small business lending is \ndown. Small businesses blame the banks for not lending and banks in \nturn blame the regulators for not letting them lend. But one thing is \ncertain: Lending is down, and that is bad for our economic recovery.\n  I hear from small businesses across my State, businesses that want to \nexpand and cannot because they cannot get credit. For us to stand here \nand twiddle our thumbs and play politics by saying that this is the \nTARP? That is wrong. That is wrong, when millions are unemployed and \nthe public is demanding get the economy going.\n\n  There are strong provisions in the underlying bill that will help \nspur lending, including an extension of the successful provisions from \nthe Recovery Act that increased SBA loan guarantees and waived SBA loan \nfees. I believe the lending fund is a much needed complement to these \nprograms. It will be a shot in the arm for small businesses across \nAmerica, greatly increasing credit. The fund has been structured to \nmaximize lending by directly tying the dividends rate participating \nbanks pay to the Treasury to their lending performance. The rate starts \nat 5 percent and goes down 1 percentage point for every 2.5 percent \nincrease in lending over the 2009 levels. Therefore, a bank that \nincreases lending by 10 percent or more will be rewarded with rates as \nlow as 1 percent.\n  In addition to this carrot, there is the stick. The dividend rate \nincreases for banks that do not increase lending. Banks that attempt to \nsit on funds will be penalized with rates as high as 7 percent.\n  Another great feature of this amendment is that it targets small Main \nStreet banks, banks that are especially committed to lending to small \nlocal businesses. To participate, banks or thrifts must have less than \n$10 billion in assets. In New York, banks such as Elmira Savings Bank \nin the Southern Tier, the Bank of Smithtown on Long Island, and the \nOneida Savings Bank in the Mohawk Valley will be eligible for capital \ninfusions, and all this will be done with no cost to the taxpayers.\n  Let me say that again: All this will be done with no cost to the \ntaxpayers. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \nestimates the lending facility would save taxpayers money. They \ncalculate that the lending fund would decrease the deficit by over $1 \nbillion.\n  Congress needs to do everything in its power to push a growth agenda, \na jobs agenda. An integral part of this agenda is to increase lending \nto creditworthy small businesses. That is why I support the Landrieu-\nLeMieux lending fund amendment and that is why I also strongly support \nMark Udall's bill to increase the arbitrary cap on the amount credit \nunions can lend to their member businesses.\n  Here is the bottom line. Small businesses will be the tip of the \nshovel that digs us out of these difficult times but that will only \nhappen if we get them the resources they need, and what they need is \nthe Small Business Lending Fund in the Landrieu-LeMieux amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this very important amendment and, \nbefore I yield the floor, I want to pay a great compliment to my \ncolleague from Louisiana, who has spearheaded this drive. We all talk \nabout small business lending. This is the best, most logical, most \ncost-effective way to do it and she is the reason we are here debating \nthis bill. I want to take off my hat--hundreds of thousands of small \nbusiness people across the country would do the same--to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nthose very kind words. But I wish to say again I am humbled, actually, \nto be able to present this amendment because it is quite unusual. \nNormally a chairman or a chairwoman presents amendments in bills that \nthey themselves wrote. That happens here all the time. This is a very \nunusual situation.\n  As I said earlier today, I did not write this provision. I didn't \nknow very much about this provision. It was written by Senators such as \nSenator Murray, Senator Cantwell, and Senator Merkley. They started \nworking on this idea. They are not even members of the Small Business \nCommittee. They started working on this idea and it picked up momentum \nand the President spoke about the need to get capital to small \nbusiness.\n  Then all the small business organizations, most all of them, stepped \nup and said, yes, this is what we need. Then the community bankers and \nthe independent bankers stood up and it snowballed.\n  It has gotten to have a great broad base of support. I am pleased \nthis is a bipartisan amendment with the Senator from Florida--both \nSenators from Florida have been strong advocates. Senator LeMieux \njoined me in offering this amendment because, for some inexplicable \nreason, this was going to be left on the cutting room floor.\n  We managed to get huge bills out here for Wall Street. We managed to \nget huge bills out here for the automobile companies. But when it came \nto lifting this smaller bill for small business, it started running \ninto some political rhetoric, some bumper sticker slogans for the next \nelection, some hogwash.\n  I think our small businesses deserve more than bumper sticker \nslogans, hogwash, and electioneering chatter. So it got me mad. I said, \nyou know what, I didn't write this provision. I am going to learn about \nthis provision, though, because I am not going to have it stomped under \nby the same people who voted for TARP, voted for the big banks, voted \nto bail them out but, when it comes to helping small business, want to \nsay there is something wrong with this. That is why we are fighting.\n  I see the Senator from Oregon, who helped draft this provision.\n  The Senator from South Dakota came here and said none of his people \nare for it. He must not be reading his mail. We have right here the \nSouth Dakota Independent Small Bankers--Independent Community Bankers \nof America, State Community Bank Associations. There are any number of \nthem. I checked. Here we have Independent Community Bankers of South \nDakota.\n  The Senator from South Dakota was just here and said no one in South \nDakota is for this. He might want to go check his in-box or e-mail or \nhis mail. The bankers of South Dakota I don't think are a very liberal \ngroup, I would guess. They are a pretty hearty bunch out there in South \nDakota. I don't think they like big, fat government programs. But the \nreason they are for it is because it is not a government program. It is \na Main Street program. It is for small businesses in South Dakota. That \nis why we are fighting for it. We are not going to go down without a \nhard fight.\n  I am going to recognize the Senator from Oregon in a minute, but the \nother thing the Senator from South Dakota said was that he loved this \nreport. He said it. He quoted it. The May Oversight Report, ``Small \nBusiness Credit\n\n[[Page S6174]]\n\nCrunch And The Impact Of TARP.'' The person who wrote this report is a \ngood friend of his, Elizabeth Warren. So he is supporting this report \nin which Elizabeth Warren said in her view she is not sure this program \nwill work. That is what this report says: She is not sure this program \nwill work. She is entitled to that opinion. But I don't listen to \nElizabeth Warren. I don't listen to Washington bureaucrats. I am \nlistening to the small business associations of America. I am listening \nto the Taco Sisters Restaurant in Lafayette. I know it is a silly name, \nbut it is a very important business to them. I don't care what anybody \nsays about their name, Taco Sisters Restaurant. Katie and Molly Richard \ndreamed about opening a restaurant. For 24 years they dreamed this \ndream. Molly convinced her sister Katie to move back home from New \nHampshire. She leased a small restaurant on Johnson Street in December \nof 2008 and opened in February. The restaurant smokes fresh gulf fish \nand shrimp. When we could actually fish for our shrimp and get our \nfish, they got it from the gulf.\n  Their restaurant was voted best new restaurant in Acadiana and best \nlunch spot in Acadiana. Do you know how hard it is to be the best in \nLouisiana when all of our restaurants are good? These little girls, \nthese women, worked hard.\n  I want to tell the Senators from Alabama and South Dakota, they said:\n\n       We have good credit, a good business plan, but we have had \n     trouble finding capital to grow our business. I was surprised \n     credit would be so tight for a business like ours . . . \n     [because we are the best.] Our business has seven employees \n     and would like to keep growing. . . .\n\n  We need capital.\n  And this troop over here wants to tell me that the amendment that \nSenator LeMieux and I are offering is a government program? This is for \ncommunity banks. Because they want a bumper sticker to run on in this \nelection they are going to throw the small businesses under the bus? \nOver my dead body.\n  The National Bankers Association, another very liberal group:\n\n       In no segment of the U.S. economy is the need for lending \n     to small business more urgent than in the distressed \n     communities that our banks struggle to serve every day.\n\n  This recession which they did not cause--let me go back here. I feel \nlike I am in Alice in Wonderland. The Senator from Oregon is being \npatient. Let me get this straight. Big banks, some big banks on Wall \nStreet traded derivatives and entered into major risky finance deals \nthat almost wrecked the entire economy of the world. They, on that \nside, ran all around themselves when George Bush was President to throw \nmoney at them, to help them, and we have restaurants in our districts \nbegging for $10,000 to keep their doors open and they are going to \nstand there and tell this Senator that my amendment is a government \nprogram? This isn't a government program. This is trying to get money \nto Main Street.\n  If they want to vote against it, go right ahead. This is very clear. \nYou can't hide behind this. There are no 100,000 pages of this bill. It \nis a very simple program--$30 billion to community banks that are \nhealthy. It is voluntary. All you have to do is lend it to the Taco \nSisters Restaurant in Lafayette so they can continue to be the best \nrestaurant, despite the fact of the moratoria so there is a shutdown so \nthere are no more fish in the gulf that we can fish for. These \nbusinesses are still trying.\n\n  Did you hear Senator Cantwell read a story from some small business \nin her State that had to take out $60,000 on a credit card on which \nthey had to pay 50 percent interest? Do we not hear them? We are trying \nto give the private sector a solution to put capital in community banks \nso that small businesses can get a loan at a decent rate and I have to \nlisten to the ranking member of the Banking Committee say he is against \nit because it didn't go through the Banking Committee.\n  The last couple of things that came out of the Banking Committee have \nbeen a little bit problematic for me and many people, so I am glad this \ndidn't come out of the Banking committee.\n  I see the Senator from Oregon. This is in large measure because of \nthe design he has come up with, this idea, with several of my \ncolleagues. I wish I could say I did it, because it is a good one, but \nI have adopted it because I am not going to leave it on the cutting \nroom floor without a fight. It passed the House. Three Republicans \nvoted for it in the House. Interestingly enough--of course all three of \nthem are up in tough elections and I don't think they wanted to explain \nhow they could vote for TARP, vote for Wall Street, but not vote for \nsmall businesses. This could be an interesting debate on the campaign \ntrail.\n  The Senator from Oregon is here. Since he helped to actually write \nthe program--as I said, maybe it is something I am not explaining well. \nSenator Cantwell is quite the expert. Senator Merkley is quite the \nexpert. Let me turn it over to the Senator.\n  I see Senator Burris from Illinois. Let me ask unanimous consent for \nthe two of them to speak for the next 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness, and if a Republican comes we will swap back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I wish to start simply by recognizing \nthe tremendous work the chair of the Small Business Committee is doing \nin championing commonsense strategies to assist our small businesses in \nbeing the job factories that they can be if they have access to credit. \nThat is where the genesis of this bill comes from. The question we have \nheard in each of our States is: How can I, as a small business, gain \naccess to credit when the credit markets are frozen?\n  We have done precious little to assist them. So often, we need to \nindulge in far less partisanship and a lot more problem solving. If one \ninvestigates what is going on in the credit markets for small business, \none finds that the businesses have gone to their banks, and the banks \nhave said, we are cutting your credit line in half or we are \neliminating it.\n  The small business said, well, we have always made every payment. \nYes, but we are in a land of frozen credit and we cannot extend the \nsame amount of credit. When we give you that line of credit, it counts \nagainst our leverage, and we have to increase our capital holdings to \nmeet the leverage requirements. So we are taking away or cutting in \nhalf or cutting by 90 percent your line of credit.\n  At that point, the small businesses go to other banks and find out \nthe other banks are in the same position. These are community banks \nwhere often the principals know each other, they have worked together, \nthe banks want to lend, the small business wants to borrow, they can \nsee it is a profitable arrangement, but the banks are constrained by \ntheir leverage limit.\n  If there were not a credit crunch in this Nation, the bank would be \nable to recapitalize and then make additional loans. That is where we \nhad a period of irrational exuberance, now we are in a period of \nirrational fear, and people do not want to recapitalize community \nbanks, even when they are healthy.\n  Through much discussion with many thoughtful people from various \nparts of the country, various parts of the credit system, it became \nclear that the chokepoint was the capitalization of healthy community \nbanks. This is why what this provision does is it provides for the \nrecapitalization of community banks. Community banks will have to pay \nthat money back.\n  A lot of questions were raised about this point, and I want to \nclarify some of them. The first question was: What happens if a bank \nthat is going under is seeking a bunch of money to recapitalize? Will \nthis program help them? Answer: No, it will not. Because only banks \nthat have CAMEL ratings--those are ratings of how healthy they are--of \none, two or three qualify. The banks have to be healthy, because this \nis ultimately not about saving banks, this is about getting capital \ninto the hands of small business.\n  The second question that many have raised is: Well, will banks not \njust sit on the funds, and not make loans? Will they not hoard funds in \ncase they have better opportunities as the economy recovers? And the \nanswer is probably not. Because the program was designed so that when a \nbank recapitalizes in this fashion, they pay dividends. If they do not \nlend out the money, then they pay a high dividend of 7 percent. They \nare not going to make money sitting on funds in their bank and paying\n\n[[Page S6175]]\n\n7 percent. But if they make loans, then they pay a 1-percent dividend, \nso that puts them in a situation where they will make money if they \nmake loans. So they will not even ask for the money if they do not \nintend to lend it. That was a thoughtful question for some of my \ncolleagues to ask, would banks sit on these funds. It is important that \nwe design this program so that they do not. And we did.\n  A third question came: Well, does this not put taxpayer funds at \nrisk? The answer is, actually it does not, because we are not lending \nto unhealthy banks, we are capitalizing healthy banks. The \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that this will make $1 billion, \nover $1 billion for the U.S. Treasury. That estimate does not include \nthe taxes that individuals will pay on the wages they earn because \nsmall businesses are able to hire. That estimate does not include the \ntaxes that small businesses will pay on their profits which will be \nhigher when they are able to expand. So that is a bottom-line positive \nreturn that could be far larger when you take into account the impact \non employment and the success of small businesses.\n  Other folks have asked another question: Why get lending into the \nhands of our small businesses through the hands of community banks? Why \nnot create some government organization to do it? Well, very simply, \nbanks are on Main Street. It is their business to know what works and \nwhat does not work. They know the principals involved. They know the \nlocal market dynamics. You do not want to set up a government agency to \ndistribute loans when you can have the power, the knowledge, the \nwisdom, of community banks making smart decisions.\n  Then finally an additional question was asked: Well, will banks not \nmake loans that maybe are not a good bet if they have this additional \ncapitalization? Well, actually, no, they will not, because, first, they \nare not required to be recapitalized in this fashion. And if they do \nmake loans through this system, they are not guaranteed loans.\n  When you have a guaranteed loan, you are saying to someone: You bear \nno risk. But these loans are not guaranteed. This is a bank doing its \nstandard lending. In that standard lending, they make money if they \nmake good loans, and they lose money if they make bad loans. So they \nhave absolutely no incentive to lend, because if a loan goes under, the \nbank is hurt. It is all the power of a smart path to getting capital \ninto the hands of our small businesses.\n  I guess my request to all of my colleagues is to ask yourselves if we \nare going to ever get out of this recession if we do not unleash the \npower of small business in America to create jobs. Please ask yourself, \nis it possible to unleash the power of small businesses if the small \nbusinesses do not have access to credit, and, therefore, if you believe \nin small business, if you believe in job creation, if you believe in \nstrengthening communities through successful businesses and employed \nfamilies, then this plan makes a lot of sense.\n  I will close with this thought: Let's bring commonsense problem \nsolving to the challenge of putting America back on track. Let's set \npartisanship aside, let's set thoughts about the November elections \naside, and let's engage in commonsense bipartisan problem solving, and \nthis program makes all the sense in the world.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I want to echo the sentiments of the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon. His comments are very well taken.\n  I also rise to support the distinguished Senator from the great State \nof Louisiana in her efforts to deal with this amendment to add to the \nsmall business legislation, of getting this $30 billion out to the \ncommunity banks so they can put those dollars in the communities.\n  For the past 2 years, this country has been held in the grips of an \nunprecedented economic crisis.\n  The housing market collapsed. The bottom dropped out of Wall Street. \nAnd for the first time in generations, many Americans felt their hard-\nearned economic security begin to slip away.\n  Here in Washington, Members of the House and Senate were faced with a \nharsh reality: For decades, regulators and policymakers alike had \nfallen short of their responsibilities. A divisive political process \ndrove them to duck the tough issues, and kick the can down the road, \ntime and time again.\n  This failure of regulation, and the absence of political will, \nallowed Wall Street fat cats to let their greed get the better of them. \nThey gambled with our economic future. They designed complicated \nfinancial products and placed high-stakes bets against them. In short, \nthey built a house of cards, and when it finally came crashing down, \nthe American economy lay in ruins.\n  There can be no quick fixes after a disaster of this magnitude. But \nunder President Obama's leadership, our elected leaders finally took \nthe bull by the horns and did what was necessary to stop the bleeding, \nand set our country back on the road to recovery.\n  I was proud to join many of my colleagues in supporting the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act--a landmark stimulus bill that helped \nreverse the rising tide of economic misfortune. Thanks to this \nlegislation, and to the landmark legislation that was signed into law \njust yesterday, that created the most sweeping reform of Wall Street \nsince the Great Depression, we are on the road to recovery. But as \nanyone in this chamber can tell you, the real key to a full recovery is \njobs. And no sector of this economy creates jobs more effectively than \nsmall businesses.\n  Long before I ever entered public service, I was a banker. I know \nfirsthand what it takes to support our small business community because \nI have done it.\n  This is a time for bold action. Not pointless ideological battles. \nThis is a time to move forward, not back. So I call upon my colleagues \nto seize this opportunity. Let's keep America on the road to recovery \nand restore the hard-earned security of ordinary folks and small \nbusiness owners who are in desperate need of help.\n  We should start by increasing our support for small businesses, \nespecially those owned by disadvantaged and minority individuals. These \ncompanies foster progress and innovation. They have the power to create \njobs, and direct investment to local communities, where it can have the \ngreatest impact.\n  Small businesses form the backbone of our economy, but in many ways, \nthey have suffered the most as a result of this economic crisis. It is \nno secret that minority-owned businesses, particularly those in poor or \nurban areas, have been hit hardest by the current economic downturn. \nThat is why these are the areas we should target for our strongest \nsupport.\n  We can rely on a proven initiative to inject new life into \ndisadvantaged areas. So I would ask my colleagues to support the Small \nBusiness Lending Act. I would ask them to reject the tired politics \nthat got us into this mess, and embrace the spirit of bipartisanship \nthat can lead us out.\n  On behalf of small and minority-owned businesses, I call upon this \nbody to take action. Our economic future may be uncertain, but with the \nSmall Business Lending Act, we have the rare opportunity to influence \nthat future.\n  So let's pass this measure, to guarantee some degree of relief for \nthe people who continue to suffer the most.\n  Let's renew our investments in America's small businesses, and rely \non them to drive our economic recovery.\n  And let's do so today.\n  I have financed them from scratch. They would walk in to me and say, \nlook, I got an idea. I love to do this. Let's get a business plan \ntogether. Where do they get the capital from to create the jobs that \nare needed? They get it from the bank giving them credit, taking some \nequity from them, getting some investment from them. That is what I \nhave done.\n  I stand on this floor, with successful lending from banks to small \ncompanies. It created jobs. Some of them are still in business today, \nsome 40 years later. Some of them have been sold off and bought off by \nbig Fortune 500 companies. They were able to start from scratch.\n  I know what it takes in a small community to lend to small \nbusinesses. Now we are up here talking about, we are not going to put \nin resources. This is not going to cost us any money. The\n\n[[Page S6176]]\n\ntaxpayers are due to support these types of efforts. That is what we \nare here for. The purpose of government is to do for those which they \ncannot do for themselves.\n  Now we are debating on this floor whether we are going to put the \nmoney into helping small businesses, give it to the banks to lend to \nthe small businesses, so they can then go out and hire people. This \nought to be a no-nonsense vote. It makes no sense what we are doing on \nthis floor, debating this issue at this time, when this economy is in \nthis condition.\n  So having lent money to small businesses, having been a banker, where \nyour stripes depended on many good loans you made, I have been there, \nand I support this legislation 100 percent. If we can put those \nresources into those banks, that will then put them into the community, \nthe banks are not going to be out there giving this money away. This is \nnot charity. It is going make money for us. So let us wise up. Let us \nmake sure we support this amendment, pass it now, and get on to the \nbusiness of helping small businesses.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, I rise to speak about the vote that is \ncoming up soon, the Landrieu-LeMieux amendment to the small business \nbill that is before us.\n  First, I want to say that I respect tremendously both Senators. I \nhave enjoyed working with them on so many issues. Many of us in the \nCongress have worked over this last year to end the TARP that went in \nplace during a time of a financial system meltdown. I supported that, \nas did many in this body. Seventy-four Senators voted during a time of \ncritical stress in our country's financial system to put that in place.\n  I also have pushed hard to end that program as soon as it was \nunnecessary, and many of us have tried to end it. Finally that was done \nwhen the financial reform bill that passed a couple of weeks ago, or \nthis last week passed and became law yesterday.\n  A lot of times around here we go through this process of erosion; \nthat is, an idea will come up, and it is embraced for one issue, and \nthen, over time, as happened with TARP, as a matter of fact. TARP was \nthere to rescue our financial system so that small businesses, people \nall across our country, could continue to get payroll checks and do \nthose things our financial system provides.\n  Then it became perverted. Industrial policy was embraced after that, \nsomething that was not the intention of TARP. Now we have another \nperversion of that by virtue of this amendment that has been put forth. \nMany of us were very concerned about the steps that were taken under \nTARP during that crisis. We felt it was a crisis and it was necessary. \nBut in many ways, this is more insidious, because not only is the \ngovernment making an investment in final institutions across this \ncountry, it then is telling those institutions what to do with that \nmoney.\n  I know that small businesses across this country are hurting. I have \nbeen a small businessman most of my life. As a matter of fact, I still \nam a small businessperson. I still have small business interests. I \nunderstand what it means to be a small businessman. I understand what \nit means to not have access to credit, to have difficulties during \ncrises such as this. I lived through one in 1990 and 1991, and had \ngreat difficulties, as so many people are having today.\n  We have had a tremendous explosion in government involvement in the \nprivate sector, something I do not think many Americans ever expected \nto see. I think the last thing we need to do now, as Americans are \nretrenching, as the economy is beginning to grow, is to take another \nstep back in this direction.\n  I cannot more strongly object to the LeMieux-Landrieu amendment, even \nthough I respect them very much. I urge Members who believe in our \nmarket system and want to see us move ahead with a healthy economy, I \nurge all such colleagues to vote against this amendment. It is another \nstep in a direction that the majority of the country wants to move away \nfrom.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Tennessee. I \ncouldn't agree with him more that this amendment should not be adopted, \nshould not be added to the small business bill. We have had a number of \npeople coming to the floor to speak on the amendment. The Senator from \nLouisiana made a couple of observations after I spoke in opposition to \nthe amendment, one of which was that Republicans have evidently some \nnewfound affection for Elizabeth Warren. I don't think that is the \ncase. In fact, she is the rumored choice of the administration to head \nthe new Consumer Financial Protection Agency. The observation I was \nmaking was that she, who most of us perceive to be somewhat more on the \nliberal side, had made strong statements about this particular small \nbusiness lending finance program and compared it to TARP. She also \npointed out that the capital purchase program under TARP had very mixed \nresults with regard to whether it encouraged banks to participate and \nlend. It also carries with it, as TARP did, an inherent risk that \ntaxpayers may be left on the hook.\n  It has been that this will be a revenue raiser, that this, the $30 \nbillion TARP, is going to actually generate a $1 billion budget \nsurplus. The Congressional Budget Office was directed to score this \ndifferently than they were the original TARP. If the same accounting \nconventions were used and applied to this particular program and the \ncalculation including market risk, we would have a $6 billion cost \nattached to this $30 billion TARP rather than a $1 billion budget \nsavings.\n  There was the suggestion that there isn't any risk to taxpayers. \nAnytime we are putting $30 billion out there, granted, it may be well \nintended, but we all saw what happened with TARP. The expectation with \nTARP is that it will lose about $127 billion for taxpayers. We hope it \nis less, but that is the estimate today. It is fair to point out again \nthat people who come into the Chamber and believe they are voting for \nsomething other than TARP are misleading themselves. If we line this up \nwith the way the TARP was structured, side by side, it is check, check, \ncheck, right down the line. This is the same essential thing. To call \nit something else is all fine and good, but that is what it is. This is \na TARP. It is a reincarnation of TARP, intended for small businesses \nand smaller banks, which is all fine and good, but make no mistake. If \nwe vote for this, we are voting for a TARP. That poses risk to \ntaxpayers.\n  There was the suggestion that somehow I don't know what my bankers in \nSouth Dakota think. I think most of us who represent our States try to \nstay informed about the views of our constituents. I sat down with a \nnumber of my bankers 2 days ago. They were clear this is not something \nthey are advocating for nor do they need. They had other issues they \nwanted to talk about. We have not had contacts in our office advocating \nfor this. Most of us represent our States in a way that we have a \npretty good idea of what the views of our various constituencies are. \nAt least where South Dakota is concerned, this is not something South \nDakota bankers are asking me to do for them. They do have concerns \nabout the financial services reform bill passed last week and signed \ninto law. That is something they have deep concerns about. But this is \ncertainly not something they are advocating for.\n  Inasmuch as we all want to do the right thing for small businesses, \nthe best thing we can do for them is get off their backs, quit putting \ntaxes and mandates and regulations on them. They are looking at the \nprospect next year of a huge tax increase, when tax rates go up. They \nare looking at a potential new energy tax, if a cap-and-trade bill were \nto pass. They are trying to figure out what is going to happen with the \nestate tax. They already have a new health care mandate that will put \nno cost burdens on them and raise the cost of doing business. Those are \nthe types of things that will impact small businesses' ability to \ncreate jobs. Those are the things we ought to be focused on. Creating a \nnew TARP is not going to be the answer that many of my colleagues who \nsupport this amendment think it is.\n  I urge colleagues to vote against this. I suggest we look at the \nthings we can do that do impact small businesses.\n\n[[Page S6177]]\n\nMost of what we are doing in Washington right now is detrimental to \neconomic growth and job creation.\n  Mr. CORKER. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. THUNE. Certainly.\n  Mr. CORKER. I was listening to the Senator. The fact is, this \ncarries, in many ways, a greater risk. I would call this son of TARP. \nThis carries a greater risk than the original TARP because the terms \nunder which this money is given to banks is at a lesser rate. So that \nmeans the money that is paid back, there is less margin to cover \nlosses. In addition, banks can continue to lower the cost of that \ncapital by putting money out quickly to small businesses. Again, we \nlike to see small business credit expanded, but we like to see it done \nin a market and healthy way. I hope Senator Dodd will have hearings. My \nguess is he will over the next several months. But in many ways it is \nmore risky because the rates are lower. The more money we put out, \nthere is going to be a perverse incentive for banks to put money out \nquickly in ways that could be at a higher credit risk. This is far \nriskier than the first program.\n  Again, I know there are good intentions. All of us want to see small \nbusiness thrive. All of us know that 80 percent of the new jobs are \ncreated through small business. I know the Senator and I have done as \nmuch as we could while we have been here to try to get government off \nthe backs of small business.\n  What I would say to small businesses--and I don't think many of them \nsupport this, but to those that do--be careful what you ask for. Once \nthe U.S. Government gets involved in our financial system in this way, \nputting money out and then directing where it goes, we know how the \ncamel's nose under the tent works in government. We understand what it \nmeans for the Federal Government to get more involved in our community \nbanks. I know I had one in particular, when I was in Tennessee, say he \nwanted me to look at this because he wanted to use these funds to \nreplace TARP funds they had not been able to pay back yet. I don't \nthink this is a good step. I don't think there are many people who \nsupport it. I know this probably has some political mileage in this \nbody because it does address an issue we care about, small business. \nBut it is a bad idea directed at something we all support; that is, \nsmall business growth. Again, I urge rejection of this amendment.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, to the Senator's point about this perhaps \nacting as an encouragement for lenders to get money out the door \nquickly, perhaps with assuming more risk than perhaps they should, I \nwish to point out, again--and because I am quoting Elizabeth Warren, \nsomehow there was an implication earlier that Republicans have a \nnewfound affection for her, but she is someone whom the Democrats look \nto extensively when it comes to advice on these issues. As the head of \nthe congressional oversight panel, in their assessment of TARP, \nparticularly with regard to this specific program, the small business \nlending fund, they said it ``runs the risk of creating moral hazard by \nencouraging banks to make loans to borrowers who are not \ncreditworthy.''\n  This is not something that many of us are making up. Clearly, there \nare those who are very concerned that this could become not unlike what \nwe saw with the original TARP, which there are still a lot of concerns \nabout. Many of us who voted for that the first time around thought it \nwas going to end up as something different than it was. I don't think \nwe need to go down that path again.\n  Mr. CORKER. Elizabeth Warren is a smart person. There are things I \nagree with her on, and there are things I disagree with her on. But on \nthat point, I absolutely agree. If we think about the moral hazard \nissue, that means a business that wants to run its business the way \nAmerica generally has run business--on their own, they don't want to be \ninvolved in government support--they would be at a disadvantage. That \nis the other moral hazard. An institution in Tennessee or South Dakota \nthat wants to go out and lend more money to small business and goes out \nand raises equity to do so, that equity is going to cost more than \nthis. So a bank that chooses to take advantage of a government program \nactually has an advantage over a company that wants to run itself the \nway most Americans want to see small business and companies run. There \nare all kinds of moral hazards. I know the notion of small business \nattracts a lot of people. I hope people on both sides of the aisle will \nthink about this, realize how insidious this is, think about the next \nidea that comes after this. Again, it is another government investment \ninto the private sector.\n\n  We have gone from systemic risk to auto companies, to suppliers of \nauto companies. Now we are looking at going into small business. We \nsure have gone the gamut here. It is time to go the other way. \nTennesseans have spoken loudly about the fact that they don't want to \nsee any more government involvement in the private sector. It is time \nto stop it now. We thought we had it killed last week with financial \nregulation when TARP ended. Now it is raising its head again.\n  Mr. THUNE. I hope we will defeat this today because there is moral \nhazard associated with it. We want to do the right thing by small \nbusinesses. I have named several things small businesses are concerned \nabout--cap and trade, more government takeovers, more Federal spending \nand debt and higher taxes and more mandates through the health care \nbill passed earlier this year. It is important to keep in mind in this \ndebate the taxpayers. Anytime we talk about a program such as this, \nthere are inherent risks. Again, to use the accounting methodology that \nCBO used when they scored the original TARP, if they used that \naccounting convention which takes into consideration market risk, this \nprogram would be a $6 billion cost rather than a $1 billion savings, as \nproponents of the amendment advocate.\n  This is about taxpayers as well as small businesses and small banks. \nThis is not the correct way to help them. I hope our colleagues in the \nSenate will reject the amendment.\n  Mr. CORKER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Budget Deficits\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, there has been a lot of discussion on the \nfloor of the Senate in the last couple of days about small business \nlegislation and various things dealing with jobs, and clearly we need a \nlot of jobs in this country. We have gone through a very steep economic \ndecline that has victimized lots of Americans. Because of that, we have \na lot of people who are waking up in the mornings without work and \nwondering what to do next. They feel helpless and hopeless and are \ntrying to get their feet on the ground. But they need some help from \nthis Congress; that is, we do not create jobs, but we do create \nconditions under which jobs can be created by the private sector.\n  So I want to talk a little about the issue of what might give the \nAmerican people some confidence because confidence is everything. If \nthey are confident about the future, it means our economy can expand. \nIf people are not confident about the future, our economy will \ncontract. It is that simple.\n  There is no question that this country now, having gone through the \nbiggest economic downturn since the Great Depression, has the largest \nFederal budget deficits we have ever had. In the last couple of years \nthere have been enormous budget deficits. In fact, the budget was in \ndeficit by $1 trillion by the end of June in this fiscal year.\n  But our colleagues--some of whom voted for all the war funding over \nthese last years and voted for the big tax cuts to reduce the \ngovernment's revenue, and all of those issues--are now rushing to the \nfloor with everything but suspenders and proclaiming that now the \ndeficit is a big problem.\n  Well, I will tell you why it is a big problem. It is a big problem \nbecause 10 years ago a lot of folks in here decided to cut the revenue \nsteeply, and cut taxes mostly for wealthy Americans, and cut them in a \nvery significant way. So the government had less revenue. They did that \nbecause they believed we\n\n[[Page S6178]]\n\nhad budget surpluses that were going to exist for 10 years.\n  We had not had a budget surplus for 30 years in this country. We ran \ndeficits for 30 years. Then, all of a sudden, at the end of the Clinton \nadministration, we had a budget surplus of a couple hundred billion \ndollars. I am pleased about that because I voted for the economic plan \nthat helped create that. We put that in place in the middle 1990s, and \nwe got to a budget surplus.\n  When that happened, in the year 2000 we had a bunch of folks say, \nwhen a new President came into office in 2001: Do you know what? We \nhave a budget surplus. We have a bunch of hotshot economists telling us \nwe are going to have budget surpluses as far as the eye can see. We are \ngoing to have budget surpluses for the next 10 years.\n  Then Alan Greenspan, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said \nhe could not sleep because he was worried we were going to have \nsurpluses too large and we were going to pay down the Federal debt too \nquickly. That is right. I know it sounds like a joke, but the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve Board worried we would pay down our debt too \nquickly.\n  So the President came to town in 2001 and said: Let's have very big \ntax cuts, and I and others said: Let's probably not do that because at \nthis point we don't know what is going to happen for 10 years. We had \neconomists who could not remember their telephone number for 3 hours \ntelling us what was going to happen for 10 years.\n  So they said: We are going to have 10 years of surpluses. Let's have \nvery big tax cuts. So the President constructed very big tax cuts, \nmostly for the wealthy, and here we are. What happened as a result of \nthat? Well, almost immediately we were in a recession in 2001. Then we \nhad a terrorist attack against this country in September of that year. \nThen we were at war in Afghanistan and at war in Iraq and in a war \nagainst terrorists.\n  So we sent hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of \nsoldiers abroad, and we rotated them in and out for 8 years and never \npaid for a penny of it because the President said: We are going to \nspend emergency funding, which means we do not pay for it; we just put \nit on the debt. We did that for a decade.\n  Now, all of a sudden, all the people who voted for the same things--\nthat is, tax cuts for the wealthy and deciding to send soldiers to war \nwithout paying for it--now we hear all this bloviation about how the \ndebt is important. Well, yes, it is important. It was important when \nthey voted to cut taxes for the wealthy as well. It was important when \nwe decided to fight two wars and not pay for a penny of it. The fact \nis, it is unsustainable now, and we have to find ways to fix it.\n  It is interesting, yesterday, I came to the Senate floor because one \nof my colleagues came to the floor and said the priority is to \neliminate the estate tax. That is the priority. He did not say that. He \nsaid ``eliminate the death tax'' because a clever pollster said: If you \nsay ``death tax,'' it invokes a lot of passion. So we are going to \neliminate the death tax--not understanding, apparently, or not caring, \nperhaps, that there is no such thing as a death tax.\n  When you die, there is no tax on your death. In fact, had I been on \nthe Senate floor when my colleague mentioned that--I know my colleague \nis married--so I would have asked: God forbid something should happen \nto you. But if it did, tell me what would happen to your estate because \nI know the answer.\n  The answer is, his spouse would inherit the estate, no matter how \nlarge, tax free, because we have a 100-percent spousal exemption. So \nthat Senator's death would have, obviously, been nontaxable.\n  So where is the death tax? We do not have a death tax. We never had a \ndeath tax. We have a tax on inherited wealth. That is what we have. So \nmy colleague said, the most important thing at the moment, while we are \ndeep in debt in the country--and with a growing debt and a need to \ncontrol the debt--the most important thing at the moment is to get rid \nof the death tax, which means you want to provide tax breaks for \nbillionaires.\n  I did not vote for the proposal in 2001 that put us on a course of \nchanging our tax system with very large tax cuts for the wealthy and \nreducing the estate tax obligation so that it came down to having zero \nestate taxes in 2010 and then spring back to a higher estate tax in \n2011. I did not vote for that. I thought it was about half nutty. But \nit passed. Enough people thought, apparently, it was OK, so they voted \nfor it.\n  So now, last year, we had an estate tax that had an exemption of $7 \nmillion for husband and wife--$3.5 million each--and a 45-percent rate.\n  This year, the estate tax went to zero; that is, nobody has to pay \nany estate tax. So we have had four billionaires die this year. The \nlate George Steinbrenner died, the owner of the Yankees. So his estate \nwill not be taxed--well over $1 billion.\n  I have said, this is the ``throw mama from the train year.'' You know \nthe movie ``Throw Mama from the Train.'' This is the year--if somebody \nhas to go, I guess, especially billionaires, they get to pay no taxes \nthis year. Then the estate tax is supposed to spring back to a $1 \nmillion exemption, husband and wife, and a 55-percent rate.\n  So my colleague and others now say the highest priority for them is \nto eliminate the death tax. This year, we will have lost about $15 \nbillion in revenue because there is no estate tax. That is just this \nyear. Over 10 years, it is a very substantial amount.\n  Who is going to benefit if you eliminate the estate tax? Well, if \nunder last year's law you had to have $7 million in total assets to pay \nan estate tax, how many people would pay it? Very few, less than 1 \npercent. In fact, I think it is three-tenths of 1 percent of the \nAmerican people would ever pay an estate tax. Now we are told the \nhighest priority is to eliminate the estate tax, which means that \nAmerica's billionaires are going to be given a tax break, and those who \nwant to do it say we want to do that because they should not be taxed \ntwice. Well, they are not taxed twice.\n\n  That estate, in most cases, has never borne a tax. Most of it is \ngrowth appreciation from stocks or bonds or property and has never \nborne the tax that most people have to pay.\n  A lot of people get up in the morning and put on their clothes and go \nto work, and they work at a manufacturing job all day--although there \nare fewer these days because we are moving those jobs to China--but \nthey get up and go to work and then they come home and they have \nwithholding on their paychecks and it says they paid taxes. They have \nto pay taxes for kids to go to school and to build roads and to pay for \nthe police and to pay for the Defense Department and so on--the Centers \nfor Disease Control. They have to bear a burden as an American citizen \nto help pay for the things we have together.\n  But if we eliminate the estate tax, we say to, for example, Bill \nGates--when Bill Gates expires--that $50-some billion or $60-some \nbillion of yours, most of which has never had any kind of a tax burden \nat all, we believe it ought to be tax free. That is the highest \npriority?\n  I used the word ``nutty'' before. Let me state again that is just \nnutty. What are you thinking?\n  Here is something I quoted yesterday from Will Rogers. Will Rogers, \n80 years ago, had it right, and it certainly applies to some in this \nChamber for sure. Will Rogers said:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we'll get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.\n\n  Well--do you know what?--go back about 18 months and just figure out \nwho got fixed up in this country, who got fixed up OK. Do you think the \nfolks at the top of the economic ladder get fixed up? Yes, yes. In \nfact, the lowest unemployment rate in America is those at the top of \nthe economic ladder.\n  There is a pretty low unemployment rate actually in the Senate, now \nthat I think of it. We all get up in the morning and put on a white \nshirt and a suit and a tie, and we all eat three meals a day.\n  But the people at the bottom of the economic ladder--those 5 million \nAmericans who have lost the manufacturing jobs, the people who are \nlooking for jobs and cannot find them, when we are 20 million jobs \nshort; the people who have been laid off, professional people who, in \nmany cases, were laid off and have been searching for work for 2 years \nand cannot find it--they are the people who seem somehow forgotten.\n\n[[Page S6179]]\n\n  So now we have a priority by some in this Chamber of saying we have \nto get rid of the death tax--a tax that does not exist. In a bill they \nfiled that would only benefit largely billionaires in this country. It \nis unbelievable. It is just unbelievable.\n  I do not know, maybe the people who are out of work need to change \ntheir names. There are names that signify wealth, at least it sounds \nlike they are from a family that inherited wealth. But it just seems to \nme to be something that is pretty much in sync with what Will Rogers \nsaid a long time ago in terms of what is happening here. The people at \nthe top get fixed up pretty well, and the rest do not matter much. That \nis a pretty pathetic set of priorities, in my judgement.\n\n\n                        Tribal Law and Order Act\n\n  Mr. President, I want to say a word about a piece of legislation the \nSenate has passed and the House has passed and ought to make all of us \nfeel as if we have done something very admirable and something that is \ngoing to save lives. So let me do that in a very positive way.\n  The Tribal Law and Order Act, which we passed--I passed, along with a \nlot of help from the Indian Affairs Committee, and the Senate passed--\nnow the House has passed that legislation. That will now be signed by \nthe President into law.\n  Why is that important? Well, let me give you an example. On the \nStanding Rock Sioux Indian Reservation--that straddles North Dakota and \nSouth Dakota--the rate of violent crime is not double or triple the \nnational rate of violent crime. That would be pretty tough to live in a \nneighborhood where you have double or triple the national rate of \nviolent crime. It is eight times the rate of violent crime for the rest \nof the country.\n  Live in that circumstance. Be a young child going to school or be an \nelder trying to get along and live in a neighborhood, live on a \nreservation, live in a circumstance where the rate of violent crime is \neight times the national average. The stories we have heard at the \nhearings we have held are unbelievable.\n  On the Standing Rock Sioux Indian Reservation--it is almost the size \nof the State of Connecticut--they had nine full-time police officers to \npatrol over two million acres of land. It is not possible to do a good \njob with so few officers. In one area of that reservation, a violent \nsexual rape, a crime in progress, a robbery, and a call to the police \nmight get someone there later that day, or it might be the next \nmorning, or days later--nine police officers to patrol that land 24/7. \nThat does not work.\n  We have passed a piece of legislation that I think is very good, the \ntribal law and order bill. It is bipartisan. I am proud of that. \nSenators Jon Kyl and John Barrasso worked with me to get this \nlegislation through the Senate. Let me mention cosponsors Jon Tester, \nMax Baucus, Mark Begich, Michael Bennet, Jeff Bingaman, Barbara Boxer, \nMaria Cantwell, Mike Crapo, Al Franken, Tim Johnson, Joe Lieberman, \nJeff Merkley, Lisa Murkowski, Patty Murray, Debbie Stabenow, John \nThune, Mark Udall, Tom Udall, Ron Wyden--so many. But there are so many \nwho worked so long to try to respond to these problems.\n  The legislation deals with cross-deputization of law enforcement \nofficers on Indian reservations and those off the reservation. We deal \nwith the tribal court system and a wide range of provisions that we put \nin this legislation that are going to make a very big difference.\n  I have said on the floor previously that violence against American \nIndian and Alaska Native women has reached epidemic levels. We have \nheard it in the hearings and the testimony. One in three American \nIndian and Alaska Native women will be the victim of rape during her \nlifetime--one in three. That is an epidemic of violence.\n  We held 14 hearings in the Committee on Indian Affairs, which I \nchair, relating to public safety on Indian lands over the past 3 years. \nI had staff go across the Nation consulting with tribal governments and \nlocal law enforcement. Based on those consultations, we put together a \npiece of legislation that I think will make a very big difference. It \nstrengthens the tribal justice system. It provides tools to law \nenforcement officers on the Indian reservations.\n  It will require the U.S. Attorney's Office to do its job. Violent \ncrimes on Indian reservations are to be prosecuted by the U.S. \nAttorney's Offices, and in most cases those offices are many, many \nmiles away from a reservation. Crime on Indian reservations becomes \njust a part of the backwater of work in those offices. We have \ninformation that 50 percent of murder cases on Indian reservations are \ndeclined for prosecution. They call them declinations. Think of that. \nIn 50 percent of the cases, there is a declination of prosecution for \nthe charge of murder. Nearly three-fourths of the cases for sexual \nassault are declined to be prosecuted. That is not fair, it is not \ntolerable, and we shouldn't stand for it.\n  We had a hearing with Chairman Herman Dillon of the Puyallup Tribe in \nWashington, who testified about the gang activity crisis on their \nreservation. There are 28 active gangs on that reservation, with \nmembers as young as 8 years old. The gangs are involved in drug \ntrafficking, weapons sales, and turf wars where innocent bystanders are \ninjured. This piece of legislation is going to increase the number of \nlaw enforcement personnel on reservations and provide better law \nenforcement training for those personnel.\n  I won't go through the stories we have heard, but they are \nunbelievable. There are a whole lot of victims out there living in \nThird World conditions on Indian reservations where they have \ninadequate health care, housing, and education. We have worked on all \nof those issues.\n  I am proud to say we passed the Indian Health Care Improvement Act \nearlier this year. It is now signed into law. We did that this year. It \nis the first time in 17 years that the Congress has dealt with those \nissues.\n  Now we have passed the Tribal Law and Order Act. This is the most \nsignificant of policy changes and legislation affecting the first \nAmericans that has been passed in decades. I want to say to my \nRepublican and Democratic colleagues who worked with me to accomplish \nthis that I believe lives will be saved because of this legislation. I \nbelieve this will make a profound difference across this country in \naddressing these critical issues.\n  We have had hearings about Mexican drug cartels now running drugs \nthrough Indian reservations. I just described the circumstances of \ngangs.\n  There is so much that needs to be done. Finally, at last--at long, \nlong last--we start down the road of improvement by having passed this \nlegislation. I talked to President Obama yesterday and mentioned the \npassage by the U.S. House of our bill. He campaigned on this issue. It \nwas very strongly supported legislation, and I know he will take great \npride in signing it.\n  Finally, with all of the competition and tension, sometimes, between \nthe House and the Senate, let me say how much I appreciate the work the \nHouse of Representatives did on this legislation.\n  Let me make one final point about Indian policy as I complete my \nstatement. There is one other issue that is out there that I think \ndesperately needs to be resolved, and that is something called the \nCobell lawsuit. It has been languishing for 15 years. Last December, \nthere was an agreement reached between the U.S. Government and the \nIndians in the Cobell case. We were given 30 days in the Congress to \napprove the settlement, and it has not happened. We must, must, must \nfind a way to make that happen soon.\n  I showed a picture of a woman living on an Indian reservation with \noil wells that were hers that she could see from her house, and she \nlived in a very small house. Why is that the case? Because she didn't \nget the money from the oil wells she owned. The U.S. Government created \ntrust accounts for Indians, and manipulated those trusts, stole from \nthose trusts, lost the records from those trusts over 150 years, and \nthat is what resulted in this lawsuit called the Cobell lawsuit. It has \ngone on for 15 years, and a good many Indians have died while that \nlawsuit has gone on who should have benefitted from that lawsuit.\n  There was a settlement agreement reached last December between the \nparties. We were given 30 days by the Federal court to approve the \nagreement, and now it is 6 months later and\n\n[[Page S6180]]\n\nnothing has happened. The first Americans don't deserve this treatment. \nI hope very soon that the Cobell settlement will be a part of a piece \nof legislation that is passed by the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I don't think we are under any time \nagreement. I think the leadership is coming to talk about how we might \nvote tonight because we have a couple of very important votes to make \ntonight, if I could speak for the next 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, before I speak about the underlying \namendment, the small business amendment----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I apologize for interrupting the Senator. I didn't catch \nwhat she said about votes. Has there been a decision made about votes?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I don't have the final details, but I understand we \nwill be voting sometime tonight, in the near future, on several \ndifferent amendments that have to do with potentially the supplemental \nbill and potentially the small business bill, but the good Senator \nmight wish to check with somebody a little above my pay grade.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, that is actually fairly specific, though. It was \nsometime later about some things. I appreciate the Senator for \nresponding to me.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I am just in charge of one amendment, but I thank the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have spent the better part of this day \non the floor with many of my colleagues speaking about the small \nbusiness jobs bill that is so important, and I would like to give \ncredit to some of my Republican colleagues. They have worked very hard \non portions of this bill, and I am very grateful. A portion of it came \nout of the Small Business Committee with a lot of bipartisan support; a \nportion came out of the Finance Committee with bipartisan support; and \nthis amendment I am offering is a bipartisan amendment. Senator \nLeMieux, the Senator from Florida--in fact, both Senators from Florida \nhave been extremely supportive. The Senator from Florida and I are the \nlead sponsors of an amendment that has over a dozen cosponsors. The \nPresiding Officer, a member of the Small Business Committee, is a \ncosponsor of our amendment, and I am so grateful to the Senator from \nIllinois for his input into the bill.\n\n  This is a very important amendment to the small business package. The \nHouse has already voted on the package of the small business bill. They \nhad a strong vote, and it was a bipartisan vote. Three Republicans \nvoted in the House, including my own Congressman from the city of New \nOrleans, and the Congressman from Delaware and the Congressman from \nNorth Carolina also voted for the small business package with the three \ncomponents: the $12 billion tax cut for small business--and they most \ncertainly need it--the other part which strengthens the Small Business \nAdministration's programs, and they voted for the Small Business \nLending Fund.\n  So that bill, of course, has come over here. Because there was really \ninexplicable opposition from many of the Republicans, we have had to go \ninto a little different strategy, offering the lending fund amendment \nseparately. I am very confident we will have the 60 votes because \nSenator LeMieux has stepped up from Florida. I see the other great \nSenator from Florida on the floor, who has been a great supporter of \nthis amendment. What they know, what I know, what Senator Cantwell \nknows, what Senator Merkley knows, what the Presiding Officer knows is \nthat without this amendment, small businesses throughout America are \nstill going to have a very difficult time getting the capital they need \nto expand and grow.\n  Small businesses did not cause this economic meltdown. Our community \nbanks did not cause this economic meltdown. The ripoffs, the meltdown, \nthe dysfunction of our financial system was caused by big banks that \ntook risky positions on instruments they couldn't explain, and then \nthey made up more, and the system collapsed like a house of cards. But \ndo we know who is paying the price, unfortunately, besides the \ntaxpayers? Small businesses and our community banks.\n  Hundreds and hundreds of letters have come from the community banks. \nThis one we will put up said:\n\n       Majority Leader Reid, Minority Leader McConnell, on behalf \n     of 5,000 members of the Independent Community Bankers, I \n     write to urge you to retain the Small Business Lending Fund \n     in the Small Business Jobs Act. The Small Business Lending \n     Fund is the core component of this legislation and the \n     provision that holds the most promise for small business job \n     creation in the near term. Failure to even consider the SBLF \n     in the Senate would be a missed opportunity that our \n     struggling economy cannot afford.\n       The Nation's nearly 8,000 community banks are prolific \n     small business lenders.\n\n  A report I submitted for the Record earlier said this: We gave--and \nmany Republicans in this Chamber gave--lots of money to the big banks. \nDo my colleagues know what they did? They cut their lending to small \nbusiness. These small banks that hardly got anything from TARP tried to \nkeep lending the best they could. But then we sent them more \nregulations, their capital is getting squeezed, and if we don't provide \nadditional capital to healthy banks, we are not going to get lending to \nsmall business. That is what these community bankers are saying.\n  The opposition has come to the floor and said this is TARP II. Let me \nsay again, this is for Main Street. We have a Main Street sign. This is \nfor Main Street. This is for small business. TARP is the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, $700 billion for big banks on Wall Street. This is a \nMain Street program for healthy banks to lend to small businesses that \nare on Main Street. It is a $30 billion program that will earn, \naccording to the CBO, $1 billion. It doesn't cost the taxpayer as TARP \ndid; it saves the taxpayer money, and it actually puts $1.1 billion \ninto the Treasury at the end of 10 years. That is what the CBO score \nsaid.\n  Two people came down--one, Senator Snowe, for whom I have a lot of \nrespect, and the other, the Senator from South Dakota--both came down \nand said: But our estimate is that it will cost $6 billion. I \nappreciate their estimates, but the only estimate we go by in this \nChamber is CBO. They are entitled to their own estimates, but I want \npeople to know that the only score that matters is the official CBO \nscore. We have the official CBO score. It doesn't cost money; it makes \n$1.1 billion. They are entitled to their opinion.\n  So it is not TARP, it does not cost the taxpayer money, and it most \ncertainly is not a bailout for banks. It is a help to small banks.\n  The other thing I heard--and I see the Senator from Michigan, and I \nknow she wishes to speak on this as well, and potentially the Senator \nfrom Florida--the other amazing argument I heard from the Senator from \nSouth Dakota was that this is another Democratic government program. I \ntold the Senator from South Dakota--with all due respect, through the \nChair, I said: If we had to take out the words ``big government,'' \n``taxes,'' and ``regulations,'' nobody on the other side could finish a \nsentence. This is not a government program; this is a program to give \ncapital to community banks.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, there was a version of this that came \nto my attention, as the Senator from Michigan will know, that said: \nLet's not go through community banks. Let's do the direct lending. \nLet's just give it to the Small Business Administration, $30 billion, \nand let them lend to small businesses because some banks are lending, \nsome banks aren't. Small businesses are so desperate. All they have is \nhigh-interest-rate credit cards. Let's do direct lending.\n  And silly me said: You know, we really want bipartisan support for \nthis, and I just don't think I am going to be able to convince one \nRepublican--even though I think it might work, I don't think I am going \nto be able to convince them to go through a direct lending program for \nthe government.\n  So I had to go tell about 10 Democrats who were very upset: I am \nsorry, I don't think we can do that. But I do think we can do a private \nsector lending approach that might work.\n  So I have to sit here and listen to some Republicans come to the \nfloor today and say to me that this is not a\n\n[[Page S6181]]\n\nprivate sector approach. It is ludicrous. It is, on its face, a private \nsector approach.\n  These are not banks run by the government. These are private sector \nbanks, run by our friends in our communities. We see them at the \nKiwanis, Rotary, in church and synagogues; we talk to them every day. \nBut the Republicans don't want to help community banks and small \nbusinesses.\n  The same Senator, from South Dakota, who came down here to say this \nwas like TARP, voted for TARP. This isn't TARP. This is a program to \nhelp small business.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan--and we are going to vote in a \nminute.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I yield to the cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I would like the Senator from Louisiana to \nunderscore the fact that the $30 billion put into this lending program, \nwhich will inure to the benefit of small business, is going to end up \nmultiplying like the fishes and the loaves; it will end up being worth, \nover that 10-year period, $300 billion.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator also agree that when you \nlook at the list of all the institutions that support this lending \nfacility, they are some of what we would think of as the most \nconservative organizations, and they are very much in favor of this?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Including the Florida Bankers Association, \nincluding the Community Bankers Association--because they know what it \nis. They got dissed on the big TARP--which some of us voted against--\neven when we tried to carve out little portions for small business, and \nit never worked because the banks would not lend the money; and now we \nare going to create a program specifically targeted to help small \nbusiness through community banks.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely. The Senator is correct. He refers to this \nlong list, which I have read several times on the floor. It is quite \nlengthy. These are not liberal organizations. They are not even \nDemocratic or Republican organizations. They are business \norganizations, including the American Apparel and Footwear Association, \nthe Arkansas Community Bankers, American Bankers Association, the \nMarine Retailers--these are conservative-to-center organizations. This \nisn't the Sierra Club. These are conservative organizations that are \nsupporting this.\n  This is a private sector approach. It is $30 billion that will \nmultiply to $300 billion. We have boxes of letters from small \nbusinesses saying all they have--as the Senator from Michigan knows--is \nthe credit cards that they have to pay 16 to 20 percent on. Senator \nCantwell almost choked me up when she said that one of the businesses \nin her State had to take out a loan at 50 percent. How do you make \nmoney when you are borrowing money at 50 percent interest?\n  We have a program where they can walk down the street and go to their \ncommunity banks and borrow not from the payday lenders but from the \ncommunity bank. The Republican caucus wants to tell us this is like \nTARP so they can put a bumper sticker on their car for the election.\n  The Senator from Florida is correct. There are any number of \nconservative organizations from all of their States that are supporting \nthis.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Senator from Louisiana for her tireless \nadvocacy and leadership in getting us to this point, because this is \nabsolutely critical for small businesses, certainly in Michigan and \nacross the country. I know we talked about it before.\n  Isn't it true that when we look at job growth--and this is a jobs \nbill, I am sure the Senator agrees--small businesses are creating the \njobs? Would she not agree, as well, that when we look at manufacturing \nin my State, the suppliers are small businesses? So what we are talking \nabout here is growing jobs. Would the Senator agree and speak about the \nfact that this is about jobs, about the fact that the majority of the \njobs are coming from small business, and these are the folks who didn't \ncause the financial crisis, and they didn't create the recklessness on \nWall Street? They got hit by it, along with our community bankers who \ndidn't cause it; would the Senator agree?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Absolutely, this is a jobs bill. The Senator from \nMichigan represents a State that has been one of the hardest hit \nStates, the automobile industry. She has firsthand experience there. \nShe knows these numbers as well as I do: From 1993 to 2009, 65 percent \nof jobs have been created by small business, and only 35 percent of the \njobs were created by big business.\n  If some people are wondering why this recovery seems to be a jobless \nrecovery, it is because it is. Big businesses have a lot of profit \nright now. Has anybody noticed that the stock market is going up? They \nare sitting on their cash. Has anybody noticed what Goldman Sachs \nreported lately? They did very well out of this.\n  If you want a recovery with jobs, where people can actually go to \nwork, earn a paycheck, and pay taxes to help us get out of this \ndeficit, and stimulate demand, you better support this. I am so tired \nof hearing the other side, I say to the Senator from Michigan, when \nthey come down here and say: But the NFIB says that there is no demand.\n  First of all, the National Federation of Independent Business did not \nsay that. So to their credit, I want to say on their behalf--although \nthey have not come out strongly in support, they are not opposing, they \nare neutral--their own survey said that 40 percent of NFIB'S \nmembership--a very conservative organization--said they didn't need any \nmoney. But that leaves 60 percent who said they could not get the loans \nthey had asked for.\n  So this whole argument that says there is no demand--I want the \nSenators who vote against this to go back and try to give a speech on \nMain Street. I challenge you, all of you who might consider voting \n``no'' on this amendment, I want to see you go home and stand on any \nMain Street and try to say to your people--look them straight in the \neye and say: We know down here there is no demand. Nobody needs any \nmoney because nobody is selling anything, and there is no demand.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, I yield for that purpose.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask the question to underscore what the \nSenator from Louisiana has just said, which is that small business, \nwhich is the mainstay of the economic engine in so many of our States--\ncertainly, that is true with Florida, as a matter of fact--the \ntechnological ingenuity of America often comes out of small business \nfirms. How many times have we heard in our townhall meetings or in \nmeetings with elected officials back in our States, the people who are \nbeing starved to death are the small businesses, because the banks \nwon't lend? The big banks don't give them a break, and they are going \nout of business. They could have hired or doubled their employment. The \ncommunity bankers want to lend, but they feel that the regulators have \nclamped down on them and this program--if it can multiply to $300 \nbillion of lending for small business over the next 10 years, at a \nminimum, isn't that the kind of jumpstart we need to provide jobs and \nget this economy moving again?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes. It will create many jobs, and maybe we can then \nhave a recovery that has jobs associated with it. That is the effort. \nWe have fashioned this so that it is going to make money for the \nTreasury. It is not related to TARP funding. It is only for community \nbanks. It is only for small business.\n  I see the Senator from Michigan. I wish to yield time to her, if she \nwishes to speak, and then the Senator from Oregon and the Senator from \nWashington wish to speak as well.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee, for her leadership and her passion.\n  I could not agree more. We have to focus on jobs. When you support \nsmall business, both the underlying bill and the changes, in terms of \ntax cuts for small business, as well as this provision, this is a great \nopportunity for us to support small businesses in this country, where \nthe majority of jobs are created.\n\n[[Page S6182]]\n\n  Every time I go home, as the Senator from Florida mentioned, I am \napproached by small businesses that cannot get capital and cannot get \nthe loans they need or get their line of credit extended. This is \nabsolutely critical for us.\n  In addition, I thank Senators Klobuchar and LeMieux for their export \npromotion piece, which is equally important. When we look at \nopportunities for small business and the opportunity to support their \nefforts to sell their products overseas in a global economy, this is \nalso about creating jobs. I had the opportunity not long ago to be in \nBeijing, China, at the global auto leaders summit. I heard from people \nwith the Foreign Commercial Service that they needed more assistance. \nIf they had more staff, they would be able to support more businesses \nbeing able to sell into China.\n  We want, in this global economy, to be exporting our products, not \nour jobs. So focusing on exports and supporting what the President has \ncalled for--doubling exports in the next 5 years--creates jobs as well.\n  I again thank Senators Klobuchar and LeMieux for their efforts on \nexports, and I thank Senator LeMieux and Senator Landrieu for the \namendment as it relates to the lending authority. All of this adds up--\nall of this together, the underlying bill, with tax cuts, support for \nsmall businesses, which have seen collateral depreciate, and the \nefforts that we can provide to be able to support them to get loans \nthrough a collateral assistance program, the loan program, which is, in \nmy judgment, a core provision, and then adding exports--all of it \ntogether is a jobs bill.\n  This is a fundamental jobs bill for small businesses all across the \ncountry. I urge colleagues to come together. I can't think of anything \nmore bipartisan or anything that should be more bipartisan than a focus \non American small businesses. This amendment is at the heart of that.\n  I strongly urge a very strong bipartisan vote.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see several Members on the floor. I am \ngoing to speak for 2 minutes, and then Senator Klobuchar for 1 minute, \nand Senator Merkley for 10; and if somebody else comes, we will put \nthem in the queue. Senator LeMieux may want to add a word.\n  I ask unanimous consent for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. This says: Is small business credit in a deep \nrecession? This is the NFIB. They are one of the most conservative \nbusiness organizations. I want to read to you their executive summary. \nIt says:\n\n       Forty percent of small businessowners attempting to borrow \n     in 2009 had all of their credit needs met.\n\n  Forty percent.\n\n       Ten percent had most of their needs met.\n\n  Let's say that 50 percent had most of their needs met. That means \nthat 50 percent of the 27 million small businesses in America did not \nhave their needs met.\n  This is not the Sierra Club here. This is the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, one of the most conservative business groups. I \ndon't know who wants to come to the floor and say they don't know what \nthey are talking about. I think they do on this subject, and on others. \nI don't agree with them on everything, but they are very legitimate \nwhen it comes to what their members say. They said that 50 percent did \nnot get their needs met. The financial institutions extending lines of \ncredit during 2009, when the country was operating at a high level--the \nsame survey--a few years earlier, before the recession, said that 90 \npercent of businesses were finding the credit they needed. That is why \nwe were having great economic times, because small business could get \ncredit.\n  This is economics 101. This is not complicated. Right now small \nbusinesses have credit card debt up to here. They are paying 16 and 24 \npercent. Maybe that makes the other side happy. They have no equity in \ntheir homes to borrow, and here we have a provision trying to give \ncommunity banks some capital, healthy small banks to lend to small \nbusinesses.\n  We know there is a need. Fifty percent of NFIB's own membership says \nthey cannot get the money they need, and we have to fight?\n  I see the Senator from Minnesota. She has a very important part of \nthis amendment. I would like to turn the floor over to her.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Landrieu for her great \nleadership on this bill.\n  What I have heard over and over from small businesses in my State is \nthey want to know how come Wall Street is doing OK right now and they \nare still struggling. Somebody once said that it is like Wall Street \ngot a cold and Main Street got pneumonia. They are still having \ntrouble. Yet 65 percent of the jobs in this country come from small \nbusinesses.\n  When I look at the big businesses in Minnesota, such as Medtronic, it \nstarted as a little business in a garage. The Mayo Clinic started with \ntwo doctors starting a practice together. 3M started as a sandpaper \ncompany up in Two Harbors, MN. Big businesses start as small \nbusinesses, and we need to help them.\n  I support all the work that is done with getting the credit out \nthere. I did want to note the important part of this amendment that was \nput together by myself and Senator LeMieux to help with exports. \nNinety-five percent of the customers of this country right now are \noutside our borders, and 30 percent of small businesses say: If we \ncould export, we would love to do it. We just don't have the people who \nspeak the language who work for us. We only have five employees or we \ndon't have the contacts to export our goods to Turkey. We don't have a \nfull-time trade person.\n  Having some help for them so they can talk with people at the \nCommerce Department to figure out are these real customers, simply get \non the computer and call our embassies. Those embassies should be their \nembassies, not just for big business. They should be the embassies for \nsmall and medium businesses too.\n  We are hopeful. This is a bipartisan amendment with a lot of support. \nIt is going to help jobs in America. I hope we can get this passed \nbecause it is incredibly important to small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate those remarks. A portion of \nthe LeMieux-Landrieu amendment is to step up exports.\n  The Senator from Oregon has been one of the key designers of this \nprogram. He is going to speak about a very important point that we have \nbeen debating today. That point is this oversight report that was \nwritten by Elizabeth Warren, who now seems to be a very good friend of \nthe other side. She wrote this report, and they held it up saying we \nhave to listen to Elizabeth Warren. It is very interesting because I \nthink they have had some problems with what she has been doing. \nNonetheless, they think this report bolsters their argument.\n  I ask the Senator from Oregon to comment about this report because I \nthink it has been misrepresented. I am confident it has been \nmisrepresented. It basically says it is inconclusive. They are not sure \nthis program is going to work. I will tell you who is sure this program \nis going to work: our community bankers, our small business \nassociations that have written thousands of letters. Is anyone opening \ntheir mail?\n  I am not going to listen to a bunch of bureaucrats up here who are \nnot sure something is going to work. I would like to listen to the \nhometown folks, and that is what this amendment is about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I came to the floor earlier to talk about \na number of concerns that had been raised and how those did not \nactually fit the bill. One of those concerns was that banks would \nsimply sit on the funds, which is not the case because there is \nincentive to lend. Another concern is there would be capitalization of \nfailing banks, which is not the case because ratings are being applied \nso that capitalization only goes to healthy banks.\n  The point is not to save banks. The point is to get lending, to get \ncapital into the hands of small businesses. I went through a number of \nthose concerns.\n\n[[Page S6183]]\n\n  Since I left the floor, there were three more issues that were raised \nby those who have concerns about the program. I wished to come back and \naddress those issues.\n  One issue that was raised by a colleague is he said this program will \nhave the government saying where to send money, what businesses will \nget money. In fact, no, not at all because similar to any \ncapitalization of a small bank, the bank decides where to send money. \nThat is the beauty of this public-private partnership; we are \nchanneling, we are connecting to the power and wisdom of the small \nbanks that understand the economy on their Main Street, that understand \nthe reputation and capabilities of the folks who are asking for the \nloans, that understand the local economic dynamics. That is the duty. \nIt is small banks that do what they do very well, which is decide where \nit is smart to invest and not invest.\n  A second concern that was raised since I last left the floor was that \nthis would create a rush to lend. I think maybe the speaker had some \npicture in his mind that the moment a small bank got capitalized, they \nwould immediately be judged on how much they had loaned out and that \ntheir rate of dividends would be set on that and, therefore, they would \njust throw the money out the door.\n  I wanted to make sure folks understood the basic mechanism in this \nbill. It works like this: For every 2.5 percent incremental increase in \nloans made by small and medium banks, the dividend would be reduced by \n1 percent. This is the key phrase: The enumerated loans would be \nmonitored for a 2-year period, starting on the date of the investment. \nBased on the lending rate at the end of that 2-year period, the \ndividend rate would be locked in and the bank would benefit from this \nattractive rate for the next 3 years.\n  If a bank seeks some funds to be recapitalized, it has a full 2 years \nto get loans out the door and needs to do so only at a rate of 2.5 to \n1; whereas, we know a lot of banks will leverage that at 10 to 1. This \nis a modest standard and certainly nothing that would impel a rush.\n  The third critique that was raised said this report--I hold up the \ncover, the ``May Oversight Report, Small Business Credit Crunch and the \nImpact of TARP,'' said there was a moral hazard in the structure of a \nsmall business lending fund. Let's find the language in the report and \nanalyze what was actually being said. We will find it on page 77. Feel \nfree to look it up.\n  In this report, it is going through a series of issues and saying: \nOK, this is something worth considering. That is why we value these \nkinds of reports because they point out the challenges we might be \nfacing and allows us to design legislation to work better.\n  This report notes:\n\n       A capital infusion program that provides financial \n     institutions with cheap capital and a penalty for banks that \n     do not increase lending runs the risk of creating moral \n     hazard by encouraging banks to make loans to borrowers who \n     are not creditworthy.\n\n  Then it goes on to answer that critique:\n\n       Although, in the legislation, the carrot . . . is arguably \n     stronger than the stick. . . .\n\n  It is an incentive system rather than a penalty system.\n  Then it goes on to note further, and it received feedback from \nTreasury:\n\n       . . . the SBLF was designed to minimize the chances that \n     banks will use the capital to make risky bets.\n\n  Why is that?\n\n       The program does not shift risk away from the banks that \n     receive the capital: any institution that receives funds \n     under the SBLF is obligated to repay that money to Treasury \n     and therefore will lose money if it makes a bad loan.\n\n  I made this point earlier that unlike a guaranteed loan program where \nit does not matter if you make a bad judgment, in this case, it is the \nbanks themselves putting at risk their own profits, utilizing their \nbest judgments.\n  I think it is appropriate that folks come to the floor and say: I \nwant to oppose this bill because it has this problem and this problem. \nThat is the value of debate. Others can come to the floor and say: \nActually, it is not designed like that; actually, it has been addressed \nbecause it has gone through months of people wrestling with the best \ndesign to harness the power of small banks, to address the challenges \nof small businesses in getting loans.\n  We will not get out of this recession if we do not empower our small \nbusinesses. There is only one other approach that has been brought to \nthis floor as an alternative, and that alternative is to tell the small \nbusiness to run up its credit card. I don't know about in my \ncolleagues' States, but in my State, running up your credit card is not \na viable option for small businesses to succeed.\n  We have the power, the wisdom of Main Street banks helping Main \nStreet small businesses. Let's put that power to work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see the cosponsor of this amendment. I \nwill ask unanimous consent for him to be recognized. But before I do, I \nwish to ask a question of the Senator from North Carolina. Senator \nHagan is on the floor. I would like to pose a question, if I may, \nbecause she was a banker, I understand. I would like to ask her if, in \nher view as a banker--I think it might be interesting to hear from \nsomebody who was actually a banker. Senator Burris was a banker. He \nspoke--what does she think about this program.\n  If she was still a banker, would she be interested in accessing this \ncapital from the Treasury and how it might help small businesses in the \ncommunities she used to lend to, if she would be so kind as to answer \nthat question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I applaud the Senator from Louisiana for \nputting forward this amendment with the Senator from Florida. I think \nbanks would be interested in lending this money. I think small local, \ncommunity banks know their client base, know their customers. They are \nthe ones to which these funds are going to be made available. It is not \ngoing to be the big banks. This is going to go to banks with $10 \nbillion assets or less. There is nothing forcing these banks to take \nthis money.\n  I highly recommend we move forward with this bill. I echo so much \nwhat Senator Landrieu has been talking about on the floor today. The \nsmall business lending fund is an absolutely critical component of the \nsmall business package we are moving through the Senate. Small \nbusinesses are the backbone of our economy and, in particular, in the \nState of North Carolina. In fact, small businesses represent over 98 \npercent of the State's employers in North Carolina and close to 50 \npercent of the private sector jobs.\n  Having spent the last year and a half meeting with small business \nowners all across North Carolina, I have seen firsthand the power of \ntheir determination and innovation. I know that the small businesses \nwill be the catalyst that we need right now for our economic recovery.\n  In North Carolina, we have over 455,000 people unemployed--455,000. \nWe need to be doing all we can in Congress to help this recovery. Small \nbusinesses cannot begin to grow and expand and hire until they have \naccess to credit and capital to invest. The small business lending fund \ndoes a lot to address that problem by giving banks a powerful incentive \nto increase lending to small businesses.\n  I have heard my colleagues in South Dakota and Alabama speak today \nabout this bill, comparing it to TARP, implying that banks will not \nparticipate because the fund too closely resembles TARP. Nobody is \nmaking a bank participate. This is totally voluntary. The small \nbusiness lending fund is not another TARP. It is not another bailout. \nThis fund goes to Main Street banks, our local community banks, not the \nbig ones, not the ones with $10 billion assets or larger.\n  These are provisions targeted at providing money to the banks that \nare the healthiest and most capable of increasing lending. In fact, the \nmeasure contains provisions to ensure that the funds only go to the \nbanks that are healthy and viable.\n  In North Carolina, which is one of the biggest banking States in the \ncountry, our bankers have offered their endorsement of this proposal.\n  I am focused on creating a better climate for businesses to add jobs \nin North Carolina and across the country. I think this is a sensible \nproposal that will help small businesses to hire and grow.\n\n[[Page S6184]]\n\n  I thank the Senator from Louisiana, as well as the Senator from \nFlorida, for putting forth this amendment.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Senator from North Carolina, and I ask \nunanimous consent to yield the next 15 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I again thank my colleague from Louisiana and all my \nother colleagues. I see the Senators from Washington and Minnesota, who \nhave worked on this bill are here. I think this is a very important \npiece of legislation, and that is why I have worked in a bipartisan way \nwith my friend from Louisiana, who has been a leader on this bill and \nhas put this bill together.\n  I know this is not without controversy. Some of my colleagues were \nhere earlier, and they do not support this bill. I have enormous \nrespect for my friends from South Dakota and Tennessee, and I \nappreciate their perspective, but I respectfully disagree with it. I \nthink it was Ronald Reagan who said that if we agree on something 90 \npercent of the time, that means we are friends, and we are friends. I \nhave tremendous respect for their views. But this bill does not bring \nwith it, I believe, the problems my friends pointed out. This \nlegislation helps small businesses, and in my State of Florida, that \nreally matters because while we are the fourth largest State in the \ncountry, we are a small business State, not a big business State. We do \nhave our share of big businesses, and we will grow more in the future. \nBut because of Florida's meteoric rise in population over the past 20 \nor 30 years, we don't have those Fortune 100 companies headquartered in \nour State as other States do. Instead, we are a collection of small \nbusinesses, for the most part--nearly 2 million small businesses in \nFlorida.\n  But during this recession--the worst recession Florida has seen in \nanyone's recent memory--those small businesses have been hurting. When \nI drive down the interstates and the State roads of Florida and I go \npast the small strip shopping centers and small buildings that house \nthose small businesses that employ so many Floridians, unfortunately I \nnow see a lot of dark and vacant buildings because these businesses \nhave not been able to make it through this recession. Our unemployment \nin Florida is nearly 12 percent, and it may be worse than that because \nmany no longer seek employment. If you figure the underemployed along \nwith the unemployed, one in five adult Floridians who are able to work \neither doesn't have a job or doesn't have enough of a job. We are No. 2 \nin mortgage foreclosures, and we are No. 1 in the country in being \nbehind on our mortgage payments. So Florida is hurting. There are signs \nthat things are getting better, but we are struggling. And more than \nperhaps any other State, our small businesses need help.\n  This bill does that in a commonsense way, and let me explain why. The \nbill provides $30 billion for local community banks. This isn't Goldman \nSachs, this isn't AIG, this is the banker down the street--the one you \nsee at church or synagogue, the one in your Kiwanis or Rotary, the one \nwho shops in the same stores you do. This is not some Wall Street \nbanker but your local banker. So the bill provides $30 billion for \nlocal banks to make loans to small businesses.\n  The first reason it is not like the other program that was passed to \nbail out Wall Street is it is optional. The Treasury Secretary and the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve are not going to get a bunch of local \nbanks in a boardroom one night and pressure them into taking this \nmoney, as was done with TARP. It is voluntary. If they do not want it, \nthey do not have to take it.\n  Second of all, this isn't going to increase the deficit. In fact, \nunlike most programs here in Washington--and my friends on the other \nside know I come to the floor all the time worried about the way we \nspend money in this Congress, worried about our debt and deficit, \nworried about what it will mean for our kids and our future--this piece \nof legislation is actually going to return more than $1 billion to the \nTreasury over time--so not a deficit, a surplus.\n  Again, the program is voluntary, it doesn't create a debt or deficit, \nand it doesn't create big government. It puts the money in the hands of \ncommunity bankers to lend to small businesses, the folks who create \njobs. My friend from Louisiana had a chart up earlier reflecting that \n65 percent of all jobs are created by small businesses. I believe that \nnumber is far greater in my home State of Florida.\n  So who supports this amendment on which we have been working? Well, \nin Florida, the Florida Bankers Association does. Alex Sanchez, the \npresident and CEO, wrote me and said:\n\n       This bill will help create jobs for Floridians by \n     increasing the loans to Florida's economic engine: Small \n     businesses.\n\n  Who else supports it? Camden Fine, the president and CEO of the \nIndependent Community Bankers of America. He said:\n\n       This legislation is a positive for our community banking \n     sector and to our small business customers who are vital to \n     job creation and the economic recovery.\n\n  Robert Hughes, National Association for the Self-Employed, says:\n\n       The National Association for the Self-Employed, on behalf \n     of our 200,000 member businesses, strongly supports creating \n     the Small Business Lending Fund, which we hope will alleviate \n     the funding and credit freeze faced by small businesses by \n     expanding loan resources.\n\n  Barney Bishop, president of Associated Industries of Florida, which \nrepresents businesses throughout Florida, says that this act moving \nthrough the Senate right now will help small businesses and ``lead to \njobs, jobs, and more jobs.''\n  David Hart, executive vice president of the Florida Chamber of \nCommerce, says:\n\n       Their ability to access capital is critical for economic \n     recovery and job growth. The Florida Chamber of Commerce \n     Small Business Council believes the Small Business Lending \n     Fund will enhance the ability of small business owners to \n     create jobs and transition Florida to a new and sustainable \n     economy.\n\n  Javier Palomarez, president and CEO of the Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce, writes in support of this bill:\n\n       The United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, which \n     represents more than 200 local Hispanic chambers and serves \n     as the national advocate for nearly three million Hispanic-\n     owned businesses in our country, supports passage of the \n     Small Business Lending Fund Act.\n\n  These are Main Street groups. These are business groups that support \nthis bill. So with all due respect to my colleagues who spoke before, \nthis is good for business, and it is done in a measured and focused way \nthat empowers the private sector. This is not big government. This \ndoesn't run a deficit and it doesn't increase taxes.\n  In fact, to my friends who are supporting the base piece of \nlegislation but may not want to support the amendment, they should know \nthat our amendment cuts $2 billion in taxes out of the base bill. So we \nare going to cut taxes. The base bill has a lot of other cuts in taxes \nfor small businesses, and I talked about that when I spoke earlier \ntoday.\n  This is going to be good for Floridians and Americans by getting \nneeded capital to these small businesses that are struggling. That is \nwhy I support it. And I hope my friends on this side of the aisle will \nlook at this bill seriously. I hope they think enough of me to look at \nit and give it a thorough evaluation because I know it is sort of a \nstrange position I am in here. There may not be a lot of support for \nthis on this side of the aisle, but my job representing Florida is to \ndo what is right by the people I represent and to do what is right for \nthe people of this country, and I believe this bill will do just that. \nIt is not a perfect bill. No piece of legislation is. It will not solve \nthe entire problem. No piece of legislation can. But I believe it will \nhelp. It will help in Florida, and it will help across the States of \nthis great country, and that is why I support it.\n  In conclusion, Mr. President, I hope we can vote on this bill. I know \nthe leadership is going back and forth trying to figure out a way to \nhave some more amendments on this bill, and I believe that is the only \nobstacle to voting on this bill. I believe amendments should be allowed \non this bill--a reasonable number--so we can get to it and we can pass \nit. Let's pass this thing before the weekend. Let's not wait until next \nweek. Let's consider it, let's get it done, and let's help these small \nbusinesses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from \nLouisiana.\n\n[[Page S6185]]\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Florida for his \noutstanding remarks and for his ability and his willingness to stand \nfor the people of Florida because his State has had a great deal of \ndifficulty, not unlike the State of California.\n  I see the Senator from California and the Senator from Illinois are \non the floor and they want to speak. I would like to turn the next 5 \nminutes over to the Senator from California, but before I do, I want to \nrespond to something the Senator from Florida said.\n  The Senator from Florida may not be the only Republican to vote for \nthis amendment because today Senator George Voinovich said he would \nsupport the amendment. He is quoted today, if this quote that was \nreported in the paper is correct, as saying there is a real need out \nthere to provide some money to some of these businesses and to get \nbanks back involved.\n  He said:\n\n       We have got to start doing something. Voinovich dismissed \n     claims by fellow Republicans, including Snowe and Minority \n     Leader McConnell, that the lending program resembles TARP \n     because it involves Treasury Department loans to banks. \n     Republicans have nicknamed it TARP, Jr. ``I don't buy that,'' \n     Voinovich said. `` That is just messaging.''\n\n  As I said, my good friend from Florida may not be the only Republican \nto stand up and vote for this amendment, and I hope others will because \nthis could mean a great deal to small businesses throughout America. \nThis is for small business, it is for jobs, it is to get this recession \nover. We have to focus on Main Street.\n  Mr. President, the Senator from California would like the next 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from \nLouisiana, the chairman of the Small Business Committee, for her \nimpassioned remarks. I have worked with Mary Landrieu on many issues. \nSometimes we are on opposite sides. I don't like those times. I like \nthese times. And I thank the Senator from Florida for his strong \nsupport.\n  Here is where we are. We are coming out of the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression, and I don't sugarcoat it when I go home because \neverybody knows where we are. And I remember back to those days at the \nend of the Bush administration when we were bleeding hundreds of \nthousands of jobs every single month, and at that time, as we all \nlooked at the situation, we realized who the job creators had been for \nthe past 15 years. They had really been the small businesses. They \ncreated 64 percent of the new jobs. So when we talk about jobs, when we \ntalk about turning this recession around, we have to focus on small \nbusinesses because they are the job creators. We have seen big \ncorporations' profits return to prerecession levels, and they are \nsitting on their cash and they are not hiring.\n  We know small businesses are asking us to work with them so they can \nget credit. This is about healthy community banks being able to lend to \nhealthy small businesses. This is not about toxic assets and toxic \ninvestments. This is such a strong program, the small business lending \nprogram, that the CBO estimates that we will make back $1.1 billion as \nthe banks and small businesses pay back the fund.\n  Mr. President, I am going to spend the rest of my time reading into \nthe Record the organizations and the businesses that support this bill:\n  The American Apparel and Footwear Association; the American Bankers \nAssociation; the American International Automobile Dealers Association; \nthe Arkansas Community Bankers; the Associated Builders and \nContractors; California Independent Bankers; Community Bankers \nAssociation of Alabama, Georgia, Illinois, Kansas, Ohio, Iowa, \nWashington, West Virginia, and Wisconsin; the Conference of State Bank \nSupervisors; the Fashion Accessory Shippers Association; the Financial \nServices Roundtable; the Florida Bankers Association; the Governors of \nMichigan, Ohio, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, New \nMexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Washington, and West \nVirginia; Heating, Airconditioning and Refrigeration Distributors \nInternational; the Independent Bankers Association of Texas, of \nColorado, and of New Mexico; the Independent Community Bankers of \nAmerica, of Minnesota, and of South Dakota; the Indiana Bankers \nAssociation. It goes on and on. The Maine Association of Community \nBanks; the Maryland Bankers Association; the Massachusetts Bankers \nAssociation; the Michigan Bankers Association; the Missouri Independent \nBankers Association. It goes on and on. The National Association for \nthe Self-Employed; the National Association of Manufacturers; the \nNational Bankers Association; the National Council of Textile \nOrganizations; the Marine Manufacturers Association; the National \nRestaurant Association; the National RV Retailers Association; the \nNational Small Business Association; the Nebraska Independent Community \nBankers; the Pennsylvania Association of Community Bankers; the \nPrinting Industries of America; Small Business California; the Small \nBusiness Majority; the Tennessee Bankers Association; the Travel Goods \nAssociation; the Virginia Association of Community Banks; the Hispanic \nChamber of Commerce; and the Women Impacting Public Policy.\n  This is a list that reflects America. This is a list that reflects \neconomic activity. This is a list of organizations in States that are \nstruggling to get to good times.\n  This idea, that I have to say originally came from a Merkley-Boxer \nbill embraced by Senators Landrieu and Cantwell and LeMieux, made \nbetter as it went down the legislative road, deserves to get 60 votes. \nIt deserves to get, frankly, 100 votes. Because if we are serious about \njobs, then we need to show it with our votes. It is not enough to get \non the floor and complain and say, Where are the jobs? This is \nlegislation, an amendment to a very important bill, that will leverage \n$30 billion into $300 billion. That is what we are talking about, the \nkind of a jolt to this economy that we need. And it makes money for the \ntaxpayers.\n  Talk about a win-win, that is what this is. I am going to yield the \nfloor and I am going to say one more time to the Senator from \nLouisiana, Senator Landrieu, thank you for your leadership. Thank you \nfor your passion. This is about jobs, jobs, jobs, and anyone who votes \nno on this, in my opinion, don't say that you are for jobs because this \nis a proven job creator. We know it. Small business creates the jobs, \n64 percent of the jobs. They need access to credit. They are not \ngetting it from big banks. This allows us to get it from our community \nbanks and it brings a very good marriage together--helping community \nbanks, helping small businesses, and job creation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see the Senator from Illinois. I will \nask unanimous consent for him to speak for 2 to 3 minutes. But before \nthat, I wish to thank the Senator from California. The Senator from \nIllinois would know this, but this issue, this provision came \noriginally from an idea that Senator Boxer and Senator Merkley had. She \ndeserves a tremendous amount of credit.\n  Of course, she represents the largest State in the Union. Of course, \nshe represents one of the States that has high unemployment. Of course, \nshe listens to the people of her State and they are saying: Senator, \nwhere is the money to create the jobs?\n  I will submit this for the Record. The Senator from California does \nnot need to see this because she knows it: Jobs lost by small business. \nDo we want to know why this recession is happening? I wish I had this \nblown up: 81 percent of the job losses come not from big business, not \nfrom Wall Street. I understand Wall Street is having fancy lunches. \nThey had a lot of fancy lunches on Wall Street today. Do you know who \nis not even eating lunch, there is no brown bag to put it in? Small \nbusiness. The Senator from California is a great Senator, fighting for \nher State. She has one of the highest unemployment rates in the \ncountry. The Senator from Illinois knows this as well. I thank her for \nputting this provision forward. I am happy to pick it up and try to \ncarry the ball a little way down the field.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Are we under controlled time or seeking unanimous \nconsent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page S6186]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank Senator Landrieu, who chairs the Small Business \nCommittee. Not only does she have the facts, she has the tenacity and \nferocity to take on these issues. You always want Mary Landrieu on your \nteam. Like Senator Boxer, there are times when we are not on the same \nteam. Thank goodness they are rare. But when we are together I know it \nis going to be a spirited fight and I am glad to join her in this \neffort. I thank her and Senator Cantwell, but I also acknowledge, as \nshe has, that Senators Merkley and Boxer were involved in the early \nformulation of this idea.\n  The idea was so obvious, it was so obvious that we knew when we spoke \nto small businesses the struggle they were having. They couldn't borrow \nmoney. Even good, reputable small businesses with great records could \nnot borrow money. When they couldn't borrow money, it was impossible \nfor them to sustain their business growth and to hire people.\n  In America, as we have lost 8 million jobs, with all the hardship and \nheartache that comes with it, we faced some hard choices. This week, \nthe Senate and the House finally, after weeks of filibustering, came \nthrough with unemployment benefits for the millions of Americans who \nare struggling to feed their families during these hard times. That to \nme is the safety net. But if we are going to go beyond the safety net \nand create the jobs to put people back to work and get beyond this \ndebate on unemployment benefits, we have to look to small business.\n  I heard the Senator from Louisiana talk about her view of small \nbusiness and job creation. This bill that is before us, this amendment \nthat Senator Landrieu brings before us today, is one that will create \njobs in my home State of Illinois.\n  There were over 258,000 small business employers in Illinois in 2006, \nled by professional service and construction firms. These small \nbusinesses accounted for over 98 percent of the employers in my State. \nThese small businesses added 93,000 jobs in 2006, more than three times \nas many as those by companies with more than 500 employees. Another \n850,000 people worked for themselves in 2006, meaning the number of \npeople working for small businesses was that much larger.\n  I am concerned about every firm losing jobs, but I know if we do not \naddress the fundamental challenge facing small business, we are not \ngoing to turn this recession around quickly and that is what we all \nneed to do and want to do.\n  What I struggle to understand, I will say to the Senator from \nLouisiana--perhaps she can answer this question: Where is the \nopposition to this? Where is the opposition? The Senator has read \ncomments from the National Federation of Independent Businesses, a \nconservative business group. I have worked with them. Many times we \nlock horns but we have worked together on health care and things. So \nwhere does the opposition to this come from?\n  Don't we know if we take this money and loan it to small businesses \nit will be repaid? It has a leverage, a multiplier in terms of what it \ncan mean to our economy, creating jobs, which means more taxes being \npaid, more people earning money with paychecks. I am trying to \nunderstand. Have people come to the floor on the other side of the \naisle and explained why we would not want to provide credit for small \nbusinesses in the middle of a recession to help create jobs? I wish to \nask the Senator if she would respond, through the Chair.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. We have had three Senators come to the floor. The \nSenator, the ranking member of the committee is here now, Senator \nSnowe. I have the greatest respect for the Senator. She outlined a few \npoints that she has concerns about. I will come back to that in a \nminute.\n  There were only two other Senators who came to the floor--the Senator \nfrom Alabama and the Senator from South Dakota. From what I could \ngather, they think--the Senators said they thought this was sort of \nlike TARP.\n  I tried to explain to them that, first of all, TARP was a $700 \nbillion fund for banks that had troubled assets. This is a $30 billion \nfund for healthy banks to lend to small business. There were lots of \nbankers opposed to TARP. I tried to say to them in this case every \nbanking organization that we know of, national organization, and the \nmajority of the State bankers--not all; I want to be clear--the \nmajority are all for it. So we are having a difficult time.\n  There may be some questions about the cost. It gets into a lot of \ndetail. The Senator from Maine raised that issue. Our score, I said, is \nwhat I go by. The Senator knows it will generate $1.1 billion for this \nprogram.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can reclaim my time--I have a limited amount of \ntime--thank you, because that addresses the issue. The fact is that \nthis money will generate money to the Federal Treasury so it is not \nadding to our debt, it is creating jobs, helping businesses, reducing \nour deficit, and I might add--I am glad you made a reference to TARP. \nAccording to the Treasury Department, the 22 largest recipients of TARP \ndollars, banks, decreased their small business lending by $12.5 billion \nbetween April and November of 2009.\n  Here we are in TARP sending money to bail out the biggest banks and \nthey are reducing their loans to small businesses as a result of it. \nWhat the Senator is saying, as I understand it, what this amendment is, \nis take this money, give it to healthy banks with the understanding it \nwill be loaned to small businesses, they will prosper, create jobs, \nmore taxpayers, fewer people on unemployment, and a net gain to the \nTreasury?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This does not sound like TARP at all to me.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. It is not. The Senator is absolutely correct. That is \nwhy I spent the majority of this day trying to be responsive to the \nseveral arguments that have been raised against it. I thought the \nSenator from Oregon did a beautiful job, much better than I did, \nexplaining the nuances of this report that has been used to criticize \nthis program.\n  But again, it is a private sector approach which the other side \nusually likes. It is community bankers whom we know, to small \nbusinesses that we know need the help. I cannot quite understand where \nthis opposition is coming from. I said earlier, if you are looking for \na bumper sticker for the election, go look elsewhere. Don't put a \nbumper sticker on the backs of small business in America. They don't \ndeserve it. The letters are heartbreaking. The letters from Illinois \nare heartbreaking.\n  Women who have waited for 20 years while they raised their children \nfinally start their business and I have to hear from the other side \nthey don't like the bumper sticker? This is not about bumper stickers. \nWe have waited a year and a half to get on a bill for small business. \nThe House has already passed this bill.\n  It is laughable, to try to go home to your district. I don't care \nwhether you are in Arizona or South Dakota or Alabama, you will be \nlaughed out of the townhall meeting if you go home and try to explain \nthat you don't think small business should get money from their local \nbank. They don't have the money to buy a train ticket to New York.\n  I mean, this is not funny. So unless somebody comes down here and \ngives me a relatively good argument--and I have the greatest respect \nfor the Senator from Maine. We have never argued about anything on our \ncommittee. This didn't even come to our committee so we never argued \nabout it. We have not argued about one thing because we feel so \nstrongly. But for some reason this has become a political football. She \ndid not make it that way and neither did I. Somebody did, but neither \none of us did.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Louisiana will allow me to reclaim my \ntime and finish and yield the floor at this point, I thank her for her \npassion and commitment. Around here we go through so many issues and \ndebates, it sounds as if people are reading telephone directories and \ndon't care, but there occasionally comes along an issue where it does \ntouch you. You can tell from the Senator from Louisiana, she feels this \nissue--as she should. These are real people, who put their all into a \nbusiness, who are about to lose it. These are real people who think \ntheir businesses can grow with a little bit of help and hire some \npeople. Instead, what we hear from the other side\n\n[[Page S6187]]\n\nis we are afraid somebody is going to twist this into a bumper sticker \nthat will look bad.\n  I used to have a friend of mine named Mike Synar, from Oklahoma. We \nused to laugh when Members of the House of Representatives would say, \n``Man, I hope we don't have to vote on that tough issue again.'' He \nsaid, ``If you don't want to fight fires, don't be a firefighter. If \nyou don't want to come to Congress and vote on tough issues, get \nanother job somewhere else.'' I think he was right. He is still right. \nIf these people are afraid of helping small businesses for fear that \nsomebody is going to dream up a bumper sticker and a 30-second ad, \nthink about another job. Because if we can't face issues this important \nin the middle of a recession and help small businesses with the \nLandrieu amendment, then we have lost our way.\n  I am glad to support the Senator, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I see other Members on the floor. \nSenator Burris had spoken earlier. I wish to say there was an \norganization we failed to mention, but the Minority Bankers of America \nalso have given their support to this. We are getting constant letters \nof support in.\n  I can speak for a few more minutes. I don't know if anyone else is \ninterested in speaking. We still do not have a vote on this, so I will \ncontinue, I guess.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes, to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, one of the arguments I have heard against \nthe Senator's amendment--as the Senator from Illinois said, this is a \nreplay of the TARP battle. I want to explore that for one moment with \nmy friend from Louisiana.\n  Before I do, I must say about the Senator from Louisiana, her passion \nand commitment to small business, reflected in her chairmanship on the \nSmall Business Committee--and I am honored to serve with her on it--has \nbeen nothing short of breathtaking. I thank her for that leadership.\n  On the TARP issue, those of us who voted for TARP have been \ncriticized back home because it didn't result in a lot of credit \nflowing. We would have loved to have had the time so we could have \ntaken some steps so we could have connected credit flow with what we \nwere doing to try to save this economy from totally going under.\n  We did not have the time to do it at that time. We have been \ncriticized, and to some extent I think fairly, for not connecting some \nkind of requirement on the part of banks that are being helped through \nTARP with some commitment to lend out that money, to get credit flowing \nagain.\n  The issue we have heard more than anything about back home, I would \nsay, in terms of businesses and why they are not adding jobs, is that \neven the businesses that have paid all their bills, that have folks out \nthere who are willing to buy their products, cannot get the regular \nlines of credit that they have relied on, mainly because the assets \nthat those credit lines have been based on have gone down in value, the \nway our homes have gone down in value.\n  So they have the same accounts. They have never missed payments they \nowe the banks. They have sales they can make. But in terms of the ratio \nthat the banks follow because of the regulators, those banks are \nunwilling to extend the traditional line of credit because the assets \nof the companies have gone down in value, although their business sales \nhave not gone down. So we have creditworthy businesses waiting for \ncredit.\n  What this amendment does is--and I wish to ask the Senator if this is \ncorrect--this really is something--we are filling a gap TARP did not \nfill. A failure that TARP, I am afraid, legitimately is criticized for, \nwe are trying and the Senator's amendment is trying to correct, to fill \na gap which we did not fill in when we passed the TARP.\n  So there are incentives in this amendment to extend credit. That is \nthe point of the amendment; that is, we will get credit flowing again. \nSo the TARP reference, to me, is totally inappropriate. I wish to ask \nthe Senator if that is correct.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. The Senator from Michigan is absolutely correct. That \nis why this is so flabbergasting to me, because the Senator is correct. \nThe TARP, some of us voted for it, some of us did not, but there are \nsome legitimate criticisms of it. I mean, it went to a lot of the big \nbanks, bigger banks. It did go to some middle-sized banks, I will \nconcede that to the opponents. They have pointed that out, that it went \nto some middle-sized banks.\n  But what we did not do was connect it to lending. They took the money \nand they cut the line of credit. We are trying to fix that. This is an \namendment to fix what we did not do correctly. This is an amendment \nsupported by bankers, by small businesses. It does not go to big banks. \nThey are not even eligible. It is voluntary. They do not have to take \nit.\n  If any Senator wants to vote against this and go home and say: Look, \nI can only give you credit cards with 16 percent interest--your people \nin Michigan cannot survive that, the Senator knows. They cannot survive \nit.\n  Mr. LEVIN. One last thing. This is what our local banks have been \npleading for.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wish to thank the Senator for her leadership on so many \nother parts of this bill. This is a critical bill. It is a critical \namendment that is now being offered.\n  We are at yet another moment in this ongoing economic crisis at which \nwe have to choose, choose between taking action to help lift our \ncountry and its people, or failing to act to alleviate their struggles. \nToo often, in the face of opposition from many of our Republican \ncolleagues, we have been delayed in making these choices. The \nlegislation before us today is no exception: This bill has been on the \nSenate floor for 10 legislative days.\n  That is sad, because every day of delay on this bill has been another \nday that small businesses, businesses our Republican colleagues \nrepeatedly commend as America's job-creation engines, lack the access \nto capital they need to continue to operate or grow. As the financial \nsystem recovers from the damage done by the greed and speculation of \nsome on Wall Street, local banks that small businesses have depended \non, and in many cases worked with for years, are not providing them \nwith the capital to finance their inventories, meet their payrolls, \noperate their factories or add new products.\n  This legislation seeks to bridge that gap. If passed it will give \nthousands of American business owners a chance to keep current workers \nor hire new ones. It is the sort of thing we should rush to do in this \neconomy.\n  Let me outline a few of the ways in which this legislation will help. \nThis legislation would establish the State Small Business Credit \nInitiative, an effort that I have been working on for many months along \nwith several of our colleagues here in the Senate, leaders in the House \nof Representatives, and the administration. Building on successful \nefforts in Michigan and other States, the initiative would provide \ncrucial funding to State and local programs that expand capital access \nfor small businesses.\n  These programs help businesses escape one of the traps that continues \nto hold back our economy: The fact that just as the recession has \ndamaged the value of our homes, it has also damaged the value of the \nreal estate, equipment and other items these businesses offer as \ncollateral to secure loans, making it harder to get those loans and \ntherefore harder to keep or hire workers, feeding a downward spiral \nthat stunts growth.\n  This bill also includes a series of efforts to boost small-business \nlending that will create thousands of jobs without adding to the \ndeficit. For instance, inclusion of the Small Business Job Creation and \nAccess to Capital Act, which raises Small Business Administration loan \nlimits, will increase small-business lending by as much as $5 billion. \nIt also includes an Intermediary Lending Pilot Program, a proposal I \noffered which allows SBA to make loans to nonprofit intermediary \nlenders, who can then loan that money to growing businesses.\n  Other provisions of the bill will help more small businesses sell \ntheir products overseas or win government contracts, and provide much-\nneeded assistance to SBA's women's business centers and microloan \nprograms that help businesses in underserved communities.\n\n[[Page S6188]]\n\n  The substitute amendment now before us does not include one provision \nwhich I support, but which hopefully we will now add. The Small \nBusiness Lending Fund would have provided $30 billion in capital \nsupport to the Nation's small banks. It is similar to the Bank on Our \nCommunities Act that I and many others have supported.\n  Some of our colleagues objected to this provision, ostensibly on the \ngrounds that it was a reprise of TARP. But unlike TARP, in which most \nof funds went to the largest institutions, this program targets the \ncommunity banks that actually make the vast majority of small business \nloans. While many of the financial institutions receiving TARP funds \nfailed to use that support to make the business loans needed to boost \nour economic recovery, this program's whole purpose would be to \nincrease small-business lending. Community banks would be rewarded for \nincreasing their small business lending, and penalized if they do not, \nThis program would not cost taxpayers. Instead, it would raise \napproximately $1.1 billion. At a time when some in this chamber say the \ndeficit is such a problem that we cannot even afford extended benefits \nfor the jobless, why would we not support a program that would not only \nhelp create jobs, but reduce the deficit by $1.1 billion?\n  While I strongly support the Small Business Lending Fund, I believe \nit is an urgent priority to get small businesses the help they need. \nEven without the Small Business Lending Fund provision, this \nlegislation represents a much-needed effort to provide more capital to \nbusinesses in need.\n  New access to an SBA loan or to support from a State capital-access \nprogram can be the difference between expanding or contracting, between \ngrowing or going out of business. These businesses and their workers \nshould not have to wait for help any longer, and we can provide it, \ntoday, by approving this bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I see the Senator from Maine. In all fairness, we have \nhad a lot of time. I want to yield 1 minute to the Senator from \nMinnesota. Then I will be happy to yield. We have no time agreements. \nThere are no scheduled votes. I am most certainly not holding up this \nvote. The leadership is not here. I am not sure when we are voting. I \nknow Members want to leave. I am not holding up the vote. We are ready \nto go to the vote at any time, but we do not have any agreement to go \nto the vote.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I thank the Senator from Louisiana. Again, I thank you \nfor including the piece of this bill on exports because we have waited \nso long to include it. This is something that came out of the Commerce \nCommittee. So I appreciate the Small Business Committee being willing \nto put this amendment in there, a bipartisan amendment.\n  It went through the Commerce Committee unanimously, with the sole \nfocus of helping small- and medium-sized businesses, people who do not \nhave the resources, that when they want to send their products, 30 \npercent of them say they want to export. They look at the world, and it \nlooks like one of those ancient maps where you do not see all the \ncountries.\n  They do not have contacts out there. They do not know someone in \nKazakhstan or someone in Turkey or someone in Morocco, but yet someone \nthere wants their product. So the whole idea was to have some \nresources, some tools, so they can access those markets. We all know \nthat if we are going to get out of this economic slump, we can do some \nof it by selling products in the United States, but a lot of it has to \ndeal with us selling our products abroad because we have to become a \ncountry again that makes stuff, that thinks again, that sends things to \nother countries, that creates jobs in America, so you turn over \nsomething when you go in a store and it says: ``Made in the USA.''\n  The way we do that is by selling things in our own country but also \nselling things to all those customers, all those millions and millions \nof customers who are starting to get buying power in other countries. \nBut it should not be just for the big businesses; the small- and \nmedium-sized businesses should be able to access those markets as well.\n  That is why this amendment is so incredibly important, an amendment \nthat came, this piece of it, unanimously through the Commerce \nCommittee. It boggles my mind that anyone would be voting against it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am hoping we can vote right now, if \npossible. I know the Senators all have schedules. The Senator from \nMaine was very kind to say she could even speak after the vote. I \nappreciate that everybody has been so patient today. We have had a good \ndebate. We are trying to get to a vote on this bill. We are waiting for \nthe leadership, but people are going to have other appointments. The \nSenator from Maine has agreed to speak after the vote, which is very \nnice.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I object to the Lincoln amendment. I \nobject to the Reid amendment, and with regard to the issue of border \nsecurity, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3170; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, and the substitute amendment at the desk, which is \na fully offset border security provision, be agreed to; that the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S6189]]\n\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I have a further unanimous consent \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4853; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken, and the substitute amendment at the desk be agreed \nto; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  Before the Chair rules, I would like to clarify that the amendment \nincludes provisions that do the following:\n  One, make permanent the $1,000 child tax credit; two, make permanent \nthe deduction for State and local sales tax; three, make permanent the \nexpired research and experimentation credit; four, repeal section 9006 \nof the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the small business \n1099 paperwork mandate; five, add a sense of the Senate on the recess \nappointment of Dr. Donald Berwick, based on the Roberts amendment No. \n4512; and extend the alternative minimum tax patch for 2009 \npermanently, adjusted for inflation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, those are laudable goals. I look forward to \nworking with my friends on the other side of the aisle to come to \nconclusion of these matters. But at this stage, I think it is pretty \nlate at night, and we have had little opportunity to talk to our \ncommittees. In fact, it would just not work at this stage. So I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4853; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the substitute amendment at the desk, \nwhich would add the previously requested lawsuit settlement language, \nmodified with a rescission of unobligated stimulus funds to cover the \ncosts and modified to reflect Barrasso amendment No. 4313, be agreed \nto; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, we have been through this \nbefore. This is a ``beat up the lawyer'' amendment. We will not agree \nto that. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding there has been \nan objection to everything but the cloture vote on the supplemental.\n  Mr. REID. And small business.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. And the small business bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the request has been \nmodified.\n  The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I would like some clarification on that last comment, \nplease, from the minority leader. There is no objection now on the UC?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There has been an objection to all of the add-ons.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nentirety of the agreement has been agreed to except the amendments of \nthe motion to concur to the supplemental.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think it is fair to the Senator from \nArkansas that there is an understanding that an amendment that passed \nthis body at least 6 months ago, that was bipartisan in nature, that \ngave emergency funding for a number of States because of agricultural \ndisasters, the question is, Is that being objected to?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. That is not my question.\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry then.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. My question is what is the pending issue and is the \nquestion on whether there is an objection to the supplemental; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is the Chair's understanding that the \nmajority leader's request, as amended, is agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I don't want any misunderstanding. If anyone is objecting \nto our moving forward on the supplemental, this is the time to speak.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it is my understanding the only thing \nin order is the vote on cloture on the motion to concur on the \nsupplemental.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I would like to wage my objection until I can further \ndiscuss it with the majority leader.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I renew my earlier unanimous consent request \nwith the exception of those exceptions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the Monday quorum be waived \nwith respect to the House message.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate very much the inordinate amount \nof time that everyone has waited. I am sorry we had to do that. But \nSenators Lincoln and Chambliss have been real professionals. They have \ndone a lot of talking. But I think we are at a point now where we can \nfinish our business tonight.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today, tomorrow and the next day \nmarines and soldiers will patrol the streets of places like Marja and \nGarmsir and assist Afghan policemen in the areas around Kandahar.\n  They are well trained, they are intent on accomplishing the mission \nthey have been given, and they are supported by loving families here at \nhome.\n  For their sacrifice, they ask little. They ask that they be well led, \nprepared, and to have clear-cut missions and guidance. They ask that \ntheir families be cared for.\n  We have become so used to their sacrifice in the days, months, and \nyears since September 11, 2001, that it may become easy to take the \nextraordinary service rendered by this All-Volunteer Force for granted.\n  So easy, it seems, that the funding request submitted by Secretary \nGates in February to fund combat operations has languished here in the \nCongress for months.\n  As a Senate, we should not take this sacrifice for granted.\n  Secretary Gates spoke to my Republican colleagues and me about the \nneed to pass the defense supplemental so the training and pay of our \nmilitary would not be at risk.\n  He has also written to the majority leader and asked that we finish \nthis supplemental before the August recess so that he will not be \nforced to furlough thousands of civilian employees at the Department of \nDefense.\n  It has taken until this late date to now vote once again on funding \nfor our All-Volunteer Force. With each passing day we approach the end \nof the fiscal year and Secretary Gates loses the ability to shift \nfunding from other activities in the Defense Department to the training \nof our forces scheduled to deploy.\n  I am afraid we are losing sight of the purpose of these war \nsupplemental bills. These bills are not for forward-funding domestic \nprograms. They are not for funding projects that won't pass elsewhere.\n  It would be irresponsible to give the House any further reason to \nshirk the responsibility of getting this funding to our fighting \nforces.\n  We need to pass this supplemental tonight, send it back to the House \nand reject any delaying tactic or additional matters that can wait for \nfuture consideration in this session.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted to end debate on the House \namendment to the supplemental appropriations bill because that \namendment addresses important domestic priorities for Wisconsin and \nthis country without adding a penny to the deficit. The amendment \nprovides $10 billion to help school districts around the country facing \nfunding shortfalls due to the ongoing recession, all of it paid for. It \nalso provides almost $5 billion in fully offset funding to help ensure \nthat the millions of low income students who receive Pell grants do not \nsee reductions in their awards.\n  The House amendment also includes a provision to give public safety \nemployees, like firefighters and police officers, collective bargaining \nrights. While Wisconsin and other States already protect public safety \nemployees' collective bargaining rights, there are still several States \nthat do not. Police officers, firefighters, and other public safety \nofficers are on the front lines of protecting our communities and we \nshould ensure that these hard working professionals have the ability to \nbargain for better wages and working conditions.\n  However, I continue to oppose funding for a massive, open-ended war \nin Afghanistan. This war funding will add tens of billions to our \ndeficit without contributing to our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6190-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6190-S6191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, I have just learned of the loss of one of my \ndear friends. He was an orphan. He was a stellar athlete. He came to \nLas Vegas to be a schoolteacher, but he had such a dynamic personality \nthat soon they learned in that rapidly growing school district, which \nis the fourth or fifth largest in the country, that they needed his \nkind of leadership. He went from being a teacher to running that huge \nschool district in Las Vegas, the Clark County School District.\n  He had such a magnetic personality. Kenny Guinn was built like an \nathlete. He was handsome as a movie star.\n  He left the school district after a number of years and became a bank \npresident. He became a big utility president in our major utility in \nNevada. Then he became president of the university. I think he worked \nfor $1 a year. He just did it to be nice.\n  Somebody said to him: What you should do is run for Governor. It was \na slam dunk. He was a very moderate Republican. He was elected Governor \ntwice very easily. He did an extremely good job as Governor.\n  We do not know what happened to Kenny today, but from reports we \nreceived, he was in an accident. He was on the roof and fell. He is \ndead now. I feel so badly about this. I talked with him a week or so \nago about my campaign and his wonderful, beautiful, charming wife Dema. \nI feel so sad that Kenny is not with us anymore.\n  I join all of Nevada in mourning the loss of truly a great man, one \nof Nevada's outstanding Governors, and a friend of mine about whom I \nwill always feel strongly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6191-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6191]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SISTER ROSEMARY LYNCH\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to honor Sister Rosemary Lynch \nfor her lifetime of promoting peace throughout Nevada, the United \nStates, and the entire world. Sister Lynch recently celebrated her 93rd \nbirthday, and I am pleased to recognize her life and achievements \nbefore the U.S. Senate.\n  Sister Lynch was born in Phoenix, AZ, but her spiritual service in \nthe Franciscan Order brought her to Las Vegas after periods in Mexico, \nEurope, Africa, and Indonesia. She began her devotion to the \nFranciscans more than 75 years ago and eventually ascended to an \nadministrative post within the order. Spending 16 years in Italy \nhelping to manage the order's global organization, Sister Lynch still \nfound time to travel the world to deliver her message of compassion. \nThese days, Sister Lynch can be found at the Franciscans' house on \nBartlett Street in Las Vegas, where she devotes her day to assisting \nthe underprivileged community of the city.\n  Sister Lynch's age has not slowed her commitment to spread peace \nthroughout her community. Her boundless energy is apparent in the daily \nearly morning walks she takes through her neighborhood and the \nunflagging devotion to combating poverty she displays through her work \nat the Franciscan house. She speaks five languages, a testament to her \nincredible mind and her experience in spreading peaceful ideas \nthroughout the world.\n  In addition to her work with the Franciscan Order, Sister Lynch \nfounded the Pace e Bene Nonviolence Service, a group dedicated to \neducating communities about theories of peaceful conflict resolution. \nThis organization celebrated 20 years of activity last year, and it \ncontinues its mission internationally due to the efforts of Sister \nLynch. ``Pace e Bene'' means ``peace and all good'' in Italian, and I \ncannot think of a better phrase to describe the life's work of Sister \nRosemary Lynch.\n  I am honored that Sister Lynch has offered her services to the State \nof Nevada for a significant portion of her life. I thank her for her \nceaseless altruism and selflessness, and I wish her continued health \nand success in her endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6191-5", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6191-S6192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EDUCATION JOBS PACKAGE\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today to urge this body to get our \npriorities straight. During this trying moment for struggling families \nall over America, as we work to get our economic ship righted, it is \nour kids and schools that should be at the top of our list.\n  And moving forward with a more lasting agenda, this body must make \ngood on our commitment to ensure that we leave more opportunity for our \nchildren than we ourselves have had. It starts with our commitment to \neducation.\n  We have a very American responsibility--to set the table for our \nkids' futures; to prepare them for the competitive world that awaits \nthem; and to enrich their lives with a better education than the one \nthat was offered to us. This is our central calling.\n  As I have discussed many times before back in Colorado and here on \nthe Senate floor, we must be willing to make the hard choices necessary \nto jumpstart our economy and put the country on a path that will return \nus to fiscal responsibility. This means recognizing how we got into \nthis fiscal mess--by not paying for our priorities, not planning for \nfuture emergencies, taking on more than we can afford, and damaging, \nexpensive bailouts.\n  Yet we cannot fight our way out of this fiscal hole riding on the \nbacks of our kids. It is wrong, and it is a disservice to them.\n  I support legislation to preserve teacher jobs. And the full Senate \nmust do the same. In so many areas, our children are taking the brunt \nof our economic downturn. School is one place we have to try to \ninoculate from economic hardship.\n\n[[Page S6192]]\n\n  Hundreds of thousands of teachers across the country--including an \nestimated 3,000 teachers in Colorado--are in jeopardy of losing their \njobs if we do not act. Districts have already cut their budgets \nsubstantially. The education jobs package would preserve thousands of \nthese middle-class jobs.\n  I am the first person to say that we cannot simply continue to do the \nsame thing in education and expect a different result. We need to \nimprove the system so it does a better job of supporting our teachers \nand educating students.\n  However, we cannot stand by while schools are devastated by layoffs. \nAllowing this would be a shortsighted blow against our communities.\n  The education jobs package would keep people working, and ensure that \nstudents can continue learning. This will actually spur economic \nrecovery in the short run, preserving thousands of good jobs, and by \nlaying the groundwork for our kids' success, it would foster prosperity \nin the long run.\n  Preserving teaching jobs is a commonsense investment. Yet inside the \nBeltway the livelihood of our teachers has become a political pawn. We \nhave seen people using this money as a negotiating tool. And we have \nseen people force false choices between jobs and critical education \nreforms. Let's not play politics with our children's future.\n  I call on our colleagues to move quickly to pass an education jobs \npackage and keep our teachers in the classroom so our kids have the \ntools they need to succeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6192-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6192-S6193]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TREATMENT OF END USERS\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter dated June 30, 2010, from Senator Dodd and me to \nHouse Chairmen Peterson and Frank regarding the treatment of end users \nin the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, H.R. \n4173.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 30, 2010.\n     Hon. Chairman Barney Frank,\n     Financial Services Committee, House of Representatives, \n         Rayburn House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chairman Collin Peterson,\n     Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives, Longworth \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Frank and Peterson: Whether swaps are used by \n     an airline hedging its fuel costs or a global manufacturing \n     company hedging interest rate risk, derivatives are an \n     important tool businesses use to manage costs and market \n     volatility. This legislation will preserve that tool. \n     Regulators, namely the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \n     (CFTC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), and the \n     prudential regulators, must not make hedging so costly it \n     becomes prohibitively expensive for end users to manage their \n     risk. This letter seeks to provide some additional background \n     on legislative intent on some, but not all, of the various \n     sections of Title VII of H.R. 4173, the Dodd-Frank Act.\n       The legislation does not authorize the regulators to impose \n     margin on end users, those exempt entities that use swaps to \n     hedge or mitigate commercial risk. If regulators raise the \n     costs of end user transactions, they may create more risk. It \n     is imperative that the regulators do not unnecessarily divert \n     working capital from our economy into margin accounts, in a \n     way that would discourage hedging by end users or impair \n     economic growth.\n       Again, Congress clearly stated in this bill that the margin \n     and capital requirements are not to be imposed on end users, \n     nor can the regulators require clearing for end user trades. \n     Regulators are charged with establishing rules for the \n     capital requirements, as well as the margin requirements for \n     all uncleared trades, but rules may not be set in a way that \n     requires the imposition of margin requirements on the end \n     user side of a lawful transaction. In cases where a Swap \n     Dealer enters into an uncleared swap with an end user, margin \n     on the dealer side of the transaction should reflect the \n     counterparty risk of the transaction. Congress strongly \n     encourages regulators to establish margin requirements for \n     such swaps or security-based swaps in a manner that is \n     consistent with the Congressional intent to protect end users \n     from burdensome costs.\n       In harmonizing the different approaches taken by the House \n     and Senate in their respective derivatives titles, a number \n     of provisions were deleted by the Conference Committee to \n     avoid redundancy and to streamline the regulatory framework. \n     However, a consistent Congressional directive throughout all \n     drafts of this legislation, and in Congressional debate, has \n     been to protect end users from burdensome costs associated \n     with margin requirements and mandatory clearing. Accordingly, \n     changes made in Conference to the section of the bill \n     regulating capital and margin requirements for Swap Dealers \n     and Major Swap Participants should not be construed as \n     changing this important Congressional interest in protecting \n     end users. In fact, the House offer amending the capital and \n     margin provisions of Sections 731 and 764 expressly stated \n     that the strike to the base text was made ``to eliminate \n     redundancy.'' Capital and margin standards should be set to \n     mitigate risk in our financial system, not punish those who \n     are trying to hedge their own commercial risk.\n       Congress recognized that the individualized credit \n     arrangements worked out between counterparties in a bilateral \n     transaction can be important components of business risk \n     management. That is why Congress specifically mandates that \n     regulators permit the use of non-cash collateral for \n     counterparty arrangements with Swap Dealers and Major Swap \n     Participants to permit flexibility. Mitigating risk is one of \n     the most important reasons for passing this legislation.\n       Congress determined that clearing is at the heart of \n     reform--bringing transactions and counterparties into a \n     robust, conservative and transparent risk management \n     framework. Congress also acknowledged that clearing may not \n     be suitable for every transaction or every counterparty. End \n     users who hedge their risks may find it challenging to use a \n     standard derivative contracts to exactly match up their risks \n     with counterparties willing to purchase their specific \n     exposures. Standardized derivative contracts may not be \n     suitable for every transaction. Congress recognized that \n     imposing the clearing and exchange trading requirement on \n     commercial end-users could raise transaction costs where \n     there is a substantial public interest in keeping such costs \n     low (i.e., to provide consumers with stable, low prices, \n     promote investment, and create jobs.)\n       Congress recognized this concern and created a robust end \n     user clearing exemption for those entities that are using the \n     swaps market to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. These \n     entities could be anything ranging from car companies to \n     airlines or energy companies who produce and distribute power \n     to farm machinery manufacturers. They also include captive \n     finance affiliates, finance arms that are hedging in support \n     of manufacturing or other commercial companies. The end user \n     exemption also may apply to our smaller financial entities--\n     credit unions, community banks, and farm credit institutions. \n     These entities did not get us into this crisis and should not \n     be punished for Wall Street's excesses. They help to finance \n     jobs and provide lending for communities all across this \n     nation. That is why Congress provided regulators the \n     authority to exempt these institutions.\n       This is also why we narrowed the scope of the Swap Dealer \n     and Major Swap Participant definitions. We should not \n     inadvertently pull in entities that are appropriately \n     managing their risk. In implementing the Swap Dealer and \n     Major Swap Participant provisions, Congress expects the \n     regulators to maintain through rulemaking that the definition \n     of Major Swap Participant does not capture companies simply \n     because they use swaps to hedge risk in their ordinary course \n     of business. Congress does not intend to regulate end-users \n     as Major Swap Participants or Swap Dealers just because they \n     use swaps to hedge or manage the commercial risks associated \n     with their business. For example, the Major Swap Participant \n     and Swap Dealer definitions are not intended to include an \n     electric or gas utility that purchases commodities that are \n     used either as a source of fuel to produce electricity or to \n     supply gas to retail customers and that uses swaps to hedge \n     or manage the commercial risks associated with its business. \n     Congress incorporated a de minimis exception to the Swap \n     Dealer definition to ensure that smaller institutions that \n     are responsibly managing their commercial risk are not \n     inadvertently pulled into additional regulation.\n       Just as Congress has heard the end user community, \n     regulators must carefully take into consideration the impact \n     of regulation and capital and margin on these entities.\n       It is also imperative that regulators do not assume that \n     all over-the-counter transactions share the same risk \n     profile. While uncleared swaps should be looked at closely, \n     regulators must carefully analyze the risk associated with \n     cleared and uncleared swaps and apply that analysis when \n     setting capital standards for Swap Dealers and Major Swap \n     Participants. As regulators set capital and margin standards \n     on Swap Dealers or Major Swap Participants, they must set the \n     appropriate standards relative to the risks associated with \n     trading. Regulators must carefully consider the potential \n     burdens that Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants may \n     impose on end user counterparties--especially if those \n     requirements will discourage the use of swaps by end users or \n     harm economic growth. Regulators should seek to impose \n     margins to the extent they are necessary to ensure the safety \n     and soundness of the Swap Dealers and Major Swap \n     Participants.\n       Congress determined that end users must be empowered in \n     their counterparty relationships, especially relationships \n     with swap dealers. This is why Congress explicitly gave to \n     end users the option to clear swaps contracts, the option to \n     choose their clearinghouse or clearing agency, and the option \n     to segregate margin with an independent 3rd party custodian.\n\n[[Page S6193]]\n\n       In implementing the derivatives title, Congress encourages \n     the CFTC to clarify through rulemaking that the exclusion \n     from the definition of swap for ``any sale of a nonfinancial \n     commodity or security for deferred shipment or delivery, so \n     long as the transaction is intended to be physically \n     settled'' is intended to be consistent with the forward \n     contract exclusion that is currently in the Commodity \n     Exchange Act and the CFTC's established policy and orders on \n     this subject, including situations where commercial parties \n     agree to ``book-out'' their physical delivery obligations \n     under a forward contract.\n       Congress recognized that the capital and margin \n     requirements in this bill could have an impact on swaps \n     contracts currently in existence. For this reason, we \n     provided legal certainty to those contracts currently in \n     existence, providing that no contract could be terminated, \n     renegotiated, modified, amended, or supplemented (unless \n     otherwise specified in the contract) based on the \n     implementation of any requirement in this Act, including \n     requirements on Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants. It \n     is imperative that we provide certainty to these existing \n     contracts for the sake of our economy and financial system.\n       Regulators must carefully follow Congressional intent in \n     implementing this bill. While Congress may not have the \n     expertise to set specific standards, we have laid out our \n     criteria and guidelines for implementing reform. It is \n     imperative that these standards are not punitive to the end \n     users, that we encourage the management of commercial risk, \n     and that we build a strong but responsive framework for \n     regulating the derivatives market.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chairman Christopher Dodd,\n       Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n     U.S. Senate.\n     Chairman Blanche Lincoln,\n       Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \n     U.S. Senate.\n\n     \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6193-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6193-S6195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                          JUDICIAL NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, earlier this week, I came to the Senate \nwith the respected senior Senator from Tennessee and sought a time \nagreement to consider Jane Stranch of Tennessee, a judicial nomination \nthat has been stalled by the Republican leadership for more than 8 \nmonths. It is one of more than 20 judicial nominations being delayed \nfrom Senate consideration by Republican objection. Despite the support \nof Senator Alexander, the senior Senator from Tennessee who is part of \nthe Republican leadership, the Republican leader objected to a time \nagreement to consider the Stranch nomination to the Sixth Circuit. I \nwas disappointed, as I have been repeatedly by Republican obstruction \nsince President Obama was elected.\n  Senate Republicans have further ratcheted up the obstruction and \npartisanship that have regrettably become commonplace this Congress \nwith regard to judicial nominees. We asked merely for a time agreement \nto debate and vote on the nomination. I did not foreclose any \nRepublican Senator from voting against the nominee or speaking against \nthe nominee but simply wanted a standard agreement in order to allow \nthe majority leader to schedule the debate and get to a vote. This is \nfor a nomination reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee over \neight months ago with bipartisan support. Yet the Republican leader \nobjected and blocked our consideration.\n  No one should be confused: the current obstruction and stalling by \nSenate Republicans is unprecedented. There is no systematic counterpart \nby Senate Democrats. In fact, during the first 2 years of the Bush \nadministration, the 100 judges confirmed were considered by the \nDemocratically controlled Senate an average of 25 days from being \nreported by the Judiciary Committee. The average time for confirmed \nFederal circuit court nominees was 26 days. The average time for the 36 \nFederal circuit and district and circuit court judges confirmed since \nPresident Obama took office is 82 days and the average time for Federal \ncircuit nominees is 126 days. So when Republicans say that we are \nmoving faster than we did during the first 2 years of the Bush \nadministration they are wrong. It was not until the summer of 2001 that \nthe Senate majority shifted to Democrats, but as soon as it did, we \nproceeded on the judicial nominations of President Bush, a Republican \nPresident. Indeed, by this date during the second year of the Bush \nadministration, the Senate had confirmed 58 of his judicial nominations \nand we were on the way to confirming 100 by the end of the year. By \ncontrast, Republican obstruction of President Obama's judicial nominees \nhas meant that only 36 of his judicial nominees have been confirmed. We \nhave fallen dramatically behind the pace set for consideration of \nPresident Bush's nominees.\n  With respect to Senate Republican leadership's current practice of \nholding, delaying and obstructing Senate consideration of judicial \nnominees reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee, this is a \ntactic they reserve for nominees of Democratic Presidents. Indeed, when \nPresident Bush was in the White House, Senate Republicans took the \nposition that it was unconstitutional and wholly inappropriate not to \nvote on nominees approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee. With a \nDemocratic President, they have reverted to the secret holds that \nresulted in pocket filibusters of more than 60 nominees during the \nClinton years. Last year, Senate Republicans successfully stalled all \nbut a dozen Federal circuit and district court nominees. That was the \nlowest total number of judges confirmed in more than 50 years. They \nhave continued that practice despite the fact that judicial vacancies \ncontinue to hover around 100, with more than 40 declared judicial \nemergencies.\n  Since the nomination of Jane Stranch of Tennessee is for a vacancy in \nthe Sixth Circuit, when the Republican leader blocked consideration of \nher nomination earlier this week, I provided the history of how \nnominees to the Sixth Circuit by Presidents Clinton and Bush had been \ntreated. Despite the fact that Senate Republicans had pocket \nfilibustered President Clinton's nominees, Senate Democrats proceeded \nto consider President Bush's.\n  Today I would like to outline the recent history of the Fourth \nCircuit. Two nominees from North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit were \nthe subject of a request for a time agreement by the Senator from North \nCarolina last week. The Republican leader objected to any agreement to \ndebate and vote on those nominations, as well. I note that one of those \nNorth Carolina nominations was reported unanimously by the Judiciary \nCommittee, and the other received six Republican votes in favor and \nonly one vote against. They are supported by both Senators from North \nCarolina, one a Republican and one a Democrat. Still the Republican \nleadership refuses to allow the Senate to consider them.\n  When I became chairman of the Judiciary Committee midway through \nPresident Bush's first tumultuous year in office, I worked very hard to \nmake sure Senate Democrats did not perpetuate the judge wars as tit-\nfor-tat. In fact, we did not. Senate Republicans had pocket \nfilibustered more than 60 of President Clinton's judicial nominations \nand refused to proceed on them. Included among these was one of the \nnominees from North Carolina now pending before us again, Judge Wynn. \nNevertheless, during the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee \nduring President Bush's first 2 years in office, the Senate proceeded \nto confirm 100 of his judicial nominees. The Fourth Circuit was \nproblematic, as I will explain, but we were able to make progress there \nas well. It was not as much progress as I would have liked, but during \nthe Bush administration we were able to reduce the number of vacancies \nin the Fourth Circuit.\n  In contrast to the Republican Senate majority during the Clinton \nadministration that obstructed nominations and more than doubled \ncircuit court vacancies, Senate Democrats contributed to the reduction \nof circuit court vacancies by two-thirds during the Bush \nadministration. The Senator from Kentucky complained last week about \ntwo nominations made during the 7th and 8th years of the Bush \nadministration, including one that did not have the support of home \nState Senators. He did not mention that, during the Clinton \nadministration, Senate Republicans pocket filibustered five of \nPresident Clinton's nominations to the Fourth Circuit, resulting in a \ndoubling of Fourth Circuit vacancies, which rose from two to five. The \nRepublican leader did not mention that Senate Republicans did not \nproceed on even one of President Clinton's Fourth Circuit nominees \nduring the last three years of his administration or the fact that, by\n\n[[Page S6194]]\n\ncontrast, Senate Democrats did proceed to confirm Judge Agee of \nVirginia to the Fourth Circuit in the last few months of the Bush \nadministration.\n  The fact is that Senate Democrats did not do what Republicans are \napparently now doing--retaliating for perceived slights. We did not \nengage in tit-for-tat. When I became chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee midway through President Bush's first year in office, the \nfirst nominee the Judiciary Committee and the Senate considered was a \nVirginia nominee to the Fourth Circuit. Judge Roger Gregory had been \npocket filibustered by Senate Republicans after being nominated by \nPresident Clinton. We also considered and confirmed the controversial \nnomination of Judge Dennis Shedd from South Carolina to the Fourth \nCircuit before the end of that Congress. Senate Democrats cooperated in \norder to break a longstanding logjam that had prevented any North \nCarolina representation on the Fourth Circuit for many years with the \nconfirmation of Judge Allyson Duncan to the Fourth Circuit in 2003.\n  In 2008, under my chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, we moved \nforward to confirm Judge G. Steven Agee of Virginia to the Fourth \nCircuit. The confirmation of Judge Agee was one more Fourth Circuit \nconfirmation than Senate Republicans would allow during the last 3 \nyears of the Clinton administration and allowed us to reduce the \nvacancies on the circuit during the Bush administration by one. While I \nwould have liked to have been more productive, and would have been had \nthe Bush administration not been intent on packing the court, we were \nable to reduce the vacancies on the Fourth Circuit during the Bush \nadministration and reverse the effect of Senate Republicans' \nobstruction of President Clinton's nominees. That is a more accurate \nsnapshot of the recent history of the Fourth Circuit than the isolated \nnominations at the end of the Bush administration that the Republican \nleader referenced as if they justified his objection to proceeding to \ndebate and vote on the consensus nominations of Judge James Wynn and \nJudge Albert Diaz now.\n  The Fourth Circuit is a good example of how much time and effort was \nwasted on ideological nominations by President Bush. For example, there \nwas the highly controversial and failed nomination of William ``Jim'' \nHaynes II, to the Fourth Circuit. Senator Graham of South Carolina \ncriticized that nomination just recently during the Judiciary Committee \nconsideration of the nomination of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. As \ngeneral counsel at the Department of Defense, he was the architect of \nmany discredited policies on detainee treatment, military tribunals, \nand torture. Mr. Haynes never fulfilled the pledge he made to me under \noath at his hearing to supply the materials he discussed in an extended \nopening statement regarding his role in developing these policies and \ntheir legal justifications.\n  The Haynes nomination led the Richmond Times-Dispatch to write an \neditorial in late 2006 entitled ``No Vacancies,'' about the President's \ncounterproductive approach to nominations in the Fourth Circuit. The \neditorial criticized the Bush administration for pursuing political \nfights at the expense of filling vacancies. According to the Times-\nDispatch, ``The president erred by renominating . . . and may be \nsquandering his opportunity to fill numerous other vacancies with \njudges of right reason.'' The Times-Dispatch editorial focused on the \nrenomination of Mr. Haynes, but could just as easily have been written \nabout other controversial Fourth Circuit nominees.\n  Another example is President Bush's nominations of Duncan Getchell, \nover the objections of both his home State Senators, a Republican and a \nDemocrat. That nomination was later withdrawn.\n  Another example is President Bush's nomination of Claude Allen to a \nvacancy in Maryland, despite the fact that he was opposed by both \nMaryland Senators. That nomination was withdrawn and Allen was later \narrested and convicted of fraud.\n  The President insisted on nominating and renominating Terrence Boyle \nover the course of 6 years to a North Carolina vacancy on the Fourth \nCircuit. This despite the fact that as a sitting U.S. district judge \nand while a circuit court nominee, Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases \ninvolving corporations in which he held investments. The President \nshould have heeded the call of North Carolina Police Benevolent \nAssociation, the North Carolina Troopers' Association, the Police \nBenevolent Associations from South Carolina and Virginia, the National \nAssociation of Police Organizations, the Professional Fire Fighters and \nParamedics of North Carolina, as well as the advice of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina who opposed the nomination. Law enforcement officers \nfrom North Carolina and across the country opposed the nomination. \nCivil rights groups opposed the nomination. Those knowledgeable and \nrespectful of judicial ethics opposed the nomination. President Bush \npersisted for 6 years before withdrawing the Boyle nomination.\n  I mention these ill-advised nominations because Senate Republicans \nseem to have forgotten this recent history and why there are continuing \nvacancies on the Fourth Circuit. The efforts and years wasted on \nPresident Bush's ideological nominations followed in the wake of the \nRepublican Senate majority's refusal to consider President Clinton's \nFourth Circuit nominees. All four nominees from North Carolina to the \nFourth Circuit were blocked from consideration by the Republican Senate \nmajority. These outstanding nominees included U.S. District Court Judge \nJames Beaty, Jr., U.S. Bankruptcy Judge J. Richard Leonard, North \nCarolina Court of Appeals Judge James Wynn, and Professor Elizabeth \nGibson. The failure to proceed on these nominations has yet to be \nexplained. Had either Judge Beaty or Judge Wynn been considered and \nconfirmed, he would have been the first African-American judge \nappointed to the Fourth Circuit.\n  In contrast, I worked to break through the impasse and to confirm \nJudge Allyson Duncan of North Carolina to the Fourth Circuit when \nPresident Bush nominated her. I also worked to reduce Federal judicial \nvacancies in North Carolina by confirming eight district court judges \nduring the Bush administration. By contrast, during the entire 8 years \nof the Clinton administration, only one district court judge was \nallowed to be confirmed for North Carolina.\n  Overall judicial vacancies were reduced during the Bush years to less \nthan 4 percent. Federal judicial vacancies are now over 10 percent. \nDuring the Bush years, the Federal circuit court vacancies were reduced \nfrom a high of 32 down to single digits after Senate Republicans had \nmore than doubled circuit court vacancies during the last 6 years of \nthe Clinton administration. Our progress has not continued with \nPresident Obama. Instead, Republican obstruction is putting that \nprogress at risk. During the Bush years, we reduced vacancies on nine \ncircuits. Since then, vacancies on six circuits have risen and circuit \ncourt vacancies have doubled from their low point.\n  There did come a time in the 108th Congress when President Bush and \nSenate Republicans were intent on packing the courts with ideologues, \nand the Republican chairman of the Judiciary rewrote or broke our rules \nand practices in his attempt to assist that effort. They forced \nfilibusters of nominees. Most of those were ultimately confirmed and \nsome withdrew, including Miguel Estrada who withdrew when the Bush \nadministration would not accommodate Senate requests for access to \ninformation about his work. Senate Democrats did not replicate or \nretaliate for Republican excesses during the Clinton years. As chairman \nI proceeded on judicial nominees I opposed, I made blue slips public \nand Senate Democrats debated judicial nominees in public and gave their \nreasons for opposition rather than relying as Senate Republicans had on \nsecret holds and pocket filibusters.\n  I have not done what the Republican chairman did. I have respected \nand protected the rights of the minority. I have followed our rules and \npractices. President Obama has not done what President Bush did by \nmaking nominations opposed by home State Senators. Instead, President \nObama has reached out and worked with home State Senators from both \nparties. He has identified well-qualified nominees. Despite our \nefforts, the qualifications of the nominees, and the support of home \nState Senators, including Republican\n\n[[Page S6195]]\n\nSenators, Senate Republicans have filibustered, obstructed and delayed \nconsideration of President Obama's judicial nominees favorably reported \nby the Judiciary Committee.\n  I have tried to ratchet up the cooperation between parties and \nbranches in my role as chairman. It is disappointing to see the Senate \nRepublican leadership take the opposite approach. They are holding up \nfor no good reason consideration of nominees reported from the \nJudiciary Committee for weeks and months. Their pattern is to stall and \nobstruct. Republicans' sense of injury is misplaced in my view. \nMoreover, the disproportionateness of their response to perceived \nslights disserves the American people and our Federal justice system.\n  I was interested to see the Republican leader in his statement last \nweek claim credit for the confirmations of Judge Andre Davis of \nMaryland and Judge Barbara Keenan of Virginia to the Fourth Circuit. I \nwould be delighted to praise the Republican leader were he to work with \nus, and I look forward to doing so were he to agree without further \ndelay to debates and prompt votes on the more than 20 judicial nominees \nnow being stalled by Republican objection.\n  Let us remember what happened with the two nominees he now mentions: \nthe nomination of Judge Andre Davis was stalled for 5 months after \nbeing reported by the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan \nmajority by a vote of 16 to 3. Some would say this nomination was \ndelayed for 10 years since Judge Davis had been nominated by President \nClinton toward the end of his administration in 2000 and was not \nconfirmed until 2010. Judge Davis was a well-respected judge who had \nserved for 14 years as a Federal district judge and before that for 8 \nyears as a Maryland State court judge and had received the highest \nrating by the ABA. I understand why the Republican leader ultimately \nvoted for him, along with more than 70 other Senators who provided a \nstrong bipartisan majority once Republicans allowed the vote to \nproceed. It is up to each Senator how he or she chooses to vote. My \nconcern is that the debate and vote on the nomination was needlessly \nstalled for 5 months.\n  The case of Judge Barbara Keenan is even more troubling. Judge Keenan \nhad been a judge for 29 years and served on each of the four levels of \nVirginia State courts. The ABA awarded her its highest rating as did \nthe Virginia State Bar. Judge Keenan's nomination was reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee on October 29, 2009. It took \nuntil March 2, more than 4 months, to get the Senate to debate and vote \non this nomination after it was unanimously reported. And even that \ndoes not fully indicate the Republican obstruction. It also took the \nmajority leader's filing a cloture petition to bring the nomination to \na vote. Having refused to agree to a time agreement on this consensus \nnomination, the Senate had to invoke cloture to end the stalling. When \nthe vote was finally taken, it was unanimous. No Senator voted against \nthis nomination or spoke against it. So, I asked, why the stalling? \nTragically, that stalling and obstruction has continued and is \ncontinuing. I said then that even when Republicans cannot say no, they \nnonetheless demand that the Senate go slow. This is wrong. Judge \nKeenan's nomination is just one example from several where after \nstalling and delaying consideration for weeks and months for no good \nreason, Senate Republicans do not vote against the nomination.\n  I suspect that will happen again with the North Carolina nominees to \nthe Fourth Circuit whose consideration the Republican leader objected \nto last week. After all, they were reported 18 to 1 and 19 to 0. Judge \nJames Wynn of North Carolina and Judge Albert Diaz of North Carolina \nare examples of the judicial nominees being stalled who would be \nconfirmed by the Senate if the Senate Republican leadership would agree \nto debate and vote on them. The list includes not only the 21 Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees currently stalled by Republican \nobjection from final Senate consideration, but also many of the 36 \nconfirmed but who were needlessly delayed. What is being perpetuated is \na shame that does harm to the American people and the Federal courts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6195-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6195-S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING FIRST LIEUTENANT VERNON BAKER\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to 1LT \nVernon Baker, a native of Cheyenne, WY. Our Nation has lost a son of \nWyoming and hero of World War II.\n  First Lieutenant Baker not only fought the fascist Axis powers but he \nalso fought to serve in a segregated U.S. Army. Vernon Baker's life \nstory is a testament to no door or opportunity can be permanently shut \nin the United States.\n  As a young man, Mr. Baker made the decision to serve his country in \nWorld War II by joining the U.S. Army. He was initially told by Army \nrecruiters he could not sign up because he was Black. His determination \nto serve his country was not deterred. Vernon returned to the Cheyenne \nrecruiting office and found a recruiter who would sign him up.\n  First Lieutenant Baker went on to serve with the 92nd Infantry \nDivision's 370th Regiment, an all Black unit in Italy. Throughout his \nWorld War II service, Mr. Baker was awarded the Bronze Star, Purple \nHeart, and the Distinguished Service Cross. Fifty years later, First \nLieutenant Baker was awarded the Medal of Honor for his leadership and \nbravery in destroying a number of German positions near Viareggio, \nItaly, almost single handedly.\n  I thank Mr. Baker for his service. Mr. Baker is survived by wife \nHeidy, four children, and a grandson.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nFirst Lieutenant Baker's Medal of Honor citation and an article that \nappeared in the Casper Star Tribune.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n       Citation: For extraordinary heroism in action on 5 and 6 \n     April 1945, near Viareggio, Italy. Then Second Lieutenant \n     Baker demonstrated outstanding courage and leadership in \n     destroying enemy installations, personnel and equipment \n     during his company's attack against a strongly entrenched \n     enemy in mountainous terrain. When his company was stopped by \n     the concentration of fire from several machine gun \n     emplacements, he crawled to one position and destroyed it, \n     killing three Germans. Continuing forward, he attacked an \n     enemy observation post and killed two occupants. With the aid \n     of one of his men, Lieutenant Baker attacked two more machine \n     gun nests, killing or wounding the four enemy soldiers \n     occupying these positions. He then covered the evacuation of \n     the wounded personnel of his company by occupying an exposed \n     position and drawing the enemy's fire. On the following night \n     Lieutenant Baker voluntarily led a battalion advance through \n     enemy mine fields and heavy fire toward the division \n     objective. Second Lieutenant Baker's fighting spirit and \n     daring leadership were an inspiration to his men and \n     exemplify the highest traditions of the Armed Forces.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                      [From the Associated Press]\n\n                        Medal of Honor Hero Dies\n\n\n    Wyoming native overcame discrimination, segregation in military\n\n                           (By Rebecca Boone)\n\n       St. Maries, Idaho.--Wyoming native Vernon Baker, who \n     belatedly received the Medal of Honor for his role in World \n     War II, died at his home near St. Maries, Idaho. He was 90.\n       Baker died Tuesday of complications of brain cancer, \n     Benewah County Coroner and funeral home owner Ron Hodge said.\n       Then-President Bill Clinton presented the nation's highest \n     award for battlefield valor to Baker in 1997. He was one of \n     just seven black soldiers to receive it and the only living \n     recipient.\n       ``The only thing that I can say to those who are not here \n     with me is, `Thank you, fellas, well done,' '' Baker told The \n     Washington Post after the ceremony. `` `And I will always \n     remember you.' ''\n       In 1944, 2nd Lt. Baker was sent to Italy with a full \n     platoon of 54 men. On April 5, he and his soldiers found \n     themselves behind enemy lines near Viareggio, Italy.\n       When concentrated enemy fire from several machine gun \n     emplacements stopped his company's advance, Baker crawled to \n     one and destroyed it, killing three Germans. Continuing \n     forward, he attacked an enemy observation post and killed two \n     occupants.\n       With the aid of one of his men, Baker attacked two more \n     machine gun nests, killing or wounding the four enemy \n     soldiers occupying these positions. Then he covered the \n     evacuation of his wounded soldiers by occupying an exposed \n     position and drawing the enemy's fire.\n       On the following night, Baker voluntarily led a battalion \n     advance through enemy mine fields and heavy fire.\n       In all, Baker and his platoon killed 26 Germans and \n     destroyed six machine gun nests, two observer posts and four \n     dugouts.\n\n[[Page S6196]]\n\n       He said later he felt the company commander, who said he \n     was going to get reinforcements, had abandoned his group of \n     men. ``It made me all the more determined to accomplish our \n     mission,'' he told the PBS series ``American Valor.'' \n     ``Because at that time the Army was segregated. It was \n     thought that we were unable to fight.''\n       No black soldiers were awarded the Medal of Honor during \n     World War II, although Baker did receive the Purple Heart, a \n     Bronze Star and Distinguished Service Cross.\n       In 1993, U.S. Army officials contracted Shaw University in \n     Raleigh, N.C., to determine if there was a racial disparity \n     in the way Medal of Honor recipients were selected. The \n     university researchers found that there was, and recommended \n     10 soldiers to receive it. From that list, Pentagon officials \n     picked seven.\n       But there was one problem--the statutory limit for \n     presentation had expired. Congress was required to pass \n     legislation that allowed the president to award the Medals of \n     Honor so long after the action.\n       Baker was the only recipient still living; the other six \n     soldiers received their awards posthumously, with their \n     medals being presented to family members.\n       Baker was initially rebuffed when he tried to join the \n     Army. Baker said in an interview with public television that \n     a recruiter told him that there was no quota for enlisting \n     ``you people.''\n       Reflecting on life in a segregated Army unit, he told The \n     Washington Post, ``I was an angry young man. We were all \n     angry. But we had a job to do, and we did it.'' He added, \n     though, that he ``knew things would get better, and I'm glad \n     to say that I'm here to see it.''\n       Baker returned to his northern Idaho home after the war. \n     When he received a call telling him he was to receive a Medal \n     of Honor, at first he was astonished. Then he was angry.\n       ``It was something that I felt should have been done a long \n     time ago,'' he told Idaho public television. ``If I was \n     worthy of receiving the Medal of Honor in 1945, I should have \n     received it then.''\n       Baker called his 1997 memoir ``Lasting Valor.''\n       U.S. Rep. Walt Minnick said he met Vernon Baker in the \n     1990s when the soldier spoke at a College of Idaho event. \n     Minnick said he'd been expecting a tough, battle-hardened \n     soldier, but says he was instead struck by Baker's gentle \n     demeanor. Minnick said Baker's valor on the battlefield in \n     Italy was a rebuke of racist policies that dominated the U.S. \n     military into the middle of the last century.\n       ``His actions on the front line demonstrates better than \n     words can describe why discrimination and segregation in the \n     military was both unfair and absolutely inconsistent with an \n     effective fighting force,'' Minnick said. ``He demonstrated a \n     degree of courage few people have. He was prepared to give \n     his life for his country--a country in which he was \n     considered a second-class citizen.''\n       Baker was born in 1919 in Wyoming. Orphaned as a small \n     child, he was raised by his grandparents in Cheyenne. He was \n     working as a railroad porter when he decided to join the Army \n     in mid-1941, a few months before Pearl Harbor.\n       In 2004, Baker underwent emergency surgery to remove a \n     malignant brain tumor. Before he fell ill, he had failed to \n     sign up for benefits from Veterans Affairs and Medicare, not \n     realizing what the requirements were. Community members and \n     politicians in Idaho pitched in to help him get aid for his \n     unpaid medical bills.\n       Hodge said Baker continued to battle brain cancer over the \n     next years, and he recently began receiving hospice care at \n     his home. Baker was surrounded by his family when he died \n     Tuesday evening.\n       Hodge said Baker's wife, Heidi Baker, plans to have a \n     memorial service in St. Maries but the arrangements have not \n     yet been made. He said Heidi Baker also planned to talk with \n     military officials about possibly having Baker buried at \n     Arlington National Cemetery.\n       A war hero, Baker was also a man of peace. After receiving \n     the award, he told a newspaper reporter for the Moscow-\n     Pullman Daily News: ``I hope never to see someone else having \n     the Medal of Honor hung around his neck by the president of \n     the United States. You young people coming up, please don't \n     take war as a solution to a problem. God gave you the brains \n     to think and not to use violence as a means to an end.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6196-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6196]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       GANN VALLEY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON.

This \ncommunity, just 15 minutes away from the Missouri River, is the county \nseat of Buffalo County.\n  Gann Valley was named after Herst Gann, one of the area's pioneers as \nwell as the publisher of one of two local newspapers. Gann also donated \nthe courthouse when the town was founded on January 14, 1885. Since the \nrailroad never came through, a freight line made three trips a week to \nneighboring Kimball to bring in goods for the town and ship out the \nproducts from the town's creamery.\n  Gann Valley will spend Saturday, July 31, celebrating this historic \nmilestone. A wagon train will arrive in the morning to kick off the \nfestivities, followed by a parade, games, a dance, and more.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 100th \nanniversary of Timber Lake, SD, on the Cheyenne River Sioux Indian \nReservation. The county seat of Dewey County, this small town embodies \nSouth Dakota values.\n  Originally established by the Secretary of the Interior, the land \nplots were so popular that 1,000 people camped out when the land went \non sale. The town grew quickly with many ``tent stores'' springing up. \nSettlers arrived before the railroad did, so building materials were \nbrought in by wagon. The Milwaukee Railroad quickly realized the demand \nfor a railroad through Timber Lake, and by May, trains were reaching \nthe thriving new town. Timber Lake officially incorporated in February \n1911. The census in 1920 showed a population of 555, making it \nofficially a city of the second class.\n  In the early 1920s, sewer lines were laid for a town septic system. \nThe digging machine unearthed a metal object, which was put in the \nbank. Upon further examination, and after it was cleaned, it was \ndetermined to be a sculpture of two hands clasping a rose branch with a \nsnake winding through the hands. The origin of this unexpected find is \nstill unknown.\n  To honor its 100 year anniversary, the Timber Lake community is \nhaving a ``Days of 1910'' celebration, complete with a banquet, a \ntalent show and play, and a viewing of 4-H exhibits. I am proud to \nrecognize them on their historic milestone, and I look forward to \nseeing what else this great town accomplishes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6196-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6196-S6197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO SONYA DAMSKER LEFKOVITS\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nSonya Damsker Lefkovits, who is being honored by the Columbiana Chamber \nof Commerce for her dedication and service to her community.\n  Sonya was born May 6, 1923, in Memphis, TN, to Louis and Helen \nRichberger Damsker. Raised in Tyler, TX, Sonya graduated from Tyler \nHigh School and went on to attend Louisiana State University, where she \nearned a degree in public school music. Following her graduation at \nLSU, Sonya moved to Birmingham to work at the Jewish Welfare Board as \nits first activities director. It was there that she met her future \nhusband, Norman Leo Lefkovits.\n  In July, 1947, Sonya married Norman Leo Lefkovits, and she moved to \nColumbiana to operate the Lefkovits family mercantile store, The \nColumbiana Leader. Since arriving in Columbiana, AL, nearly 63 years \nago, Sonya has been an integral member of her community. In 1949, she \nbecame a charter member of the Vignette Club, which gave her the \nopportunity to participate in various community projects. Among her \nproudest achievements was working on the building committee during the \nconstruction of the Columbia Library when she was chairman of the \nColumbiana Library Board.\n  Sonya has also held various community leadership positions. She was a \nmember of the Shelby County High School Band Boosters Club, the womens \ncoordinator for the Columbiana Civil Defense Organization, and \ncochairman of the Shelby County Civil War Centennial Commemoration. \nSonya was an active member of the Shelby County Historical Society. In \n1999, Sonya helped to form the Columbiana Merchants and Professional \nAssociation, where she worked on the Columbiana Downtown Renovation \nCommittee. She also served as an ambassador to the South Shelby Chamber \nof Commerce.\n  Sonya has two children, Norman Leo Lefkovits, Jr. and Marsha Phyllis \nLefkovits, both of whom now reside in California. In the early 1980s, \nMarsha\n\n[[Page S6197]]\n\nserved with distinction as a member of my staff in Washington, DC. \nSoon, Sonya will be leaving Columbiana to join her children on the west \ncoast.\n  I am sure that Sonya will be sorely missed in Columbiana, whose \nresidents will reap the benefits of her contributions to their \ncommunity for years to come. Regardless of where she resides, I know \nthat she will continue to touch the lives of everyone fortunate enough \nto meet her.\n  I wish Sonya luck on her journey west, and I ask this entire Senate \nto join me in recognizing and honoring the life and career of my good \nfriend Sonya Lefkovits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6197-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING AXIOM TECHNOLOGIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I have long held the belief that the \navailability of broadband undoubtedly contributes to business \nexpansion, employment growth, and greater educational opportunities. \nIndeed, the Internet can truly transform the way small firms do \nbusiness. This is particularly the case in places like my home State of \nMaine, which is not only largely rural, but is home to over 150,000 \nsmall businesses. As such, it is with great admiration that today I \nrecognize Axiom Technologies, based in the town of Machias, for the \nfirm's outstanding commitment to the goal of bringing broadband \nInternet service to rural Maine communities that have not previously \nknown its remarkable power.\n  Founded in 2004 by Nelson Geel and Chris Moody, Axiom originally \nsought to provide inexpensive consulting services to small businesses \nand communities in Washington County, Maine's easternmost county. Yet \nthe two quickly realized that there was a growing desire for affordable \nbroadband in the area, which was largely overlooked by corporate \nproviders. As such, the company reevaluated its business vision in an \nattempt to allow rural areas of the State to benefit from the same \nadvantages of broadband Internet provided to Maine's more urban \nregions.\n  In addition to operating on a sustainable financial basis, Axiom \nTechnologies prides itself on always attempting to hold true to a \nunique social mission as well. Axiom is well aware ``of the central \nrole that business plays in society'' and seeks to solidify this \nresponsibility ``by initiating innovative ways to improve the quality \nof life in the communities in which [it] operate[s].'' Not only has the \ncompany done this by spreading equality of access to information \nthrough broadband services, but its employees also take it upon \nthemselves to improve their community.\n  One shining example is Susan Corbett, Axiom's CEO, who was \ninstrumental in the development of a type of community-minded, service-\nbased listserv for Washington County called Mighty Women. In 2006, she, \nalong with some of her entrepreneurial and social service peers, \ncreated the ``rolodex'' of e-mail contacts that could be solicited to \nassist those in need throughout eastern Maine. Indeed, in 2009, the \nMighty Women listserv mobilized to raise last minute funds for \nWashington county children who were in need of toys and warm clothing \nfor the holiday season. With just a week before Christmas, the group \nraised approximately $3,000 to help give the children the holiday joy \nthat they deserved.\n  People such as Susan Corbett are representative of the family-like \nmentality which Axiom Technologies hopes to foster among its employees \nand within the greater community. Small businesses around the country \nhave historically helped build a sense of community in the areas in \nwhich they operate, and Axiom is no exception. The ability to access \ninformation via broadband should be something available to all people \nacross America, and Axiom Technologies has built its business around \nfulfilling this goal. The company has done it economically, but most \ninspiringly, Axiom has attempted to promote the well-being of the \npeople in the communities they serve. When a business cares about \nhelping others as does Axiom, the community can rest assured that \nAxiom's employees share their goals and aspirations for improving the \noverall community.\n  While small businesses are duly noted as the drivers of the Nation's \neconomy, they cannot be overlooked for their positive social impacts on \nthe communities in which they operate. Although they may serve a \nrelatively small market, Axiom is certainly on the cutting edge when it \ncomes to promoting broadband equality, a goal of national importance. I \nthank everyone at Axiom for their numerous and varied contributions to \nthe health of Maine's economic future and general welfare, and I wish \nthem much success in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6197-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6197]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ALTON ``RED'' FRANKLIN\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to acknowledge Coach \nAlton ``Red'' Franklin for his dedicated service to Louisiana and in \nparticular to Haynesville High School in northern Louisiana. I would \nlike to take some time to make a few remarks on his accomplishments.\n  Throughout his distinguished career as the Haynesville High School \nfootball coach, he won 27 district championships and participated in \nthe State playoffs 31 times. The team had 8 undefeated seasons and 191 \nshutouts. Coach Franklin led the team to 11 State championships in four \ndecades winning four consecutive State championships from 1993 to 1996. \nCoach Franklin was inducted in the Louisiana High School Coaches \nAssociation Hall of Fame in 1991. He was also named State coach of the \nyear 6 times and district coach of the year 23 times throughout his \ncareer.\n  When Coach Franklin retired in January of 2002, he retired as the \nsecond most winningest football coach in Louisiana history and number \n15 nationally. Coach Franklin had accumulated a remarkable record of \n366 wins, 76 losses, and 8 ties.\n  Even after his outstanding career, Red Franklin continued to be \nactively involved in his community, returning to Haynesville High in \n2003 as a volunteer assistant coach for his son David, the current head \ncoach. In 2009, Red Franklin won his first State championship as an \nassistant coach to his son. On July 10, 2010, Red Franklin received the \nhigh honor of being inducted into the National Federation of State High \nSchool Associations Hall of Fame Class of 2010.\n  Thus, today, I honor a fellow Louisianian, Coach Alton ``Red'' \nFranklin, for his exceptional and distinguished service to Haynesville \nHigh School and to our State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6197-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6197-S6198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:13 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2693.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging Congress to oppose the creation of a new \n     consumer regulatory agency for FDIC insured institutions; to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution, No. 147\n\n       Whereas, H.R. 4173 and S. 3217 are sweepingly broad bills \n     pending in conference in the United States Congress that \n     would restructure the financial regulatory system; and\n       Whereas, both measures would create a new Consumer \n     Financial Protection Agency/Bureau with overly broad powers \n     that would have complete authority over Louisiana banks and \n     thrifts with respect to writing future consumer regulations; \n     and\n       Whereas, although improvements can and should be made to \n     further protect consumers from unscrupulous practices, the \n     creation of an enormous, new federal bureaucracy is the wrong \n     approach because it will harm both Louisiana banks and their \n     customers; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana banks and thrifts will be subject to \n     greatly increased regulation and compliance costs, which will \n     hamper their ability to effectively serve their customers' \n     needs; and\n       Whereas, this increased regulatory burden will likely lead \n     to increased costs of obtaining credit for consumers and \n     overall less access to financial products and services; and\n       Whereas, the vast majority of FDIC insured institutions, \n     especially Louisiana banks and thrifts, did not contribute to \n     the financial crisis, yet would be subject to the broad \n     jurisdiction of this proposed agency; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana banks and thrifts are already heavily \n     regulated and examined on a regular basis for compliance with \n     existing consumer laws and safety and soundness; and\n       Whereas, this new proposed agency, which has no experience \n     as a bank regulator, would likely create a mountain of new \n     regulation that is one sided in its focus without balancing \n     bank safety and soundness considerations of the financial \n     institution; and\n       Whereas, this will put Louisiana banks and thrifts in a \n     position where they must try to comply with conflicting \n     mandates that ultimately could put their businesses at risk; \n     and\n       Whereas, creating another layer of bureaucracy in the \n     banking industry also does not address the gaps in regulation \n     that exist with respect to non-bank lenders; and\n       Whereas, the Obama administration itself has acknowledged \n     that 94% of the high-cost mortgage loans that have so damaged \n     our economy were made by non-bank financial companies; and\n       Whereas, with this in mind, Congress should concentrate on \n     improving the supervision and examination of such non-bank \n     institutions rather than adding to an already large \n     regulatory compliance structure for banks and thrifts. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to oppose the creation of a \n     new consumer regulatory agency for FDIC insured institutions. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-132.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to continue to \n     support and invest in the National Cancer Institute Community \n     Cancer Centers Program; to the Committee on Health, \n     Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 122\n\n       Whereas, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Community \n     Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP) began in 2007 to provide \n     community cancer centers and their patients across the United \n     States better access to the most advanced cancer research; \n     and\n       Whereas, NCI estimates that the vast majority of cancer \n     patients (about 85 percent) are treated at community \n     hospitals in or near the communities in which they live and \n     only about 15 percent of U.S. cancer patients are diagnosed \n     and treated at the nation's major academic-based cancer \n     centers; and\n       Whereas, many patients choose community hospitals because \n     they are close to family, friends, and jobs, whereas \n     treatment at the major cancer centers may require long \n     commutes or extended stays away from home; and\n       Whereas, the NCCCP extends NCI programs into local \n     communities, giving patients easier access to state-of-the-\n     art cancer care and clinical trial opportunities; and\n       Whereas, the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program has \n     formed a national network of community cancer centers to \n     expand cancer research and deliver the most advanced cancer \n     care to more Americans in the communities where they live; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Cancer Program of Our Lady of the Lake and \n     Mary Bird Perkins was one of only 16 community cancer \n     programs in the country selected to participate in the NCI \n     Community Cancer Centers Program because of its proven \n     medical leadership, phenomenal community outreach and \n     experience in conducting clinical trials; and\n       Whereas, the Cancer Program of Our Lady of the Lake and \n     Mary Bird Perkins was the\n\n[[Page S6200]]\n\n     only cancer program in Louisiana, and the only program in the \n     Gulf South, selected for the NCI Community Cancer Centers \n     Program; and\n       Whereas, the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program is \n     designed to create a community-based cancer center network to \n     support basic, clinical and population-based research \n     initiatives, addressing the full cancer care continuum from \n     prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and survivorship \n     through end-of-life care; and\n       Whereas, the seven major focus areas of the NCI Community \n     Cancer Centers Program are to reduce cancer healthcare \n     disparities, improve quality of care, increase participation \n     in clinical trials, enhance cancer survivorship and \n     palliative care services, participate in biospecimen research \n     initiatives to support personalized medicine, expand use of \n     electronic health records and connect to cancer research data \n     network and enhance cancer advocacy; and\n       Whereas, the sixteen initial pilot hospitals have made \n     considerable progress toward achieving the major program \n     goals and are defining for NCI what it takes to build a \n     national network of community hospitals that are fully \n     engaged in cancer research and offer the latest evidence-\n     based, multidisciplinary care to diverse populations in their \n     home communities; and\n       Whereas, funding from the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act helped the NCI Community Cancer Centers \n     Program expand from its original pilot network of sixteen to \n     thirty hospitals in twenty-two states. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to continue to support and \n     invest in the National Cancer Institute Community Cancer \n     Centers Program, a vital and innovative program that is \n     transforming the way cancer care is delivered across the \n     nation. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives and to each member \n     of the Louisiana delegation to the United States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-135. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to adopt and submit \n     to the states for ratification the Parental Rights Amendment \n     to the Constitution of the United States; to the Committee on \n     the Judiciary.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 38\n\n       Whereas, the right of parents to direct the upbringing and \n     education of their children is a fundamental right protected \n     by the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution \n     of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, our nation has historically relied first and \n     foremost upon parents to meet the real and constant needs of \n     children; and\n       Whereas, the interests of children are best served when \n     parents are free to make child-rearing decisions about \n     education, religion, and other areas of a child's life \n     without state interference; and\n       Whereas, the United States Supreme Court, in Wisconsin v. \n     Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 (1972), held that ``This primary role of \n     the parents in the upbringing of their children is now \n     established beyond debate as an enduring American \n     tradition''; and\n       Whereas, however, in Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 \n     (2000), six justices of the United States Supreme Court filed \n     opinions on the nature and enforceability of parental rights \n     under the Constitution of the United States; and\n       Whereas, the number of written opinions in Troxel v. \n     Granville has created confusion and ambiguity about the \n     fundamental nature of parental rights in the laws and society \n     of the several states; and\n       Whereas, H. J. Res. 42 and S.J. Res. 16 were introduced \n     during the First Session of the 111th Congress to provide for \n     an amendment to the United States Constitution to prevent \n     erosion of the enduring American tradition of treating \n     parental rights as fundamental rights, and the legislation \n     states:\n       ``Section One: The liberty of parents to direct the \n     upbringing and education of their children is a fundamental \n     right.\n       Section Two: Neither the United States nor any State shall \n     infringe upon this right without demonstrating that its \n     governmental interest as applied to the person is of the \n     highest order and not otherwise served.\n       Section Three: No treaty may be adopted nor shall any \n     source of international law be employed to supersede, modify, \n     interpret, or apply to the rights guaranteed by this \n     article''; and\n       Whereas, this amendment would add explicit text to the \n     Constitution of the United States to forever protect the \n     rights of parents as they are now enjoyed, without \n     substantive change to current state or federal laws \n     respecting these rights; and\n       Whereas, the enumeration of these rights in the text of the \n     Constitution of the United States would preserve these rights \n     from being infringed upon by shifting ideologies and \n     interpretations of the United States Supreme Court. \n     Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, that the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to adopt and submit to the \n     states for ratification the Parental Rights Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States. Be it further\n       Resolved, that a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6200-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6200]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DORGAN, from the Committee on Appropriations, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 3635.

A bill to authorize appropriations for the Housing \nAssistance Council; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Housing \nAssistance Council Authorization Act. This legslation will re-authorize \nappropriations for the Housing Assistance Council, HAC, which has been \ncommitted to developing affordable housing in rural communities for \nover 35 years.\n  HAC was originally given a three-year authorization through the Farm \nBill in 2008. During the past three years HAC made $46.1 million in \ngrants and loans to help build 3,878 homes throughout rural America. \nThe program has leveraged its funding with over $360 million in other \nfinancing and has provided essential technical assistance to local non-\nprofits throughout the country in the form of capacity building grants. \nThese critical services help local organizations, rural communities and \ncities develop safe and affordable housing.\n  Throughout the country, approximately \\1/5\\ of the Nation's \npopulation lives in rural communities. About 7.5 million of the rural \npopulation is living in poverty and 2.5 million of them are children. \nNearly 3.6 million rural households pay more than 30 percent of their \nincome in housing costs. While housing costs are generally lower in \nrural counties, wages are dramatically outpaced by the cost of housing. \nAdditionally, the housing conditions are often substandard and there \nare many families doubled up due to lack of housing. Rural areas lack \nboth affordable rental units and homeownership opportunities needed to \nserve the population.\n  There are several federal programs that are aimed at developing \naffordable housing and economic opportunities in rural communities in \nboth the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the Department \nof Agriculture. However, rural housing programs have traditionally been \nunderfunded. The administration's fiscal year 2011 budget request \nzeroed two programs that were devoted to helping rural communities: \nRural Innovation Fund, and the Self Help Homeownership Program, SHOP. \nIn many regions, federal funding might be the only assistance available \nfor housing and economic development. The Housing Assistance Council is \nyet another tool that rural communities can utilize when trying to \ndevelop affordable housing.\n  The presence of the HAC in Wisconsin has made a huge impact on rural \nhousing development in Wisconsin and other rural communities across the \ncountry. In Wisconsin, HAC has provided close to $5.2 million in grants \nand loans to 17 non-profit housing organizations and helped develop 825 \nunits of housing.\n  Tony Romo, the current quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys, grew up in \na HAC-supported self-help home in Burlington, WI. His parents built the \nhome as part of Southeastern Wisconsin Housing Corporation's sweat \nequity, self-help homeownership program. There are countless examples \nlinking a child's future success to the stability in their childhood \nhome. Tony Romo's story provides one such example of how a child raised \nin safe, stable homeownership may go on to later success.\n  I am very honored to work with Senators Snowe and Inouye on this \nlegislation. Its passage will allow every state to better serve the \nneeds of the people living in rural areas. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to ensure the adoption of this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himsel, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Gregg, Mr. \n        Bennet and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 3640. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nincrease the limitations on the amount excluded from the gross estate \nwith respect to land subject to a qualified conservation easement; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing, along \nwith my friend and colleague Senator Crapo, legislation to encourage \nfurther protection of our treasured lands, ranches and family farms. \nThe American Family Farm and Ranchland Protection Act is a bipartisan \npiece of legislation that rewards those who protect these lands through \nconservation easements by increasing their exemption from the estate \ntax. Put simply, we strongly support conservation efforts and believe \nwe need to do more to give Americans a real incentive to protect our \nnation's land. It is a companion bill to similar bipartisan legislation \nin the House of Representatives introduced by Congressman Blumenauer.\n  I have long made conservation of America's natural resources a core \ncomponent of my public service. In my role as chair of the National \nParks Subcommittee, I am continuously focused on preserving our public \nlands and waters, because we owe it to future generations to leave them \na sustainable environment. We did not inherit the land from our \nparents, we are borrowing it from our children.\n  However, the Government can only do so much, and many of our most \nimportant landscapes are privately owned property. If we are serious \nabout conservation, we must acknowledge the important role that private \nland owners play in the overall effort to preserve our natural \nresources for generations to come.\n  Estate taxes can compromise Americans' ability to conserve private \nproperty. After the death of a loved one, families are often forced to \nsubdivide a property and sell it for development to pay the costs of \nestate taxes. This situation could become more common starting in 2011 \nwhen the estate tax is set to revert back to the 2001 level of 55 \npercent above a $1 million per spouse exemption. Nearly 15 years ago, \nin an effort to provide some relief and encourage conservation of \nfamily farms and ranches, Congress created an exemption from the estate \ntax of up to 40 percent of the value of the land, capped at $500,000, \nfor land permanently protected by a conservation easement.\n\n[[Page S6204]]\n\n  A conservation easement is a voluntary agreement between a landowner \nand the government that permanently restricts certain development and \nfuture uses of the land. It often prevents future commercialization, \nwhile still permitting historic farming and ranching operations to \ncontinue in the family. I know in Colorado, our lands are best cared \nfor when each generation knows its stewardship will reward the next.\n  When Congress first created the conservation easement exemption from \nestate taxes in 1997, a 40 percent exemption up to a total of $500,000 \nmade sense. Now, that exclusion is simply too small. Since 1997, \naverage farm real estate values have more than doubled and the average \nfarm is larger, as larger farms are more likely to be economically \nviable. Incidentally, larger farms are also more likely to hold \nresources worthy of conservation. The old cap is simply no longer much \nof an incentive.\n  My legislation is a simple solution to the inadequacy of the current \nexemption. It raises the exemption for land under a conservation \neasement to 50 percent, up to a maximum exclusion of $5 million. It \nalso encourages more robust conservation easements: less protective \neasements will receive a proportionally lower exemption rate. If we can \nsupport greater conservation efforts through a simple update to our \nexisting tax code, then to me, that sounds like a deal worth taking.\n  This is a small change, but it has a profound effect. Those who \nchoose to enter into a conservation easement will leave a dramatically \nreduced estate tax burden on their family. This, in turn, will help \nkeep family farms and ranches whole, preserving them for future \ngenerations.\n  This is just a small piece of the estate tax puzzle, but it is an \nimportant one. It is critically important for Congress to address the \nestate tax before the end of this year to prevent it from going back to \nwhere it was a decade ago, with an exemption of only $1 million. At \nthat level, it would affect almost every farmer and rancher in my state \nand in many others, as well as many, many family businesses.\n  We can protect the land, respect private property, ease tax burdens, \nand preserve our important farming and ranching heritage with the \nexemption my legislation proposes. I encourage the Senate to take up \nand approve this common-sense bill in an expeditious manner.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3640\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Family Farm and \n     Ranchland Protection Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCREASE IN LIMITATIONS ON THE AMOUNT EXCLUDED FROM \n                   THE GROSS ESTATE WITH RESPECT TO LAND SUBJECT \n                   TO A QUALIFIED CONSERVATION EASEMENT.\n\n       (a) Increase in Dollar Limitation on Exclusion.--Paragraph \n     (3) of section 2031(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 \n     (relating to exclusion limitation) is amended by striking \n     ``the exclusion limitation is'' and all that follows and \n     inserting ``the exclusion limitation is $5,000,000.''.\n       (b) Increase in Percentage of Value of Land Which Is \n     Excludable.--Paragraph (2) of section 2031(c) of such Code \n     (relating to applicable percentage) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``40 percent'' and inserting ``50 \n     percent'', and\n       (2) by striking ``2 percentage points'' and inserting ``2.5 \n     percentage points''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to the estates of decedents dying after December \n     31, 2009.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 3641. A bill to create the National Endowment for the Oceans to \npromote the protection and conservation of United States ocean, \ncoastal, and Great Lakes ecosystems, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to discuss bipartisan \nlegislation coauthored by my friend and fellow New Englander, Olympia \nSnowe, to establish a national endowment for the preservation, \nconservation, and restoration of our Nation's oceans, our coasts, and \nour Great Lakes. I also wish to take a moment and say a particular \nthank-you to an original cosponsor of this legislation, the chairman of \nthe Commerce Committee, Senator Rockefeller of West Virginia.\n  The National Endowment for the Oceans, along with the President's \nrecent Executive order establishing our country's first ever national \nocean policy, represent a long overdue and badly needed commitment to \nour great waters. While the President's national ocean policy specifies \nnational objectives and outlines processes and government structures to \nrestore, protect, and maintain our ocean and coastal resources, the \nNational Endowment for the Oceans will provide the funding to actually \nachieve those public purposes. The endowment would make grants \navailable to coastal and Great Lakes States, local government agencies, \nregional planning bodies, academic institutions, and nonprofit \norganizations so these entities could embark on projects to learn more \nabout and do a better job of protecting our precious natural resources.\n  Author C. Clarke once said:\n\n       How inappropriate to call this planet Earth when it is \n     quite clearly ocean.\n\n  Oceans cover three-quarters of our planet's surface, contain 90 \npercent of our planet's water, and produce more than two-thirds of our \nplanet's oxygen. For as long as mankind has lived on the lands of this \nplanet, oceans have sustained our survival and been part of our \nidentity.\n  Speaking at a dinner in Newport, RI, in 1961, President Kennedy said:\n\n       We are tied to the ocean . . . and when we go back to the \n     sea, whether it is to sail or to watch it, we are going back \n     from whence we came.\n\n  My State, and indeed our country, always have kept a special bond \nwith those great waters.\n  As a practical matter, my State's economy, as do many others, relies \non Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound to provide the jobs for \nfishing, shipbuilding, tourism, and soon, we hope, wind farming. Across \nAmerica, coastal waters generate over 50 percent of our Nation's gross \ndomestic product and support more than 28 million jobs.\n  So we don't call Rhode Island the Ocean State just because of its \nbeautiful coasts and beaches. Although as a sailor and proud ambassador \nfor Rhode Island's tourism industry, I will tell my colleagues that \nRhode Island's coast is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. We \nare the Ocean State because from our earliest days we have relied on \nthe ocean and our beloved Narragansett Bay for trade, for food, for \njobs, for recreation, and for solace and inspiration.\n  In part, it is Americans' love of the oceans that drives the need now \nto protect and restore them. Coastal America is experiencing a huge \npopulation boom, leading to more and more construction that puts \nsignificant pressure on our natural coastline and our wetlands. \nWorldwide demand for seafood grows at a pace that our fish stocks \ncannot keep pace with, and our demand for energy leads us deeper and \ndeeper into the ocean in search of fuel.\n  For too long, we have been takers from our oceans rather than \ncaretakers of our oceans, and the evidence of our peril is mounting.\n  From the Arctic Ocean, where ice sheets that have been part of Inuit \nlore as far back as memory and oral tradition go, are now disappearing, \nto the tropic seas, where coral reefs that serve as nurseries for ocean \nlife are bleaching and dying, warnings are ringing.\n  From the far-off waters of the Pacific, where a garbage gyre of \naccumulated marine litter has grown larger than the State of Texas, to \nour near coasts such as Rhode Island's own Narragansett Bay where the \nwater temperature has risen 4 degrees in the winter in the last 40 \nyears, an ecosystem shift displacing our historic fisheries, warnings \nare ringing.\n  From the top of the oceanic food chain, where pollutants are turning \nour marine mammals into swimming toxic waste and major pelagic species \nhave suffered a 90-percent population crash, to the very bottom of the \nfood chain where greenhouse gases change the fundamental chemistry of \nour oceans until they may become too acidic to support the plankton \nbase of the food chain, real warnings are ringing.\n  Our present day ocean is more acidic today than it has been in 8,000 \ncenturies. A change in ocean chemistry\n\n[[Page S6205]]\n\nhappening so quickly, we don't know if species will be able to adapt in \ntime to survive. Even if we were to act immediately to curb our carbon \npollution, the stress on these ecosystems will certainly worsen for \nsome time from what we have already put into our atmosphere.\n  So from the far Arctic to the warm tropics, from the far ocean to the \nnear coasts, from the top of the food chain to the bottom, real warning \nbells are ringing.\n  We can't begin to know what the total effects on our oceans will be, \nbut what we have observed so far must be deeply troubling to any \nprudent, thoughtful person.\n  If you have been to the Biltmore Hotel in downtown Providence, you \nhave seen a large plaque on the wall in the lobby marking the high \nwater mark of the great hurricane of 1938 when a massive storm surge \nfilled downtown Providence and the hotel lobby to a depth of about 5 \nfeet. Sea level rise, another ocean threat, could mean that future \nstorm surges crest much higher, wreaking far worse devastation.\n  That is a threat that is not unique to Rhode Island. Island nations \naround the globe are currently preparing for the possibility--really, \nthe inevitability--that they will literally be engulfed by the ocean.\n  The National Intelligence Council reports that at least 30 American \nmilitary installations around the world will be underwater if sea \nlevels rise as projected. There is a dangerous feedback loop. The more \nice that melts, the greater the danger. As darker ocean water traps \nrather than reflects the Sun's rays, melting accelerates and leaves us \nwith less and less time to act, less and less time to spare our \ngrandchildren the consequences of our generation's selfishness and \nfolly.\n  Even seemingly modest changes in temperature, such as the 4 degree \nincrease in Narragansett Bay, wreak havoc on marine ecosystems, causing \nwhat amounts to a full ecosystem shift. Anybody who relies on marine \nlife for food, recreation, or a paycheck may soon find their lives \nchanged by the disruption of the ocean's delicate ecosystem.\n  As a member of the Senate's Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks, I find myself habitually frustrated that this ``tragedy of the \ncommons'' continues to play out, while we stand idly on the sidelines \nand fail to intervene.\n  As a source of jobs and economic opportunity, a key element of our \nAmerican tradition and, truly, the origin of life on our planet, our \noceans, and our responsibility for them, ought to occupy a more \nprominent place on our national agenda.\n  Yet, our commitment to ocean and coastal preservation is unreliable \nat best--subject to the volatility of the yearly budget and \nappropriations process. None other than Robert Ballard, the famed ocean \nexplorer who discovered the Titanic and is current president of the \nOcean Exploration Trust, recently lamented that available funds for \nocean research often fall far short of desired goals.\n  As we stand here and BP's oil poisons our Gulf of Mexico, it is time \nto ask our political system to put the stewardship of our natural \nresources, our ocean resources, at the forefront of our national \nagenda. In the past, Congress had established lasting endowments to \nprotect other important American priorities.\n  Because we believe that a great society must cherish artistic \nexpression and study closely the lessons of history, we established--\nthrough the wisdom of Senator Claiborne Pell--the National Endowment \nfor the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities. Because we \nbelieve that a great society must connect communities to each other, we \nestablished a national highway trust fund. Because we believe that a \ngreat society must guarantee its elders a dignified and comfortable \nretirement after a lifetime of work, we established Social Security. \nBecause we are indeed tied to our great waters, we should now act to \nestablish a national endowment for the oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes.\n  This legislation, as I said, is bipartisan. I thank Senator Olympia \nSnowe for joining in this effort. This legislation is science based, \nwith much of the money made available through a competitive grant \nprogram that will award funding to research undertaken by academic \ninstitutions, on-the-ground conservation by nonprofit organizations, \nand local governments, and protection of critical public \ninfrastructure.\n  This legislation is cost effective, coordinating existing efforts of \nFederal, local, and private programs, reducing duplication of research \nefforts, and crossing political borders to ensure that every dollar is \nspent with the greatest possible effect.\n  This legislation is appropriately paid for with revenue generated \nfrom the oilspill liability trust fund, Outer Continental Shelf \ndrilling, offshore renewable energy development, and fines collected \nfor violations of the Federal law off our coastline. Put simply, a \nsmall portion of the revenue extracted from our oceans and great waters \nmust be reinvested to now protect their long-term viability.\n  The ocean provides us with great bounty, and we will continue to take \nadvantage of the ocean's bounty, as we should. We will fish, we will \nsail, and we will trade. We will dispose of waste. We will extract fuel \nand construct wind farms. We will put pressure on our oceans. Navies \nand cruise ships, sailboats and supertankers, will plow their surface. \nWe cannot change that part of our relationship with the sea.\n  What we can change is what we do in return. We can, for the first \ntime, give back. We can become stewards of our oceans--not just takers, \nbut caretakers.\n  My wife, Sandra, is a marine biologist. We have watched as the \nUniversity of Rhode Island, home of the Graduate School of \nOceanography, has become a world leader in understanding our oceans and \nhow to conserve them.\n  We are watching GSO's researchers struggle to keep up with rapid \nchanges reshaping the ecosystems they study. This endowment will help \nscience keep pace with change.\n  The National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration received $167 million \nfor coastal restoration projects under the Recovery Act last year. More \nthan 800 proposals for shovel-ready projects came in, totaling $3 \nbillion. But NOAA could only fund 50. This endowment will help us move \nforward with those projects that protect our oceans and drive our \neconomy.\n  The oceans contain the potential for new discoveries, the potential \nfor new jobs, and the potential for new solutions to the emerging \ncrisis off our shores.\n  But it is time to act. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Snowe and \nmyself in support of this legislation. Let ours be the generation that \ntips the increasingly troubling balance between mankind and the oceans, \nfrom whence we came, a little bit back toward the benefit of our \noceans.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, as I rise today to join Senator Whitehouse \nin introducing the National Endowment for the Oceans Act, our Nation \ncontinues to bear the brunt of what has now become the biggest offshore \noil spill in recorded history. Since April 20, 2010, when the mobile \noffshore drilling unit Deepwater Horizon exploded and sank 50 miles off \nthe coast of Louisiana, claiming the lives of 11 men, as much as 180 \nmillion gallons of oil has spewed into the Gulf of Mexico. The \necosystem, environment, and the culture of the Gulf coast region will \nfeel the effects of this spill for decades to come in the aftermath of \nan event that has focused National attention on one of our most \nproductive, beautiful, and beloved resources: our oceans and coasts. I \nalso want to acknowledge the support of the Chair of the Senate \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Senator Rockefeller \nfor his cosponsorship of this initiative.\n  As Ranking Member on the Commerce Subcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, \nFisheries, and Coast Guard, and as a Senator from a state which relies \nheavily on our marine and coastal resources, I have long appreciated \nthe tremendous value of America's oceans, coasts, and Great Lakes. \nThroughout my time in this body I have pursued policies that would \nenhance our stewardship of these treasured regions, and permit \nsustainable use of the bounty they provide. This legislation would \nensure a brighter future for these areas that heal our souls and drive \nour economy.\n  Investment in our oceans is investment in our future. The United \nStates' exclusive economic zone, encompassing\n\n[[Page S6206]]\n\nthe area 200 miles out from our shores, covers more of the earth's \nsurface than our land area, and ultimately what affects our coastal \neconomy drives our Nation's economy. More than 75 percent of growth in \nthis country from 1997 to 2007, whether measured in population, jobs, \nor gross domestic product, occurred in coastal States. Coastal \ncounties, covering just 18 percent of our land area, contributed 42 \npercent of U.S. economic output in 2007 according to a report published \nlast year by the National Ocean Economics Program. Tourism, inherently \nreliant on pristine beaches, healthy habitat to foster fish, shellfish, \nand marine mammals, and fishable, swimmable waters, contributed over \nhalf a trillion dollars to our national GDP.\n  This is why in the 2004 report of the U.S. Commission on Ocean \nPolicy, one of that body's fundamental priorities was the creation of \nan ocean policy trust fund to supplement existing appropriations for \nocean and coastal programs. The Joint Ocean Commission Initiative, \ncomprised of members of that body and the Pew Oceans Commission, has \nconsistently listed establishment of an ocean trust fund among its \nhighest priorities. The National Endowment for the Oceans will at long \nlast meet this demand and provide a consistent stream of supplemental \nfunding to enhance our commitment to protecting and sustaining these \nmost fragile resources.\n  The fact is, our oceans and coastal regions face more challenges \ntoday than at any time in our history. Global climate change is already \nbeing felt more pressingly off our shores than our scientists yet \nunderstand. In the past few years alone, ocean acidification, a threat \nso new it was not even mentioned in the Ocean Commission's report, has \nbegun to change the fundamental makeup of the ocean food web and \ndestroy coral reef structures that have for eons girded our shores and \nprovided nursery grounds for countless species of fish. Scientists \nbelieve increasing ocean temperatures are to blame for a steep and \nsudden decline in the southern New England and Long Island Sound \nlobster populations. This problem is so grave that fishery managers are \nconsidering closing the entire fishery in this area that has been rich \nwith lobster throughout the duration of recorded human history. Hypoxic \nareas known as ``dead zones'' are cropping up off our shores in areas \nwhere they never before existed, and the annual hypoxic zone in the \nGulf of Mexico regularly encompasses an area the size of the state of \nNew Jersey. I could go on and on, but my point is abundantly clear--our \noceans need our help.\n  This vital legislation would set aside a portion of revenues from \noffshore oil and gas and renewable energy development on the outer \ncontinental shelf and would apply interest generated by the oil spill \nliability trust fund to a dedicated National Endowment for the Oceans. \nThis endowment would fund three targeted grant programs--one to coastal \nstates, a second to support regional ocean partnerships, and a third to \nfund the activities of additional ocean research not covered by the \nother two programs. This money would be available at the discretion of \nState and Federal resource managers for activities proven to restore, \nprotect, maintain, or understand living marine resources and their \nhabitats and ecosystems.\n  Funding will supplement, not replace, annual appropriations for the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations, NOAA, and other \nFederal agencies already carrying out critical work in our ocean, \ncoastal, and Great Lakes regions. In the past I have pressed the \nAdministration and others in this body to increase Federal support for \nthese agencies. I will continue to call for increases in NOAA's base \nfunding until our investment in the agency meets the requirements of \nits missions. In the meantime, this program would provide a significant \nboost to our efforts to protect, conserve, restore, and understand the \noceans, coasts and Great Lakes so vital to our national heritage, \nculture, economy, and identity.\n  I would like once again to thank Senator Whitehouse for his tireless \nocean advocacy and his invaluable work to introduce the National \nEndowment for the Oceans Act, and Senator Rockefeller for his \ncosponsorship of this initiative, and I look forward to working with \nthem on this and many more ocean issues in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself, Mr. Merkley, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. \n        Begich):\n  S. 3642. A bill to ensure that the underwriting standards of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac facilitate the use of property assessed clean \nenergy programs to finance the installation of renewable energy and \nenergy efficiency improvements; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the PACE \nAssessment Protection Act of 2010. I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by my colleagues, Senators Merkley, Gillibrand, and Begich.\n  Property Assessed Clean Energy or PACE programs allow homeowners and \nbuilding owners to finance an energy efficiency upgrade to their \nproperty through a tax assessment on that property. In this way, \nproperty owners are able to spread the cost of the upgrades over \nseveral years, lower their energy costs, contribute to a cleaner \nenvironment, and create jobs.\n  In California, nearly half of the State's 58 counties, as well as \nindividual cities, have developed PACE programs or plan to start one, \nand 23 states as well as the District of Columbia have enacted PACE \nlegislation. The program has the strong support of the White House and \nthe Department of Energy, and many States and cities dedicated Recovery \nAct funding for their PACE programs.\n  Despite the promise of this program, the Federal Housing Finance \nAgency recently ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to take actions that \nlimit the use of PACE programs in conjunction with their home \nmortgages, effectively killing the program. FHFA objected that PACE \nassessments carry a priority lien, ahead of the lenders, on \nparticipating properties.\n  The right of States and localities to secure property tax assessments \nwith a senior position is well established, and in the past, Fannie and \nFreddie have always respected this right--such as with assessments to \nfinance sidewalks, bridges, or parks and other projects that provide a \npublic benefit--without raising any concerns over the impact of such \npriority liens. In addition, the Department of Energy issued guidance \nfor municipalities intending to use Recovery Act funding for PACE \nprograms that calls for strong underwriting standards. These guidelines \nrequire that the savings a property owner would see as a result of any \nupgrade must be greater than the cost of the assessment, leaving \nhomeowners in a more financially secure position.\n  To allow PACE programs to continue, as well as protect homeowners and \ntaxpayers, we must take immediate action to address the overreach by \nthe FHFA. My legislation would require Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to: \nadopt sound underwriting standards for financing clean-energy upgrades, \nconsistent with Department of Energy guidelines; treat a PACE \nassessment as any other property tax assessment and respect States' \nauthority to secure such assessments with a first lien; allow \nhomeowners to finance, refinance, or sell their home without having to \nrepay any PACE assessment first; prohibit discrimination against \ncommunities implementing or participating in a PACE program.\n  The legislation also limits the assessment amount subject to \nforeclosure to only the unpaid delinquent amount, along with applicable \npenalties, interest and costs, and not the entire amount.\n  The current uncertainty surrounding PACE programs is jeopardizing \n$110 million in Federal investments for California communities, and \nmillions more in other States, which is simply unacceptable. We must \ntake action to protect these initiatives because they create jobs, save \nhomeowners money on their energy bills and help our environment. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me and to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n        Inhofe, and Mr. Thune):\n  S. 3643.

Res. 592\n\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease (known as ``PKD'') is one \n     of the most prevalent life-threatening genetic diseases in \n     the world, affecting an estimated 600,000 people in the \n     United States, including newborn babies, children, and \n     adults, regardless of sex, age, race, geography, income, or \n     ethnicity;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease comes in 2 forms, \n     autosomal dominant, which affects 1 in 500 people worldwide, \n     and autosomal recessive, a rare form that affects 1 in 20,000 \n     live births and frequently leads to early death;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease causes multiple cysts to \n     form on both kidneys, leading to an increase in kidney size \n     and weight;\n       Whereas the cysts caused by polycystic kidney disease can \n     be as small as the head of a pin or as large as a grapefruit;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is a systemic disease \n     that damages the kidneys and the cardiovascular, endocrine, \n     hepatic, and gastrointestinal systems;\n       Whereas patients with polycystic kidney disease often \n     experience no symptoms during the early stages of the \n     disease, and many patients do not realize they have PKD until \n     the disease affects other organs;\n       Whereas the symptoms of polycystic kidney disease can \n     include high blood pressure, chronic pain in the back, sides \n     or abdomen, blood in the urine, urinary tract infections, \n     heart disease, and kidney stones;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is the leading genetic \n     cause of kidney failure in the United States;\n       Whereas more than half of patients suffering from \n     polycystic kidney disease will\n\n[[Page S6221]]\n\n     reach kidney failure, requiring dialysis or a kidney \n     transplant to survive, thus placing an extra strain on \n     dialysis and kidney transplantation resources;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease has no treatment or cure;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease instills in patients the \n     fear of an unknown future with a life-threatening genetic \n     disease, and of possible genetic discrimination;\n       Whereas polycystic kidney disease is an example of how \n     collaboration, technological innovation, scientific momentum, \n     and public-private partnerships can--\n       (1) generate therapeutic interventions that directly \n     benefit the people suffering from polycystic kidney disease;\n       (2) save billions of Federal dollars paid by Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and other programs for dialysis, kidney \n     transplants, immunosuppressant drugs, and related therapies; \n     and\n       (3) open several thousand spots on the kidney transplant \n     waiting list;\n       Whereas improvements in diagnostic technology and the \n     expansion of scientific knowledge about polycystic kidney \n     disease have led to--\n       (1) the discovery of the 3 primary genes that cause \n     polycystic kidney disease and the 3 primary protein products \n     of the genes; and\n       (2) the understanding of cell structures and signaling \n     pathways that cause cyst growth, which has produced multiple \n     polycystic kidney disease clinical drug trials; and\n       Whereas thousands of volunteers throughout the United \n     States are dedicated to expanding essential research, \n     fostering public awareness and understanding, educating \n     patients and their families about polycystic kidney disease \n     to improve treatment and care, providing appropriate moral \n     support, and encouraging people to become organ donors: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week of September 13-19, 2010, as \n     ``Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national week to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a \n     treatment and a cure for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to--\n       (A) support Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week \n     through appropriate ceremonies and activities;\n       (B) promote public awareness of polycystic kidney disease; \n     and\n       (C) foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hatch to \nintroduce a resolution to increase awareness of Polycystic Kidney \nDisease, PKD, a common and life threatening genetic illness.\n  Over 600,000 people have been diagnosed with PKD nationwide. There is \nno treatment or cure for this devastating disease. Families and friends \nstruggle to fight PKD and provide unwavering support to their suffering \nloved ones.\n  But there is hope. The PKD Foundation has led the fight for increased \nresearch and patient education. Recent studies have led to the \ndiscovery of the genes that cause PKD as well as promising clinical \ndrug trials for treatment. More needs to be done, however, and the \ngovernment wants to help.\n  In order to increase public awareness of this fatal disease, I \npropose that September 13th through the 19th be designated as National \nPolycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week. This week coincides with the \nannual walk for PKD which takes place every September. In Wisconsin, \nwhere over 10,000 patients are living with the disease, residents \ngather across the state to take part in this very special walk.\n  Increasing awareness will help all those affected by Polycystic \nKidney Disease, and I hope my colleagues will support this important \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nWisconsin, Senator Herb Kohl, in introducing a resolution to designate \nSeptember 13-19, 2010, as National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness \nWeek.\n  Polycystic kidney disease, also known as PKD, is a life-threatening, \ngenetic disease which affects more than 12.5 million adults and \nchildren worldwide. PKD is of significant interest to me because many \nUtahns suffer from this illness. The PKD Foundation estimates that \nroughly 5,000 Utahns have PKD; and ESRD instances in Utah are almost \nthree times the national average.\n  A kidney affected by PKD will develop cysts ranging in size from that \nof a pinhead to the size of a grapefruit. These fluid-filled cysts \nincrease the size and weight of the kidney from what is normally the \nsize of a human fist to as large as a football. This condition causes \ngreat pain and is extremely dangerous to kidney function. As PKD \nprogresses a person may acquire other diseases and disorders such as \nurinary tract infections, hypertension, and kidney stones. In its most \nprogressive stage, PKD results in kidney failure, or end-stage renal \ndisease, ESRD, for which the only help available is dialysis or a \nkidney transplant.\n  Autosomal dominant PKD is the most common form of the disease and \naffects one in every 500 people. This type of PKD is commonly diagnosed \nin adulthood. Children born to an affected parent have a 50 percent \nchance of inheriting the disease themselves. In less prevalent cases, a \nchild may be diagnosed with autosomal recessive polycystic kidney \ndisease, ARPKD. ARPKD kills approximately 30 percent of infants \ndiagnosed within the first month of life--and of the 70 percent who \nsurvive infancy, one-third will require a kidney transplant by the age \nof 10.\n  There is no cure for PKD. Although minimal treatments can alleviate \npain, and a healthy lifestyle can delay kidney failure, currently the \nonly way to truly stop the symptoms is by transplantation. Yet, there \nis hope in science, awareness, and education.\n  To cure PKD could mean billions of dollars in savings to Medicare and \nMedicaid. Greater yet, it would offer relief to the suffering endured \nby the millions of people living with this dreadful disease.\n  With improved awareness and education comes a greater ability to find \na cure. That is why Senator Kohl and I have introduced this resolution \nevery year since 2007 to designate a National Polycystic Kidney Disease \nAwareness Week. I encourage my colleagues to lend their support to this \nimportant measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6221-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6221-S6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 593--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF OCTOBER 7, \n            2010, AS ``JUMPSTART'S READ FOR THE RECORD DAY''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Begich) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 593\n\n       Whereas Jumpstart, a national early education organization, \n     is working to ensure that all children in the United States \n     enter school prepared to succeed;\n       Whereas Jumpstart recruits and trains college students and \n     community volunteers year-round to work with preschool \n     children in low-income communities, helping the children to \n     develop the key language and literacy skills they need to \n     succeed in school and in life;\n       Whereas, since 1993, Jumpstart has engaged more than 20,000 \n     adults in service to more than 70,000 young children in \n     communities across the United States;\n       Whereas Jumpstart's Read for the Record, presented in \n     partnership with Pearson, is a world record-breaking \n     campaign, now in its fifth year, that harnesses the power of \n     reading by bringing adults and children together to read the \n     same book on the same day;\n       Whereas the goals of the campaign are to raise national \n     awareness of the early literacy crisis, provide books to \n     children in low-income households through donations and \n     sponsorship, celebrate the commencement of Jumpstart's \n     program year, and raise money to support Jumpstart's year-\n     long work with preschool children;\n       Whereas October 7, 2010, would be an appropriate date to \n     designate as ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'' because \n     Jumpstart aims to set the world record for the largest shared \n     reading experience on that date; and\n       Whereas Jumpstart hopes to engage 2,500,000 children to \n     read Ezra Jack Keats' ``The Snowy Day'' during this record-\n     breaking celebration of reading, service, and fun, all in \n     support of the preschool children of the United States: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of October 7, 2010, as \n     ``Jumpstart's Read for the Record Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the fifth year of Jumpstart's Read for the \n     Record; and\n       (3) encourages adults, including grandparents, parents, \n     teachers, and college students, to join children in creating \n     the largest shared reading experience in the world and to \n     show their support for early literacy and Jumpstart's early \n     education programming for young children in low-income \n     communities.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, as many of my colleagues know, I began my \ncareer as a preschool teacher back in my home State of Washington. My \nexperience as a preschool teacher allowed me to see just how important \nearly education is in shaping a person's life. As we all know, research \nillustrates that children who begin learning at an early age are more \nlikely to be\n\n[[Page S6222]]\n\nsuccessful in their secondary education career--and to graduate from \nhigh school.\n  During my time in the classroom, I could easily distinguish those 4-\nyear-olds who were read to at home. Their skills were more advanced \nbecause they had been introduced to sounds and words prior to beginning \nschool. This is why I believe it is important for all of us to \nunderstand that reading to children at home fosters a sense of \ncuriosity and a passion for learning that drives students throughout \ntheir academic careers.\n  This is why I rise today to commend Jumpstart, a successful, national \nnon-profit organization that focuses on developing the critical \nlanguage and literacy skills of our young children in low-income \ncommunities.\n  Beginning in 1993, Jumpstart has recruited and trained thousands of \nstudents and community volunteers to deliver a research-based and \nresults-driven curriculum to over 70,000 preschool children across our \ncountry. During the 2009-2010 school year, Jumpstart partnered with \nover 250 preschools across 15 States and the District of Columbia to \nprovide early education to 13,000 preschool children. Additionally, \nJumpstart promotes reading at home through Read for the Record, an \nevent that engages adults and children in the world's largest shared \nreading experience.\n  In my home State of Washington, Jumpstart has played an important \nrole in providing quality literacy skill development in the city of \nSeattle. During the 2009-2010 school year, over 150 volunteers served \nnearly 500 children in 9 preschools. I appreciate Jumpstart's \ncommitment to Washington State and its continued dedication to \nproviding essential skill development to prekindergarten children while \nstimulating our next generation by involving many student volunteers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/22/senate-section/article/S6222-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 594--TO CONSTITUTE THE MAJORITY PARTY'S MEMBERSHIP ON \n  CERTAIN COMMITTEES FOR THE ONE HUNDRED ELEVENTH CONGRESS, OR UNTIL \n                      THEIR SUCCESSORS ARE CHOSEN\n\n  Mr. REID submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

111 Stat. 2627) to stimulate \n     economic development through increased employment and capital \n     investment by providing Federal contracting preferences to \n     small business concerns in those areas, including inner \n     cities and rural counties, that have low household incomes, \n     high unemployment, and suffered from a lack of investment; \n     and\n       (B) according to the Government Accountability Office, the \n     weakness in the oversight of the HUBZone program by the \n     Administration has exposed the Government to fraud and abuse.\n       (c) HUBZone Improvements.--The Administrator shall--\n       (1) ensure the HUBZone map--\n       (A) is accurate and up-to date; and\n       (B) revised as new data is made available to maintain the \n     accuracy and currency of the HUBZone map;\n       (2) implement policies for ensuring that only HUBZone small \n     business concerns determined to be qualified under section \n     3(p)(5) of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)(5)) are \n     participating in the HUBZone program, including through the \n     appropriate use of technology to control costs and maximize, \n     among other benefits, uniformity, completeness, simplicity, \n     and efficiency;\n       (3) submit to the Committee on Small Business and \n     Entrepreneurship of the Senate and the Committee on Small \n     Business of the House of Representatives a report regarding \n     any application to be designated as a HUBZone small business \n     concern or for recertification for which the Administrator \n     has not made a determination as of the date that is 60 days \n     after the date on which the application was submitted or \n     initiated, which shall include a plan and timetable for \n     ensuring the timely processing of the applications; and\n       (4) develop measures and implement plans to assess the \n     effectiveness of the HUBZone program that--\n       (A) require the identification of a baseline point in time \n     to allow the assessment of economic development under the \n     HUBZone program, including creating additional jobs; and\n       (B) take into account--\n       (i) the economic characteristics of the HUBZone; and\n       (ii) contracts being counted under multiple socioeconomic \n     subcategories.\n       (d) Employment Percentage.--Section 3(p) of the Small \n     Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632(p)) is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (5), by adding at the end the following:\n\n[[Page S6223]]\n\n       ``(E) Employment percentage during interim period.--\n       ``(i) Definition.--In this subparagraph, the term `interim \n     period' means the period beginning on the date on which the \n     Administrator determines that a HUBZone small business \n     concern is qualified under subparagraph (A) and ending on the \n     day before the date on which a contract under the HUBZone \n     program for which the HUBZone small business concern submits \n     a bid is awarded.\n       ``(ii) Interim period.--During the interim period, the \n     Administrator may not determine that a HUBZone small business \n     is not qualified under subparagraph (A) based on a failure to \n     meet the applicable employment percentage under subparagraph \n     (A)(i)(I), unless the HUBZone small business concern--\n\n       ``(I) has not attempted to maintain the applicable \n     employment percentage under subparagraph (A)(i)(I);

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE RECESS \n                   APPOINTMENT OF DR. DONALD BERWICK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 19, 2010, the President nominated Dr. Donald \n     Berwick to serve as the Administrator of the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services (in this section referred to as \n     ``CMS'') in the Department of Health and Human Services. As \n     of that date, the position was vacant for the first 16 months \n     of the Obama Administration.\n       (2) Since that date, Dr. Berwick has been undergoing the \n     bipartisan nomination investigation review process of the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate (in this section referred \n     to as the ``Senate Finance Committee'') and there has been \n     ongoing activity as the Senate Finance Committee continues\n\n[[Page S6224]]\n\n     to gather and review information from Dr. Berwick.\n       (3) The Senate Finance Committee review process for the \n     Berwick nomination was proceeding normally. A hearing on the \n     nomination of Dr. Berwick had been requested and no \n     objections had been raised to having the hearing.\n       (4) On July 7, 2010, less than 3 months after the \n     nomination and without a Senate Finance Committee hearing \n     taking place, the President recess-appointed Dr. Berwick to \n     serve as the Administrator of CMS. Dr. Berwick was sworn in \n     on July 12, 2010.\n       (5) The appointment of the Administrator of CMS is subject \n     to Senate confirmation under article II, section 2, clause 2 \n     of the Constitution. Dr. Berwick's nomination was referred to \n     the Senate Finance Committee which has jurisdiction over \n     health programs under the Social Security Act and the \n     responsibility to examine Presidential nominees related to \n     these programs.\n       (6) It is especially true that Dr. Berwick's nomination \n     should have undergone the Senate Finance Committee nomination \n     review process in light of the significant responsibilities \n     of the Administrator of CMS.\n       (7) CMS is responsible for the health care of more than \n     100,000,000 Americans, and is one of the largest agencies in \n     the Federal Government.\n       (8) The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (commonly referred to as the ``health care reform \n     law'') significantly increases the responsibilities of CMS, \n     including half a trillion dollars in Medicare provider cuts \n     and the largest expansion of the Medicaid program since its \n     inception.\n       (9) The manner in which an individual nominated to serve as \n     the Administrator of CMS intends to carry out these \n     responsibilities is a serious matter and warrants a thorough \n     review. A thorough review is especially needed for Dr. \n     Berwick's appointment in light of statements he has made in \n     the past about health care rationing as well as the role of \n     government in health care.\n       (10) By recess-appointing Dr. Berwick, the President has \n     attempted to short circuit the requirement of article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution that he appoint \n     officers of the United States ``by and with the Advice and \n     Consent of the Senate''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the recess appointment of Dr. Donald Berwick, while \n     consideration of his nomination to serve as Administrator of \n     CMS was proceeding normally through the Senate Finance \n     Committee nomination review process, constitutes an abuse of \n     power by the President; and\n       (2) notwithstanding his recess appointment to that \n     position, Dr. Donald Berwick should appear before the Senate \n     Finance Committee and respond to questions by members about \n     his qualifications to serve as Administrator of CMS.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4513.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize all of the \nproviders who work in retail-based convenient care clinics in a \nresolution to designate August 2 through August 8, 2010, as National \nConvenient Care Clinic Week. National Convenient Care Clinic Week will \nprovide a national platform from which to promote the pivotal services \noffered by the more than 1,100 retail-based convenient care clinics in \nthe United States.\n  Today, thousands of nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and \nphysicians provide care in convenient care clinics. At a time when \nAmericans are more and more challenged by the inaccessibility and high \ncosts of health care, convenient care offers a vital, high-quality \nprimary care alternative.\n  A resolution will help pave the way for this effort.
