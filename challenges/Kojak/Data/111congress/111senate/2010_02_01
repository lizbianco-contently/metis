Mr. President, nursing our economy back to health is not \njust about giving it the right short-term treatments; it is about \nsetting a new, responsible foundation for our future security and \nstability; it is about recognizing that what got us into this mess will \nnot get us out of this mess; it is about making sure this kind of \ncrisis can never again threaten American families.\n  There are three things above all else I wanted to see in President \nObama's budget: No. 1, a plan to put Americans back to work; No. 2, a \nplan to ease our deep deficit, bring fiscal discipline back to our \ngovernment, and leave our children a stronger economy; and finally, No. \n3, a plan that will strengthen Nevada's economy and make Nevadans \nsafer.\n  As far as I am concerned, the President has gone three for three. \nRegarding jobs: Ensuring every American who wants to work can find a \njob is the top priority of the American people and it is the top \npriority of President Obama's budget. His proposed tax cuts will \nencourage small businesses to keep workers on the job, hire new ones, \nand give those employees bigger paychecks, and it will encourage \nentrepreneurs to start new companies and encourage existing owners to \ngrow their businesses, which will in turn grow our economy.\n  This budget is also about smart investing. It looks forward to \nbuilding industries of the future by creating clean energy jobs that \ncan never be outsourced and jobs in infrastructure, science, \ntechnology, and research. It extends middle-class tax cuts so hard-\nworking families can invest more of their income in the economy rather\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\nthan sending it back to the government.\n  As far as fiscal responsibility goes, his budget does some good \nthings. It continues Democrats' efforts to reduce the deficit and \nrestore fiscal responsibility to the government.\n  This budget comes with a lot of zeros. Its numbers are in the \nmillions, billions, and trillions. It is easy to mischaracterize those \nnumbers and what they mean, but let's keep some perspective. When you \nlook at this budget as a share of our entire economy, it will cut the \ndeficit by more than half in 2 years. It is not the last thing we will \ndo to slash the deficit, but it is a good, promising start.\n  The President also has endorsed the pay-as-you-go rules the Senate \napproved last week, as well as a commission dedicated to reducing the \ndeficit, which I support. Unfortunately, many of our Republican \ncolleagues do not. They voted in unison against pay-as-you-go--the \nsimple concept that we should only spend what we as a government have. \nSome Republican Senators who sponsored the legislation creating the \ndeficit-reduction commission turned right around and voted against \ntheir own bill when it came before the Senate. Had they voted with us--\nif they had voted the way the bill was sponsored--it would have passed. \nWe had 53 votes. One Senator was gone because of a funeral. There are \n54 Democrats, and with 7 Republicans, that would have brought us to 61.\n  It is a real shame. People worked on this so hard, and one of those \nwho did so is the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer is an expert \nat balancing budgets, having been Governor of the Commonwealth of \nVirginia, and the Presiding Officer used that knowledge to work with \nSenator Conrad and others to bring about the pay-go rules and to bring \nabout this deficit-reduction commission. Then to have people who \nsponsored the legislation vote against it is hard to comprehend. This \nbudget knows our economy and our future cannot afford partisan games \nsuch as that.\n  As far as Nevada is concerned, the recession has hit Nevada harder \nthan most every other State. Nevadans will benefit more than nearly any \nother State's citizens when we see the implementation of the job-\ncreating and money-saving ideas in this budget.\n  Nevada will also benefit in another very specific way. The President \nhas declared dead the dreadful plan called Yucca Mountain--to turn a \npiece of the magnificent Nevada desert just outside of Las Vegas into a \nnational dumping ground for dangerous nuclear waste. This budget ends \nfunding for that reckless project and pulls its license application.\n  That means families in Nevada and throughout America no longer have \nto worry about trucks and trains loaded with tons of the most toxic \nnuclear waste known to man passing by their children's schools, their \nneighborhoods, parks, and their own backyards. It means we will all be \nsafer.\n  The President's plan will walk us further down the path toward \neconomic recovery, but we still have a long way to go. Let's keep in \nmind this budget is merely a blueprint, not a silver bullet. It will \nguide Congress, not restrict us.\n  No matter what the items and numbers are in this document, neither \nDemocrats nor Republicans should ever forget that every single dollar \nin this budget belongs to the American people. We know we cannot make \nour economy work again for the middle class unless we invest taxpayers' \nmoney as responsibly and efficiently and as transparently as possible. \nSenate Democrats are committed to doing just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S364-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S364]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

JOHNSON\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, later this afternoon, the Senate will \nvote on a cloture motion on the nomination of Patricia Smith to be \nSolicitor of the Department of Labor. Last Friday, I believe, Senator \nReid also filed a cloture motion on another nomination, and it is that \nnomination I would like to talk about because it comes out of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which I am \nprivileged to chair. That is the nomination of Martha Johnson to be \nAdministrator of the General Services Administration.\n  It has become unfortunate practice, I believe, that Members have been \nholding up Executive nominations, in some cases, and I am confident it \nis the case with regard to Martha Johnson, for reasons unrelated to her \nqualifications. She is extremely well qualified and very much needed at \nthe General Services Administration, as I will note in a moment.\n  As I understand the process we will follow this week--presuming, as I \nhope will be the case, that cloture is granted later this afternoon, \nwhen we vote on the nominee for Solicitor of the Department of Labor, \nwhenever the vote on that nomination occurs--hopefully, sooner than \nlater this week--immediately thereafter, we will go to a vote on \ncloture on this nomination of Martha Johnson. In anticipation of that, \nI wished to speak to my colleagues about what is coming.\n  She is an extraordinary nominee, in my opinion, for a job that is \ncritically important to the efficient operation of the Federal \nGovernment, about which a lot of us have been speaking with intensity \nin recent times. She is a former Chief of Staff at the General Services \nAdministration, so she comes with some background that will give her \nthe opportunity to hit the ground running, and that is important in an \nagency that has not had a permanent leader since April of 2008. Here we \nare in February of 2010. GSA has not had a permanent leader since April \n2008, when the former Director was asked to resign by the previous \nadministration. Since then, the agency has had five Acting \nAdministrators. It is obviously time for stable leadership.\n  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee unanimously \nendorsed her nomination last June, more than a half year ago. Since \nthat time, GSA has undergone several changes in top management, \nincluding the departure of the Chief of Staff and the retirement of the \nDeputy Administrator. So it has been very frustrating for the members \nof our committee to see such a qualified nominee being held up in the \nSenate for more than a half year because of a hold that had nothing to \ndo with the nominee's qualifications.\n  I wish to speak for a moment to my colleagues about the full scope of \nGSA's responsibilities. It is a critically important agency of our \nGovernment that mostly works out of the spotlight. GSA is often called \nthe Federal Government's landlord because it provides workspace and \noffice services for almost every Federal office and agency across our \ncountry, from court houses to ports of entry. With 8,600 buildings and \n$500 billion in assets under its control, GSA must be either the \nlargest property management organization in the world or certainly one \nof the top and largest property management organizations in the world. \nBut GSA actually is far more than just the Federal Government's \nlandlord. It has 12,000 employees spread across the country in 11 \ndistricts. They help guide Federal spending on everything from basic \noffice equipment to the Federal fleet of\n\n[[Page S365]]\n\nmore than 200,000 vehicles owned and leased by the U.S. Government. \nGSA's purchasing divisions have broad effect on the rest of the economy \nsince, as an early acquirer of new technologies, including green \ntechnologies, the agency has helped and will continue to help spur \nproduction that brings down costs and makes these technologies \navailable and affordable to the broader consumer market. GSA is that \nimportant, that it can help build a market for an innovative \ntransformational technology.\n  In fact, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, commonly known \nas the Stimulus Act, which we adopted last year, gave GSA specific \nresponsibility to help green the Federal Government by providing $5 \nbillion to make Federal buildings more energy efficient and $300 \nmillion to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles for the Federal fleet.\n  GSA also has wide responsibilities for providing information \ntechnology and telecommunications services for Federal agencies. With \nits leadership, GSA can ensure that the Federal Government is using \ncutting-edge technology to lower costs, better engage with citizens and \ndetect and defend against cyber threats. In other words, GSA spends so \nmuch money every year acquiring information technology systems that if \nit requires the providers to put together systems that are resistant \nand defensive to the kinds of cyber attacks that, unfortunately, public \nand private information networks are under today, it can drive that \ntechnology development, which then will be more broadly available to \nthe private sector as it acquires information technology equipment.\n  A lot of big and important responsibilities are there, meaning the \nagency is in need of strong leadership. If confirmed, Ms. Johnson will \nface many challenges, and I wish to take a moment to lay out for my \ncolleagues a few which have come to the attention of our committee, \nwhich has oversight of GSA. In the area of procurement, contracts \nnegotiated by GSA must leverage the vast buying power of the Federal \nGovernment so agencies get more value for the taxpayers' dollar. Last \nyear, Federal agencies bought approximately $53 billion of goods and \nservices right off GSA schedules and other GSA contracts, which offer \neverything from office supplies to human resource services, to security \nequipment, to energy management services and through other contracts \nnegotiated by GSA. Having GSA negotiate these procurement agreements \nlets these customer agencies stay focused on their core missions. In \nother words, the agencies do not have to get into all the back-and-\nforth details on negotiating these contracts. The experts at GSA do it \nfor them. The agencies can focus on what they are supposed to be doing.\n  Some agencies, if I may speak directly, have lost confidence of the \nability of GSA to provide the best products at the best prices and have \nbegun to negotiate their own contracts or interagency contracts. This \nduplicates services offered by GSA. It is effectively a waste of \nFederal money and effectively also defeats the purpose of GSA, which \nwas created by President Harry S. Truman, in 1949, with the specific \nintent of streamlining the Federal Government's purchasing process so \nevery agency of the Federal Government did not have its own \nseparate purchasing division that may have done well or not so well but \ncertainly not as efficiently as one for the whole Federal Government.\n\n  The second problem, similar to this one, exists in GSA's property \nmanagement activities, with agencies sometimes questioning whether GSA \nhas now met their needs in the most cost-effective manner.\n  Another problem a new administrator must address is the amount of \nexcess or underutilized property owned by the Federal Government. The \nOffice of Management and Budget has reported--these are stunning \nnumbers--that the Federal Government owns 21,000 buildings, worth about \n$18 billion, that are underused or no longer needed, but they are \nsitting there. In effect, the GAO, the Government Accountability \nOffice, has put the management of Federal property on their high-risk \nlist for this reason. Not all those properties are under GSA's control, \nbut one of its jobs is to help other agencies dispose of excess \nproperty. That is another reason why we need a full-time administrator \nthere.\n  Think about it, $18 billion. The freeze the President has announced--\nwhich I support--doesn't come to much more than that, when you think \nabout the potential for selling some of this property and bringing more \nrevenue to the government.\n  Let me come back to Martha Johnson. This is a job with big \nchallenges, as I have described, in part. She brings a tremendous \nwealth of experience in the private, nonprofit, and government sectors. \nShe has a B.A. in economics and history from Oberlin College and a \nmasters in business from Yale Business School. After graduating from \nYale, Ms. Johnson began her career in the private sector at Cummins \nEngines Company. She had a series of other management positions in the \nprivate sector and then was called on by the Clinton administration to \nbe the Associate Deputy Secretary of Commerce and then, as I mentioned \nearlier, Chief of Staff of GSA from 1996 to 2001--very relevant and \nindispensable experience.\n  After leaving government, Ms. Johnson was a vice president for the \nCouncil for Excellence in Government, which is a nonpartisan, nonprofit \norganization dedicated to increasing the effectiveness of government at \nall levels, and most recently she has served as vice president at \nComputer Sciences Corporation. She is extremely well qualified, has \nbroad qualifications, including extensive experience at GSA.\n  All these varied experiences make Martha Johnson a perfect fit for \nthe responsibilities and challenges she will face as GSA Administrator. \nThe fact is, she, Martha Johnson, has had broad bipartisan support. I \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on cloture. I even preserve the hope \nthat there may be a decision to vitiate the cloture vote, that we go \nright to a final vote, and we confirm this excellent nominee so she can \ngo to work for the American people.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S365-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S365-S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during the past few weeks, President Obama \nhas repeatedly professed a commitment to clamp down on out-of-control \nspending and on deficits. That new development, of course, appeals to \nmany Americans who have become increasingly frustrated with the \ntrillions of dollars in new debt that has been racked up by this \nadministration.\n  The President's newly released budget tells a different story, and it \nis not one of fiscal responsibility. Just look at the front-page \nheadlines from many of today's morning newspapers and you will see a \nhelpful review of what they think of the budget.\n  The Wall Street Journal: ``U.S. Deficit to Hit All-Time High.''\n  The Washington Post: ``White House Expects the Deficit to Approach a \nRecord $1.6 Trillion This Year.''\n  The Washington Times: ``White House Says the Government Will Run Huge \nDeficits for the Foreseeable Future.''\n  The publication Politico: ``Five Years, $5.08 Trillion in Debt.''\n  In other words, this $3.8-trillion budget is another sea of red ink, \nmore of the same record spending and debt that have come to \ncharacterize this administration.\n  Let me go over some important numbers. Under the President's budget, \nthe deficit, which is the gap between total revenues and total spending \nin a given year, will reach a whopping $1.56 trillion for the fiscal \nyear 2010. For fiscal year 2011, the deficit is projected to be $1.3 \ntrillion. That will mark the third year in a row of trillion-dollar-\nplus deficits, beginning in 2009. These 3 years of deficits are more \nthan the total accumulated debt from George Washington to George W. \nBush. The President's budget also virtually doubles the debt held by \nthe public over 5 years and virtually triples it over 10. It exceeds 60 \npercent of the GDP as a share of the economy this year. That surpasses \nlast year's 50-year high.\n  Interest payments will more than quadruple by the end of the decade,\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\nreaching $840 billion in the year 2020. That is $311 billion more than \nwe spend on education, roads, and all other nonsecurity discretionary \nspending. That is just to pay the interest on the debt.\n  Overall spending will remain well above the historical average as a \npercentage of GDP. By the end of the 10-year budget window, debt will \nconsume 77.2 percent of our economy. As Congressman Paul Ryan, ranking \nmember on the House Committee on the Budget, pointed out recently, even \nEuropean Union countries--hardly exemplars of fiscal rectitude--are \nrequired to keep their debt levels below 60 percent of their GDP.\n  I wish to mention a finding from a new paper entitled ``Growth in a \nTime of Debt'' by two economists, Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard and Carmen \nReinhart of the University of Maryland. In their paper, they study the \nrelationship between GDP growth and debt, and they find that nations \ncarrying an excessively large debt burden of more than 60 percent of \nGDP produce a negative effect on short-term economic growth. They \nwrite:\n\n       When gross external debt reaches 60 percent of GDP, annual \n     growth declines by about 2 percent. For levels of external \n     debt in excess of 90 percent of GDP, growth rates are roughly \n     cut in half.\n\n  This only makes sense because you have less money to spend on those \nthings which provide capital, which provide growth in your economy, \nbecause you are paying more and more of your income to service the \ndebt.\n  Remember, our debt will consume 77.2 percent of our economy by 2019. \nThis is important because there are really only four ways to pay down \nor pay off your debt. The first is to raise taxes. You do not do that \nwhen you are in the middle of a recession, and, in fact, it is \ncounterproductive to economic growth in the first place. Second, you \ncut spending. Well, that is very hard for Congress to do. Third, \ninflate the currency. Of course, that wipes out savings. It is the \nleast good of the bad alternatives. Fourth, you can grow your way out. \nGrowing your way out is the way to do it, obviously. It is like your \nfamily: If you have a lot of debt, you can cut some on spending, \nsometimes you can make a little more money. You cannot inflate your way \nout the way the government can. But the preferred way is to grow your \nway out of debt by, over time, making more money and by being able to \npay it down. But there is a point at which, according to these studies, \neven that does not work--when you have so much debt that you do not \nhave enough money to put back into the system to create the growth we \nare talking about. And that is what this debt burden and interest cost \ndoes.\n  The administration has been touting a spending freeze worth about \n$250 billion over a decade to help allay concerns about spending and \ndebt, but it does not start until next October. Therefore, to me, it is \na little bit like the alcoholic who says: Well, I am going to quit \ndrinking right after I have my next drink. If it is a good idea--and it \nis--we should begin now. I applaud any move toward fiscal \nresponsibility, but this proposal will really do little to seriously \nattack the debt and will not even erase the massive debt accumulated \nduring President Obama's first year in office. As columnist Robert \nSamuelson put it recently, ``Any savings would be mostly a rounding \nerror in the decade's projected deficits.''\n  The point is, we have to do a lot more than this. Let's remember that \nthe proposed spending freeze only applies to 17 percent of the budget. \nPrograms targeted for the freeze have already seen a 22-percent \nincrease in their annual appropriations in the past 2 years, plus \nanother 25 percent increase including the stimulus. So it is hard to \nargue that tough choices are being made when you increase these \nprograms by 22 percent, plus another 25 percent, and then say: OK, now \nI am going to stop.\n  Finally, of course, why propose a budget in February with a more than \n$1.5 trillion deficit and a spending freeze that will not even take \neffect until October? Maybe another analogy is, it is like the dieter \nwho wants to start the diet tomorrow but never today. The spending \nfreeze is a good idea. So let's not start it in the future, let's start \nit with this year's appropriations bills.\n  I would also suggest other stronger measures right now. We can start \nwith the TARP money, for example. Rather than using the TARP money to \npay for another stimulus bill, as some of my colleagues have suggested, \nlet's use it to pay down the debt. That money, remember, was borrowed \nin the first place. We did not have $700 billion lying around. We went \nto the markets to borrow that, and we have to pay interest on it. A lot \nof it came from China. We have to pay it back. Let's do that--pay the \nmoney back. Do not use it to pay for yet another stimulus program. \nRemember, it will ultimately have to be paid back.\n  Second, let's end unlimited funding for government-sponsored \nenterprises such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Right now these two \nentities can spend as much as they like even without congressional \nauthority. I find it interesting that when the President, in his State \nof the Union speech, said we are going to impose a tax on the banks, he \nwas talking about banks that either never took TARP money or banks that \nhave paid it back. The tax does not apply to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. \nThey haven't paid back the money. It does not apply to AIG. It does not \napply to General Motors. None of them have paid the money back.\n  If we are going to have a tax, impose it on those who haven't paid \nthe money back. Don't put it on those who either never needed the money \nor didn't take it, but, in any event, who have paid it back.\n  Third, let's rescind unobligated stimulus money. The stimulus has \nalready proven, by most accounts, to be a failure in terms of creating \njobs for the money spent. That is even using the administration's own \nstandards to measure its success. Let's use the money that has not yet \nbeen spent or obligated to pay down the debt. Again, remember, most of \nthat money has to be borrowed and, therefore, let's not spend it in the \nfirst place, thus reducing future debt included in the President's \nbudget.\n  These are just three specific ways, three relatively easy ways that \nwe could employ to start getting hold of spending and debt. I would \nalso like to suggest that those who continue to evoke the spending \npolicies of the last administration become more focused on the future. \nThat is what Americans want us to do. It makes little sense to complain \nabout high spending from a previous era and then make the situation \nworse, creating a deficit that is four times as much as the biggest \ndeficit in the previous administration and creating a debt burden that \nis equal to all of the Presidents from George Washington through George \nBush.\n  Americans want this administration to confront the massive spending \nand massive debt it is accumulating in a meaningful way. The budget the \nPresident sent to Capitol Hill this morning does not do the job.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S366-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

PATRICIA SMITH TO BE SOLICITOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF \n                             LABOR--Resumed\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of M. Patricia Smith, of \nNew York, to be Solicitor for the Department of Labor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, at 5:30 today, under a previous order, the \nSenate will be voting on cloture on the nomination of Patricia Smith to \nbe Solicitor for the Department of Labor. I\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\nwill be addressing the Senate about this and about the key role the \nSolicitor plays, about the qualifications of Patricia Smith to assume \nthis position, and sort of to bring people along as to why we are here \nand why it has taken so long.\n  This nomination has been before us since last April and, quite \nfrankly, this should have been disposed of many months ago. But, \nnonetheless, we are in a situation where the Republican side has \nobjected, and so we have had to file cloture, which was done on \nThursday. It ripens at 5:30 p.m. today. We will have a vote at 5:30, \nand then we will be in a postcloture position on the nomination of \nPatricia Smith to be the Solicitor for the Department of Labor.\n  On Friday, the Commerce Department announced that the Nation's GDP \nsurged at a 5.7-percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of 2009. \nWell, that is good news, and it is yet more evidence that the Recovery \nAct is having the positive impact we expected when we passed it last \nyear. But in my book, the most important economic statistic is the \nunemployment rate, which remains stuck at about 10 percent. I wish to \nbe clear, a jobless recovery, as people are calling it, is a \ncontradiction in terms. There is no meaningful recovery until that \nunemployment rate is coming down and people on Main Street are feeling \nthe benefits of a stronger economy.\n  Today, more than 6 million workers have been looking for a job for \nmore than 6 months and cannot find one. Hard-working people have seen \ntheir hours cut back, their benefits reduced, and millions more are \nsimply not looking because they have given up, and they are not even \ncounted in the unemployment figures. Family budgets are stretched to \nthe breaking point. Workers are desperate to get a job and keep a job \nand pay for the basic necessities of their families.\n  The Obama administration has implemented an aggressive agenda to \nrestore economic security for working families and to get our economy \nback on track. We will be offering jobs bills on the Senate floor in \nthe near future. But a key part of restoring economic security in this \ncountry is reaffirming our commitment to strong labor standards and a \nrevitalized, strong Department of Labor.\n  In these tough times, when so many families are suffering, it is sad \nto think some unscrupulous employers might choose to pad their profits \nby violating our labor laws, cutting corners on safety, firing workers \nillegally, refusing to pay workers the wages they have earned. But the \nharsh reality is, these practices are far too common now in our \neconomy.\n  A recent survey of workers in very low-wage occupations found, in a \nsingle week, 26 percent of low-wage workers were paid less than the \nminimum wage--one out of every four paid less than the legally required \nminimum wage--and 76 percent worked overtime without receiving their \nproper overtime pay; 76 percent--three out of every four people--who \ndid overtime did it without receiving proper overtime pay.\n  These acts of theft--and that is what I call it; let's be clear about \nit, it is theft from America's most vulnerable workers--represent a \nmajor loss of income for families struggling to make ends meet.\n  We like to think these things do not happen in the United States. We \nlike to think sweatshops do not exist. We like to think employers do \nnot cut corners in ways that endanger the life and limb of employees. \nBut these things do exist, sadly, and they are even more common when \ntimes are tough and when enforcement is lax or nonexistent.\n  That is not fair to our workers, it is not fair to their families, \nand--this is very important--it is not fair to the overwhelming number \nof honest and reputable businesses that play by the rules and treat \ntheir workers fairly.\n  That is why--now more than ever--we need a strong Department of Labor \nto stand for America's workers. We need leaders at the Department who \nunderstand the challenges workers are facing and are prepared to tackle \nthese challenges aggressively.\n  Secretary Solis, our Secretary of Labor, has put an excellent team \ntogether at the Department, and they are working hard to reinvigorate \nthat agency after years of neglect. But they are still missing a vital \nplayer on their team. For more than 9 months, Republicans have been \nblocking the confirmation of a key Department official, the Solicitor \nof Labor.\n  The Solicitor of Labor has the critical responsibility of enforcing \nalmost 200 Federal laws that affect American workers every day, such as \nsafety and health, wages and work hours, equal employment opportunity, \nveterans' protections and retirement and health benefits. Again, I have \na series of charts to show what the Solicitor does, how important this \nposition is.\n  For example, the Solicitor of Labor was critical in the investigation \nof a major explosion at BP Products' Texas City refinery that killed 15 \nworkers and seriously injured over 170 others. The Solicitor secured a \nsettlement that included over $21 million in penalties.\n  The Solicitor of Labor also helps to protect workers' paychecks. The \nSolicitor of Labor launched an investigation of Walmart that resulted \nin the payment of $41 million in back wages to workers who had been \nunderpaid. Again, these wages would not have been paid had it not been \nfor the Solicitor of Labor taking these actions because those workers \ndo not have the wherewithal to bring these cases themselves, so it had \nto be done by the Solicitor of Labor. Mr. President, 41 million in back \nwages would have been underpaid at Walmart.\n  The Solicitor of Labor defends workers' retirement security. The \nSolicitor of Labor launched an active investigation into Enron \nCorporation's--remember Enron--Enron Corporation's management of \nworkers' pensions that resulted in the recovery of more than $220.8 \nmillion for workers' pensions plans. That is $220.8 million that would \nnot have gone to these workers' pensions had it not been for the \nSolicitor of Labor.\n  Because workers cannot bring private lawsuits under many of these \nlaws, the Solicitor is the only official who can defend their rights.\n  The Solicitor is also a vital member of the Secretary's management \nand leadership team. The Solicitor provides legal advice and guidance \non virtually every policy, legislative, regulatory, and enforcement \ninitiative at the Department of Labor. The Department simply cannot \nperform its mission effectively without a strong Solicitor in place.\n  The President has nominated Patricia Smith of New York to perform \nthese critical responsibilities, and there is no question she is \nsuperbly qualified for this job. Patricia Smith--Commissioner Smith, I \nshould say--is an accomplished attorney with a detailed knowledge of \nour labor laws and a deep commitment to improving the lives of working \nfamilies. At present, she is commissioner of the New York Department of \nLabor. Since becoming commissioner of the New York Department of Labor, \nshe has played a prominent role in helping New York's working families \nweather the current economic crisis.\n  She has implemented creative, new work-sharing programs to help \nemployers avoid layoffs. She has revamped the State's unemployment \ninsurance system to help workers access benefits more easily. She has \ncreated a new program to help low-income workers train for careers in \nhigh-demand fields, such as green technology, construction, and health \ncare. Through these initiatives, Commissioner Smith has demonstrated \nimpressive leadership skills. She has built positive working \nrelationships with legislators, worker advocates, and the business \ncommunity.\n  In a letter urging her confirmation, the Business Council of New York \nState--the Business Council of New York--had this to say:\n\n       Ms. Smith has shown a clear ability to balance her duty as \n     a public official to enforce the law and her obligation as a \n     public official to ensure that the law provides for \n     reasonable application and reasonable solutions.\n       It is those critical skills--listening, interpreting, and \n     balancing--that make Ms. Smith an ideal candidate to serve as \n     the United States Department of Labor's Solicitor. . . .\n\n  That is the Business Council of New York State.\n  Another letter from the business community, this one from the \nManufacturers Association of Central New York:\n\n       The Department of Labor under the leadership of \n     Commissioner Smith--\n\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\n\n  Now they are talking about the Department of Labor in the State of \nNew York--\n\n     has been fully supportive in our mission to enhance and \n     improve our sector's workforce. Commissioner Smith and her \n     team have been informative, helpful, and involved every step \n     of the way. . . . It is Commissioner Smith's dedication, \n     leadership, and innovative thinking that make her an \n     exceptional candidate for Solicitor for the United States \n     Department of Labor.\n\n  That is the Manufacturers Association of Central New York.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that both these full letters, \nalong with five other letters of support from business organizations, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              The Business Council\n\n\n                                      of New York State, Inc.,\n\n                                      Albany, NY, August 14, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of M. Patricia Smith, US Department of Labor \n         Solicitor General.\n\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: On behalf of the 3,000 members of The \n     Business Council of New York State, I write in support of \n     President Obama's nomination of Ms. Patricia Smith for the \n     position of Solicitor General at the United States Department \n     of Labor. As the president and CEO of a statewide business \n     trade organization, I believe Ms. Smith is superbly qualified \n     to assume the responsibilities of Solicitor General and urge \n     the Committee's favorable disposition of her nomination.\n       As the Committee has the broadest access to Ms. Smith's \n     resume and credentials, I write to add a perspective which \n     often does not translate well from written documents or \n     background checks. Ms. Smith's long tenure as an Assistant \n     Attorney General of New York leading its Labor Bureau showed \n     her to be thorough, fair and judicious in the use of the \n     tools at her disposal to ensure compliance with New York's \n     Labor Law. She carefully balanced the disparate issues before \n     her and sought resolution as opposed to prosecution, when \n     that result would serve the best interests of New York's \n     citizens. And where blatant fraud, abuse and disregard for \n     New York's Labor Law was evident, she did not rush for \n     headlines and photo opportunities, but rather worked closely \n     with appropriate officials to build a legal case which would \n     withstand scrutiny and higher level appeals.\n       In her tenure as New York's Commissioner of Labor, Ms. \n     Smith continued her vigilance and diligence on behalf of New \n     York's citizens, again balancing the many different roles the \n     Department of Labor serves in New York State. To those not \n     familiar with the responsibilities of that Department, they \n     may not understand the challenge it can be to manage an \n     agency which issues unemployment benefits; must be vigilant \n     about fraud in that $2.5 billion unemployment system; engages \n     with businesses and individuals to help put people back to \n     work; manages a workforce development system designed to \n     improve skills of our workforce; and, enforces rigorous \n     minimum wage, safety and health, and various labor standards' \n     statutes. At times, a Commissioner is asked to decide between \n     what may seem to be conflicting goals and objectives; Ms. \n     Smith always demonstrated to the business community a \n     willingness to listen, to reflect and to respond.\n       To be sure, our organization did not always agree with the \n     policy direction taken under Ms. Smith's tenure. But there \n     are well-established processes through which we can pursue \n     changes to policies with which we disagree. What is important \n     to note is that under Ms. Smith's leadership, she made an \n     extra effort to communicate directly with the business \n     community, to elicit feedback, to provide us with a heads-up, \n     and to balance our comments as she framed policy and practice \n     within her Department. Her outreach to us and communication \n     with us was open, honest, candid and frequent. While some may \n     view her tenure as one of strict enforcement, with little \n     regard to practical day-to-day business realities, our \n     membership would disagree, as we believe she offered an \n     opportunity to the business community to be a part of the \n     solution, rather than just reacting to the problems.\n       New York's Labor Laws date back a century and reflect the \n     seriousness with which policymakers then and now feel the law \n     should protect workers and be responsive to their needs. That \n     is the statutory and regulatory environment within which New \n     York employers must operate. Where employers engage in fraud \n     and abuse of employees, enforcement of the law is a duty, not \n     an option. Ms. Smith has shown a clear ability to balance her \n     duty as a public official to enforce the law and her \n     obligation as a public official to ensure that the law \n     provides for reasonable application and reasonable solutions.\n       It is those critical skills--listening, interpreting, and \n     balancing--that make Ms. Smith an ideal candidate to serve as \n     the United States Department of Labor's Solicitor General and \n     I would ask that the Committee move on her nomination upon \n     its return in September.\n       Should any Committee members benefit from further \n     discussion on her nomination to which I can contribute, \n     please feel free to contact me at your convenience.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Kenneth Adams,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Manufacturers Association\n\n\n                                          of Central New York,\n\n                           Syracuse, New York, September 11, 2009.\n     Re nomination of M. Patricia Smith as Solicitor General, \n         United States Department of Labor.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Merkley,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Merkley: On behalf of MACNY, the Manufacturers \n     Association and its members, I fully give my support to the \n     nomination of Patricia Smith as Solicitor General of the \n     United States Department of Labor.\n       MACNY is a trade association representing over 330 member \n     companies with over 55,000 employees within a 19-county \n     region, and we serve and advocate for the growth and \n     development of the manufacturing sector of New York State. \n     Founded in 1913, we pride ourselves on not only being the \n     largest association of manufacturers in New York, but also \n     one of the oldest and most widely recognized associations in \n     the nation.\n       For Central and Upstate New York to retain its \n     manufacturing base, manufacturers must be able to compete in \n     the global economy. Manufacturing strength is contingent upon \n     the quality of the region's workforce. Manufacturers often \n     cite the quality of the workforce as a key reason for \n     business expansion and the lack of it as a reason for closing \n     and/or relocating. Expanding the trained and educated \n     manufacturing workforce is therefore crucial to the Upstate \n     New York economy. As such, one of MACNY's core mission areas \n     remains workforce development. Training programs help \n     manufacturers educate workers and remain in Central and \n     Upstate New York.\n       The Department of Labor under the leadership of \n     Commissioner Smith has been fully supportive in our mission \n     to enhance and improve our sector's workforce. Commissioner \n     Smith and her team have been informative, helpful, and \n     involved every step of the way, ensuring our membership has \n     the tools, education and skills they need in order to \n     succeed.\n       One such example is the partnership between MACNY and DOL \n     on the successful Shared Work Program. Since its inception, \n     MACNY has lent its support and continued to promote this \n     beneficial DOL program. Through this unique and successful \n     partnership, over 34 member companies have utilized and \n     benefited from the Shared Work program, including Revere \n     Copper Products, Endicott Interconnect and Manth Brownell, \n     Inc.\n       In another similar partnership, in May of 2009, MACNY \n     hosted a Workforce Development partnership meeting for the \n     planning of reemployment services on behalf Magna Power \n     train, a longtime MACNY member and major market manufacturing \n     employer located in Dewitt, New York. The meeting, in \n     partnership with the Department of Labor, focused on the \n     company's employees and the anticipated downsizings and \n     possible future plant closure. Since economic and labor pool \n     questions are regular inquiries from our membership, MACNY \n     holds a vested interest in the related progress. As a result \n     of this meeting, and with thanks to the expertise and hard \n     work of the Department of Labor, MACNY remains readily \n     available to promote an applicant pool and highly qualified \n     resumes to their membership.\n       Commissioner Smith has also spent her tenure advocating on \n     the federal level for funding in workforce development \n     initiatives and continued Federal workforce training dollars, \n     a cause that has greatly benefited MACNY's membership. \n     Meeting with editorial boards and local officials, New York's \n     Congressional delegation, as well as key Congressional \n     committee members and staff, Commissioner Smith was able to \n     draw attention to and oppose the 50% cut in New York's \n     Workforce Investment Act (WIA) dollars since 2000. In recent \n     years, MACNY has been grateful in securing federal funding \n     for workforce and training initiatives, allowing members to \n     receive discounted advanced skills training as a way to keep \n     their costs down and advance their workforce. Without \n     Commissioner Smith's tireless efforts in this capacity, this \n     critical program would not be possible.\n       As earlier stated, for over 95 years MACNY has been \n     tirelessly working to ensure we have the most up-to-date \n     services and information needed to allow our manufacturing \n     community to grow and prosper. In examples as cited above, \n     plus many more, our collaborative partnership with the \n     Department of Labor allows us to learn and educate our \n     membership on how the state's workforce development programs \n     can best help them. The continued leadership of Commissioner \n     Pat Smith in such instances has been exemplary, and our \n     collective membership is grateful for both her and the \n     Department of Labor's years of dedication to the state's \n     manufacturing community.\n       It is Commissioner Smith's dedication, leadership, and \n     innovative thinking that make her an exceptional candidate \n     for Solicitor for the United States Department of Labor, and \n     on behalf of MACNY, I fully support her nomination for this \n     position.\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\n       If you have any other questions in this capacity, please do \n     not hesitate to contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Randy Wolken,\n      President, MACNY.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Partnership for New York City,\n\n                                  New York, NY, September 1, 2009.\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: I am writing in support of President \n     Obama's nomination of M. Patricia Smith for Solicitor General \n     of the United States Department of Labor.\n       The Partnership for New York City is an organization whose \n     members include many of the nation's most prominent business \n     leaders. Our mission is to work with government, organized \n     labor and the not-for-profit sector to build a stronger city \n     and state, with a focus on education, infrastructure and the \n     economy.\n       During the past year, we have been particularly concerned \n     about the threat that the global financial crisis and \n     recession have had on the financial services industry, which \n     is a key source of jobs and tax revenues for New York. \n     Thousands of city businesses and workers, either directly or \n     indirectly, have been casualties of this crisis. As New York \n     State Labor Commissioner, Patricia Smith has been a strong \n     voice and essential partner in addressing the issues arising \n     from this crisis and helping to insure that New York remains \n     the financial capital of the country and the world.\n       Ms. Smith acted decisively to mobilize New York, \n     Connecticut and New Jersey to collaborate as a region with a \n     shared interest in the recovery of the financial services \n     industry and keeping top talent here. She led efforts to \n     secure a $20 million National Emergency Grant that is \n     currently helping thousands who have been laid off to train \n     for new careers. She established a New York Early Alert/\n     Retention Team to respond to small businesses in danger of \n     closure, relocation, or financial crisis that would result in \n     mass layoffs.\n       She has aggressively promoted programs that help employers \n     retain productive workers during downturns and fund employer-\n     sponsored worker training initiatives. She increased employer \n     participation in the federal Work Opportunity Tax Credit \n     (WOTC), which provides incentives to employers to hire people \n     who are hard to employ. The Partnership strongly supports \n     these programs, and every one of them has seen unprecedented \n     success in New York City under Commissioner Smith's \n     leadership.\n       As an advocate for businesses and economic development in \n     New York for more than twenty-five years, I have had the \n     opportunity to interact with many public officials. Ms. Smith \n     stands out as one of the most dedicated and effective of our \n     state commissioners and I consider her to be an excellent \n     choice for the post that the President has selected her for.\n       We hope you will support her nomination and would be happy \n     to answer any questions you might have about her work with \n     the New York business community.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Kathryn, S. Wylde,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             Long Island Forum for Technology,\n\n                                                  August 21, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of M. Patricia Smith, U.S. Department of Labor \n         Solicitor.\n\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: As the President of the Long Island \n     Forum for Technology I am writing in support of the \n     nomination of Ms. Patricia Smith for the position of \n     Solicitor General at the United States Department of Labor.\n       Founded in the 1970's, LIFT is a not-for-profit \n     organization whose focus is on technology-driven economic \n     development throughout the Long Island region. Our success is \n     evidenced by the recognition and responsibilities conferred \n     on us by our partners in the State and Federal Government \n     including:\n       LIFT serves as the U.S. Department of Commerce \n     Manufacturing Extension Partner (MEP), one of nearly 350 MEP \n     locations across the country;\n       LIFT serves as the NYS Foundation for Science, Technology \n     and Innovation (NYSTAR) designated Regional Technology \n     Development Center (RTDC) for the region;\n       LIFT serves as the NYS DOL Sector Intermediary in the \n     Advanced Manufacturing Sector and on the National Governors \n     Association (NGA) Sector Policy Academy.\n       It was in the last role that we have come into contact and \n     worked with NYS Department of Labor Commissioner Smith and \n     the programs she sponsored on work force transformation in \n     the Manufacturing and Healthcare sectors.\n       Under Commissioner Smith's able and visionary leadership, \n     the New York State Department of Labor conceived, launched \n     and funded a program known as Regional Workforce \n     Transformation (I3N). This program broke new ground in the \n     connectivity between industry and education. With its \n     industry-driven initiative structure it created an \n     environment for innovation, and increasing skill grwoth, \n     focused on creating Long Island's future workforce.\n       This program is now entering its 2nd year, with over 600 \n     individuals having gained a wide variety of new and upgraded \n     skills training. This has led to the transformation of many \n     individual lives with the results borne out in job placements \n     and position upgrades.\n       With a strong record of achievement and leadership, \n     Patricia Smith has been and outstanding Commissioner of the \n     NYS Department of Labor. With her vision and her energy, we \n     believe she will make an outstanding addition to the U.S. \n     Department of Labor's Leadership team and we urge her \n     earliest confirmation by the United States Senate.\n           Yours truly,\n                                              C. Kenneth Morrelly,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce,\n\n                                                  August 25, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of M. Patricia Smith, U.S. Department of Labor \n         Solicitor General.\n\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the U.S. Women's Chamber \n     of Commerce, our 500,000 members and the millions of women \n     nationwide, I am writing to send our strong support for \n     President Obama's nomination of Ms. Patricia Smith, and I \n     urge the Committee to confirm Ms. Smith as Solicitor General \n     at the United States Department of Labor. Ms. Smith has \n     demonstrated that she is well prepared and qualified for the \n     position, and will act on behalf of those who are facing \n     unfair labor practices.\n       The U.S. Women's Chamber of Commerce represents both \n     working women and women business owners. While one would \n     think that these two constituencies would be contradictory in \n     viewpoint, they are not.\n       From 1997-2006, the number of women-owned firms grew by \n     42.3% largely due to women leaving Corporate America in \n     droves in search of equal pay, opportunities for promotions \n     and a family friendly work environment. What they found \n     instead was more barriers to opportunity. In fact, during \n     this same time period, the revenues for all women-owned small \n     businesses grew only 4.4%--representing a 38% overall \n     decrease in revenues.\n       Clearly, women found that business ownership came with a \n     whole new set of challenges including the inability to fairly \n     access federal contracts, capital and affordable health care. \n     And, most profoundly, they are faced by the growing challenge \n     of competing with businesses that undercut their \n     competitiveness by engaging in unfair labor practices.\n       Those that pay fairly and play fairly do not fear Ms. \n     Smith's no-nonsense approach to labor law enforcement. They, \n     in fact, see that they are being protected.\n       After learning of Ms. Smith's qualifications, expertise and \n     the laws she has worked to uphold, I can clearly see that she \n     is someone who would work with conviction to enforce the laws \n     of the United States of America. Additionally, I am impressed \n     with her out-of-the-box thinking in creating programs that \n     will keep jobs. We especially need these attributes in this \n     time of economic challenge.\n       Please accept Ms. Patricia Smith's nomination, and confirm \n     Ms. Smith as Solicitor General at the United States \n     Department of Labor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Margot Dorfman,\n     CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n         Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractors' National \n           Association, Inc.,\n                                     Chantilly, VA, June 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy, Chairman,\n     Hon. Michael B. Enzi, Ranking Member,\n     Health, Education, Labor & Pensions Committee, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Kennedy and Enzi: I am writing on behalf of \n     the Sheet Metal and Air Conditioning Contractor's National \n     Association in support of Patricia Smith's confirmation as \n     Solicitor of the Department of Labor. As one the oldest and \n     well respected national trade associations with over 1800 \n     members in the United States and Canada, we wholeheartedly \n     endorse this appointment based on her past demonstrated \n     commitment for enforcement of labor laws and the rights of \n     workers.\n       In her past role as New York State's Secretary of Labor, \n     she brought a high degree of professionalism and equity for \n     many of our contractor members in New York State. Ms. Smith \n     was a strong advocate for protecting workers rights and \n     worked aggressively against the misclassification of \n     workers--an all too common problem for unionized contractors \n     not only in New York State, but nationwide.\n       SMACNA supports her appointment as the Solicitor of the \n     Department of Labor and urges her immediate confirmation. We \n     appreciate your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Vincent R.

Michael B. Enzi,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Our Chamber is the largest business and \n     economic development\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\n     alliance in northern New York and one of the five largest in \n     our state, representing more than 3,250 companies. I have had \n     the pleasure of serving as President and CEO since 1993, \n     having previously served as Executive Assistant to former \n     Congressman Gerald Solomon (R-NY 23) for fourteen years.\n       During my sixteen years of engagement in business and \n     workforce development in this region, I have had many \n     occasions to work with our New York State Labor Department in \n     various efforts to assist employers and to design and \n     implement meaningful workforce training programs. I am \n     writing to tell you first hand that until Patricia Smith was \n     named Commissioner, we enjoyed an excellent working \n     relationship with our local State Labor Dept. officials but \n     enjoyed little leadership, engagement or even interest from \n     the Commissioner's office.\n       Since she assumed leadership of the New York State Labor \n     Dept. in 2007, we have enjoyed not only attention and \n     engagement from Patricia Smith but a genuine working \n     partnership.\n       This includes the design, funding and implementation of a \n     three-year Aerospace, Transportation Equipment & Green Tech \n     Workforce Strategy for our region, our first multifaceted \n     approach to the creation of a capacity in our region to \n     attract and support employers in these targeted sectors. The \n     creative approach features everything from support for the \n     start-up of Plattsburgh Aeronautical Institute, an FAA-\n     certified A mechanics' school, to further development of a \n     new Global Supply Chain Management school at our local \n     university, to the launch of new electronics and alternative \n     energy technology programs at our community college, and \n     more.\n       And although we are just beginning the second year of \n     implementation under the three-year plan, the results are \n     already tangible. Plattsburgh Aeronautical Institute is set \n     to fully open its doors next month, and is already putting us \n     in play in terms of marketing the former Plattsburgh Air \n     Force Base for future aerospace activities. And Volvo/Nova \n     Bus has just opened a new plant in our community with 300 \n     employees for the production of transit buses in the U.S., a \n     venture that would not have been feasible without the \n     programs she helped us get up and running.\n       In these and other ways, Patricia Smith has worked with us \n     to give true life to the notion of wedding economic and \n     workforce development. But at the same time, she has also \n     been a partner in serving the current needs of our employers.\n       A prime example is a major workplace safety training \n     program administered through our Chamber under contract with \n     the State Labor Dept., bringing meaningful safety training to \n     hundreds of small employers who could never access it \n     otherwise.\n       Even in current tough situations, in which some of our \n     manufacturers have needed to reduce production, she and her \n     team have been there with creative solutions. This includes a \n     Shared Work program now being used by a major railcar \n     assembly plant. Rather than fully lay off a percentage of \n     their workers, they are using this program to reduce their \n     hours, with NYSDOL allowing them to access unemployment \n     insurance benefits for the percentage of hours they are not \n     working while being paid by the company for the remainder. \n     The obvious result is a better economic interim for the \n     employees, and the ability for the company to hold onto \n     skilled employees they want to bring back to fulltime when \n     orders pick up.\n       I could cite additional examples, but the bottom line is \n     this. Patricia Smith has been an outstanding partner as \n     Commissioner of the New York State Labor Dept., and will be \n     an outstanding Solicitor for the U.S. Labor Department. We \n     strongly encourage her earliest possible confirmation by the \n     Senate.\n       Please let me know if there are any questions we might be \n     able to answer, and thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Garry F. Douglas,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Commissioner Smith has a keen appreciation for the \nreality that challenging economic times put vulnerable workers even \nmore at risk. Under her leadership, the New York Department of labor \nhas ramped up enforcement efforts to protect workers who are being \nmistreated and has leveled the playing field for responsible employers \nwho play by the rules but face unfair competition from the lawbreakers.\n  It is another point I wish to emphasize. By going after the \nlawbreakers, what Ms. Smith has done is help level the playing field \nfor the responsible employers who are not engaging in these kinds of \nbad activities.\n  Commissioner Smith has developed an innovative new approach to \nprotecting workers. Her strategy--which involves targeting problem \nindustries and increasing focus on low-wage and immigrant workers--has \nbecome a model for other States. Her fair and effective approach to \nenforcing the law has won her the strong endorsement of the New York \nState District Attorneys Association.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that endorsement letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    District Attorneys Association\n\n\n                                     of the State of New York,\n\n                                               September 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     Chairman, Senate HELP Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Chairman Harkin: As an association of the 62 elected \n     District Attorneys, we represent very distinct and diverse \n     regions of New York, However, we are united in our efforts to \n     enforce the law and protect the people of our great state. \n     When the membership was polled whether to support the \n     nomination of Commission Patricia Smith to become United \n     States Solicitor of Labor, District Attorneys from across the \n     state and party lines enthusiastically agreed, because she \n     shares our commitment to law enforcement and has shown a \n     dedication, fairness and professionalism that would make her \n     a tremendous asset to the Department of Labor. The New York \n     District Attorneys Association strongly endorses the \n     appointment of Commissioner Patricia Smith for Solicitor of \n     Labor.\n       Commissioner Smith's thirty year record of accomplishment \n     proves that she is uniquely qualified to serve and has the \n     experience and expertise to serve as Solicitor of Labor. \n     Beyond her exemplary work as Commissioner, she has served \n     both in the New York State Office of the Attorney General as \n     the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Labor Bureau \n     and as the Deputy Bureau Chief and Section Chief of the Labor \n     Bureau. In these positions, she conducted and oversaw labor \n     law litigation in both state and federal courts. Under both \n     Democratic and Republican Attorney Generals, she effectively \n     brought together management, unions, employers and employees, \n     to solve disputes and ensure the effective and fair \n     application of labor and employment laws.\n       Commissioner Smith built a proactive labor docket, \n     enforcing labor laws with innovative approaches: developing a \n     Code of Conduct, partnering with advocacy groups, targeting \n     enforcement efforts on an industry-wide basis, and focusing \n     on low-wage and immigrant workers. She actively cooperated \n     with District Attorneys in bringing criminal cases arising \n     out of wage violations on public work cases. She enhanced \n     effectiveness of the minimum wage law by obtaining the first \n     criminal felony conviction in a garment case, the first \n     felony indictment in a minimum wage case, the first criminal \n     prosecution for failure to maintain payroll records, and the \n     first case brought under a joint employer theory.\n       Moreover, she successfully argued two Employment Retirement \n     Income Security Act cases before the United States Supreme \n     Court in 1996 and 1997. Her sound legal arguments for New \n     York State Conference of Blue Cross & Blue Shield Plans \n     vs. Travelers was noted by the Office of the Attorney \n     General and the legal community. As a result, she was \n     awarded the Louis Lefkowitz Award for outstanding service \n     to the State of New York.\n       In addition to those cases, she has had extensive labor law \n     experience. She has been lead and co-counsel in over 100 \n     cases in state and federal court primarily in the areas of \n     labor standards (minimum wage, prevailing wage, and \n     overtime); unemployment insurance, workforce development, \n     employee benefits, occupational health and safety, federal \n     preemption of state laws, constitutional issues, and workers' \n     compensation. She has defended the jurisdiction, procedures \n     and determinations of the Department of Labor, the \n     Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board, and the Workers' \n     Compensation Board and successfully defended State labor laws \n     against claims of ERISA, NLRA and IRCA pre-emption.\n       Most significant is her body of work as Commissioner of the \n     New York State Department of Labor. After being confirmed in \n     2007 by the New York State Senate, Commissioner Smith set \n     about to create the Office of Special investigations (OSI) \n     that identifies and prepares unemployment fraud and wage and \n     hour cases for criminal prosecution. This innovative \n     enforcement office has developed relationships with all the \n     District Attorneys, educating prosecutors about criminal \n     prosecutions under the labor law and referring ``prosecution \n     ready'' cases. To date, OSI has referred 1,735 unemployment \n     insurance fraud cases representing overpayments of over $77 \n     million. These criminal referrals are increasing every year \n     with a 60% increase from last year.\n       Commissioner Smith overhauled wage and hour enforcement at \n     the Department by strategically targeting enforcement to \n     either low-wage industries such as apparel, grocery stores, \n     car washes and race courses, or to poor neighborhoods, each \n     time bringing national attention to the plight of workers. In \n     2008, the Department collected and disbursed $24.6 million \n     for 17,000 workers across the State, resulting in a 37% \n     increase in collections from previous years and significantly \n     increased compliance by employers.\n       Commissioner Smith spearheaded the first-of-its kind Joint \n     Enforcement Task Force on Worker Misclassification that \n     brought together various state and federal agencies to focus \n     on misclassification of workers as independent contractors \n     and off the book work, which result in tax violations, \n     workers' compensation fraud, and unreported wages and \n     unemployment taxes. To date, the\n\n[[Page S371]]\n\n     Task Force has identified over 25,100 instances of employee \n     misclassification and over $292 million in unreported wages. \n     Many of these investigations uncovered criminal violations, \n     and the Office of Special Investigations worked with District \n     Attorneys throughout the state to ensure that corrupt \n     business practices were prosecuted. Three of these cases \n     resulted in criminal convictions. Several more are currently \n     under investigation by prosecutors. Many states are now \n     following New York's lead and creating task forces to tackle \n     this national problem.\n       It is for these reasons, the District Attorneys Association \n     of the State of New York strongly endorses the nomination of \n     M. Patricia Smith as the United States Solicitor of Labor.\n                                                Kathleen B. Hogan,\n                                                 DAASNY President.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Under her leadership, New York State has strategically \ntargeted enforcement efforts among low-wage employers, such as apparel \nmanufacturers, grocery stores, and car washes. This has resulted in a \nrecord recovery of unpaid wages that were stolen from workers' pockets. \nIn 2008 alone, 17,000 workers across the State of New York received \nmore than $24.6 million in back wages thanks to these enforcement \nactions.\n  There are real faces and real families behind these numbers. They \ninclude 170 janitors on Long Island who were being paid less than $100 \na week, despite working 12-hour days, and garment workers in Queens, \nworking in sweatshop conditions for $3 less than the minimum wage.\n  Patricia Smith led the New York Labor Department to investigate \nminimum wage and overtime violations at the Jin Shun factory in Queens, \nNY. Employees were paid $250 for working a 66-hour work week. That is \n$3.79 an hour, far below the minimum wage. Well, that investigation \nrevealed $5.3 million in wage violations in one of the worst sweatshops \nin the United States--$5.3 million.\n\n  Another one that came in is New York State Labor Commissioner \nPatricia Smith revealed illegal practices at a Long Island cleaning \nservice. Again, I referred to this. The employees worked 12 hours a \nday, 60 hours a week, bringing home less than $100 a week, and 170 \nworkers were paid far less than they actually earned. The illegal \ndeductions amounted to $238,581.\n  Again, this is what Patricia Smith has done. These are real people \nwhose hard lives--and they have hard lives anyway--were made a little \nbit easier because Patricia Smith went to bat for them and that made a \ndifference.\n  In light of Commissioner Smith's very impressive record, I had hoped \nall of my colleagues would agree that she will be a tremendous asset to \nthe Department of Labor and that she deserves to be confirmed as \nquickly as possible. Unfortunately, some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have raised concerns about Commissioner Smith's \nnomination. These were brought up last year in our committee, and these \nconcerns are focused on a program at the New York Department of Labor \ncalled Wage and Hour Watch. This was a small pilot project which \nallowed the department to partner with worker advocates, community \norganizations, and others, to educate workers about their rights, such \nas: You do have the right to the minimum wage. You do have the right to \novertime pay. Frankly, that sounds like a pretty good idea to me.\n  I think it is clear from what I have just pointed out there are far \ntoo many violations of our labor laws, especially among low-income \nworkers. That is where it hits--low-income workers, minimum-wage \nworkers and others such as that. I think the more education people such \nas that can have about their rights, about what the law is, the better \noff we all are.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues do not agree with New York's \napproach. Well, that is an issue we can certainly debate, if you like. \nBut beyond these policy concerns, my colleagues have also suggested \nthat Commissioner Smith's statements about this program raised \nquestions about her integrity and her management skills. Some have gone \nso far to suggest that she is not qualified for this position or that \nshe has not been truthful with Senators.\n  These are very serious accusations against a sitting, dedicated \npublic servant. I take them very seriously. I took them very seriously \nlast year. So I asked my staff to get me all of the documents. We \ninvestigated this from the beginning to the end with every relevant \ndocument. I spoke personally with Commissioner Smith and walked through \nthis whole thing with her from beginning to end. After doing all of \nthat, I can say with complete confidence that concerns expressed by my \nRepublican friends are totally misplaced.\n  Did Commissioner Smith misspeak on two occasions at her hearing? Yes, \nand we talked about that with Commissioner Smith. She admitted that. \nFirst she said she hadn't had any ``conversations'' about expanding the \nWage and Hour Watch program. Well, I went back and looked at the record \nand the kinds of questions that were asked. Quite frankly, you know, \nwhen you are asking questions and you have a witness on the stand, \nmaybe what they hear is not what you ask. That happens all the time. As \na Senator, sometimes I ask a question of a witness and they give me an \nanswer and I think, they didn't even hear my question. That happens all \nthe time, so you have to repeat it. She was asked this question in \nwhich she basically said she had not had any conversation. When she \nlooked at the record, she clearly--and then repeatedly explained \nafterward in writing that she intended to say she had not authorized \nthe expansion. There was no authorized expansion. There was a pilot \nprogram. After the pilot program they were then going to look at the \nresults and think about what they wanted to do next. In fact, that is \nwhat is happening right now. The pilot program has ended and is being \nassessed at this point in time. Again, Commissioner Smith clarified \nthis response on this issue in writing to the committee.\n  Commissioner Smith also testified at the hearing that the idea for \nthe Wage and Hour program came from the New York Department of Labor, \nthe department she oversees. Again, going back through the record and \ntalking with Ms. Smith, it is clear her testimony was correct to the \nbest of her knowledge at that time. What she later found out is that \none of her deputies had consulted with an outside group in the early \nstages of the program. Commissioner Smith was not aware of this fact at \nthe time of her testimony. She subsequently corrected her testimony \nafter she had learned about the prior communications by her staff with \nan outside group.\n  Commissioner Smith's explanations are completely consistent with the \ndocuments the HELP Committee has. In my view, that should be the end of \nit. She made innocent errors, she corrected them, and there is \nabsolutely no evidence of any underlying wrongdoing or any intention to \nmislead our committee. I will come back to this point again and again \nand again in the ensuing discussion, if there is one; however long it \ntakes, I will come back to this point, and that is this: No one is \nalleging that the Wage and Hour pilot program was illegal or unethical \nor in any way nefarious. It was perfectly legal, perfectly ethical, \naboveboard. It was documented. There were pieces of paper and stuff. It \nwas all out in the open. No one is alleging that. So if Ms. Smith made \nan incorrect statement, she wasn't trying to cover up some wrongdoing; \nshe wasn't trying to cover up something that was being done that was \nsort of under the table.\n  This was perfectly legal. So why would you want to cover up? Why \nwould you want to either mislead the committee or cover up something \nwhich was perfectly legal, perfectly open, perfectly aboveboard? I \nthink what those who have kind of accused her of misleading the \ncommittee are trying to do is to cloak it as though there was something \nwrong with this, that there was something she was hiding. There was \nnothing to be hidden. Again, I will put in the Record the documentation \nthat when people went through this training program for the Wage and \nHour Watch, they got a nice little piece of paper and they got a little \nbadge, a little card. There was nothing under the table about this \nwhatsoever.\n  So when you hear things such as she misled the committee, keep in \nmind, she didn't mislead them about anything at all; she incorrectly \nmade a couple of statements which she then corrected in writing. But \nthere was nothing illegal or unethical about what she was testifying \nabout, so there was nothing to mislead the committee about. These were \nsimply innocent mistakes.\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\n  My Republican colleagues have argued that Commissioner Smith's \nmisstatements are a problem because they were based now on \nmisinformation from her staff and thus reflects on her ability to \nmanage a large organization. Again, let's look at it this way: We are \nall busy public officials. As Senators we have large staffs here and we \nhave them in our State. We try to keep everything going, but every once \nin a while someone makes a mistake, or someone does something. And we \ndelegate. We delegate to our Chiefs of Staff. As committees, we \ndelegate to our staffs to do certain things. Let's put this in \nperspective as it pertains to Commissioner Smith. She runs an $11 \nbillion--billion with a ``b''--agency in the State of New York with \nover 4,000 staff. How big was this Wage and Hour Watch? A $6,000 pilot \nproject out of an $11 billion budget. I have to tell my colleagues--\nlet's be honest about it. We all deal with our staffs, we deal with our \nbudgets. This would be like something worth maybe $5 or $10 in our \nbudget. Do I pay attention to it? I would ask my staff to take a look \nat it, but me, personally? I can't. We don't have the time to do that. \nThat is why we have our staffs to do that. So for her not to have known \nintimately every little detail of a $6,000 pilot project--a pilot \nproject--well, to me, that makes sense.\n  In the meantime, while they were doing this, she is out there going \nafter all of these people whom I mentioned here getting back wages for \npeople who were cheated out of overtime, who were being paid less than \nthe minimum wage. That is where her focus was: helping families get \ntheir due recompense from their work. This was all during, as we know, \nan unprecedented economic crisis. So we have to keep that in focus.\n\n  It seems to me that the real concern of Ms. Smith's critics with the \nWage and Hour Watch program is that it was an innovative approach to \nenforcing the law. Historically, it has been very difficult to protect \nthe rights of workers in low-wage industries because they are so \nvulnerable to abuse, and they are often afraid to approach the \ngovernment for help. They can be fired for nothing. They can be \ndismissed. These are low-income workers or minimum wage, or barely \nabove minimum wage. So calling on community groups, religious groups, \nand others to play a role in reaching out and bridging this gap I think \nis an important idea. Quite frankly, I think it merits further \nconsideration.\n  It is important to understand how this pilot project worked in \npractice. Participants did not have any special authority or any \nenforcement power. They could not come onto private property without \npermission. They could not interfere with business operations. These \nwere ordinary citizens who volunteered--volunteered--to distribute \nflyers, to sit at information booths, educate workers about their \nrights under the law. This program was not by any stretch of the \nimagination radical. It is simply a way to ensure that our working \npeople are not unknowingly victimized by reaching out to the community. \nFor many of these people English is a second language. They may be new \nimmigrants to this country. They have their green cards or maybe they \nare now citizens, but they are at the bottom of the ladder and they \ndon't know all the laws. They don't understand all the intricacies. It \nwould be I think logical to reach into that community, whether it is a \nHispanic community, a Latino community, it could be Somalians who are \nhere or it could be some who have come here from Bosnia, some Asian \nimmigrants who come here from Vietnam or from Cambodia, all of these \npeople who have come into this country to work hard and to raise their \nfamilies here and contribute to our American society. They are at the \nbottom. It seems logical to me that you would go to that community, \npeople in the community who speak the language, who understand the \ncustoms, who are intimately knowledgeable of many of these families, to \nwork with them to let them know what their rights are. Surely no one is \ngoing to come here to the floor and argue these people should be kept \nin the dark about what their rights are. Again, this was on a volunteer \nbasis.\n  I applaud Commissioner Smith for having this type of program. It is \nthe kind of innovative thinking we need to protect the most vulnerable \nworkers during these very tough economic times.\n  It is my knowledge, my information, that this pilot program has ended \nand is now being assessed to see if it needs to be changed or fixed, \nwhat needs to be done, and do they need to expand it even more. Those \ndecisions are being made by the State of New York right now.\n  There are so many things we need to be doing to build a brighter \nfuture for working families: fostering new industries, investing in our \ncommunities, building skills, shoring up the safety net, but too often \nwe neglect to mention the importance of simply enforcing our laws. That \nis all we are talking about. We are not talking about doing anything \nother than that. When the law says you have to pay the minimum wage, \nyou ought to be paying the minimum wage, not less. When the law says \nyou should pay time and a half over 40 hours, you should pay time and a \nhalf over 40 hours, not less than that. This should not be a matter for \ncontroversy or any partisanship. Fair treatment is the foundation of \nreal security and opportunity for American workers, and ensuring this \nfair treatment starts with a strong Solicitor of Labor.\n  Patricia Smith is a seasoned, dedicated public servant with an \nexceptional record of achievement and unimpeachable integrity--\nunimpeachable integrity. Her nomination should be confirmed by the \nSenate as quickly as possible so she can get to work helping working \nfamilies to succeed during these very tough economic times.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                   Remembering Dr. William G. Demmert\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Dr. William G. \nDemmert, known by many as Kaagoowu (a man with the strength of a stump) \nof the Tlingit ``Naasteidi'' Eagle clan--a pioneer in the cause of \nimproving Indian education and the Nation's leading researcher on \nNative language immersion and culturally based education.\n  I am saddened to report that Dr. Demmert, an invaluable pioneer in \nthe cause of justice for Indian education, died January 19, 2010, in \nBellingham, WA, at the age of 75.\n  He was a man beloved by indigenous peoples of Alaska, the Southwest, \nthe Arctic nations, and New Zealand--especially the Tlingit and Lakota, \nby Hawaiians, and by Maoris. He will be sorely missed. In particular, I \nwould note that we in Alaska honored and cherished Kaagoowu. Residents \nof southeast Alaska say of his departure that he ``Walked into the \nForest,'' but his spirit and memory live on. He was tied to the lands \nof Alaska as a fisher and gatherer; he studied and recorded the \nlandscapes of ancestors as a scholar and as clan member. He served \nAlaska as superintendent, principal, and teacher for Klawock City \nSchool; a teacher in Fairbanks; a professor of education at the \nUniversity of Alaska Southeast; as a Commissioner of Education for the \nState of Alaska; and as a trustee of the Sealaska Heritage Institute. \nThroughout his life, he united Alaskans with the Lakota and, through \nhis work strengthened our bonds with Indian tribes across the Nation \nand with other indigenous Peoples throughout the Arctic and South Seas. \nHe contributed to the Nation by ensuring that the richness of our \ncultural and linguistic diversity survived in the schools and in our \ndaily lives.\n  Throughout his professional life, Dr. William Demmert championed \nthree important education issues: 1) early learning and preschool \nprograms; 2) meeting the educational needs of at-risk youth; and 3) \nimproving the academic performance of American Indian, Native Hawaiian, \nand Alaska Native children.\n  The focus of Dr. Demmert's research was the education of American \nIndian, Alaska Native, and Native Hawaiian students. His work was \ninvaluable in the exploration of educational programs and schools \nserving Native communities, helping educators and policy\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\nmakers to better understand the role of traditional knowledge in \ninstructional practice, and assessing what works in providing a school \nenvironment that values academic performance, citizenship, and the \ntraditional ways for Indian children. His research on Native language \nimmersion education has proven unequivocally that heritage language \nacquisition strengthens critical thinking, college preparedness, and \noverall academic success.\n  Dr. Demmert was born in Klawock, AK, to William and Florence (Allman) \nDemmert. He was of Tlingit and Oglala Lakota heritage and a member of \nthe Demmert family of southeast Alaska, many of whom made important and \npositive contributions to their communities and to Alaska at large \nthrough their work as teachers, education researchers, and leaders. \n``Dr. Bill,'' as he was known by many in southeast Alaska, lived up to \nhis heritage and his ancestors' examples.\n  Bill's experiences growing up within the Alaska education systems in \nthe 1940s and early 1950s ran the gamut of the kind of educational \nopportunities available to young Alaska Native people at that time. He \nattended a BIA school, a territorial school, and boarding schools both \nin and out of State. These experiences, and the support he received \nfrom his extended family, stayed with him and informed his view of \nIndian education.\n  Bill was not one of those ivory tower academics with no roots in the \nreal world. After earning his bachelor's and master's degrees and \nteaching in Washington State, Bill returned to Alaska, teaching in \nFairbanks, Craig, and Klawock, where he also served as both principal \nand superintendent. He spent the 1960s learning how to educate from the \nground up.\n  In 1969, he and few friends attending a conference on Indian \neducation decided to form a new group, one they thought would represent \nthe unique needs of Indian educators, students, and communities. The \ngroup they formed was the National Indian Education Association. The \nNIEA has become, since that initial conversation over coffee, a \npowerful voice for Indian students and educators across the country.\n  Soon after, Bill was asked to work with Senators Kennedy and Mondale \nto help write the Indian Education Act of 1972, legislation that was \nintended to respond to the U.S. Senate's report, ``Indian Education: A \nNational Tragedy, A National Challenge.'' Today, we know the Indian \nEducation Act as title VII of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct. Thousands of Indian educators and countless children and parents \nhave found a voice and benefited from programs created by Bill's work \nto create solutions to the tragic shortcomings in Indian education.\n  In 1973, having earned his doctorate in education from the Harvard \nGraduate School of Education, Bill returned to the world of public \npolicy, working for the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and \nWelfare as Deputy Commissioner of Education for the U.S. Office of \nIndian Education and as Director of the Office of Indian Education \nPrograms at the Bureau of Indian Affairs.\n  After 5 years with the Federal Government, Bill returned to academia \nat the University of Alaska Southeast and finished the 1980s as \nCommissioner of Education for the State of Alaska. As Commissioner from \n1986 through 1990, Dr. Demmert is credited with ``changing the \nconversation'' on education. Today, many of the issues he championed \nhave become mainstream in Alaska education.\n  In 1991, after Dr. Demmert left office as Commissioner, President \nGeorge H. W. Bush named him and former U.S. Secretary of Education \nTerrell H. Bell cochairmen of the prestigious Indian Nations at Risk \nTask Force, which issued an influential report to the President and \nCongress entitled, ``Indian Nations at Risk: An Educational Strategy \nfor Action.'' A principal writer of the report, this effort gave Bill \nthe opportunity to assess nearly 20 years of work and progress in the \neducation of Native American children. Among other elements, the report \npublished an Indian Student Bill of Rights. It reads:\n\n       The Indian Nations at Risk Task Force believes that every \n     American Indian and Alaska Native student is entitled to:\n       A safe and psychologically comfortable environment in \n     school.\n       A linguistic and cultural environment in school that offers \n     students opportunities to maintain and develop a firm \n     knowledge base.\n       An intellectually challenging program in school that meets \n     community as well as individual academic needs.\n       A stimulating early childhood educational environment that \n     is linguistically, culturally, and developmentally \n     appropriate.\n       Equity in school programs, facilities, and finances across \n     Native communities, and in schools run by the federal \n     government and public schools in general.\n\n  In writing and speaking about this report, he reflected upon his \ngrandparents', his parents', and his own education in BIA schools, \nwhose mission it was to assimilate Natives into the ``American way of \nlife and culture.'' He felt blessed that his grandfather and parents \nwere fluent in both Tlingit and English, and that they encouraged him \nto be so as well. He reflected with sadness that so many young people \nhe knew were fluent in neither. He expressed concern that over the \ncourse of his life, too many young people were educated in schools that \nreflected no respect for their language and culture, and was surprised \nthat he survived this.\n  Dr. Demmert spent the remaining years of his life researching and \nteaching at Western Washington University. Before retiring in 2008, he \nserved as a principal investigator, in partnership with Northwest \nRegional Educational Laboratory and other major partners from Arizona \nto Hawaii working to develop and test assessments in schools using \nNative language immersion and culturally based instruction.\n  Not only recognized as an expert in indigenous education here in the \nUnited States, Dr. Demmert leant his expertise to education \npolicymakers and practitioners of many nations, serving as cochair of a \ncoalition of the Ministers of Education of northern nations, including \nNorway, Sweden, Finland, Greenland, the Russian Federation, Nunavut \nTerritory, Northern Quebec, and the Yukon Territory.\n  Recognized for his long experience and vast expertise in Native \neducation, particularly with regard to Native language instruction, Dr. \nDemmert was called to testify in 2000 before the Senate Indian Affairs \nCommittee in support of the Native American Languages Act Amendments \nAct. Bill celebrated the fact that ``Native language, the traditional \nmores and cultural priorities, the importance of tribal identity and \nlineage have all become higher priorities as we build a contemporary \nculture and context of the school that supports Native students' \nidentities.'' That bill passed the U.S. Senate by unanimous consent.\n  In addition to his professional accomplishments, Dr. Demmert was a \ngood man. He had a great ability to put people at ease. He understood \nhis role as mentor, and built bridges between academia, policymakers, \nand everyday people. He was a teacher of teachers, and a leader of \nleaders.\n  Dr. William G. Demmert was responsible for great strides in Indian \neducation, and had great hopes for its future. Now, as we celebrate a \nlife well lived and his innumerable contributions to the education of \nIndian children, we must all rededicate ourselves to ensuring that \nevery child among our first peoples has the opportunity to learn in an \natmosphere of respect where his language, culture, and history are \ntaught and celebrated, and where every Indian child can achieve his or \nher highest aspirations. We must ensure that his legacy--the Indian \nEducation Act and indigenous language education as a means to \npreserving the sacred languages of our first peoples--is kept vibrant \nand meaningful for the future.\n  Bill Demmert, Kaagoowu, is survived by his wife of 42 years, Nora \nDemmert; sons William and Philip; daughters Nora and Melanie; brothers \nLee and Ted; his sister, Justna; five grandchildren, two great-\ngrandchildren, and a multitude of other relatives.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I am proud to recognize and thank Dr. \nWilliam G. Demmert for his long years of service. I extend my \ncondolences and sincere sympathy on his passing to his family, friends, \ncolleagues, and students.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the attached poem and resolution written \nin tribute to Dr. Demmert from the Native people of Hawai`i be printed \nat the end of my statement in the Record.\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         Ka Makua Bill Demmert\n\n                     (By Professor Larry L.

Demmert Jr., has fallen unto his \n     carefree sleep as his last breath left him, and has departed \n     to travel on that lonely path from which one does never \n     return. That same grief has affected all of Hilo's Hawaiian \n     language consortium partners, who now stand together \n     shouldering this burden of sadness.\n       Whereas the aforementioned Dr. Demmert was a native of that \n     same land where his Tlingit ancestors' piko, or umbilical \n     cords, lie secreted away in the birthsands of Klawock, the \n     place known well for the running salmon, a fish so favored by \n     Hawaiians; and whereas he was an esteemed descendent of the \n     nation from which came the two great logs that are now at sea \n     as the robust hulls of the canoe Hawai`illoa; and\n       Whereas the aforementioned Dr. Demmert was, even in his \n     early years, and following in his father's footsteps, a child \n     thirsty for knowledge, always keen to drink heartily from the \n     many rippling tributaries of instruction until he in the \n     fullness of time became one of those in the first group of \n     Native American students to graduate with a doctorate degree \n     from Harvard University in 1973; and\n       Whereas the aforementioned Dr. Demmert was one of the \n     founding members of the association put together to fight for \n     the education of Native Americans, the National Indian \n     Education Association, in 1970; and\n       Whereas the aforementioned Dr. Demmert became a friend to \n     the Hawaiian people in the year 1993, for his efforts to \n     improve the status of the many native languages of the United \n     States including the Hawaiian language; and \n     &*COM003*21Whereas the aforementioned Dr. Demmert was both an \n     advisor and confident for us as we continued to work through \n     the multitude of tasks involved in the revival of the \n     Hawaiian language; including here his role as a co-defender \n     of the plans and resources of the `Aha Punana Leo; his role \n     as a co-architect of the foundational P-20 framework upon \n     which the Hawaiian language college, Ka Haka `Ula o \n     Ke`elikolani, was built--his hands digging in the very same \n     soil as did our own--; and as co-investigator as we examined \n     ways to improve the abilities and the standing of our young \n     Hawaiian language speakers at Nawahiokalani`opu`u Hawaiian \n     Language Immersion School;\n       Therefore upon taking all of this into consideration, we \n     resolve that we are united with you, we as Hawaiian language \n     friends and families of the `Aha Punana Leo, Ka Haka `Ula o \n     Ke`elikolani, and Ke Kula `o Nawahiokalani`opu`u, now and \n     together alongside you as we enter this place of sadness at \n     the loss of the man whom we now praise to the highest.\n       Furthermore, we have resolved that we shall be standing as \n     you do in spirit and in prayer, packed shoulder to shoulder \n     against each other, coming from all corners of our land, in \n     order to best send our dearly departed friend to meet the \n     Holy Trinity in the heavens.\n       We have also together resolved that our loving embraces \n     will encircle and warm the bereaved family which has \n     experienced such loss at the recent departure this beloved \n     man took as the start of his infinite journey.\n       And finally, we resolve that our prayers, wishes, and \n     blessings shall go hand in hand with those of the Episcopal \n     Church in Bellingham on the 25th of January, and so too with \n     the Tlingit of Craig, Alaska, in their February ceremonies: \n     that the man may return to the land of his birth and \n     ancestors; that his hair may once again be blown by the soft \n     breezes of that area; that he may once again inhale the fresh \n     cool fragrances so yearned for and held in fond memory; and \n     that he may heed the distant call of his ancestors to return \n     to be with them in the peaceful calm of love's warm embrace.\n       . . . life appears as does a whisp of steam, but is so \n     quickly dissipated . . .\n       With love and aloha everlasting, those of the Fellowship of \n     Hilo, Hawai`i Island of the Verdant Green Back.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority leader is recognized.\n\n\n                               the budget\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, this morning, we received the \nadministration's budget for the next fiscal year. While there are \nplenty of issues raised by this budget, the fundamentals are clear: \nthis budget is more of the same--more spending, more taxes and more \ndebt.\n  I think everyone can agree that last year's budget spent too much. \nWith the trillion-dollar stimulus bill and massive increases in \noptional spending, the administration and Democrats in Congress simply \nspent too much and took us into record territory. But the \nadministration assured us that it was an anomaly--that we just needed \nto get through the year and then we would get serious about our \nspending in 2010. Fiscal hawks on the other side of the aisle told us \nthe same thing every time we raised the issue.\n  But now they have produced yet another massive budget filled with \neven more spending than last year's record totals. The President \nproposes to increase spending by another $100 billion--despite having \nalready increased the size of the Federal Government to unprecedented \nlevels. Even though the administration claimed that the current funding \nwas unique due to the economic crisis, they show no sign of slowing \nspending.\n  And while spending is going up, taxes are going up even faster. Taxes \non Americans will increase by over $400 billion--nearly 20 percent--\nnext year alone, with no improvement in sight. Does anyone truly \nbelieve this is a good time to raise taxes on job creators or anyone \nelse?\n  This budget provides a startling figure that should stop us all in \nour tracks. According to the administration's budget, the interest on \nthe Federal debt is expected to be nearly $6 trillion over the next \ndecade. We have all heard about interest-only loans, but this is the \nequivalent of an average of $600 billion in interest every year. That \nis an astonishing number.\n  In fact, in just 4 years the administration predicts the Government \nwill have to spend more just to pay interest on the Federal debt than \nit spends on the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Education, \nEnergy, Health and Human Services, HUD, Interior, Justice, Labor, \nState, Treasury, and the Corps of Engineers, Environmental Protection \nAgency, GSA, NASA, National Science Foundation, Small Business \nAdministration and the Social Security Administration--combined.\n  In just 4 years, the interest the government will have to pay on our \nFederal debt will be more than it spends on the Departments of \nAgriculture, Commerce, Education, Energy, Health and Human Services, \nHUD, Interior, Justice, Labor, State, Treasury, and the Corps of \nEngineers, EPA, GSA, NSA, National Science Foundation, Small Business \nAdministration, and the Social Security Administration--combined.\n  The Senate will have an opportunity to write a new budget this year. \nOur leader on this issue, Senator Gregg, will have much more to say on \nthe matter as we work to do what so many Americans are doing, and that \nis to get our budget in order. And I will have much more to say on the \nindividual pieces of this blueprint, including the administration's \npriorities on our national and homeland security. But now it is crystal \nclear that this budget is more spending, more taxes, and more debt--\nmore spending, more taxes, more debt. Anyone listening to the American \npeople knows this is not what they support, it is not what our country \nneeds, and it is not the way to grow good jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the nomination of Patricia Smith to be Solicitor of Labor. Ms. \nSmith is a well qualified, might I say exemplary, nominee and I \nenthusiastically support her confirmation.\n  Most recently, Ms. Smith served effectively as New York's \ncommissioner of labor, frequently bringing business leaders, workers \ngroups, and government officials together at the table. She has earned \nthe support of business groups in her State through her willingness to \nengage in an ongoing working partnership. She has earned the support of \nlabor groups in her State by upholding and enforcing New York's labor \nand workplace laws.\n  Ms. Smith not only has support from labor and business but bipartisan \nsupport as well. The entire New York congressional delegation signed a \nletter endorsing her nomination. She has worked under both Democratic \nand Republican administrations during her long tenure in public \nservice. Republicans and Democrats alike acknowledge her willingness to \nengage both sides of the aisle and to do so effectively.\n  Most important to her position at the department of labor is her \nstrong track record of protecting workers. She has demonstrated that \nall workers, regardless of wage, occupation, or gender, deserve the \nfullest protection of New York's labor laws. As commissioner of labor \nthere, she targeted enforcement toward the industries and geographic \nareas most susceptible to abuse and managed to increase compliance \namong employers and raise awareness about recurring workplace problems. \nFor example, Ms. Smith has led New York's Department of Labor in \nshutting down exploitative sweatshops. Last year, her department's \ninvestigation turned up an instance where sweatshop operators were \nrequiring employees to fraudulently use two sets of timecards, thereby \navoiding paying overtime. Workers were often required to work 80 hours \na week, often working 7 days a week, and then were coached to lie to \nlabor department investigators. These employers who ignore workplace \nlaws cheat taxpayers out of money. The taxpayers are forced to make up \nthe difference when taxes on overtime wages are not paid, not to \nmention that this treatment of workers is both illegal and immoral. Ms. \nSmith worked to fix these problems.\n  Based on her exemplary work, Ms. Smith has won support from countless \ncivil rights groups, including the National Conference on Civil Rights, \nthe National Women's Law Center, the American Association of University \nWomen, and the Business and Professional Women's Foundation.\n  Unfortunately, there are some who have been trying to delay Ms. \nSmith's confirmation. Further delay is detrimental to America's \nworkers. The Department of Labor has been deprived of a critical member \nof its leadership team. We should see that it is filled as soon as \npossible. The Solicitor of Labor leads an office of over 600 people who \nwork to enforce 200 of our Nation's labor laws. The Solicitor also sets \nlong-term planning strategy, participates in shaping legislative \npolicy, and interprets legislative language. These are all essential \nelements to the full functioning of our Department of Labor. Delaying \nher confirmation is a disservice to the American workforce.\n  For these reasons, I urge all of my colleagues to support the \nnomination of Patricia Smith to be Solicitor of Labor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Is the current business the nomination of Patricia \nSmith?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Smith nomination is before the Senate.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I reluctantly rise to oppose moving \nforward with the nomination of Patricia Smith. I do not do so easily \nnor happily because I believe the President of the United States has \nthe right to make appointments, and I think within reason those \nappointments should be confirmed. The question before the Senate, with \nthis nomination, is not whether wage and hour laws should be enforced. \nThey should be.\n  The question is not whether Ms. Smith has done a good job in New York \nState because Republicans and Democrats said she has. The question is \nwhether the Senate will tolerate a nominee intentionally misleading a \nstanding committee of this body. My guess is the Democratic majority \nwould not have stood for that under the previous administration, and we \nshould not today.\n  Unfortunately, Ms. Smith has been consistently evasive in response to \nnumerous questions from members of the committee, specifically with \nregard to a program called Wage Watch, which deputized private activist \ngroups to inspect small businesses to look for and seek to find wage \nand hour law violations.\n  For 5 years I have served as the senior Republican on the Employment \nand Workplace Safety Subcommittee that maintains the oversight \nresponsibilities over the Department of Labor. I am a vigilant, \nlongtime supporter for fair and fully enforced wage-and-hour laws.\n  The program in question, Wage Watch, is a program that empowered pro-\nunion special interests to enforce the myriad of labor laws that cover \nsmall employers. This approach is simply inappropriate. It can at worst \nbe entrapment and at best an improper attempt to enforce the law. One \ncan imagine the outcry if the Minutemen who patrolled on their own on \nour border to the south had somehow been deputized by our immigration \ndepartment under the last administration. There would have been \noutrage, and there should have been.\n  The ``Wage Watch'' program specifically targeted small- and medium-\nsize businesses. In discussing the success of the program, Ms. Smith \nbragged that one business was closed as a result of this program, \ntelling the New York Times that she had ``made the determination that \nit would be better for workers to lose their jobs than to continue \nworking there.''\n  Ms. Smith stated the program would not be used for union \norganization; however documents obtained by the HELP Committee from the \nNew York State Labor Department and a union newsletter show plans \nspecifically to use the program for union organizing throughout New \nYork.\n  Worse than the program itself was Ms. Smith's refusal to provide the \ncommittee with accurate and complete information about the program. In \nApril of 2009 I wrote to Ms. Smith to ask if she foresaw ``the \npossibility of instituting similar efforts on a national level.'' On \nMay 12 she replied in writing that she had ``not considered or \nadvocated expanding it across New York to other parts of the country, \nto the Federal level or to other laws.'' However, documents procured by \nthe HELP Committee revealed that Ms. Smith wrote in January 2009, 4 \nmonths before the letter I just mentioned, that she would like to \ndouble the number of organizers involved, ``while laying the foundation \nto expand the program to various parts of Long Island and upstate New \nYork.''\n  She continued:\n\n       We're creating a movement here, and the more the merrier.\n\n  Clearly she had both considered and advocated expansion of the \nprogram, thus her statement to me was inaccurate. Her deceit on this \nissue forced me to write the President on September 10, 2009, and \nrequest that Ms. Smith withdraw her name. I asked the President that a \nnew nominee, one who would both look out for the interests of workers \nand be honest with the Congress, be nominated.\n  We now see a similar program like Wage Watch, now called We Can Help, \ndeveloping in the U.S. Department of Labor. In fact, one of the pro-\nunion special interest groups Ms. Smith deputized to implement her New \nYork program, the so-called National Employment Law Project, has been \nchosen by Secretary Solis to assist in the enforcement of Federal \nworkplace laws.\n  On a personal note, I ran a business for 22 years, and it was a small \nbusiness. I employed golf course superintendent workers, I had \nindependent contractors who were real estate agents, I did a lot of \nconstruction where we were subject to the Americans with Disabilities \nAct. We were\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nsubject to all types of labor laws. I vigorously made sure that \nwhatever the case might be, we worked hard to see to it we obeyed not \nonly the letter of the law but the spirit of the law.\n  But I, too, in my experience, from time to time encountered the kind \nof organizations Ms. Smith used in ``Wage Watch.'' They tried to entrap \nme and punish me. I think the proactive enforcement of labor law should \nbe vigilantly looking for violations and vigilantly looking for \ncorrection, not vigilantly looking for someone--as in the case of Ms. \nSmith and the businesses in New York--you can put out of business and \ncost the jobs of many employees of that small business.\n  As such, I reluctantly rise today to oppose the nomination of Ms. \nPatricia Smith.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum. I withdraw the \nrequest for a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise in support of \nPresident Obama's nominee to serve as Solicitor of Labor, Patricia \nSmith. I am very confident that she is the right person for this \ncritical job. The work she is going to do to protect our workers is \nmore important now than ever before.\n  American workers are facing incredible challenges today. They are \nstruggling with record unemployment and a devastating economic crisis. \nThey need and they deserve strong leaders in the Department of Labor \nwho are passionate about public service and committed to fighting for \nthem.\n  The Department of Labor is charged with a critical mission in our \nNation's government. Their role is to foster and to promote the welfare \nof America's workers by improving their working conditions, advancing \ntheir opportunities for profitable employment, protecting their \nretirement and their health care benefits, helping employers find \nworkers, and strengthening free collective bargaining. I believe during \nthese challenging economic times it is absolutely critical that the \nDepartment has the leadership it needs to make those goals a reality. \nThat is why I was very pleased that President Obama nominated such a \nstrong candidate for the position of Solicitor of Labor.\n  Patricia Smith has been the Commissioner of the New York State \nDepartment of Labor since 2007. She is cochair of the New York State's \nEconomic Security subcabinet, and she oversees 3,700 employees in 80 \noffices, with an annual budget of $4 billion.\n  For the previous 20 years, Tricia worked in the Labor Bureau of the \nNew York Attorney General's Office, and she served on the Obama \nadministration's transition team for the Department of Labor.\n  I have received many letters of support for Patricia Smith from \npeople who admire her work, from people she has worked with, and from \nworkers she has helped. I want to take a moment this afternoon to read \nsome excerpts from some of those letters because I believe they do \ndemonstrate Patricia's broad support and why she deserves to be \nconfirmed by the Senate.\n  I have received a letter of support from the CEO of the Plattsburgh, \nNY Chamber of Commerce. He knows Patricia well. He said:\n\n       Patricia Smith has been an outstanding partner as \n     Commissioner of the New York State Labor Department and will \n     be an outstanding solicitor for the U.S. Labor Department. We \n     strongly encourage her earliest possible confirmation by the \n     Senate.\n\n  That was the CEO of the Plattsburgh, NY Chamber of Commerce.\n  I also heard from the United States Women's Chamber of Commerce. They \nsaid:\n\n       After learning of Ms. Smith's qualifications, expertise, \n     and the laws she has worked to uphold, I can clearly see that \n     she is someone who would work with conviction to enforce the \n     laws of the United States of America. Additionally, I am \n     impressed by her out-of-the-box thinking in creating programs \n     that will keep jobs. We especially need these attributes in \n     this time of economic challenge.\n\n  I also received a letter from a group of professors and scholars of \nlabor and employment law and labor relations, from over 50 scholars of \nhighly respected institutions across the country such as the Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center, Columbia Law, Thomas Jefferson School of Law, \nYale Law School, and Cornell University School of Industrial and Labor \nRelations. They too urged speedy confirmation, saying that Tricia has:\n\n     consistently demonstrated the highest integrity and \n     commitment to ethical standards. She is experienced, \n     intelligent, thoughtful and energetic. We believe this is \n     exactly what the U.S. Department of Labor needs in a \n     Solicitor. Once confirmed, she will be among the best \n     Solicitors of Labor the Department has known.\n\n  Her support transcends party lines. Former New York Attorney General \nDennis Vacco, a Republican, had this to say about his former employee:\n\n       Patricia Smith has proven herself as one of the foremost \n     experts in the nation in the realm of labor law, which is why \n     President Obama saw fit to nominate her. . . . She was an \n     asset to the New York Attorney General's Office and I am \n     confident. . . . She will be an asset to the Department of \n     Labor.\n\n  I am here this afternoon as Chair of the Subcommittee on Employment \nand Workplace Safety. I know the challenges American workers are facing \nright now. That is why they deserve a Solicitor of Labor such as Tricia \nSmith who will fight every day to protect them. If she is confirmed as \nthe Department's top legal counsel, she will have the profound \nresponsibility of enforcing more than 180 Federal laws and managing \nmore than 450 attorneys nationwide.\n  She will be responsible for defending the Department in litigation as \nwell as providing legal advice and guidance on nearly every policy, \nlegislative, regulatory, and enforcement initiative of the Department. \nMost importantly, she will be responsible for defending the rights of \nworkers when they are not able to speak for themselves.\n  Tricia has a big job ahead of her, but we need to act now to allow \nher to get started. We owe it to our country's workers to have a \nconfirmed Solicitor of Labor in place. I have had a number of \nconversations with Tricia and I wanted my colleagues to know I am \nconfident she is highly qualified and very eager to get to work. I will \nbe voting with confidence to confirm Patricia Smith. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the nomination of \nPatricia Smith to serve as the Solicitor of the Labor Department. I \nhave got to tell you, this is my 14th year in the Senate, and this is \nthe first time I have taken the lead in opposition to a nomination that \nhas come through my committee.\n  I take this very seriously. When the Founding Fathers drafted our \nConstitution, they were very concerned about concentrating too much \npower in any branch of the government. That is why they carefully \ncrafted the system of checks and balances to ensure that each branch of \nthe government has a method of checking the work and operations of the \nother.\n  Here in the Senate, one of our great checks has been our duty to \nprovide our advice and consent to the nomination of the executive \nbranch. That is a responsibility I take seriously. That compels us to \nensure that nominees who were brought before us are qualified and they \nhave presented their credentials to us completely, thoroughly, and \nhonestly.\n  Each nominee must pass the vetting process to ensure he or she \npossesses the strength of character and the experience to ensure that \nthe public can trust in his or her ability to carry out the duties of \nthe office for which they have been nominated. My Senate colleagues \nknow I rarely oppose Presidential nominees. I believe the President is \nultimately responsible for the conduct of his administration and is \nalso answerable to the Nation's voters, so he has the right to select \nthe members of his team, up to a point. That is where the advice and \nconsent comes in.\n  Before I elaborate on her nomination, I do want to recognize her \naccomplishments as the Commissioner of Labor in New York and the \ncommitment she has shown to serving the people of New York. Her prior \nservice would ordinarily have earned her our support and make her a \nbipartisan choice to lead one of our most important offices in the \nLabor Department. Unfortunately, there are other considerations which \nmust be taken into account in reviewing her credentials for this \nposition, which I believe disqualify her for this position. I have \nreleased a ranking\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\nmember's report detailing my concerns with Ms. Smith's nomination and \nposted them on the HELP Committee's Web site. Today I will explain the \nfactual inconsistencies between what Ms. Smith said before the HELP \nCommittee, for the record, compared to what is recorded in the official \ndocuments I have received from the State of New York.\n  The Solicitor of Labor is an important role. He or she is the chief \nlegal officer of the U.S. Department of Labor, the third ranking \nofficial in that Department, General Counsel to the Secretary, and is \nasked to manage one of the largest legal offices in the Federal \nGovernment, with more than 400 attorneys serving on the Solicitor's \nteam.\n  Unlike most legal offices in Cabinet agencies, the Solicitor of Labor \nhas independent litigating authority from the Department of Justice and \nexercises that authority on behalf of the Department of Labor. The \nSolicitor is also responsible for ensuring that all stakeholders, \nincluding small businesses, are treated fairly.\n  In the course of conducting a thorough review of Ms. Smith's \nbackground and qualifications, the committee discovered a program in \nNew York State called Wage and Hour Watch that she announced in January \nof 2009. The program was established to recruit and train union \norganizers and public interest groups to leaflet businesses with \ncompliance literature and to interview employees in an effort to find \nviolations of the law that could be used to bring State actions against \nbusinesses.\n  As part of the program, Ms. Smith committed to providing the groups \nwith a direct pipeline to senior State enforcement personnel to report \nany violations found. Participants were given official cards by the \nState of New York identifying them and their group as being part of the \nprogram. Here is a copy of one of the cards. You will find down there \nacross from ``date'' that this is for a 2-year period starting on \nFebruary 7, 2009. You got one of those cards after 1 day of training.\n  According to the New York State Department of Labor's press release \non January 26, 2009, Wage and Hour Watch is:\n\n     modeled in part after Neighborhood Watch, [the program] will \n     help promote labor law compliance through formal partnerships \n     between the New York State Labor Department and community \n     groups\n\nand\n\n     provide ordinary people with a formal and systematic role in \n     the fight against wage theft.\n\n  That sounds good, except Neighborhood Watch was set up so that people \nwould notify law enforcement authorities of things they thought were \nstrange and should be looked at. They did not have permission to go \ninto people's homes and investigate unannounced.\n  The release also identifies the six groups, two labor unions and four \ncommunity organizing groups, chosen by Ms. Smith for the program and \nexplains that they have been active in labor issues and referred cases \nto her agency.\n\n  Upon the conclusion of my remarks, I will ask unanimous consent that \nall documents referenced be made part of the Record.\n  In addition to her May 7 confirmation hearing, Ms. Smith also \nparticipated in a committee staff interview and answered questions for \nthe record. In her responses, Ms. Smith suggested the committee seek \nrelevant documents from New York, which I did obtain through a Freedom \nof Information request.\n  My staff reviewed the several thousand pages of documents eventually \nproduced by New York, and we sent Ms. Smith some additional questions \nthat she answered in late July, and former Chairman Kennedy sent \nquestions that she answered in September.\n  My concerns with the nomination relate primarily to four areas where \nMs. Smith provided at best incomplete and factually inaccurate \ntestimony to the HELP Committee, both during her May confirmation \nhearing as well as in the followup questions.\n  The first inconsistency I wanted to highlight is with Ms. Smith's \nplan to expand this program. In the May 7 hearing, Ms. Smith was asked \nby Senator Burr about her plans to expand Wage and Hour Watch. She \nresponded that there were no such plans.\n  His question was: Have you had any discussions relative to your being \nat the Department of Labor that would extend Wage Watch in any fashion \non a Federal level?\n  Ms. Smith said: No, we have not had any discussions of that. I have \nnot had any discussions with the Department of Labor in New York about \nwhether we would extend it across New York State. Again, it is a pilot \nprogram which we just did in January. We specifically limited it to a \nsmall number of groups, and we limited it to a small geographic area. \nWe limited it to basically New York City, Long Island, the lower Hudson \nValley, so we could assess what the successes would be, what the \nproblems would be.\n  On May 13, 2009, Ms. Smith made a similar statement in writing in \nresponse to three separate questions from committee members, including \nme. She said:\n\n       This initiative was designed as a local model in a limited \n     geographic area in a state, for a particular issue under a \n     particular statute. It was not designed for other laws or to \n     be used on the Federal level. Until the pilot is completed \n     and evaluated--\n\n  As she said up here--\n\n       I would not advocate expanding it to other areas in New \n     York, to other areas of the country, to the Federal level or \n     to other Federal or state laws.\n\n  That is what she said. The problem here is that many documents, \nincluding press releases, Ms. Smith's talking points for her own \nspeeches, and e-mails she was copied on, show there were plans in place \nto expand the program in virtually every instance, many with June 2009 \ndeadlines. Documents show that in April 2009, the State was maintaining \nlists of possible new entrants into the program.\n  I have a copy up here of groups that were being solicited with the \nWage Watch expansion, and that is in April of 2009. That is before she \ntestified. The State even sent out applications to a number of groups \nto join Wage and Hour Watch during May, when Ms. Smith had just \ntestified to the HELP Committee there were no plans to expand the \nprogram.\n  This was the plan to expand the program:\n\n       Dear friend, we are preparing to expand Wage and Hour Watch \n     beyond the original groups in the pilot program. We are \n     writing to you because you have expressed an interest in \n     becoming or joining a Wage and Hour Watch group, as are a \n     number of other organizations and individuals.\n\n  Later on it says:\n\n       In order to allow us to plan for the next stage of the \n     program, please return the completed application form with \n     the reference letter by Monday, June 15.\n\n  The records show that Ms. Smith's department also planned to expand \nthe scope of Wage and Hour Watch into investigating occupational safety \nand health matters from day one. That is not the original intent. The \noriginal intent was a Wage and Hour Watch group. But we can show where \nit was intended to investigate occupational safety and health matters.\n  Of course, originally it was not sold as enforcement of wage, it was \nsold as an educational program. But it changed to enforcement, \ninfiltration, and spying, and then added investigating occupational \nsafety and health matters.\n  In a January 15, 2009 e-mail from Ms. Smith to dozens of staff \nannouncing the program, she states:\n\n       After 6 months, once we have had the chance to get the \n     program rolling, we would like to expand to other groups \n     (particularly upstate), including community based \n     organizations, student groups; churches and other faith-based \n     organizations and labor unions. . . . This is an exciting new \n     initiative and one which we could potentially replicate \n     elsewhere in the country.\n\n  In the press release issued to announce the program, Ms. Smith's \nagency states:\n\n       After a six-month pilot period . . . , the Labor Department \n     will begin seeking additional groups who wish to participate \n     statewide. . . .\n\n  The release also directs the public to contact her agency by \ntelephone or through a dedicated e-mail address to establish additional \nNew York Wage and Hour Watch groups. In an article, the New York Times \nnoted the plans for expansion. They said:\n\n       After the first experiment in New York City and on Long \n     Island, the Labor Department will seek additional groups for \n     the program. The groups must be nongovernmental and nonprofit \n     and can include religious organizations, student groups, \n     labor unions, business associations and neighborhood groups.\n\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\n\n  Here is a sampling of other program expansion activities before Ms. \nSmith testified on May 2009: A December 1, 2008, e-mail to Ms. Smith \nlisted potential expansion groups in upstate New York. A February 2, \n2009, e-mail from Ms. Smith's deputy to two individuals explained how \nto set up a Wage and Hour Watch group. A February 18, 2009, e-mail from \nMs. Smith's deputy to an outside group noted plans to expand the \nprogram. A February 23, 2009, e-mail from Ms. Smith's deputy \nmemorialized a meeting with the six pilot groups and included a \nparagraph on training in June in both New York City and upstate for \npurposes of expansion. An April 9, 2009, e-mail exchange among Ms. \nSmith's subordinates listed several groups for expansion.\n  After Ms. Smith testified and answered written questions in May \ndenying expansion plans, her department continued to promote expansion \nand looked to recruit new members. For example, a May 15, 2009, e-mail \nto over 20 outside individuals requested that application forms be \nsubmitted by June 15; a June 1, 2009, e-mail to outside parties \nannounced preparations to expand Wage and Hour Watch; a June 3, 2009, \ne-mail from an outside public interest group offered over 40 \nindividuals the opportunity to join Wage and Hour Watch; a June 9, \n2009, formal application was submitted to Ms. Smith's department by the \nLaborers International Union of North America's Organizing Fund to \nconduct wage watch activities in the construction industry.\n  Contrary to Ms. Smith's responses to written questions that the \nprogram was only about wage and hour laws, her subordinates expanded \nthe program to occupational safety and health enforcement. It says:\n\n       Thank for your offer to insert something about safety and \n     health enforcement in the training the DOL is conducting on \n     Saturday. Unfortunately, given the late notice and training \n     schedules and grant deadlines, we will not be able to put it \n     together by Saturday. However, what we would like to do for \n     you is to announce that we will contact each of the \n     participating groups and offer their organization a training \n     on what safety and health issues they should be looking for \n     while conducting the oversight for wage and hour issues. If \n     that works for you, it would be great for us.\n\n  It wasn't supposed to be oversight. It was supposed to be education \nso that people would know what they were supposed to get and be able to \ntake the kinds of actions that individuals could take. But you can see \nit has changed dramatically.\n  An e-mail from the New York Committee on Occupational Safety and \nHealth, a safety and health public interest group closely tied to \norganized labor, sent to Ms. Smith's deputy on February 6, 2009, notes \nthat:\n\n       We will contact each of the participating groups and their \n     organization training on what safety and health issues they \n     should be looking for while conducting the oversight for wage \n     and hour issues.\n\n  In response, Ms. Smith's deputy solicits a list of things to train \nwage and hour watchers to look for, and they respond, as well as \nsuggesting that the groups take pictures of working conditions they \nbelieve unsafe. Sounds like an investigation.\n  Ms. Smith's own public pronouncements contradict her testimony to the \nSenate. A May 19, 2009, National Public Radio article quoting Ms. Smith \nand her deputy states:\n\n       New York's Wage Watch is just a few months old, and \n     officials say it is too soon to measure success. But the \n     pilot program is set to expand across the state this summer.\n\n  A set of talking points for Ms. Smith to deliver to an upstate \ncoalition group sometime after January 2009 but before she testified at \nher confirmation hearing states that the program ``will'' be expanding \nand solicits volunteers.\n  We have it here:\n\n       They are currently expanding with six distinct labor unions \n     and advocacy organizations in New York City and plan to roll \n     it out across the state in the coming months and years. We \n     will be expanding this program and when it does come upstate, \n     we will need the help of many of you to roll it out.\n\n  There also does not appear to be any document that supports Ms. \nSmith's statement that there were no plans for expansion. Indeed, I am \ntold the public documents actually contain more than 50 specific \nreferences to expanding the Wage and Hour Watch Program. All of these \nred tabs are references to expanding the program. All of the red tabs \ntalk about expanding the program. It doesn't look incidental.\n  Concerns about the factual inconsistencies in Ms. Smith's testimony \nare not solely held by the minority. Former Chairman Kennedy's staff \nsubmitted questions about the expansion of the program. Ms. Smith \nresponded at the time of the confirmation that she had had ``no \ndiscussions about a potential expansion with anyone, other than \ngenerally indicating that if it were proved successful, my goal would \nbe to expand to it other areas of New York.''\n  Despite all of this evidence, Ms. Smith's defenders have claimed that \nshe misspoke and that she delegated a small program to a deputy. \nHowever, the documents show Ms. Smith herself promoting expansion and \nrecruiting members in her own speeches and media interactions.\n  In addition, I question Ms. Smith's ability to lead the Solicitor's \nOffice if her subordinates, including her deputy, were allowed to act \noutside of their authority as suggested by earlier explanations. It is \ndifficult to see how it would be appropriate to blame a breakdown \nbetween Ms. Smith and her deputy for inaccuracies regarding program \nexpansion plans. Ms. Smith worked with her deputy for more than 5 \nyears. When Former Governor Spitzer appointed Ms. Smith to the New York \nLabor Department, news articles noted that she brought her deputy and \nprotege with her. I find the explanation even more surprising because \nof Ms. Smith's pedigree. Her prior boss, former attorney general and \nGovernor Eliot Spitzer, was known for his aggressive prosecution of \ncorporate officials, including some who were accused of not overseeing \ntheir subordinates properly. I find it unlikely that the State of New \nYork would accept ignorance as an excuse if an executive on Wall Street \ntried to use it as a defense. Why should we accept a similar excuse \nnow?\n  A little more information about her background and the Spitzer \neducation program and her participation there. Some have also suggested \nthat this program was reasonably beneath Ms. Smith's notice, noting \nthat her agency has an $11 billion budget with almost 4,000 staff. If \nconfirmed, Ms. Smith would be in charge of legal compliance for a \ndepartment whose budget projects spending 10 times what she oversaw in \nNew York, $104.5 billion in 2010. Leaving aside the extensive \ndocumentation showing she was heavily involved in this program, I ask \nmy colleagues, why would we consider expanding her responsibility \ntenfold if she was unable to oversee her subordinates effectively in \nNew York?\n  Former President Harry Truman had a sign on his desk that read ``The \nbuck stops here'' to show that responsibility for the conduct of \nsubordinates ultimately rested with him. Ms. Smith ought to own up to \nthe responsibility that ultimately rests with her.\n  With regard to the second inconsistency, Ms. Smith stated that the \nprogram was developed internally and only then did the New York \nDepartment of Labor approach or recruit outside groups. However, e-\nmails obtained by the committee directly contradict this statement, \ninstead showing much of the driving force and even legal research for a \nprogram model came from organized labor and its allies. Here are a \ncouple of examples: an April 16, 2008, e-mail from Mr. Jeff Eichler, \ncoordinator for retail organizing projects for the Retail Wholesale and \nDepartment Store Union, RWDSU, to Ms. Smith's deputy regarding an \n``Enforcers'' program, with four pages of attached research explaining \npotential models for their ``concept of wage and hour enforcers;'' an \nAugust 18, 2000, e-mail in which Ms. Smith's deputy responds to Mr. \nEichler's ideas that the State consider allowing participants to \ninfiltrate businesses that are part of the program.\n\n  Most disturbing, however, to me about this inconsistency is the fact \nthat Ms. Smith admitted in her response to a question that she \napparently saw the e-mails contradicting her testimony in July but did \nnot correct the problem until directly asked in September about this \nissue by majority staff; that is, 2 months later.\n  A third inconsistency is that Ms. Smith also characterized Wage and \nHour Watch as an educational program in testimony. However, the record \nshows it was designed and intended to be enforcement from the very \nbeginning, with the union organizers and\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\ncommunity organizer participants serving as amateur investigators and \ninformants. The very first documents discussing the program describe \npotential participants as ``community enforcers.'' I refer to the \npreviously introduced April 2008 e-mail from union official Mr. Eichler \ndescribing this as an enforcers program and a November 28, 2008, e-mail \nfrom one of Ms. Smith's subordinates disseminating draft training \nmaterial stating:\n\n       The one day session [of training] will not turn enforcers \n     into labor law experts but will assist them in identifying \n     labor law violations and make the referral of greater value. \n     The ``role of community enforcer'' is where we will have to \n     come up with original material . . .\n\n  Notably, Ms. Smith is personally copied on that e-mail.\n  Ms. Smith's own words, her subordinates' internal and public \nstatements and deliberations, the media, and the groups involved in the \nprogram all emphasized and portrayed wage and hour watch as an \nenforcement from its very beginning. It was only when she was \nquestioned by HELP Committee members about the program that Ms. Smith \nchose to portray the program's substance as educational in nature. \nQuite a difference.\n  Finally, Ms. Smith stated that the two unions that were selected for \nthe pilot program, United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1500 and \nRWDSU, were told not to use the program for organizing. However, the \nagreement created by Ms. Smith and entered with the unions and special \ninterest groups specifically allows the pilot groups to make use of \ninformation gathered for ``community organizing,'' which Ms. Smith also \nadmitted in response to a written request.\n  The committee has a copy of the United Food Commercial Workers, UFCW, \nLocal 1500 work plan sent to Ms. Smith's deputy which also directly \ncontradicts Ms. Smith. The plan states that the union intended to use \nwage and hour in ``all of our organizing campaigns,'' including those \noutside their designated Wage and Hour Watch area. UFCW Local 1500 also \npublished plans to target nonunion workplaces as part of the program in \nits publicly available union newsletter.\n  It is difficult for me to believe Ms. Smith and her department did \nnot know union organizing was intended by those joining the pilot \nprogram. All the participants and signatories from two labor unions \ninvolved appear to be employed as full-time organizers. Other \nindividuals and groups purely responsible for union organizing also \napplied to join when the program was expanded.\n  It is clear that Ms. Smith's testimony and responses to follow-up \nquestions are repeatedly contradicted by documents I received from the \nState of New York. It is particularly troubling that inconsistent \nstatements to the committee were in each instance an attempt to \ndownplay concerns about the Wage and Hour Watch Program raised by \nRepublican members. At best, the inconsistencies in her testimony lead \nme to question her ability to interact with Congress in a candid manner \nand manage the enforcement of labor laws by the Office of Solicitor in \nan evenhanded and fair manner.\n  I have tried for months to resolve these concerns. In August, I asked \nPresident Obama to withdraw Ms. Smith's nomination and offered my \nassistance in ensuring a replacement would be confirmed quickly. I also \njoined all my nine Republican colleagues on the HELP Committee in \nurging Chairman Harkin to refrain from approving this nominee in \ncommittee and made the same offer to him of assistance in ensuring a \nqualified replacement being given swift review and confirmation. I \nmentioned I joined all nine. As to a couple people on there, I do not \nknow that they have ever opposed a Presidential appointment.\n\n  Because the President and the majority did not consider it a problem \nthat Ms. Smith provided factually inconsistent information to the \nSenate, I am forced to insist on a full debate on her nomination. \nGiving my consent to a Presidential nominee is not something I take \nlightly, even with the benefit of the doubt I have always given to the \ncandidates sent over to us by the White House. However, the integrity \nof the Senate committee process and the responsibility of advice and \nconsent demands honest and accurate testimony when the witnesses come \nbefore us.\n  For that reason, I have lost confidence in Ms. Smith's ability to \nmanage the Solicitor's office. I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nnomination, and I ask unanimous consent that documents referred to in \nmy speech be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nLabor Department Initiative Empowers Ordinary People to Join the Fight \n                           Against Wage Theft\n\n\n New York Wage Watch, the Only One of its Kind in the Nation, to Roll \n                  Out in New York City and Long Island\n\n       Albany, NY (January 26, 2009).--At a press conference in \n     New York City, State Labor Commissioner M. Patricia Smith \n     today announced the formation of New York Wage Watch, a new \n     tool in the fight against labor law violations in New York \n     State. New York Wage Watch will focus on a variety of illegal \n     practices, jointly referred to as wage theft, including \n     payment of subminimum wages; nonpayment of wages; failure to \n     pay overtime; tip stealing; and other such violations.\n       Modeled in part after the Neighborhood Watch program, New \n     York Wage Watch will help promote labor law compliance \n     through formal partnerships between the New York State Labor \n     Department and community groups. The effort will start with a \n     pilot program with several groups in New York City and Long \n     Island for the first six months, and then be opened up to \n     interested groups from throughout the state.\n       The first model of its kind, New York Wage Watch will \n     provide ordinary people with a formal and systematic role in \n     the fight against wage theft. Participating groups will \n     select a geographic zone for their efforts, and within that \n     zone, they will participate in a range of activities aimed at \n     improving labor law compliance, including holding know-your-\n     rights training; providing employers with information about \n     compliance; and distributing literature to workers in \n     supermarkets, laundromats, nail salons, and other community \n     settings. When they encounter workers facing serious \n     violations of the law or employers with detailed questions \n     about compliance, New York Wage Watch groups will have a \n     designated point person for referrals in the Labor \n     Department's Division of Labor Standards, which enforces wage \n     and hour laws. The Department will provide training and \n     materials to participating groups.\n       ``Just as no one wants to live in an area riddled with \n     crime, nobody wants to live in a neighborhood where workers \n     are paid sweatshop wages,'' said Commissioner Smith. ``New \n     York Wage Watch will increase labor law compliance by giving \n     regular people a formal role in creating lawful workplaces \n     statewide, and thereby improving the quality of life in their \n     communities. It will also help law-abiding employers, who \n     struggle to compete with businesses that undercut them by \n     violating the law.''\n       In recent years, the Labor Department has uncovered \n     widespread labor law violations in a broad range of \n     industries and locations throughout the state. An industry-\n     based investigation of car washes in 2008 revealed that over \n     78% of New York City car washes inspected were not paying \n     minimum wage or overtime. Nearly half of 303 employers \n     visited on joint enforcement sweeps in Buffalo, Albany, the \n     Bronx, and Queens required followup for wage and hour \n     violations. The Labor Department found serious violations at \n     ordinary stores, restaurants, and offices statewide, as well \n     as at state icons like the Saratoga Race Course, where over a \n     hundred backstretch workers interviewed reported a pattern of \n     illegal wages, and at the Erie County Fair, where bathroom \n     attendants were paid no wages and were even forced to give \n     half of their tips to a subcontractor.\n       ``These violations are far more common than many people \n     realize, but they plague our communities and diminish the \n     quality of life for New York's workers,'' said Commissioner \n     Smith. ``We are enforcing the law as creatively and \n     aggressively as we can, but the government cannot do it \n     alone. We need concerned members of the public to help raise \n     awareness about wage theft, to educate workers and employers \n     about the law, and to help serve as a bridge between our \n     agency and workers who might be unlikely to come to us on \n     their own.''\n       Over the past few years, the Department of Labor has forged \n     informal partnerships with advocacy groups and grassroots \n     organizations on behalf of workers. A more proactive approach \n     by the Division of Labor Standards, combined with efforts of \n     the newly created Bureau of Immigrant Workers' Rights, has \n     resulted in more sustained and effective partnering. One such \n     relationship, with the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store \n     Union (RWDSU), and Make the Road New York, led the Department \n     to investigate a commercial strip in Bushwick, Brooklyn. \n     During the course of this investigation, the Labor Department \n     found $350,000 in wage underpayments were owed to 60 workers. \n     In the ensuing weeks and months, the RWDSU and Make the Road \n     New York maintained a presence in the area, talking with \n     businesses and workers about labor law. A labor law seminar \n     was also conducted for employers in the area. Labor law \n     compliance appears to have increased in Bushwick as a result \n     of this joint effort. New York Wage Watch aims to\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\n     replicate the enhanced effectiveness resulting from the \n     coordination of law enforcement efforts with ongoing presence \n     and involvement of community members.\n       This pilot program will begin with a small number of groups \n     who are already working on labor issues. Each group has \n     referred a number of cases to the Department of Labor in \n     recent years. The groups are Centro del lnmigrante in Staten \n     Island; Chinese Staff and Workers' Association; Retail, \n     Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU); Make the Road \n     New York; United Food and Commercial Workers (UFCW) Local \n     1500; and The Workplace Project in Long Island.\n       Next month, each of these groups will receive language-\n     specific training from Department of Labor staff. The first \n     trainings will be held on Saturday February 7 at the Murphy \n     Center for Labor Studies in Manhattan, in English, Spanish \n     and Chinese, and will cover basic labor laws affecting \n     workers such as minimum wage, overtime and meal periods. The \n     Department of Labor will also be providing multilingual \n     outreach materials to each Wage Watch group to hand out to \n     workers and businesses.\n       After a six-month pilot period with these groups, the Labor \n     Department will begin seeking additional groups who wish to \n     participate statewide. Each group should be a non-\n     governmental, non-profit entity, such as a community group, \n     religious organization, student group, labor union, business \n     association, or neighborhood association. Groups must have at \n     least six members and must select a geographic region to \n     focus upon--this may be as small as several blocks in an \n     urban setting or as large as several counties elsewhere. \n     Groups need not have prior labor-related experience.\n       Stuart Appelbaum, President of the 100,000 member Retail, \n     Wholesale and Department Store Union said, ``New York Wage \n     Watch is labor law enforcement at the purest, most grassroots \n     level. This program will allow unions, community groups and \n     churches to engage in the fight against the exploitation of \n     workers in our neighborhoods. It is critical that employers \n     do not take advantage of workers and their families during \n     these difficult economic times.''\n       Amy Carroll, Supervising Attorney for Workplace Rights at \n     Make the Road New York said, ``Wage theft is rampant in many \n     low-wage industries and immigrant neighborhoods, in large \n     part because workers are afraid to come forward and file a \n     complaint when their rights are violated. New York Wage watch \n     allows the State Department of Labor to partner with \n     organizations, like Make the Road New York, that already have \n     workers' trust. In our experience, community monitoring of \n     employer conduct is critical to ensure that employers caught \n     violating the law today actually pay their workers correctly \n     tomorrow. Employers will be dramatically less likely to \n     violate wage and hour law when they know that trained \n     community members are on the ground as the eyes and ears of \n     the DOL's wage enforcement units.''\n       Bruce W. Both, President of United Food and Commercial \n     Workers Union Local 1500, New York State's Largest Grocery \n     Workers Union said, ``UFCW Local 1500 commends the New York \n     State Department of Labor for its innovative approach to \n     promote labor law compliance among New York State's \n     employers. UFCW Local 1500 is excited to participate in the \n     Wage Watch program, as we see it as both a creative yet \n     fiscally efficient way to educate workers and employers about \n     their labor rights and obligations during these difficult \n     economic times. Our long history of working with the DOL, \n     Commissioner Patricia Smith and her dedicated staff has \n     taught us that grocery workers, especially Gourmet Grocery \n     Workers, will greatly benefit from such a program. Workers in \n     this industry have high rates of not being paid according to \n     New York State Wage and Hour laws. UFCW Local 1500 looks \n     forward to making Wage Watch a successful collaborative \n     effort.''\n       Gonzalo Mercado, Director, El Centro del Inmigrante said, \n     ``El Centro del Inmigrante applauds the New York State \n     Department of Labor for the creation of the Wage Watch \n     Program. Thousands of workers every year are victims of wage \n     and hour violations and this initiative is a great tool to \n     help enforce the labor laws that most of the time are not \n     known by the workers nor by their employers. Immigrant \n     workers are the most exploited and most vulnerable and we \n     look forward to collaborating in this endeavor.''\n       Nadia Marin-Molina, Executive Director of the Workplace \n     Project said, ``During this time of economic crisis, it is \n     more important than ever that the wages of workers, immigrant \n     and non-immigrant alike, are protected, so that workers can \n     pay rent and feed their families. On Long Island, the \n     Workplace Project has shown that, with education, organizing, \n     and support, community members--day laborers, domestic \n     workers, and factory workers, for example--are willing to \n     stand up and fight exploitation on the job at great personal \n     risk. The Wage Watch program will now allow us to link a \n     trained community team to work closely with the New York \n     State Department of Labor, so that employers will not be able \n     to abuse workers with impunity. The Workplace Project is \n     excited to participate in this innovative partnership with \n     the DOL and looks forward to engaging many more community \n     members to stop wage theft through this collaboration.''\n       To find out what you can do to establish a New York Wage \n     Watch group in your community, send an email to \n     NewYorkWageWatch@labor.state.ny.us or call 1-888-52-LABOR.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        New York State Department of Labor--Wage and Hour Watch\n\n       Dear Friend: We are preparing to expand Wage and Hour Watch \n     beyond the original groups in the Pilot Program. We are \n     writing to you because you have expressed interest in \n     becoming or joining a Wage and Hour Watch group, as have a \n     number of other organizations and individuals.\n       We have not yet determined the precise extent or timetable \n     of the initial expansion of the program, and we want to be \n     sure to expand in a planned and methodical way which will \n     ensure the continued quality of the program.\n       However, regardless of the precise plan we develop for \n     expansion, our first step is to gauge the level and location \n     of interest throughout the state. This will allow us to \n     determine training needs and a realistic schedule for \n     expansion. Therefor, we have developed the attached \n     Application form for groups who are interested in becoming \n     Wage and Hour Watch participants.\n       For efficiency and quality control, all groups who wish to \n     become a Wage and Hour Watch group must have at least six \n     members, and must have a host or sponsor organization--either \n     a nonprofit organization, an educational institution, a trade \n     association, a labor union, or a religious/faith-based \n     organization.\n       If you are an individual without such an affiliation, \n     please complete the form to the best of your ability and \n     return it to us. If there is a Wage and Hour Watch group \n     forming in your region, we will try to connect you to the \n     group.\n       Please note that the application form asks for a reference \n     letter. This reference letter would be for the lead person, \n     or contact person, for the proposed Wage and Hour Watch \n     group.\n       In order to allow us to plan for the next stage of the \n     program, please return the completed application form with \n     reference letter by Monday, June 15, 2009.\n       If you have any questions, please contact email \n     wageandhourwatch@labor.state.ny.us\n       Thank you for your interest and we look forward to hearing \n     back from you.\n\n                                               Terri Gerstein,\n\n            Deputy Commissioner for Worker Protection & Immigrant \n                                                          Service.\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS01FE10.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\n     From: Gerstein, Terri (LABOR)\n     Sent: Wednesday, April 16, 2008 4:49 PM\n     To: Boylan, Lorelei (LABOR)\n     Subject: FW: Enforcers\n     Attachments: Auxiliary Police Fact Sheet; Volunteer Ambulance \n         Corps Fact Sheet; Neighborhood Watch Fact Sheet\n       FYI.

I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I listened very carefully to the statement \nmade by my friend and ranking member, Senator Enzi. Many of the points \nraised by the Senator have been gone over before by the committee. \nThese were things we looked into. So I think I would like to respond a \nlittle bit, almost point by point, to some of those concerns that were \nraised in the statement made by Senator Enzi.\n  But before I do that, I, again, wish to make one thing very clear. We \nare talking about something--this Wage Watch. Is that what it is \ncalled? Wage Watch. We are talking about something that is perfectly \nlegal. Almost, listening to my friend's comments on it, you would think \nthere was some subterfuge going on. This was perfectly open and above \nboard and everything. No one is alleging anything was ever done \nillegally. No person--none of the Wage Watch people--did anything \nillegal. In fact, all the things they were engaged in--and I say \n``were''; I use the past tense because it was a pilot program and it \nhas now ended and they are now assessing it--but all the things they \nwere engaged in, they can engage in today. Anyone can. I can. You can. \nStaff can. Anybody can do this. It is not illegal. It is perfectly \nlegal. So let's keep in mind what we are talking about is a perfectly \nlegal, open, transparent pilot project that was started by the New York \nDepartment of Labor.\n  Again, as I indicated earlier with my charts, why were they doing \nthis? Because so many people had been found who were not being paid the \nminimum wage; they were working overtime and not being paid overtime. A \nlot of times these low-income workers--many of whom are recent \nimmigrants to this country--do not know what their rights are. They are \nfearful of losing their job. It is the only thing they have to keep \ntheir families together, and if the employer decides to shave a little \nbit off their overtime, what are they going to do? They have no one to \ngo to.\n  So that is why I pointed out in my charts how much money and how many \ntimes Commissioner Smith had gone after bad actors, bad employers, to \nget money back for workers, for their families, for their retirement \nsystems they were cheated out of.\n  As she said to me, the good employers--the good employers--the \nbusinesspeople in New York wanted her to do this because the bad actors \nwho were shaving, who were not paying the minimum wage, who were not \npaying overtime, were taking unfair advantage of the honest employers \nthat were meeting their legal obligations. That is why it is no \nsurprise to me we have all these letters of support for Ms. Smith from \nthe business community. I already mentioned the Business Council of New \nYork, the Manufacturers Association of Central New York, the entire New \nYork congressional delegation--all these writing letters in support of \nher, talking about how fair she is and how she would listen and work \nthings out.\n  When she started--she did not start it--but when the department \nstarted this Wage Watch, that was the intent of it. It was information. \nMy friend says they started out from the beginning for enforcement. \nWell, sure, what do you think? Do you think someone is going to find \nout someone is not paying someone the minimum wage, and they are not \ngoing to tell anybody, they are not going to tell the Department of \nLabor, they are just going to say: Well, that is just the way it is. Of \ncourse, the end result is to enforce the law, to let people know their \nlegal rights so that law can be enforced. Of course, that is the end \nresult of it.\n  But the implementation of that was an informational program, to get \ninformation and guidance out to people, again, who--we are not talking \nabout Members of Congress. We are not talking about our educated staff \nwho have been to the best schools and have all these fancy degrees. We \nare not talking about accountants. We are not talking about people \nworking on hedge funds in New York or on Wall Street. We are talking \nabout people working in Queens at the minimum wage in the garment \nindustry--janitors, homemakers, others out there who are working in \nfood service who are at the minimum wage or slightly above it. So we \nare talking about people who do not have all that knowledge base we \nkind of assume workers would have. I wish to make that point clear \nbefore I start to talk about some of the points that were made.\n  Again, a lot has been made about the plans for expansion and about \nSenator Burr's question. I looked at Senator Burr's question. I looked \nat her response. I was there that day. It did not register. But then \nlater on we began to look at this when issues were raised by my \nRepublican colleagues.\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\n  Well, quite frankly, the e-mails that were shown by my colleague were \nnot e-mails from Patricia Smith. They were e-mails from Terri Gerstein, \nnot Patricia Smith. Quite frankly, to expand it to include occupational \nsafety and health training, there was an e-mail to Terri Gerstein from \nJoel Shufro. Well, much was made of this. Again, I will respond in two \nways. Much was made of expanding it to occupational safety and health \nissues training. My response is, yes; so? Shouldn't people also know \nnot only what their rights are in terms of what their wages are, but \nshouldn't they also have the right to know whether something is unsafe, \nwhether their health is being endangered? It would seem to me this also \nhas to get out there, to know what their rights are to protect their \nhealth and their safety. I don't have any problem with that, that they \nshould have that kind of training also, as well as to be on the lookout \nfor that.\n\n  Sure, if they are working in hazardous conditions and with hazardous \nmaterials that can affect their lives and their livelihood and their \nfuture health, somebody ought to know about it. Someone should know \nabout it.\n  On the expansion of the program beyond just the wage-and-hour \nexpansion in the State, it looks as though the deputies may have gotten \na little ahead of her when they were doing this. Again, keep in mind, I \nknow the buck stops here. I saw that chart. The buck always stops here. \nWe are responsible.\n  As I pointed out, Ms. Smith was running an agency with an $11 billion \nbudget--$11 billion, 4,000 employees. This was a $6,000 pilot project, \nhardly the meat and potatoes of what she was doing in her job every \nday. Plus, she was focusing on one of the worst economic crises New \nYork and this country has faced. So keep that in mind.\n  Ms. Smith was clear in her response to us about the fact that she had \nno discussions about a potential expansion with anyone other than \ngenerally indicating that:\n\n       . . . if it proved successful, my goal would be to expand \n     it to other areas of New York State. At that time, I had not \n     authorized my staff to proceed with a statewide expansion of \n     the program, nor had I discussed with them any steps that \n     were preliminary to a possible expansion. My first--\n\n  And I am reading from her response to our written questions. Ms. \nSmith says:\n\n       My first substantive discussion about the steps needed to \n     be taken to evaluate any potential expansion of Wage and Hour \n     Watch occurred in late May 2009 with my Executive Deputy \n     Commissioner. . . . At that time he informed me that the \n     Deputy Commissioner for Wage Protection and Immigrant Affairs \n     had recently discussed with him what to do about the \n     additional requests to join the program to which we had never \n     responded. He told me that he had authorized her sometime in \n     mid May to send out e-mails to groups in New York that had \n     expressed interest in the program in case we judged the pilot \n     a success. He had not personally seen the e-mail. Therefore, \n     within days, I asked to review the text of the e-mail the \n     Deputy Commissioner for Wage Protection and Immigrant Affairs \n     was using. I told her that it could give the impression that \n     a decision to expand the pilot had been made, which it had \n     not, and made appropriate changes to the text. I directed her \n     to use my corrected version in all future e-mails.\n\n  So, again, rather than saying this has to be expanded, she said let's \nlook at the results and see what the results are, and she took it upon \nherself to correct those mailings that went out from her office.\n  The other thing that was said had to do with unions and that she \nmisled the committee. There is a claim in response to a written \nquestion that she instructed unions participating in the Wage and Hour \nWatch Program not to use their status as wage watch groups as a union \norganizing tool. In fact, the New York Department of Labor tacitly \ncondoned this practice.\n  Those are the charges that were made.\n  Well, first of all, again, there is nothing improper or unlawful \nabout unions using their Wage and Hour Watch activities as part of \norganizing campaigns. There is nothing illegal about that. I would like \nto have someone show me where that would be illegal. There is nothing \nillegal about that. However, Ms. Smith, in order to be fair, took all \nappropriate steps to discourage that activity because business groups \nhad raised concerns about this issue with her. She responded \nimmediately, specifically prohibiting unions from distributing their \nown organizing literature while they were performing wage and hourly \nwatch activities.\n  This was a written question to her:\n\n       Were you personally aware of any instance when a labor \n     organization participating in the Wage and Hour Watch program \n     engaged in labor activities? If so, how did you respond? If \n     not, how would you have responded to such activity?\n\n  Here is what Ms. Smith responded in writing:\n\n       I am not personally aware of any instance when a labor \n     organization participating in the Wage and Hour pilot program \n     engaged in organizing functions while performing Wage and \n     Hour Watch functions. If I had been aware of such behavior I \n     would have decided to terminate them from the pilot.\n\n  Here is another question:\n\n       In your response to a question submitted by Senator Enzi on \n     May 12, 2009, you describe a March 2009 meeting with numerous \n     retail trade organizations where these organizations \n     requested that groups participating in the Wage and Hour \n     Watch pilot program be prohibited from giving out information \n     about their group while doing Wage and Hour Watch activities. \n     How did you respond to that request, and what actions did you \n     take to follow up on that request?\n\n  This has to do with labor unions too.\n\n       I told the trade associations that their request was \n     reasonable, that I would make sure the participating groups \n     would be specifically instructed to refrain from giving out \n     their own materials while doing Wage and Hour Watch \n     activities. I also told the trade associations that their \n     request would be explicitly incorporated in any future \n     written agreements. Within a week of that meeting, I \n     instructed Lorelei Boylan, Director of Strategic Enforcement \n     . . . to call each of the groups participating in the Wage \n     and Hour Watch pilot and give them that instruction. Within a \n     week after our conversation, she reported back to me that she \n     had contacted each of the groups, explained the specific \n     prohibition, and that they agreed to it. Since then, I have, \n     from time to time, asked my staff if they were aware of any \n     problems with the groups' complying with that particular \n     instruction, and they have reported no problems.\n\n  Again, here is her e-mail. Some talked about how these people would \ngo in and use authority to do something. It was compared to the \nNeighborhood Watch program. As my friend said, in the Neighborhood \nWatch program, people can't go into people's homes. Well, under this \nprogram, the Wage and Hour Watch Program, they could not go into a \nprivate employer's business either. They couldn't go into somebody's \noffice, somebody's business. They could go into a store where the \ngeneral public could go, yes. They could go into Wal-Mart or they could \ngo into a retail establishment where the public generally could go, but \nthey could not go into, let's say, a manufacturing concern where the \npublic was not allowed to go, the same as Neighborhood Watch. You \ncouldn't go into somebody's home. You could sure go into a community \ncenter. You could go into a shopping center. You could do a lot of \nthings. You could go to the public park as Neighborhood Watch.\n  But here is a letter from Patricia Smith dated January 15, 2009, long \nbefore any of this stuff ever came out:\n\n       Dear Labor Standards Staff:\n       I want to let you know about a new pilot program we will be \n     announcing on Friday called ``Wage Watch.'' The goal of the \n     program, as with all of our enforcement efforts, is labor law \n     compliance throughout the state.\n\n  Complying with the law. Anybody opposed to that? But here is the \nimportant paragraph:\n\n       Please note that the groups and individuals who participate \n     as Wage Watchers will not be agents, employees, or official \n     representatives of the Labor Department. They are not \n     replacing staff and they are not going to be conducting \n     investigations of any kind. Their role is limited to doing \n     outreach and community education, and to reporting any \n     violations they encounter to the Division.\n\n  I don't think you can get much clearer than that. That went out on \nJanuary 15.\n  There was one other thing I guess I have to respond to, and that is \nthat there is some confusion as to whether the idea for this came about \ninternally or whether it was external. Again, I don't understand what \nthe big problem is. Who cares where it came from? Again, it is a legal \noperation, ethical, aboveboard, not nefarious in any way.\n  There is some problem about whether it came from internally or \noutside. When Patricia Smith testified at the hearing, she was being \naccused of misleading us because she said it was ``an internally \ncrafted group'' and that ``it\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\nwas only after we sat down and crafted it ourselves that we reached out \nto groups to see if they would be interested.''\n  Well, I have met with Ms. Smith. We have talked about this. We went \nthrough all the records. At that point in time when she testified that \nwas to the best of her knowledge, that it had come from the people in \nher department and that they had suggested this and then they were \ngoing to go to outside groups to get people involved.\n  What she didn't know is that some people on her staff had been \nmeeting with outside groups in terms of coming up with this kind of an \napproach. Then she corrected it later on when she said: Yes, I found \nout later that some people on my staff had done this.\n  But, again, let's keep in mind there was nothing inappropriate about \nthis. There was nothing inappropriate about her staff meeting with \noutside groups to talk about this. Absolutely nothing. She just \nhappened to make a mistake in front of the committee in saying they \nhadn't gone to outside groups before it came up, and actually it had \nbeen discussed with outside groups with her staff.\n  What is the big deal? Is someone saying there is something illegal? \nNo, there is nothing illegal about that. Again, there is nothing \ninappropriate about it. It was simply a mistake she made in her \ntestimony because she didn't have full knowledge of what her staff had \nbeen doing at that point in time in that Wage and Hour Watch.\n  Lastly, I know it will be said: Can she manage a large organization \nif she doesn't know about what one staff person may have done in terms \nof talking to an outside group? Well, as I point out, she ran an $11 \nbillion agency, 4,000 employees. Her focus more than anything--and I \nhave talked to her about this, and I talked earlier about it with the \ncharts I had--was going after these employers who were cheating people \nout of their minimum wage, taking away retirement benefits, working \nthem overtime and not paying them overtime. She was getting money back \nfor these families. This was a $6,000 pilot project in an $11 billion \nagency. So she may have missed a little bit here or missed something \nthere or missed one person talking to somebody.\n  I would be more upset about it if it were illegal activity. If, in \nfact, these things had been going on and they were not legal, they were \nnot ethical, yes, then I would say the buck stops here, you bet. But \nthat is not the case. This is perfectly legal, perfectly ethical.\n  So I can understand if something went on in that agency in a small \npilot project and she didn't know every single thing about it and who \ntalked to whom and when something occurred. That is the essence, as I \nunderstand it, of the arguments on the other side. That seems to be the \nessence of it.\n  I think it is making a mountain out of a molehill. She is perfectly \nqualified to be the Solicitor, and I hope the vote coming up shortly \nwill confirm that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, in light of the 20 minutes that we just \nheard in defense, and he had spoken previously before I spoke, I ask \nunanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes to briefly comment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, there are so many places that a person needs \nto go if Ms. Smith does make it through the cloture vote. Of course, I \nhave a lot more documents and information I will be sharing with \npeople. I don't even know where to begin on the rebuttal to what has \nbeen said.\n  Internally crafted, no. It was brought to them by the unions. We can \nshow where that came from. The Senator from Iowa mentioned that she met \nwith small businesses in March. The program started in January with no \ninput from small business. This is going to affect small business. They \nshould have had the opportunity to comment on how the program would \nwork, because there are a lot of privacy and other related issues in \nthis.\n  When somebody comes to you with a State card from the Department of \nLabor of New York, they could probably go anywhere in the business they \nwant to. They have only had 1 day of training in order to be able to do \nthis. Does that make them an expert in OSHA and in wage and hour law? I \ndon't think so. But there are safety and security and invasion of \nprivacy issues that were ignored, or it was consciously decided they \nweren't important.\n  We asked about background checks on those who were trained and gave \nthe State identification cards to:\n\n       There is no formal vetting process for the New York \n     Department of Labor to partner with an entity. Instead, the \n     Department relies primarily on prior experience working with \n     the group. For the Wage and Hour Watch pilot, the Department \n     selected the groups that were asked to join based on prior \n     experience working with them on a more informal basis.\n\n  They did consider the possibility of a background check on the groups \nbut ultimately rejected that idea after inquiring as to whether \nNeighborhood Watch groups are subjected to backgrounds checks. The \nDepartment was informed that the groups participating in this more \nsensitive crime prevention partnership were not subject to a background \ncheck.\n  In her Senate response, Ms. Smith in part explains the lack of a \nbackground check because the program is modeled on the National Sheriff \nAssociation's Neighborhood Watch program. Notably, however, unlike Wage \nand Hour Watch, Neighborhood Watch is purely an observe and report \nprogram. Participants do not investigate crimes and are strongly \ncautioned against doing so, nor are they allowed to enter private \nproperty or businesses in conducting their operations. Calling the \npolice about suspicious activity in a public area is significantly \ndifferent than investigating the wages and hours of individual \nemployees and recording their personal contact information.\n  This decision to allow those who may have criminal records--no \nbackgrounds check--or may not be legal residents--no background check--\nin the United States to be trained and gather information under cover \nof New York State authority is also compounded by the types of \ninformation being gathered. That is a little different than \nNeighborhood Watch too. Ms. Smith authorized the training provided to \nparticipants that directed them to gather the personal telephone \nnumber, vehicle license plate, and home address of business owners they \nvisited. As noted above, the State also allowed that information to be \nkept and used for other purposes outside of Wage and Hour Watch.\n  I have more things I could go into. For instance, in a memorandum to \nMs. Smith in January 2009, NYDOL officials point out that all pilot \ngroups would be taught ``guidance on what level of information is \nneeded for `anonymous' Wage and Hour Watch tip.'' They wouldn't be able \nto tell if an anonymous tip was inaccurate. In other words, it could be \nused for harassment.\n  There are a lot of problems with the program. I will be going into \nthem tomorrow if cloture is successful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will try to end yet \nanother Republican filibuster and invoke cloture on the nomination of \nPatricia Smith to be Solicitor General for the Department of Labor. \nThis is the 15th filibuster against President Obama's nominees.\n  Commissioner Smith is a well-qualified nominee who has decades of \nexperience working on labor issues, and a strong record as labor \ncommissioner for the State of New York. The Senate Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions held a hearing on her nomination in May \nand reported it favorably to the Senate last October. Commissioner \nSmith should have been confirmed long ago. However, as has become all \ntoo common in this Congress, the Republican minority continues to block \nthe Senate from even considering her nomination and giving her the up \nor down vote they not long ago insisted was the constitutional right of \nevery nominee. Instead, the Senate is faced with another Republican \nfilibuster.\n  Nothing I have seen suggests there is a reason to block Commissioner \nSmith's nomination from receiving Senate consideration. If some \nSenators oppose the strong enforcement of laws to protect American \nworkers, they can vote against the nomination.\n  Some seek to justify this delay by creating controversy over ``Wage\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\nWatch,'' a pilot program started by the New York Department of Labor \nunder Commissioner Smith designed to encourage Department employees to \nreport labor law violations. This seems to be a controversy generated \nby those who disagree with the program. What is so troubling about this \nfilibuster is how difficult it has become to determine which \nnominations Senate Republicans are merely blocking as part of their \npolitical strategy of obstruction and delay of President Obama's \nnominees.\n  If cloture is invoked and we are finally able to consider the Smith \nnomination, we will then have the opportunity to end the filibuster of \nanother nomination, that of Martha Johnson to head the General Services \nAdministration, GSA. Her nomination has been stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar since June 8 due to the opposition of a single \nRepublican Senator over a dispute with GSA about plans for a Federal \nbuilding in his home State. The will of the Senate and the needs of the \nAmerican people are held hostage by a single Senator.\n  This should not be the way the Senate acts. Last week in his State of \nthe Union Message, President Obama told Congress and the American \npeople: ``The confirmation of well-qualified public servants shouldn't \nbe held hostage to the pet projects or grudges of a few individual \nsenators.''\n  Unfortunately, we have seen the repeated use of filibusters, and \ndelay and obstruction have become the new norm for the Republican \nminority. We have seen unprecedented obstruction by Senate Republicans \non issue after issue--over 100 filibusters last year alone, which has \naffected 70 percent of all Senate action. Instead of time agreements \nand the will of the majority, the Senate is faced with a requirement to \nfind 60 Senators to overcome a filibuster on issue after issue. Those \nwho just a short time ago said that a majority vote is all that should \nbe needed to confirm a nomination, and that filibusters of nominations \nare unconstitutional, have reversed themselves and now employ any \ndelaying tactic they can.\n  The Republican practice of making supermajorities the new standard to \nproceed to consider many noncontroversial and well-qualified \nnominations for important posts in the executive branch, and to fill \nvacancies on the Federal courts, has had a devastating effect. As a \nresult of this Republican strategy, there are currently 75 nominations \npending on the Senate's Executive Calendar for important positions \nthroughout the executive branch and the judiciary, all but nine of them \npending since last year.\n  There are 19 judicial and executive nominations pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar that were reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, all of them reported with bipartisan support. In fact, 16 of \nthe nominations reported by the committee were reported without a \nsingle dissenting vote. These nominations are not controversial. They \nshould be easy to consider and confirm.\n  Five more nominations reported by the committee were pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar at the end of last year, but Republicans \ninsisted that they be returned to the President rather than held in \nplace. Two were judicial nominees and three were nominees to head \ndivisions at the Justice Department as Assistant Attorneys General. One \nof those nominations had been reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote, with no dissent.\n  Despite the fact that President Obama began sending judicial nominees \nto the Senate 2 months earlier than President Bush, last year's total \nwas the fewest judicial nominees confirmed in the first year of a \nPresidency since 1953, a year in which President Eisenhower only made \nnine nominations all year, all of which were confirmed. The number of \nconfirmations was even below the 17 the Senate Republican majority \nallowed to be confirmed in the 1996 session.\n  Only 12 of President Obama's judicial nominations to Federal circuit \nand district courts were confirmed all last year, less than half of \nwhat we achieved during President Bush's first tumultuous year. We have \nconfirmed only two more this year, after Republicans objected to \nconsideration of the nomination of Joseph Greenaway of New Jersey to \nthe Third Circuit, a nomination reported by the committee last October \n1 by unanimous consent.\n  Democrats did not practice this kind of obstruction and delay in \nconsidering President Bush's nominations. In the second half of 2001, \nthe Democratic majority in the Senate proceeded to confirm 28 judges. \nBy this date during President Bush's first term, the Senate had \nconfirmed 30 circuit and district court nominations compared to only 14 \nfor President Obama. In the 17 months that I chaired the Senate \nJudiciary Committee during President Bush's first term, the Senate \nconfirmed 100 of his judicial nominees.\n  During President Bush's last year in office, with Democrats again in \nthe majority, we had reduced judicial vacancies to as low as 34, even \nthough it was a Presidential election year. When President Bush left \noffice, we had reduced vacancies in nine of the 13 Federal circuits.\n  As matters stand today, judicial vacancies have spiked and are being \nleft unfilled. We started 2010 with the highest number of vacancies on \narticle III courts since 1994, when the vacancies created by the last \ncomprehensive judgeship bill were still being filled. While it has been \nnearly 20 years since we enacted a Federal judgeship bill, judicial \nvacancies are nearing record levels, with 102 current vacancies and \nanother 21 already announced. If we had proceeded on the judgeship bill \nrecommended by the Judicial Conference to address the growing burden on \nour Federal judiciary, as we did in 1984 and 1990, in order to provide \nthe resources the courts need, current vacancies would stand over 160 \ntoday. That is the true measure of how far behind we have fallen. \nJustice should not be delayed or denied to any American because of \noverburdened courts and the lack of Federal judges. The rule of law \ndemands more. The American people deserve better.\n  Among the nominees ready for Senate approval are nine Federal \njudicial nominees reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Two would \nfill vacancies on the Third Circuit, three would fill vacancies on the \nFourth Circuit, and there are nominees to fill vacancies on the First, \nSecond and Sixth Circuits, as well as a district court nominee to \nWisconsin. The delay in considering them is also part of this effort to \ndelay and obstruct. Judge Greenaway, about whom Senators Lautenberg and \nMenendez spoke last week, was reported by unanimous consent back in \nOctober, four months ago.\n  Two weeks ago the Majority Leader tried to get agreement to take up \nthe nomination of Judge Greenaway, the next judicial nominee on the \nSenate Executive Calendar, but Republican objections continue to stall \nconsideration. That is a shame. He is a good judge. Senator Sessions \npraised him at his confirmation hearing. Why he is being stalled I do \nnot know, and no one has explained. Even after the statements by the \nNew Jersey Senators, no one has come forward to explain the hold up \nfrom the Republican leadership. Judge Greenaway is one of the many \noutstanding judicial nominations reported by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that remain stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar. They \nshould have been confirmed last year and would have but for Republican \nobjection. When considered, they will be confirmed but not before being \nneedlessly delayed for months.\n  They insisted on debate on the nomination of Judge Gerard Lynch, who \nwas confirmed with more than 90 votes. Republicans insisted on hours of \ndebate for the nomination of Judge Andre Davis, who was confirmed with \nmore than 70 votes. Senate Republicans unsuccessfully filibustered the \nnomination of Judge David Hamilton last November, having delayed its \nconsideration for months. For at least 2 additional months, Judge \nBeverly Martin's nomination was stalled because Republicans would not \nagree to consider it before January 20. Judge Martin, of course, had \nthe strong support of both of her home state Republican Senators, \nSenator Chambliss and Senator Isakson, and the highest possible rating \nfrom the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary.\n  The Democratic leadership sought to build on our belated progress two \nweeks ago when we were allowed finally to consider and confirm Judge\n\n[[Page S386]]\n\nMartin. We asked for agreement to consider the nomination of Judge \nGreenaway. As the Majority Leader indicated two weeks ago: ``[The \nDemocratic] majority was in a position to agree to a vote on the \nnomination of Joseph Greenaway to be a U.S. circuit judge for the Third \nCircuit. However, I was advised the Republicans would not agree to such \nrequest.'' This is Congressional Record S166, January 22, 2010, daily \ned. Again, Senate Republicans have withheld consent and have objected \nto consideration of a nominee.\n  None of the nine Federal circuit and district court nominations \ncurrently pending on the Senate Executive Calendar should be \ncontroversial. Six were reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nwithout a single dissenting vote. One had one negative vote, one had \nthree negatives votes and the nominee from Tennessee supported by \nSenator Alexander had 4 negatives votes but 15 in favor, including 3 \nRepublicans. We have wasted weeks and months having to seek time \nagreements in order to consider nominations that were reported by the \nSenate Judiciary Committee unanimously and who are then confirmed \nunanimously by the Senate once they were finally allowed to be \nconsidered. That obstruction and delay continues.\n  The American people deserve better. The cost will be felt by ordinary \nAmericans seeking justice in our overburdened Federal courts. President \nObama has reached across the aisle and worked with Republican Senators, \nincluding Senators Lugar, Martinez, Shelby, Sessions, Thune, Alexander, \nBurr, Chambliss and Isakson, who all have supported his judicial \nnominees. I wish Senator Republicans and the Senate Republican \nleadership would reconsider their tactics of obstruction and delay and \nwork with us and with the President.\n  The Republican minority must believe that this partisan playbook of \nobstruction will reap political benefit for them and damage to the \nPresident. But the people who pay the price for this political \ncalculation are the American people who depend on the government being \nable to do its job. I hope that Republican Senators will rethink their \npolitical strategy and return to the Senate's tradition of promptly \nconsidering noncontroversial nominations.\n  During his State of the Union Address last Tuesday night, President \nObama talked with us about the ``deficit of trust--deep and corrosive \ndoubts about how Washington works that have been growing for years.'' \nHe urged that we show the American people that we can work together. \nRegrettably the Senate is being required to dedicate today and tomorrow \nto freeing one of the long-delayed nominations the President has sent \nto the Senate for advice and consent. This is not working together. \nThis is yet another instance in which Senate Republicans have decided \nto delay and obstruct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the clerk will \nreport the motion to invoke cloture.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the nomination of \n     M.

Every one of these are very important, I repeat, to \nthe security and safety of our Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Patricia Smith, currently commissioner of labor for the \nState of New York, as the Solicitor of Labor.\n  We just had a vote where, again, 40 people tried to block the \nnomination of a key position at the Department of Labor. This is a \nposition that matters to workers. It is a position that matters to the \nmiddle class. It is a position that has remained unfilled for 1 whole \nyear. It has been 1 year since President Obama has been sworn in. This \nis one of the top officials of the Labor Department. It is a department \nwhich, frankly, the Bush administration didn't put much stock in. The \nBush administration didn't much care about enforcing the rules about \nlabor, didn't much care about putting government on the side of the \nworkers in terms of worker safety, in terms of wages, in terms of all\n\n[[Page S387]]\n\nthe things a Labor Department is there for--to make sure people are \nrewarded for their labor; that people who work with their hands, people \nwho work with their brains are compensated for the fruits of their \nlabor. It is such an American success story, of people working hard, \ngetting ahead and being compensated for what they do and sharing in the \nwealth they create for their employer through pay and benefits.\n  That doesn't seem to be the way 40 Members of this body look at the \nworld. The Solicitor of Labor is the third-ranking leader at the \nDepartment of Labor. She will be charged, if confirmed, with enforcing \nthe full scope of the Federal laws protecting labor rights and \nemployment rights. These are not trivial matters. They are important \nprotections that reflect core American values: fair hiring practices, \nsafe working conditions, retirement security, and the payment of wages \nand benefits rightfully earned.\n  Let me give an example: There has been a practice in northeast Ohio--\nand across the country, we find out--where, when you go to a restaurant \nand you don't pay your bill and you walk out of the restaurant, in many \ncases it is the person who waited on your table who ends up paying the \nbill. If you skip out on your bill--as has happened more and more and \nmore in this recession--it is not management who eats the cost, it is \ntypically the worker, the waiter, the waitress, the server who eats \nthat cost.\n  There are two cases--one in Columbus--where I believe it was a \nwaitress, in this case, who chased a person out of the restaurant who \ndidn't pay their bill and she was hit by a car and is paralyzed. There \nwas a case in Texas where a server chased someone who didn't pay the \nbill out to the parking lot and was hit by a car and was killed.\n  The reason they do that is they are trying to make the patron behave \nand do the right thing, but they paid the ultimate price for that. You \nknow why? Because the Department of Labor has not enforced laws that \nprotect that worker. Those are just two examples--one in Columbus and \none, I believe, in Dallas or somewhere in Texas.\n  There are only a few people who I am aware of who have expressed any \nconcerns over Commissioner Smith's nomination. The Commissioner will \nenforce these rules that simply aren't being enforced--and were not \nenforced during the 8 years of the previous administration, which \nalmost always sided with management over any real labor concerns--over \nwages, over safety, over worker concerns.\n  A handful of Republicans have voiced opposition due to supposed \ndiscrepancies in Commissioner Smith's testimony before the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. They disingenuously cite her \nstatements regarding a small pilot program that constituted $6,000 of \nthe Department's $11 billion budget. In response to written questions, \nCommissioner Smith clarified her statements to the full satisfaction of \nChairman Harkin.\n  Despite this, Republicans on the HELP Committee have held up the \nnomination process. Again, it has been 1 year and she is not sitting \nthere yet--1 year of Republicans saying no, of blocking things, of \nobstruction. They have gone so far as to call for the withdrawal of the \nnomination altogether.\n  It is irresponsible to cause a lengthy delay for a position that is \nso important. This isn't an inconsequential position that doesn't \nmatter. It is a position that affects workers' rights, that affects \nworkers' pay, that affects workers' ability to be part of the middle \nclass. This position is particularly critical to the needs of workers \nin this country.\n  We all know, in the last 10 years, until this recession, profits \ngenerally were up, the economy was growing--until this recession, until \n2007--yet workers' wages didn't keep up. Part of the reason is because \nwe had a Labor Department that simply didn't care about enforcing these \nrules. We have a responsibility to provide leadership at the highest \nlevel to ensure American workers of their right to an honest day's \nwork.\n  I am pleased the President has nominated a candidate who is as well-\nqualified as Patricia Smith to be our Nation's next Solicitor of Labor. \nShe previously served as the New York attorney general's labor bureau \nchief, where she argued and won two cases before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Her tenure as commissioner has come at a difficult period. Yet she \nhas met the challenge with great professionalism and dedication. She \nhas garnered support in New York State, where she worked in both the \nbusiness and labor communities. The Business Council of New York \nState--not exactly the State AFL-CIO--said her record shows her to be \n``thorough, fair, and judicious in the use of the tools at her disposal \nto ensure compliance with New York's labor law.''\n  Local chambers of commerce have also expressed their support, saying \nthey ``have enjoyed not only attention and engagement from Patricia \nSmith, but a genuine working partnership.''\n  She has received commendations while serving under both Democratic \nand Republican administrations. One Republican New York Senator \nobserved that she ``has worked in a positive, bipartisan manner.'' The \nNew York congressional delegation--both parties--unanimously supports \nher.\n  Yet 40 Republicans have again said no and tried to block what we are \ntrying to do, what the President simply wants to do--to fill this \nposition.\n  Let me conclude with a short story. Today, I was at Hugo Boss, which \nis a clothing manufacturer in Cleveland, OH. It is actually Brooklyn, a \nsuburb of Cleveland. This Hugo Boss plant is one of the last \nmanufacturing companies of men's suits, pants, and sport coats in the \nUnited States. It is Hugo Boss's last manufacturing plant. Hugo Boss \nhas said this is a profitable operation. Hugo Boss is a German company. \nThis is a profitable operation in greater Cleveland making suits, but \nthey say they would make more if they moved their production to Turkey, \nand that is what they are going to do.\n  I met with some of the 400 workers today. They make no more than $15 \nan hour, many less than that. They are paid pretty good benefits. It is \none more case where our trade laws and tax laws undercut manufacturing. \nThese are jobs that barely get their workers to the middle class. A lot \nof husbands and wives both work at Hugo Boss, so I am hopeful they \nchange their mind. At the same time, Hugo Boss says they are expanding \ntheir operations in the United States, but those operations are in the \nsales force. They are going to open more stores in the United States. \nThey are expanding their sales force, but they have decided to \neliminate production in the United States.\n  Again, this is happening not because they are not making a profit in \nCleveland but because they can make a bigger profit in Turkey. I think \nthis illustrates, again, that it is time our government--whether it is \nenforcement of our labor laws with Patricia Smith or trade agreements \nand tax laws--comes down on the side of the workers, comes down on the \nside of communities. We know what this will mean for Cleveland, OH, in \nterms of taxes. We know what it will mean for those 400 workers. We \nknow what it will mean for those families. It is not good for anybody. \nIt is important that at least we speak today in support of Patricia \nSmith, to show that this body will stand for workers and do the right \nthing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise tonight following on the heels of \nthree more bank closings in my State last Friday; not new banks, one of \nthem over 60 years old, one of them over 100 years old. I want to talk \nfor a few minutes tonight about the unintended consequences of well-\nintended regulation.\n  We are now going into the 26th month of the current recession. This \nwill arguably be the longest recession post-World War II America has \nexperienced. I can tell you from having gone through four of the \nrecessions post-1960, this is by far the worst of anything that we \nexperienced. We are at a point where we have to make some good, solid \ndecisions, but we have to help our economy, help our businesses, and \nhelp our financial institutions.\n\n[[Page S388]]\n\n  Don't get me wrong at the outset. I am not talking about waiving or \ndispensing or looking the other way. I am not talking about loosie-\ngoosie regulation which got us into the mess we are in: shoddy \nunderwriting and poor credit. But what I am talking about are realistic \napproaches to difficult problems and looking to our past to understand \nthe answers for our future.\n  I wish to talk about rule 114, which is called mark to market. Mark \nto market is where an appraisal of an asset held by a bank is appraised \nat what it would sell for today, and in many cases because of a \ndifficult real estate market, in both commercial and residential, those \nvalues are dramatically depressed, in most cases below the loan that is \nagainst them. So the asset deteriorates, the asset side of the balance \nsheet of the bank deteriorates, and you have difficult problems.\n  In the late 1980s and early 1990s we had a similar period of time. We \nhad something called the Resolution Trust Corporation, the RTC. It was \nkind of a bad bank that took all the assets of the failed savings and \nloans around the United States. We waived mark to market for 3 years. \nWe had a 3-year moratorium so the banking institutions and their \nregulators could deal with loans in a practical, pragmatic way rather \nthan Draconian, rigid application of mark to market.\n  Second, we have to consider doing something on the appraisal rules \nthat have been passed down. I have talked to our Secretary of HUD on \nthis matter, and I intend to talk to him more about it. I was in \nClayton County, GA, south of Atlanta, just 2 weeks ago, a county that \nhas been hit hard by the housing recession, a county where values are \n42 percent below what they were in 2006. That is a significant decline.\n  I talked to one realtor after another and one lender after another \nwho told me the interesting thing that has happened. With the new \nappraisal regulations, the appraisals on these houses when they sell at \na short sale or foreclosure are coming in at exceedingly low values. \nBut when the people have to get their homeowners insurance to insure \nthe house, they are having to insure the house for more than they paid \nfor it. Why? Because you can buy houses in Georgia today or around the \ncountry for less than what it costs to replace them.\n  When I entered the business in the 1960s, cost to replace was the \nprincipal way real estate was evaluated. Later, comparable sales took \nover cost to replace. I think it is time we look at cost to replace \nbecoming the primary mechanism for establishing lending and insurance \npurposes.\n  The short sale situation is another problem. It has taken banks in \nsome cases 10 to 12 months to give somebody an answer on a short sale. \nA short sale, for those listening, is when you have a house and you are \nin default, you can't pay your loan but it is not in foreclosure yet, \nyou find a buyer who can pay 80 cents on the dollar.\n  Say you owe $100,000, and they can pay $80,000. You go to your bank \nand say: Will you take $80,000 and forgive the $20,000 and let me sell \nthis property rather than foreclose it? Banks are reluctant to make \ndecisions and most of the time, therefore, they didn't. Those houses \nthey could have sold on a short sale go into foreclosure. When they go \ninto foreclosure, more often than not they are vandalized. Their value \ndeclines 1, 2, 3 percent a month and the house comes out at an even \nlower value.\n  To show you the value of some well-intended regulation, I want to \ncommend the Treasury because last week the Treasury issued a ruling to \nbanks that received TARP money that they must respond within 10 days on \nany short sale offer on a mortgage that bank holds. We are going to see \na remarkable change in Denver, in Atlanta, in Houston, and a lot of \nother places. We are going to see some sales that have not been taking \nplace start to take place. We are going to see some inventory \nreabsorbed. I commend the Treasury on their good approach to short \nsales.\n  I wish to talk a minute about loss-share. The FDIC has come up with a \nloss-share proposal for the banks that take the troubled assets of \nbanks that have failed. FDIC says: If you will take these assets, we \nwill guarantee the most you can lose is 20 percent on the value. We \nwill cover the other 80. But to make sure we do not get in worse \ntrouble, you cannot extend credit beyond 10 percent of the debt owed to \nthe borrower.\n  The problem with that is a lot of these assets are, in fact, \nperforming, but they have not been completed yet. To complete the asset \nso it begins to pay back, sometimes you have to extend credit beyond 10 \nor 15 or 20 percent. To have an absolute rule that you cannot is \ncausing loans to go bad or to go unfunded that otherwise should have \nbeen funded.\n  In 1974, we went through a housing recession as deep and as \nproblematic as the one today. Foreclosures were every bit as rampant--\nmaybe not as big in numbers but as rampant and as difficult. As is \nbeginning to happen now, the commercial loans began to fail in 1975.\n  An interesting thing happened around the country. Commercial lenders \nand the regulators recognized very quickly if they foreclosed on \ncommercial loans like they had foreclosed on residential loans, the \nbanking system would collapse; the asset side of almost all banks would \ncollapse. So what they decided to do was encourage banks to work out \nthese assets by going to the developer who was in trouble, who owed the \nmoney, and say: I'll tell you what. If you deed this property back to \nus in lieu of foreclosure and then let us hire you on an earned-out \nprocess so we can develop our way out of this debt rather than \nforeclose ourselves into a loss--and more often than not, probably \nthree out of every four transactions, it happened.\n  The house I live in today I built on a lot I bought in a subdivision \nthat had been taken back by the C National Bank. They had hired the \ndeveloper to do a workout. I bought it at a good price and later did \nmost of the sales in the development. It became a great development, \nand the bank eventually was made whole. The bank would have lost lots \nof money if they had to take that thing and foreclose on it and had not \nworked it out.\n  I encourage our regulators to give the great American ingenuity and \nentrepreneurship the chance to work. Sure, some of these people are in \ntrouble, but there are avenues outside of that trouble.\n  There has been a lot of talk about taxing banks that receive TARP \nmoney. I want to address that for a second because, the best I can \ntell, every bank that has received TARP money is paying it back at a 5-\npercent dividend. We are making a profit. The only people who have not \npaid it back are GM and Chrysler, who probably never will. But if we \nput that much more of a burden on top of the people who are paying us, \nand paying a premium when we have a banking system under stress and \nduress, it is only making it more and more impossible for them to stay \nin business, for them to be vibrant and come back to bring credit to \nour communities.\n  On that point, with mark to market enforced at a Draconian rate, with \nappraisal rules driving down the values of properties that are financed \nby the banks, with the regulatory environment being so stiff to \nrecognize losses and deteriorate the balance sheet, there is not any \ncredit for small business to speak of.\n  We are making a recession that is deep, that is broad, and that is \npervasive worse because of the unintended consequences of well-intended \nregulation.\n  Last, I have enjoyed working with Senator Kaufman so much over this \nissue of short sales that I just want to put in one more plug for what \nwe plugged in this entire session and encourage the SEC. In the \ncollapse that took place in the markets, one of the things that went \nout of hand was the short selling of financial stocks to terrible lows. \nThat short selling took place in large measure because there was no \nuptick rule, which was the old rule that was good for years on the \nstock market that once you had a declining value in the stock, if it \nticked up on a trade, you stopped the short selling from continuing to \ntake place.\n  We need the SEC to revisit it. They took 30 days a year and a half \nago and suspended it and it helped, but we don't need those speculating \nin the marketplace to take unfair advantage of the values of equities \nthat are owned by Americans all over this country for the sake of \nmaking a buck on a short sale.\n\n[[Page S389]]\n\n  My remarks are very simple. There are unintended consequences to \nregulation, and we need to start looking at the cause and effect. Where \nwe can find opportunities for banks to work out, for mark to market to \nbe suspended, for appraisals to be based on cost to replace rather than \ncomparable sales, we will begin to give the flexibility to the banking \nsystem to begin to recover, to stop the losses, stop the failures and, \nover time, recover our economy.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nCampbellsville University Lady Tigers volleyball team, winners of the \nfirst national title for a team sport in that university's history. On \nDecember 5, 2009, the Lady Tigers swept the top-seeded Mount Vernon \nNazarene University Cougars in three sets to win the National Christian \nCollege Athletic Association, NCCAA, Division I Women's Volleyball \nNational Championship.\n  The Lady Tigers' winning championship game capped an eight-match win \nstreak through the NCCAA Mid-East Regional Tournament and the NCCAA \nNational Tournament. Every player on the team contributed to this \nvictory. The members of this championship team are Shannon Cahill, \nLilian Da Silva, Caitlin Dresing, Whitney Haynes, Samantha James, \nJovana Koprivicia, Brooke Marcum, Caroline Martin, Renee Netherton, \nLilian Odek, and Christiana Sindelar.\n  Two players also notched career highs on the way to this national \nchampionship. Senior Jovana Koprivicia of Serbia passed the 1,000 dig \nmark early this season, proving her a crucial part of this team's \ndefense.\n  Senior Renee Netherton of Louisville, KY, passed the 1,000 kill mark \nfor her career in the final national championship match. Each one of \nthose kills represents a point for the Lady Tigers that kept them on \ntheir march to victory.\n  Winning the NCCAA national championship is obviously one of the \ngreatest thrills of these girls' lifetimes. ``I'm a little nervous to \ntake my uniform off, because once I do it's over,'' senior Renee \nNetherton said. ``I'm excited we went out so strong. It's such a great \nfeeling to be able to picture that last hit in my head. That's going to \nstay with me forever.''\n  Success came often to the Lady Tigers this season. They finished \nsecond in the Mid-South Conference, won the NCCAA Mid-East Region, and \nreceived votes in both the National Association of Intercollegiate \nAthletics, NAIA, and NCCAA national polls all season.\n  Head coach Randy LeBleu not only saw his team win the championship, \nhe also was named the NCCAA Division I Coach of the Year. He coached \nthe Lady Tigers to 38-13 overall, a program record for wins in a \nseason. This was his fifth and final season as the Lady Tigers' head \ncoach; he finishes with a 172-52 career record. Assistant coach Amy \nEckenfels, who played a key role in bringing this team to the \nchampionship, will take over as head coach next season.\n  Founded in 1906, Campbellsville University has a tradition of \nteaching academic excellence, instilling a love of life-long learning, \nand nurturing an environment of Christian fellowship. Attracting \nstudents from 97 Kentucky counties, 30 States and 37 foreign nations, \nthey have a student body of 3,000 and enrollment is increasing. \nKentucky is grateful for the presence and the rewards of Campbellsville \nUniversity.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in congratulating the Campbellsville \nLady Tigers for their impressive season and for being the NCCAA \nDivision I Women's Volleyball National Champions. Surely much success \nlies ahead for the members of this winning team.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today in the Senate to pay tribute \nto the Campbellsville University Lady Tigers of Campbellsville, KY. On \nDecember 5, 2009, the Lady Tigers Volleyball team won the National \nChristian College Athletic Association Division I Women's Volleyball \nNational Championship in Kissimmee, FL.\n  For the coaches and young women on this team, this is not just a \ntrophy; it is an affirmation that anything is possible with hard work \nand determination. These young women defeated the top-seeded Mount \nVernon Nazarene University to complete an eight-match win streak. \nFurthermore, this national title is the first national team title for \nCampbellsville University. Every single player on the team contributed \nto this remarkable feat and several individual records were set.

Mr President, I rise to acknowledge the great \ncontributions of Colorado's African-American community in celebration \nof Black History Month.\n  Colorado's African-American community has a long history in our \nState. From the days of its settlement to modern times, Colorado has \nbenefited from the Black community's hard work and dedication to making \nColorado a better place to live.\n  In contemporary times, we often forget about the diversity of \nsettlers that moved West during the expansion of the United States. \nBut, Black settlers played an active and productive role in the \nformation of the American West. Many of these settlers found their \nfreedom by moving West and became entrepreneurs, traders, and leaders \nthat helped in the formation of Colorado as a territory and State. \nNames of early African-American westerners, such as James Beckwourth \nand ``Aunt'' Clara Brown, echo through Colorado history.\n  James Beckwourth was a true frontiersman, leading expeditions into \nColorado's Rocky Mountains in the 1820s and returning later in the \n1830s to serve at Fort Vasquez near Denver. In the 1840s, he cofounded \na fort and settlement named Pueblo so he could enter the lucrative \ntrade business along the Santa Fe Trail. This settlement eventually \nbecame the city of Pueblo and still serves as a commercial hub for \nsoutheast Colorado.\n  ``Aunt'' Clara Brown is another strong African-American figure who \nfled slavery to establish an independent life in the West. When she \nreached Colorado in the 1860s, she found a place that rewarded hard \nwork. She earned her living laundering the clothes of miners in Central \nCity and served her community by helping others in need regardless of \ntheir race. She was a woman who valued a commitment to her community \nand to providing opportunity to those who lacked the resources to \naccess it.\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\n  These individuals--and countless others--are real examples of the \nearly contributions of African Americans in Colorado and throughout the \nAmerican West. Yet I do not speak of these individuals so their stories \nremain in history books or museums, but instead to highlight the \ncontinuing efforts and contributions of Colorado's Black community to \nour State. From the time that James Beckwourth and ``Aunt'' Clara Brown \nmade their way to Colorado along with other Black men, women and \nchildren until present day, there have been many other community \nleaders, public officials, and entrepreneurs who have overcome the \nstruggles of progress. They rose above the challenges of frontier life \nand those hard times of the great depression. They joined many others \nto mine Colorado's mineral wealth and forge the steel of Colorado's \nrailways to contribute to Colorado's burgeoning economy. They have \nfought in every major American war to protect a collective freedom that \nfor so many years they were denied. And they have risen in solidarity \nto defend the civil rights of every American citizen regardless of the \ncolor of their skin.\n  Today, I am proud to see Colorado's African-American community \ncontinue as a vibrant force in our State, just as they can be found in \nour history.\n  As I marched recently in Denver's annual Martin Luther King, Jr. \n``marade,'' I was reminded of Dr. King's dream of a nation where people \nare not judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their \ncharacter. We have made much progress in working to fulfill Dr. King's \ndream; and it was evident to me, that his message is still being heard.\n  Mr. President, I hope all Coloradans and Americans can reflect on the \ncontributions of African Americans of our State and throughout our \ngreat Nation not only during the Black History Month but in every month \nof the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S390-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING THE CUTTER OAK CREW\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the \ncrewmembers of the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Oak, a 225-foot sea-going \nBuoy Tender homeported in Charleston, SC, for their bravery, stamina, \nand fortitude in their response to the tragic aftermath of the \nearthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti.\n  One day after the earthquake, with just a few hours' notice, the \nOak's crewmembers departed from Charleston stocked with medical \nsupplies, food provisions, and 62,880 bottles of water. Their engineers \nand food service specialists worked around the clock to ensure the ship \nhad all the supplies they needed for the humanitarian rescue mission, \nand on January 18, 2010, the Coast Guard Cutter Oak arrived in Haiti.\n  The crew faced a tremendous challenge both physically and mentally as \nthey sought to open the port in Port-au-Prince an provide humanitarian \nassistance and evacuation for the critically injured. Working under the \njoint task force and partnering with the Haitian port officials and \nmaritime community, the Oak's crew surveyed the port and placed out \nbuoys to improve the conditions. Having spent time in Haiti on previous \nmissions training the Haitian Coast Guard members in CPR and first aid, \nsmall arms maintenance, and boat maintenance, the Oak's crewmembers \nwere able to quickly improve the situation. I am especially proud of \nthe crew's accomplishment in reopening the port to traffic on January \n21, 2010. Because of their efforts, life-saving relief aid reached the \nHaitian people.\n  In addition to opening the port, the Oak's crew distributed food, \nwater, and medical supplies and aided in evacuating hundreds of \nAmerican citizens and critically injured Haitians to the United States. \nTheir quick response to a terrifying situation saved the lives of many \npeople, and these impressive achievements bring great credit upon the \nOak.\n  It is with great pride that I thank Commander Mike Glander, the \ncommanding officer of the Oak, and the men and women under his command.\n  These crewmembers have upheld the best traditions of the Coast Guard \nand have represented the city of Charleston, the State of South \nCarolina, and this Nation with honor and distinction. They have worked \ndiligently to support the values that make this Nation great. I know \nthe Coast Guard is especially proud of the heroic actions of the Oak's \ncrewmembers, but on behalf of the people of the State of South Carolina \nand our great country, I salute the outstanding work of the crewmembers \nof the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Oak. This January, the men and women of \nthe Oak were a living expression to the world of the Oak's motto--\nDecora Fides Robur--Honor, Faithfulness, Strength.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S390-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S390-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S390-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S390-S392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   BUDGET OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011--PM 43\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred jointly, pursuant to the order of January \n30, 1975 as modified by the order of April 11, 1986; to the Committees \non the Budget; and Appropriations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  We begin a new year at a moment of continuing challenge for the \nAmerican people. Even as we recover from crisis, millions of families \nare still feeling the pain of lost jobs and savings. Businesses are \nstill struggling to find affordable loans to expand and hire workers. \nOur Nation is still experiencing the consequences of a deep and lasting \nrecession, even as we have seen encouraging signs that the turmoil of \nthe past 2 years is waning. Moving from recession to recovery, and \nultimately to prosperity, remains at the heart of my Administration's \nefforts. This Budget provides a blueprint for the work ahead.\n  But in order to understand where we are going in the coming year, it \nis important to remember where we started just 1 year ago. Last \nJanuary, the United States faced an economic crisis unlike any we had \nknown in generations. Irresponsible risk-taking and debt-fueled \nspeculation--unchecked by sound oversight--led to the near-collapse of \nour financial system. Our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was falling at \nthe fastest rate in a quarter-century. Five trillion dollars of \nAmericans' household wealth had evaporated in just 12 weeks as stocks, \npensions, and home values plummeted. We were losing an average of \n700,000 jobs each month, equivalent to the population of the State of \nVermont. The capital and credit markets, integral to the normal \nfunctioning of our economy, were virtually frozen. The fear among \neconomists--from across the political spectrum--was that we risked \nsinking into a second Great Depression.\n  Immediately, we undertook a series of difficult steps to prevent that \noutcome. We acted to get lending flowing again so that businesses could \nget loans to buy equipment and ordinary Americans could get financing \nto buy homes and cars, go to college, and start or run businesses. We \nenacted measures to foster greater stability in the housing market, \nhelp responsible homeowners stay in their homes, and help to stop the \nbroader decline in home values. To achieve this, and to prevent an \neconomic collapse that would have affected millions of additional \nfamilies, we had no choice but to use authority enacted under the \nprevious Administration to extend assistance to some of the very banks \nand financial institutions whose actions had helped precipitate the \nturmoil. We also took steps to prevent the rapid dissolution of the \nAmerican auto industry--which faced a crisis partly of its own making--\nto prevent the loss of hundreds of thousands of additional jobs during \nan already fragile time. Many of these decisions were not popular, but \nwe deemed them\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\nnecessary to prevent a deeper and longer recession.\n  Even as we worked to stop the economic freefall and address the \ncrises in our banking sector, our housing market, and our auto \nindustry, we also began attacking the economic crisis on a broader \nfront. Less than 1 month after taking office, we enacted the most \nsweeping economic recovery package in history: the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act. The Recovery Act not only provided tax cuts to \nsmall businesses and 95 percent of working families and provided \nemergency relief to those out of work or without health insurance; it \nalso began to lay a new foundation for long-term economic growth and \nprosperity. With investments in health care, education, infrastructure, \nand clean energy, the Recovery Act both saved and created millions of \njobs and began the hard work of transforming our economy to thrive in \nthe modern, global marketplace and reverse the financial decline \nworking families experienced in the last decade. Because of these and \nother steps, we can safely say we have avoided the depression many \nfeared, and we are no longer facing the potential collapse of our \nfinancial system. But our work is far from complete.\n\n  First and foremost, there are still too many Americans without work. \nThe steps we have taken have helped stop the staggering job losses we \nwere experiencing at the beginning of last year. But the damage has \nbeen done. More than seven million jobs were lost since the recession \nbegan 2 years ago. This represents not only a terrible human tragedy, \nbut also a very deep hole from which we have to climb out. Until our \nbusinesses are hiring again and jobs are being created to replace those \nwe have lost--until America is back at work--my Administration will not \nrest and this recovery will not be finished.\n  That is why this Budget includes plans to encourage small businesses \nto hire as quickly and effectively as possible, to make additional \ninvestments in infrastructure, and to jump-start clean energy \ninvestments that will help the private sector create good jobs in \nAmerica.\n  Long before this crisis hit, middle-class families were under growing \nstrain. For decades, Washington failed to address fundamental \nweaknesses in the economy: rising health-care costs, a growing \ndependence on foreign oil, and an education system unable to prepare \nour children for the jobs of the future. In recent years, spending \nbills and tax cuts for the wealthy were approved without paying for any \nof it, leaving behind a mountain of debt. And while Wall Street gambled \nwithout regard for the consequences, Washington looked the other way.\n  As a result, the economy may have been working very well for those at \nthe very top, but it was not working for the middle class. Year after \nyear, Americans were forced to work longer hours and spend more time \naway from their loved ones, while their incomes flat-lined and their \nsense of economic security evaporated. Beneath the statistics are the \nstories of hardship I've heard all across America. For too many, there \nhas long been a sense that the American dream--a chance to make your \nown way, to support your family, save for college and retirement, own a \nhome--was slipping away. And this sense of anxiety has been combined \nwith a deep frustration that Washington either didn't notice, or didn't \ncare enough to act.\n  Those days are over. In the aftermath of this crisis, what is clear \nis that we cannot simply go back to business as usual. We cannot go \nback to an economy that yielded cycle after cycle of speculative booms \nand painful busts. We cannot continue to accept an education system in \nwhich our students trail their peers in other countries, and a health-\ncare system in which exploding costs put our businesses at a \ncompetitive disadvantage and squeeze the incomes of our workers. We \ncannot continue to ignore the clean energy challenge and stand still \nwhile other countries move forward in the emerging industries of the \n21st Century. And we cannot continue to borrow against our children's \nfuture, or allow special interests to determine how public dollars are \nspent. That is why, as we strive to meet the crisis of the moment, we \nare continuing to lay a new foundation for the future.\n  Already, we have made historic strides to reform and improve our \nschools, to pass health insurance reform, to build a new clean energy \neconomy, to cut wasteful spending, and to limit the influence of \nlobbyists and special interests so that we are better serving the \nnational interest. However, there is much left to do, and this Budget \nlays out the way ahead.\n  Because an educated workforce is essential in a 21st Century global \neconomy, we are undertaking a reform of elementary and secondary school \nfunding by setting high standards, encouraging innovation, and \nrewarding success; making the successful Race to the Top fund permanent \nand opening it up to innovative school districts; investing in \neducating the next generation of scientists and engineers; and putting \nour Nation closer to meeting the goal of leading the world in new \ncollege graduates by 2020. Moreover, since in today's economy learning \nmust last a lifetime, my Administration will reform the job-training \nsystem, streamlining it and focusing it on the high-growth sectors of \nthe economy.\n  Because even the best-trained workers in the world can't compete if \nour businesses are saddled with rapidly increasing health-care costs, \nwe're fighting to reform our Nation's broken health insurance system \nand relieve this unsustainable burden. My Budget includes funds to lay \nthe groundwork for these reforms--by investing in health information \ntechnology, patient-centered research, and prevention and wellness--as \nwell as to improve the health of the Nation by increasing the number of \nprimary care physicians, protecting the safety of our food and drugs, \nand investing in critical biomedical research.\n  Because small businesses are critical creators of new jobs and \neconomic growth, the Budget eliminates capital gains taxes for \ninvestments in small firms and includes measures to increase these \nfirms' access to the loans they need to meet payroll, expand their \noperations, and hire new workers.\n  Because we know the nation that leads in clean energy will be the \nnation that leads the world, the Budget creates the incentives to build \na new clean energy economy--from new loan guarantees that will \nencourage a range of renewable energy efforts and new nuclear power \nplants to spurring the development of clean energy on Federal lands. \nMore broadly, the Budget makes critical investments that will ensure \nthat we continue to lead the world in new fields and industries: \ndoubling research and development funding in key physical sciences \nagencies; expanding broadband networks across our country; and working \nto promote American exports abroad.\n  And because we know that our future is dependent on maintaining \nAmerican leadership abroad and ensuring our security at home, the \nBudget funds all the elements of our national power--including our \nmilitary--to achieve our goals of winding down the war in Iraq, \nexecuting our new strategy in Afghanistan, and fighting al Qaeda all \nover the world. To honor the sacrifice of the men and women who \nshoulder this burden and who have throughout our history, the Budget \nalso provides significant resources, including advanced appropriations, \nto care for our Nation's veterans.\n  Rising to these challenges is the responsibility we bear for the \nfuture of our children, our grandchildren, and our Nation. This is an \nobligation to change not just what we do in Washington, but how we do \nit.\n  As we look to the future, we must recognize that the era of \nirresponsibility in Washington must end. On the day my Administration \ntook office, we faced an additional $7.5 trillion in national debt by \nthe end of this decade as a result of the failure to pay for two large \ntax cuts, primarily for the wealthiest Americans, and a new entitlement \nprogram. We also inherited the worst recession since the Great \nDepression--which, even before we took any action, added an additional \n$3 trillion to the national debt. Our response to this recession, the \nRecovery Act, which has been critical to restoring economic growth, \nwill add an additional $1 trillion to the debt--only 10 percent of \nthese costs. In total, the surpluses we enjoyed at the start of the \nlast decade have disappeared; instead, we are $12 trillion deeper in \ndebt. In the long term, we cannot have sustainable and durable economic \ngrowth without getting our fiscal house in order.\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\n  That is why even as we increased our short-term deficit to rescue the \neconomy, we have refused to go along with business as usual, taking \nresponsibility for every dollar we spend, eliminating what we don't \nneed, and making the programs we do need more efficient. We are taking \non health care--the single biggest threat to our Nation's fiscal \nfuture--and doing so in a fiscally responsible way that will not add a \ndime to our deficits and will lower the rate of health-care cost growth \nin the long run.\n  We are implementing the Recovery Act with an unprecedented degree of \noversight and openness so that anyone anywhere can see where their tax \ndollars are going. We've banned lobbyists from serving on agency \nadvisory boards and commissions, which had become dominated by special \ninterests. We are using new technology to make Government more \naccessible to the American people. And last year, we combed the budget, \ncutting millions of dollars of waste and eliminating excess wherever we \ncould--including outdated weapons systems that even the Pentagon said \nit did not want or need.\n  We continued that process in this Budget as well, streamlining what \ndoes work and ending programs that do not--all while making it more \npossible for Americans to judge our progress for themselves. The Budget \nincludes more than 120 programs for termination, reduction, or other \nsavings for a total of approximately $23 billion in 2011, as well as an \naggressive effort to reduce the tens of billions of dollars in improper \nGovernment payments made each year.\n  To help put our country on a fiscally sustainable path, we will \nfreeze nonsecurity discretionary funding for 3 years. This freeze will \nrequire a level of discipline with Americans' tax dollars and a number \nof hard choices and painful tradeoffs not seen in Washington for many \nyears. But it is what needs to be done to restore fiscal responsibility \nas we begin to rebuild our economy.\n  In addition to closing loopholes that allow wealthy investment \nmanagers to not pay income taxes on their earnings and ending subsidies \nfor big oil, gas, and coal companies, the Budget eliminates the Bush \ntax cuts for those making more than $250,000 a year and devotes those \nresources instead to reducing the deficit. Our Nation could not afford \nthese tax cuts when they passed, and it cannot afford them now.\n  And the Budget calls for those in the financial sector--who benefited \nso greatly from the extraordinary measures taken to rescue them from a \ncrisis that was largely of their own making--to finally recognize their \nobligation to taxpayers. The legislation establishing the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program (TARP) included a provision requiring the \nAdministration to devise a way for these banks and firms to pay back \nthe American taxpayer. That is why in this Budget we have included a \nfee on the largest and most indebted financial firms to ensure that \ntaxpayers are fully compensated for the extraordinary support they \nprovided, while providing a deterrent to the risky practices that \ncontributed to this crisis.\n  Yet even after taking these steps, our fiscal situation remains \nunacceptable. A decade of irresponsible choices has created a fiscal \nhole that will not be solved by a typical Washington budget process \nthat puts partisanship and parochial interests above our shared \nnational interest. That is why, working with the Congress, we will \nestablish a bipartisan fiscal commission charged with identifying \nadditional policies to put our country on a fiscally sustainable path--\nbalancing the Budget, excluding interest payments on the debt, by 2015.\n  This past year, we have seen the consequences of those in power \nfailing to live up to their responsibilities to shareholders and \nconstituents. We have seen how Main Street is as linked to Wall Street \nas our economy is to those of other nations. And we have seen the \nresults of building an economy on a shaky foundation, rather than on \nthe bedrock fundamentals of innovation, small business, good schools, \nsmart investment, and long-term growth.\n  We have also witnessed the resilience of the American people--our \nunique ability to pick ourselves up and forge ahead even when times are \ntough. All across our country, there are students ready to learn, \nworkers eager to work, scientists on the brink of discovery, \nentrepreneurs seeking the chance to open a small business, and once-\nshuttered factories just waiting to whir back to life in burgeoning \nindustries.\n  This is a Nation ready to meet the challenges of this new age and to \nlead the world in this new century. Americans are willing to work hard, \nand, in return, they expect to be able to find a good job, afford a \nhome, send their children to world-class schools, receive high-quality \nand affordable health care, and enjoy retirement security in their \nlater years. These are the building blocks of the middle class that \nmake America strong, and it is our duty to honor the drive, ingenuity, \nand fortitude of the American people by laying the groundwork upon \nwhich they can pursue these dreams and realize the promise of American \nlife.\n  This Budget is our plan for how to start accomplishing this in the \ncoming fiscal year. As we look back on the progress of the past 12 \nmonths and look forward to the work ahead, I have every confidence that \nwe can--and will--rise to the challenge that our people and our history \nset for us.\n  These have been tough times, and there will be difficult months \nahead. But the storms of the past are receding; the skies are \nbrightening; and the horizon is beckoning once more.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 1, 2010.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S392-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  Under the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, the Secretary of \nthe Senate, on January 29, 2010, during the adjournment of the Senate, \nreceived a message from the House of Representatives announcing that \nthe Speaker pro tempore (Ms. Edwards of Maryland) has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4508.

Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Levin, and Mr. \n        Begich):\n  S. 2973. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na temporary payroll increase tax credit for certain employers; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak of what I believe \nis the central concern of the American people right now, and that is \nthe issue of jobs or in many cases the lack of a job. We have seen it \nin so many ways. We have seen it in our own communities. Many people \nhave seen it in their own families. These are not statistics on a \nbusiness page. When they see an unemployment rate or the number of \npeople who are out of work, it is real life for far too many American \nfamilies. As long as the unemployment rate in America is 10 percent, \nthe American people want us to focus, as we never have before, on the \nissue of job creation.\n  In Pennsylvania we have now 560,000 people out of work as of the last \nmonth it was calculated, the month of December. That is a huge number. \nIf you look at it by percentage it looks like it is lower than a lot of \nStates, 8.9 percent, but it is 560,000 people in Pennsylvania, and it \nspiked upwards toward the end of the year.\n  I had a chance, now just about a week ago, to sit down with 8 of \nthose 560,000 people, 8 people out of work. I will not give you their \nnames because that was the agreement. I wanted to spend some time \nlistening, mostly, to folks who had been laid off, who lost their job \nin one way or another, through no fault of their own, victims of this \nhorrific recession that so many families have lived through.\n  To encapsulate what they said, it comes down to much of what we heard \nPresident Obama speak about the other night in the State of Union, as \nwell as what he said a number of weeks ago when he met unemployed \nindividuals in Allentown, PA.\n  What he saw in that job center in Pennsylvania is what I saw in \nanother job center in another part of the State: people who do not \nfully understand why they are in this predicament--people who had \nworked their whole lives, had great work records, never missed a day of \nwork for the most part, many of them over the age of 50, many of them \nover the age of 60 and feeling a kind of economic insecurity and \nvulnerability they never had felt before, but, despite all that, they \nwere not complaining. They were not pointing fingers. They were not \ncomplaining about the number of applications they filled out--scores of \nthem, 25, 30, 50, 100--and in many cases getting either rejected or \nhearing nothing at all. That is what I heard.\n  I also heard, as the President said, a real determination to keep \nfighting, to keep applying, and to keep trying to get a job. Maybe the \nthread that runs through all of them is they are grateful for the \ncountry they live in and they want to work. They don't want to be in \nthe position they are in. Many of them feel ashamed to have to rely \nupon someone else or an institution or, in particular, a government \nprogram.\n  One woman said to me, in the meeting I had a week ago--she was just \nsitting on my right. She had a lot of brains and talent and commitment, \nhad never had to worry about being out of work before. But she told me \nshe felt--and I am not quoting her directly--bad or even embarrassed \nabout having to rely upon food stamps, a program that we know helps \npeople get across that bridge when they are out of work, when they can \nreturn to work.\n  These eight individuals gave me just an insight, just a glimmer of \nhow difficult it is for so many families.\n  I received a couple of letters recently. I will not use names because \nwe do not have permission, but two individuals, one from southeastern \nPennsylvania, and one--actually two from southeastern Pennsylvania, \nwhich in Pennsylvania, generally, is probably one of the most \nprosperous corners of our State.\n  But even in suburban communities that seem well off and strong \neconomically, we are seeing many challenges for families who have lost \ntheir jobs, in some cases more than one person. One woman wrote to me \nand said:\n\n       My husband got a job at a particular company [I will not \n     identify the company] right out of high school. Left to serve \n     in the Army. Then went back and retired from there when they \n     closed.\n\n  So like a lot of places, someone works for decades and the plant \ncloses, that is where they lose their job.\n  She continues:\n\n       I got a job in a factory and worked there while starting to \n     raise two sons until they closed that company as well. We \n     both got our jobs to support our families.\n\n  Then she talked about her sons getting the benefit of a college \neducation which she and her husband did not have. But now they are at \nrisk because one son is out of work and the other one is having \nchallenges as well, despite having a college education.\n  She concludes the letter with one question, a question which I think \nis on the minds of a lot of Americans, not a question where they are \npointing a finger at what is happening or not happening in Washington, \nbut it is a question we need to listen to and do our best to provide \nanswers for.\n  She says: When is the change coming?\n  When is the change coming? I think it encapsulates a lot of the \nquestions I have heard across Pennsylvania. People are worried about \nwhat a lot of us have been talking about here; it is not moving fast \nenough to help them.\n  I point to another letter from an individual, again in southeastern \nPennsylvania. This gentleman said to me that he grew up in \nPennsylvania, had roots in Pennsylvania. He said:\n\n       I worked hard all of my life, yet to no avail. I have been \n     unemployed since the last layoff for a year now.\n\n  It is hard to comprehend that, being out of work for a year, in some \ncases longer than a year.\n  I seriously think we should start focusing heavily on jobs in the \nUnited States. We are hearing that everywhere, the same sentiment. But \nlike the letter I cited a minute ago from a woman in southeastern \nPennsylvania, this man said to me toward the end of the letter: When \nwill the recovery begin for those individuals, the people he described \nin his letter, in addition to talking about his own situation?\n  So we can't pretend that just because we passed a recovery bill last \nyear, which I voted for--I was very proud to support that. I know it \nwas not the most popular vote in the world for a lot of folks around \nhere, but we know the recovery bill is starting to work, in some cases \nworking faster than others. There are good numbers on job creation \nacross the country. Instead of losing 741,000 jobs as we did in January \n2009, we are losing in the tens of thousands now--still not good, not \nenough when the unemployment rate is 10 percent across the country, \nwhen 560,000 people in Pennsylvania are out of work. So we should point \nthis out, that the Recovery and Reinvestment Act is beginning to work \nbut it is not working fast enough. So we have to do more. We can't just \nsay: Let it fully play out and let it be fully implemented and all. \nThat is not good enough for the economic trauma so many families are \nfacing.\n  So for those who are leading lives of struggle and challenge, lives \nof anxiety and worry, and a kind of collective economic insecurity, we \nhave to act. We can't just talk, we have to act. And I believe one of \nthe ways we can act is by passing not just a jobs bill, which we should \nand must pass very quickly, but a jobs bill that is targeted on \ncreating jobs in the fastest way possible. We do not need theories; we \ndo not need some idea or some theory, untested; we do not need a bill \nthat we hope will create jobs over many years. We need a bill that \ncreates jobs this year, in the next 6 months to the next year, not the \nyear after and 5 years later. We need a job creation bill that does \nthat now.\n  I hope many of my colleagues will support legislation I have \nintroduced, the Small Business Job Creation Tax Credit Act of 2010. I \nhave introduced it today. I thank Senators Gillibrand, Levin, and \nBegich for cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  I mentioned the job loss in Pennsylvania, 560,000 people out of work \nthrough no fault of their own. That number across the country, since \nthe\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nbeginning of the recession--if you add up the jobs lost, it is over 7 \nmillion jobs since the beginning of the recession.\n  I just saw a story yesterday in my hometown paper in Scranton, the \nTimes Tribune, a front-page story talking about the manufacturing job \nloss in just one region, not even a corner, just a region of \nPennsylvania, 3 counties out of 67 counties. It was reported that in \n2005--not that long ago--there were 35,150 manufacturing jobs in that \nregion, over 35,000 jobs in 2005, and it is down below 30,000 now, \n29,400 as of the latest number, meaning that a little more than 5,000 \njobs have been lost in that period, in just a couple of years in \nnortheastern Pennsylvania, and if you stretch it over 5 years, it is \nmore than 7,500 manufacturing jobs. We know that number nationally is 2 \nmillion--2 million manufacturing jobs lost since the recession began in \nDecember 2007.\n  I mentioned the 10-percent unemployment rate, and I also mentioned \nthat the Recovery Act is having an impact. We are happy about that, and \nwe should mention and affirm that, but it is not moving fast enough. We \nhave to do more.\n  This job creation tax credit--and many others have different versions \nof it, but the version I have been working on is actually very simple. \nWe set the line of division between a large and small business at 100. \nSo if you are under 100, you are considered a small business in this \nbill; over 100, a large business. If you are under 100 and you increase \nyour payroll--when you compare one quarter of a particular year to the \ncorresponding quarter from the year before, if you increase your \npayroll in that quarter, you get a tax credit of 20 percent. If you are \nabove 100 employees and you add to your payroll in a particular \nquarter, you can get a 15-percent tax credit. It makes sense because it \nis targeted, it is focused on the problem, and it is going to be \neffective. We know from prior history--it is not theory; we have \nalready tested this in recent American history--that it is a job \ncreator. It creates jobs in big numbers fast. That is what we need.\n  We know the focus of this, of course, just by definition, becomes \nsmall business. We know that in America, most of the job creation in \nany period but especially in recent history has been the creation of \njobs in small businesses. In Pennsylvania, small businesses with less \nthan 100 employees--that fit into the definition of our bill--accounted \nfor 91.6 percent of job growth between 2003 and 2006. Almost 92 percent \nof the job growth in Pennsylvania for that time period was small \nbusiness.\n  This tax credit legislation would provide employers with a \nnonrefundable quarterly payroll tax credit based upon the increase in \nthe employers' wages paid. It would be 1 year. We want to emphasize \nthat we are focused on the short term, immediate direct benefit for the \neconomy and to individual employers. The credit would only apply to an \nemployee's wages up to the Social Security wage base of $106,800.\n  I mentioned a business of 100 or more getting a 15-percent credit and \nless than 100 getting a 20-percent tax credit. So, for example, if you \nhad a firm that would be considered a small business and say they have \na total payroll of $\\1/2\\ million--and we are talking about the second \nquarter of 2009--we pass the bill and we get the legislation enacted, a \nyear later, you compare that $500,000 payroll to a quarter in 2010. Say \nthey hired five employees. If you hired those five employees, all of \nwhom are given an annual salary of $40,000, that means you have five \nemployees making $10,000 in a particular quarter. The tax credit would \napply to that increase in their payroll. So that particular company \ncould get a tax credit to offset their quarterly taxes by some $10,000.\n  So we wanted to make this part of the jobs bill we are going to be \nconsidering very quickly. I believe the bill we are going to be \ncompleting work on and voting on will be a bill that will focus on \nstrategy to create jobs very quickly and not be a big bill that a lot \nof things get attached to that make people feel good but may not create \njobs.\n  I wanted to move to three charts very quickly. The first chart with \nregard to the small business job creation tax credit is a chart that \ndepicts one of the themes here, that this particular strategy will be \neffective. This is from the Congressional Budget Office.\n  As of January of this year--for those who follow us, I use the \nacronym ``CBO,'' but for those who do not, the Congressional Budget \nOffice. By definition, I think by acceptance of both parties in \nWashington, the CBO is a referee. When the Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO, says this is what this particular legislation will cost, it tends \nto be accepted as a good number. So when the CBO speaks about a \nparticular policy provision, it speaks with authority and I think with \na significant degree of credibility. Here is what CBO said:\n\n       Providing tax credits for increases in payrolls would \n     increase both output and employment.\n\n  That is what we want. We want legislation that will be, first, \neffective. The next part is very simple, just the word ``efficient.'' \nWe want to make sure we can put dollars in the hands of employers very \nquickly to create jobs in the near term.\n  The same Congressional Budget Office report that I cited before for \nJanuary of this year says that:\n\n       This particular policy would provide tax benefits linked to \n     payroll growth; fewer budget dollars would be used to cut \n     taxes for workers who would have been employed anyway.\n\n  So that is an indication that it can be efficient.\n  Finally, related to the question of efficiency is, how will this work \nin the real world? Often, we talk about and debate and enact things \nthat sometimes do not work as well as we hope they would. We want this \nto work. We do not want to have an employer say: Well, I have a tax \ncredit, but I need to hire an army of lawyers to interpret and \nimplement it. We want this to be a provision that is easy for \nbusinesses to use.\n  So here is a basic form 941. Every employer has to fill this out \nquarterly. And there is a lot to go on this. I will not read every \nline, but as you can see, the form captures the number of employees who \nreceive wages, the taxes and wages. The IRS would simply have to add in \nthe ability to calculate the change in the payroll from one quarter of \none tax year to one quarter of the next. So if the IRS can add a line \nor two, when this employer is filing out this form they are well \nfamiliar with--they have to fill it out every quarter--they can just \nadd in how they have increased their payroll. They do that, and they \nwill have the opportunity to benefit from the tax credit.\n  Finally, let me turn to one final theme, which is cost. I expect the \ncost of this tax credit to be $30 billion. The improvement to the \neconomy from this tax credit will more than offset the overall cost. An \nincrease in the gross domestic product will obviously increase company \nprofits, which will increase the revenue of the U.S. Government. An \nincrease in revenue will also reduce the deficit.\n  We have to invest in a strategy that will create jobs right now. We \ndo not have time for a long ramp-up along the implementation of new \nlegislation.\n  Finally, an increase in jobs will assist in taking people off \nunemployment, putting people to work. We want to have the safety net in \nplace of unemployment insurance and/or food stamps and COBRA for \ninsurance, but we also want to create opportunities so that more and \nmore people do not have to worry about having to enroll in those \nprograms and can actually be going to work every day because we \nanswered the questions that were in those letters about when will the \nchange come, when will we have the kind of economic security that \nworkers and their families have a right to expect.\n  As we go through these next couple of days--I think we are down to \ndays now--finishing up a provision or a set of provisions that will be \na jobs bill, we have to be not just focused on getting the policy \nright, we have to be focused on getting this right for real people, \npeople who are leading lives of struggle and anxiety and worry every \nday. Every morning they get up, they are worried about not having a \njob. Many of them are worried because they do not have access to health \ncare or sometimes the protections we should have on health care--\nanother bit of unfinished major business we have. But, in particular, \nmost Americans are faced with the prospect of darkness, of misery, and \nthe pain of no job at all. For those eight individuals I met and for \nthose who have been writing to me--and I am sure many people in both \nparties--we have to act, and we have to\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\nact now. Talk is long past. We have exhausted the time for just talk \nand discussion. We have to act and pass a jobs bill. A central part of \na jobs bill has to be a job creation tax credit to efficiently and \neffectively and in a very focused way create jobs in the near term.\n  I ask my colleagues to review and cosponsor the job creation tax \ncredit legislation I have for small businesses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S396-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S396]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 403--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT UMAR \nFAROUK ABDULMUTALLAB SHOULD BE TRIED BY A MILITARY TRIBUNAL RATHER THAN \n                          BY A CIVILIAN COURT\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \nChambliss, Mr. Ensign, and Mr. Wicker) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 403\n\n       Whereas Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, a Nigerian citizen, \n     attempted to blow up a transcontinental airliner, Northwest \n     Airlines Flight 253, over Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day \n     2009;\n       Whereas Abdulmutallab boarded Flight 253 in Amsterdam using \n     an unrevoked United States visa after having traveled from \n     Yemen, purchasing his ticket with cash, and checking no \n     luggage;\n       Whereas prior to the attack on Flight 253, Abdulmutallab's \n     father, a prominent Nigerian banker, warned officials at the \n     United States Embassy in Nigeria that his son was being \n     influenced by Islamic extremists in Yemen;\n       Whereas United States intelligence officials learned, based \n     on intercepted al Qaeda communications from Yemen in November \n     2009, that a man named ``Umar Farouk'' had volunteered for an \n     upcoming terrorist attack and had been in contact with Anwar \n     al-Awlaki, the same Yemen-based radical cleric who sent more \n     than a dozen e-mail messages to the Fort Hood shooter, Nidal \n     Malik Hasan;\n       Whereas in November 2009, the National Security Agency also \n     intercepted a phone conversation involving al Qaeda \n     operatives in Yemen discussing an unnamed Nigerian man;\n       Whereas in December 2009, intelligence officials learned \n     that al Qaeda operatives in Yemen were looking for ``ways to \n     move people to the West'' and specifically mentioning the \n     Christmas Day date;\n       Whereas the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) had issued \n     finished intelligence regarding Abdulmutallab by Christmas \n     Day 2009, which both the CIA and the National \n     Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) had access to, but did not \n     disseminate more broadly within the intelligence community \n     due to the absence of a photograph of Abdulmutallab, despite \n     the fact that other counterterrorism groups already possessed \n     such a photograph;\n       Whereas the intelligence agencies for the United Kingdom \n     revoked Abdulmutallab's British visa because of a fraudulent \n     visa application;\n       Whereas after Abdulmutallab was apprehended by United \n     States Customs agents and local police following his failed \n     attack on Flight 253, he spoke freely about receiving \n     training from members of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula \n     and stated that other jihadists would follow him;\n       Whereas local agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     (FBI) interrogated Abdulmutallab for 50 minutes, during which \n     time Abdulmutallab disclosed information concerning his \n     training in Yemen and the operation of al Qaeda in the \n     Arabian Peninsula;\n       Whereas after 50 minutes, the FBI stopped its interrogation \n     of Abdulmutallab, agreeing to continue the interrogation \n     after he received medical attention for the burns on his legs \n     and groin caused by the failed bomb he had sewn in his \n     underwear;\n       Whereas before the FBI agents resumed the interrogation, \n     Attorney General Eric Holder made the decision to extend the \n     rights required under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966) \n     to Abdulmutallab and to treat him as a common criminal rather \n     than an unprivileged enemy belligerent who would be subject \n     to military law;\n       Whereas the FBI agents, following the decision of Attorney \n     General Holder, read Abdulmutallab his Miranda rights, \n     including his right to a lawyer and his right to remain \n     silent, at which point Abdulmutallab stopped divulging \n     information and remained silent;\n       Whereas information concerning Yemeni terror networks, \n     terrorist training operations, and al Qaeda in the Arabian \n     Peninsula are of the utmost value to the United States in its \n     ongoing war against international terrorism;\n       Whereas Attorney General Holder made the decision to extend \n     Miranda rights to Abdulmutallab without consulting the \n     Director of National Intelligence, Dennis Blair, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, the NCTC \n     Director, Michael Leiter, the Secretary of Defense, Robert \n     Gates, or the FBI Director, Robert Mueller;\n       Whereas Attorney General Holder did not consult the High-\n     Value Detainee Interrogation Group (HIG), which, according to \n     Director Blair, ``was created exactly for th[e] purpose'' of \n     making ``a decision on whether . . . a certain person who's \n     detained should be treated as . . . a case for federal \n     prosecution'';\n       Whereas despite the fact that President Barack Obama \n     created the HIG for the specific purpose of interrogating \n     high-value detainees in order to obtain intelligence, the HIG \n     was not yet operational by Christmas Day 2009;\n       Whereas given the evidence against Abdulmutallab and the \n     numerous witnesses onboard Flight 253 who saw him attempt to \n     detonate an explosive device, it was not necessary to secure \n     testimony admissible in civilian court by providing Miranda \n     rights to Abdulmutallab;\n       Whereas even if testimony that would be admissible in a \n     civilian court was believed to be necessary, Abdulmutallab \n     qualified for an exception to the requirements under Miranda \n     that permits law enforcement officers to interrogate \n     individuals with possible knowledge of an impending terrorist \n     attack;\n       Whereas despite the fact that the United States is at war \n     with al Qaeda and deeply concerned about the operation of \n     Islamic terrorist networks in the Arabian Peninsula and in \n     Yemen, a country that continues to harbor the terrorists who \n     attacked the U.S.S. Cole, Attorney General Holder, under the \n     guidance of President Obama, subsequently ordered that \n     Abdulmutallab be prosecuted on criminal charges in a United \n     States civilian court rather than in a military tribunal;\n       Whereas under the international law of armed conflict, the \n     United States has the authority to detain enemies who have \n     engaged in combatant actions until the end of hostilities;\n       Whereas on September 18, 2001, the Congress passed a Joint \n     Resolution authorizing the use of military force (Public Law \n     107-40; 50 U.S.C. 1541 note), stating that ``the President is \n     authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against \n     those nations, organizations, or persons he determines \n     planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist \n     attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such \n     organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts \n     of international terrorism against the United States by such \n     nations, organizations or persons'';\n       Whereas following extensive debate and numerous hearings on \n     the topic, both the Senate and the House of Representatives \n     passed the Military Commissions Act of 2009, which became law \n     on October 28, 2009 (title XVIII of Public Law 111-84); and\n       Whereas pursuant to the President's authority under the \n     United States Constitution as the Nation's Commander-in-\n     Chief, as well as the Congressional authorization for the use \n     of military force under Public Law 107-40, the President has \n     both the authority and the responsibility to detain \n     Abdulmutallab and other foreign terrorists and prosecute them \n     through a military tribunal for their terrorist actions on \n     behalf of al Qaeda: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) foreign terrorists who are enemies of the United States \n     should not be afforded the same rights under the Constitution \n     as United States citizens;\n       (2) the most important duty of the Attorney General is to \n     protect the United States from its terrorist enemies;\n       (3) the decision by Attorney General Holder to truncate \n     Abdulmutallab's interrogation after only 50 minutes cost the \n     United States Government untold intelligence and has made \n     America less safe;\n       (4) Attorney General Holder should not provide \n     Abdulmutallab with a civilian trial, nor should he have \n     ordered that Abdulmutallab be advised of his right to remain \n     silent;\n       (5) to the extent possible, foreign terrorist enemy \n     combatants should be tried in military tribunals rather than \n     in civilian courts;\n       (6) to the extent that foreign terrorists are prosecuted in \n     civilian courts, they should be thoroughly interrogated for \n     information necessary to protect the United States before \n     they are provided with a lawyer and informed of their right \n     to remain silent; and\n       (7) at a minimum, the Attorney General should consult with \n     the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the \n     Director of National Intelligence, the Director of the \n     Central Intelligence Agency, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, the Director of the National Counterterrorism \n     Center, the Secretary of Defense, congressional leaders, or \n     the President before unilaterally deciding to terminate the \n     interrogation of a key intelligence source and provide a \n     terrorist enemy with the same rights as those that are \n     guaranteed under the Constitution for United States citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S396-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S396-S397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 404--SUPPORTING FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE \n COMPREHENSIVE PEACE AGREEMENT AND OTHER EFFORTS TO PROMOTE PEACE AND \n               STABILITY IN SUDAN, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Wicker, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mrs. Boxer, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Iskason, Mr.\n\n[[Page S397]]\n\nMerkley, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \nCardin, and Mr. Casey) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 404\n\n       Whereas violent civil conflict between North and South in \n     Sudan raged for 21 years, resulting in the deaths of an \n     estimated 2,000,000 people and displacement of another \n     4,000,000 people;\n       Whereas the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement \n     (CPA) by the National Congress Party (NCP) and Sudan People's \n     Liberation Movement (SPLM) on January 9, 2005, brought a \n     formal end to that civil war;\n       Whereas the United States Government, particularly through \n     the efforts of the President's Special Envoy for Sudan Jack \n     Danforth, worked closely with the parties, the mediator, \n     General Lazaro Sumbeiywo, the members of the \n     Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), and the \n     United Kingdom and Norway to bring about the CPA;\n       Whereas the CPA established a 6-year interim period during \n     which the Government of Sudan would undertake significant \n     democratic reforms and hold national elections, and at the \n     end of which the South would hold a referendum on self-\n     determination, with the option to forge an independent state;\n       Whereas, while the parties have made progress on several \n     parts of the CPA, limited national government reforms have \n     been made and several key issues remain outstanding, notably \n     border demarcation, resolution of the census dispute, and \n     certain preparations for the 2011 referenda for southern \n     Sudan and Abyei;\n       Whereas the NCP's delay and refusal to follow through on \n     some of its commitments under the CPA has fueled mistrust and \n     suspicion, increasing tensions between northern and southern \n     Sudan;\n       Whereas research by the Small Arms Survey, published as \n     recently as December 2009, shows that both sides are building \n     up their security forces and covertly stockpiling weapons in \n     anticipation of a possible return to civil war;\n       Whereas the Government of Southern Sudan continues to face \n     a range of challenges and continues to struggle with problems \n     of financial management, insufficient capacity, and a limited \n     ability to provide security in parts of its territory, \n     especially in the face of increasing inter-ethnic and \n     communal violence;\n       Whereas humanitarian organizations and the United Nations \n     report that more than 2,500 people were killed and an \n     additional 350,000 displaced by inter-ethnic and communal \n     violence within southern Sudan throughout 2009;\n       Whereas the Lord's Resistance Army, a brutal rebel group \n     formed in northern Uganda, has reportedly resumed and \n     increased attacks against civilians in southern Sudan, \n     creating another security challenge in the region;\n       Whereas the Government of Southern Sudan and the United \n     Nations Mission (UNMIS) have not taken adequate steps to \n     address the rising insecurity and to protect civilians in \n     southern Sudan;\n       Whereas, despite 5 years of peace, most of southern Sudan \n     remains severely underdeveloped with communities lacking \n     access to essential services such as water, health care, \n     livelihood opportunities, and infrastructure;\n       Whereas Sudan is scheduled to hold national elections in \n     April 2010, and the people of southern Sudan and Abyei are to \n     hold their referendum on self-determination in January 2011 \n     under the terms of the CPA;\n       Whereas the holding of these elections, Sudan's first \n     multiparty elections in 24 years, could be a historic \n     milestone for the country and a step toward genuine \n     democratic transformation if the elections are fair and free \n     and all communities are able to participate;\n       Whereas the existence of laws that grant powers to \n     government security services in Sudan to arrest and detain \n     citizens without charge and recent actions taken by the \n     security forces to restrict freedom of speech and assembly by \n     opposition parties have raised concerns that conditions may \n     not exist for fair and free elections in Sudan;\n       Whereas the conflict in Darfur is still unresolved, the \n     security situation remains volatile, and armed parties \n     continue to commit humanitarian and human rights violations \n     in the region, raising concerns that conditions may not exist \n     for Darfurians to freely and safely participate in the \n     elections; and\n       Whereas the security situation in the whole of Sudan has \n     profound implications for the stability of neighboring \n     countries, including Chad, the Central African Republic, the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, and \n     Uganda: Now, therefore be it\n         Resolved, That the Senate--\n         (1) acknowledges the critical importance of preventing a \n     renewed North-South civil war in Sudan, which would have \n     catastrophic humanitarian consequences for all of Sudan and \n     could destabilize the wider region;\n         (2) supports the efforts of President Barack Obama to \n     reinvigorate and strengthen international engagement on \n     implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA);\n         (3) encourages all international envoys and \n     representatives, including those of the permanent members of \n     the United Nations Security Council, IGAD, the African Union, \n     and the United Nations, to work closely together and \n     coordinate their efforts to bolster the peace accord;\n         (4) calls on the parties in Sudan--\n         (A) to comply fully with their commitments under the CPA;\n         (B) to refrain from actions that could escalate tensions \n     in the run-up to the 2011 referendum;\n         (C) to work expeditiously to resolve outstanding issues \n     of the agreement; and\n         (D) to begin negotiations to resolve post-referenda \n     issues, including resource allocation and citizenship rights \n     in the case of separation;\n         (5) calls on the Government of National Unity to amend or \n     repeal laws and avoid any further actions that would unduly \n     restrict the freedom of speech and assembly by opposition \n     parties or the full participation of communities, including \n     those in Darfur, in the upcoming national elections;\n         (6) encourages the international community and the United \n     Nations to engage with local populations to provide \n     assistance for elections in Sudan and popular consultations \n     while also closely monitoring and speaking out against any \n     actions by the Government of Sudan or its security forces to \n     restrict or deny participation in a credible elections \n     process;\n         (7) calls on the Government of Southern Sudan to work \n     with the assistance of the international community to design \n     and begin implementing a long-term plan for security sector \n     reform that includes the transformation of the army and \n     police into modern security organs and the training of all \n     security forces in human rights and civilian protection;\n         (8) urges the United Nations Security Council to direct \n     and assist the UNMIS peacekeepers to better monitor and work \n     to prevent violence in southern Sudan and to prioritize \n     civilian protection in decisions about the use of available \n     capacity and resources;\n         (9) supports increased efforts by the United States \n     Government, other donors, and the United Nations to assist \n     the Government of Southern Sudan to improve its governing \n     capacity, strengthen its financial accountability, build \n     critical infrastructure, and expand service delivery;\n         (10) urges the President to work with the permanent \n     members of the United Nations Security Council, other \n     governments, and regional organizations at the highest levels \n     to develop a coordinated multilateral strategy to promote \n     peaceful change and full implementation of the CPA; and\n         (11) encourages the President and other international \n     leaders to strategize and develop contingency plans now for \n     all eventualities, including in the event that the CPA \n     process breaks down or large-scale violence breaks out in \n     Sudan before or after the 2011 referendum, as well as for \n     longer term development in the region following the \n     referendum.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S397-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE FLOOR\n\n  Mr. HARKIN.

Isham, and\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\n     David Rutter signing an agreement to establish the medical \n     department of Lind University, which provided the first \n     graded curriculum in a medical school in the United States;\n       Whereas, on October 9, 1859, the medical school marked its \n     first session;\n       Whereas, on April 26, 1864, the medical department of Lind \n     University became Chicago Medical College;\n       Whereas in 1870, Chicago Medical College entered into an \n     agreement with Northwestern University to serve as the \n     Department of Medicine for the University;\n       Whereas in 2002, the Northwestern University Board of \n     Trustees renamed the medical school in honor of benefactor \n     Reuben Feinberg;\n       Whereas the Feinberg School of Medicine is one of the pre-\n     eminent medical schools in the Nation, producing the next \n     generation of leaders in medical and related fields through \n     its innovative research and educational programs;\n       Whereas the Feinberg School of Medicine supports the \n     provision of the highest standard of clinical care by its \n     clinical affiliates for their patients;\n       Whereas the Feinberg School of Medicine is cited annually \n     in national college rankings as one of the top medical \n     schools for research;\n       Whereas Feinberg School of Medicine alumni are leaders in \n     their fields;\n       Whereas the Feinberg School of Medicine is a leader in \n     aligning experts from various disciplines to create a \n     collaborative research enterprise that explores the fertile \n     discovery space between disciplines; and\n       Whereas Feinberg School of Medicine faculty are nationally \n     and internationally prominent physicians and scientists who \n     have an impact on the most pressing medical and research \n     issues: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Feinberg School of Medicine on the \n     momentous occasion of its 150th anniversary, and expresses \n     best wishes for continued success;\n       (2) recognizes and commends the Feinberg School of Medicine \n     for its dedication to educating world class physicians and \n     scientists, sponsoring cutting edge medical research, and \n     providing highly specialized clinical care; and\n       (3) directs the Secretary of the Senate to transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Feinberg School of \n     Medicine for appropriate display.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/01/senate-section/article/S398-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
