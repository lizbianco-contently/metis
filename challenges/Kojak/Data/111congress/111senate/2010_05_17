Mr. President, we all know how Wall Street brought our \neconomy to the brink of collapse nearly 2 years ago. Our financial \nsystem let traders gamble away other people's money with little risk \nand large reward. The system said to big bankers: If you win, enjoy \nyour jackpot. If you lose, don't worry; taxpayers will bail you out. It \nis quite a rewarding deal for Wall Street but a pretty raw deal for \neveryone else. We have seen firsthand the dangers of that arrangement. \nWhen the bottom collapsed, 8 million Americans lost their jobs. The \ntypical family lost $100,000 in savings and home equity. The problem is \nthat it is still the way the system works today, and every new day we \ndon't act, we take the chance it will happen again.\n  The bill empowers consumers and holds Wall Street accountable to make \nsure history never repeats itself. Ours is a strong bill. The American \npeople not only overwhelmingly support this legislation, it is \nlegislation they loudly demand. But it won't do anyone any good until \nwe send it to the President for his signature. If there is a strategy \nof delay involved in this--and I certainly hope there isn't--I have \nsaid before that as soon as tonight, we could file cloture and hold a \nfinal vote this week. This cannot be delayed any longer.\n  I appreciate the good work of so many Senators to make a tough Wall \nStreet reform bill even tougher. I extend my appreciation to the \nPresiding Officer, who has been involved in a significant number of the \namendments we have tried to work through. His experience in the \nbusiness community has certainly strengthened the bill.\n  So far, the Senate has voted for amendments to strengthen the bill \nand has voted against efforts to weaken it. Democrats and Republicans \nhave voted\n\n[[Page S3794]]\n\nfor each other's amendments. This is the way it should be. However, the \nend must come. The time has come to begin work sending this to \nconference so we can have a bill to go to the President.\n  The Senate has voted to reject loopholes for Wall Street lobbyists. \nWe rejected an amendment that would leave the door open for more \ntaxpayer bailouts. We denied carve-outs for those who game the system \nfor their own financial gain.\n  The message is clear: We must guarantee taxpayers that they will \nnever again be asked to bail out big banks. We must protect families' \nlife savings and seniors' pensions. We must ensure no bank can become \ntoo big to fail. And we must make sure the system is more transparent, \nwhich will let us rein in the risky bets before it is too late.\n  I remind all of my colleagues that the amendment process can continue \nafter cloture is filed and after it is invoked. I hope the two managers \nof this bill, Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby, can continue \nworking on amendments that will strengthen these urgent and overdue \nreforms.\n  Another reason we have to finish sooner rather than later is that we \nhave such important work to do this month. At the top of that list is a \nnew jobs bill--a jobs bill that will cut taxes for middle-class \nfamilies and stimulate small businesses by giving small businesses tax \ncuts.\n  Also, we have two supplemental appropriations bills. Senator Inouye \nand Senator Cochran are going to combine those, as the two managers of \nthat legislation, so that when they come to the floor, there will only \nbe one supplemental appropriations bill. They will join the FEMA \nsupplemental--because of all of the natural disasters around the \ncountry--with the war funding bill we also need to do. We have scores \nof nominees awaiting confirmation. We hope to be able to complete some \nof that before we leave here for the recess, so I hope both sides can \nfind a way to work together to get these bills done.\n  I repeat: We need to finish the bill that is on the floor. We need to \ndo the war funding appropriations bill that is going to be combined \nwith FEMA, and of course we have to do the jobs bill before the first \nof the month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3794-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              BP OIL SPILL\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, Wall Street isn't the only place where a \nreckless pursuit of profits has proven destructive. In the weeks since \nthe Deepwater Horizon explosion, as much as 20 million gallons have \nspewed into the Gulf of Mexico. To put that so it is more \nunderstandable, think of the Exxon Valdez. The Exxon Valdez was an \nawful spill, but it was only 11 million--I underline that, only 11 \nmillion--gallons. Already, the disaster in the gulf has been twice that \nbig as far as the amount of oil spilled.\n  Last night's edition of ``60 Minutes'' reported damning evidence that \nthe roots of this tragedy are in British Petroleum executives' efforts \nto pad their own wallets. The program was very direct and to the point. \nTheir greed led to 11 horrific and unnecessary deaths. It has harmed an \nenormous tourism industry, weakened business at countless fisheries, \nand disrupted life for many along the gulf coast. As the pollution \ngrows worse, those consequences will only compound.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress and the administration to \ninvestigate this disaster, and it is the responsibility of British \nPetroleum and anyone else found culpable to pay the price of those \ndamages. By law, oil companies are liable for only $75 million in \ndamages in instances such as these. This is clearly insufficient. One \nway Congress can act now is by raising that limit. Some believe it \nshould be raised to $10 billion. Others support no cap at all. I \ncertainly think a $10 billion cap is inadequate.\n  Whatever the final figure, the catastrophe that continues to poison \nour gulf coast is a wake-up call. We must make sure oil companies learn \ntheir lesson. While they spend record profits on finding more oil, they \nalso must find safer ways to drill and to handle it. They must invest \nin rapidly developing clean domestic energy to protect our environment \nand increase our energy security.\n  Secretary Salazar and the President deserve credit for their \ncontinued efforts to clean up the previous administration's efforts to \nput oil company profits before people.\n  In the meantime, we and the Senate must also learn from the mistakes \non Wall Street to the Gulf of Mexico. We have to work as quickly as \npossible to protect against it ever happening again.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the American people are concerned with \nthe direction the administration is trying to take this country. They \nare concerned about the government running banks, insurance companies, \ncar companies, and the student loan business. And they are concerned \nabout the way all this is being done as exemplified by the health care \ndebate in which the administration and its allies in Congress defied \nthe clear will of the people by jamming this partisan bill through \nCongress and stifling its critics along the way.\n  On this last point, I am referring, of course, to the gag order the \nadministration imposed on insurance companies that wrote letters to \nseniors telling them how the health care bill could affect their \nbenefits under Medicare Advantage. In issuing this gag order, the \nadministration relied on the flimsiest of legal arguments. It said that \nregulations which allowed the Department of Health and Human Services \nto restrict how companies marketed their products could be used to \nimpose a prior restraint on speech about an issue of public concern--\nnamely, the pending health care bill. But the communications in \nquestion were not commercial speech; they were issue advocacy, which is \nthe very type of speech the first amendment is intended to protect. \nThat is why even the Clinton administration rejected the notion that \nits Department of Health and Human Services could restrict this kind of \nspeech.\n  Nor was this the only time the Obama administration has attempted to \nuse the government to stifle speech. Just 1 month prior to its issuance \nof this gag order, I had the opportunity to sit in the Supreme Court \nwhen the Solicitor General delivered her first oral argument in any \ncourtroom. This was the Citizens United case, the same case that \nprompted the President to scold the Court during his State of the Union \nAddress in January and a case that, if it had gone the other way, could \nhave dealt a serious blow to the first amendment right of free speech.\n  For those who aren't familiar with the particulars of this case, \nCitizens United turned on the question of whether the Federal \nGovernment could ban a nonprofit corporation from producing a movie \ncritical of former Senator Hillary Clinton and attempting to air it \njust prior to the 2008 Democratic primary.\n  Most people would probably be surprised to learn that in America, the \nFederal Government could ban a group from speaking because of who the \ngroup was and because of the type of speech being uttered, but that is \nprecisely what Federal campaign finance law prohibited. So because this \nlaw constrained the exercise of its first amendment rights, this \nnonprofit, Citizens United, sued the government. The case made it all \nthe way to the Supreme Court, and because the Federal Government was \nthe defendant, the Solicitor General's Office--Ms. Kagan's office--\nhandled the case, arguing in favor of prohibiting the advertising and \nairing of the film.\n  There were two oral arguments in this case, and during both of them, \nSolicitor General Kagan's office and Ms. Kagan herself argued that the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S3795]]\n\nGovernment had the power to regulate--and, if need be, to ban--large \namounts of political speech. Indeed, the amount of power Ms. Kagan and \nher office argued the Federal Government had in this area was so \nbroad--so broad--that both liberal and conservative Justices found \ntheir arguments jarring, given the reverence Americans of all \nideological stripes have for the first amendment. But that was, in \nfact, their argument.\n  During the first argument, the Court asked Ms. Kagan's deputy whether \nthe government had the power to ban books if they were published by a \ncorporation, and if the books urged the reader to support or defeat a \ncandidate for office. Incredibly, he said, yes, the government could \nban a corporation from publishing a book--even if it only mentioned the \ncandidate once in 500 pages.\n  Not surprisingly, this contention prompted quite a bit of discussion \namong the Justices. They wanted to be clear that that is actually what \nMs. Kagan's office was proposing. So, to remove any doubt about their \nposition, Ms. Kagan's deputy said he wanted to make it, in his words, \n``absolutely clear'' that the government did, in fact, have the power \nto ban certain speakers from publishing books that criticized \ncandidates. Justice Souter asked if that meant labor unions, too. Ms. \nKagan's deputy said that indeed it did.\n  Well, so troubled was the Court by the contention of the Solicitor \nGeneral's office that the government had a constitutionally defensible \nability to ban certain books by certain speakers, that it ordered \nanother argument in the case. This time, Ms. Kagan herself appeared on \nbehalf of the government. And this time, it was Justice Ginsburg who \nnoted that at the first argument, Ms. Kagan's office argued that the \nFederal Government could, in fact, ban books, such as ``campaign \nbiographies,'' despite the protections of the first amendment.\n  Justice Ginsburg asked whether that was still the government's \nposition. Ms. Kagan responded that after seeing the reaction of the \nSupreme Court to her office's argument, they had rethought their \nposition. Ms. Kagan maintained that while the Federal law in question \ndid apply to materials like ``full-length books,'' someone probably \nwould have a good first amendment challenge to it.\n  So far so good.\n  But her fall-back position was that the same law gives the government \nthe power to ban pamphlets, regardless of the first amendment's \nprotection for free speech. This caused the Justices to bristle again. \nOne Justice asked where, in Ms. Kagan's world, does one ``draw the \nline''?\n  First, her office says it is OK for the government to ban books if it \ndoesn't like the speaker; then it says it is OK to ban pamphlets if the \ngovernment doesn't like the pamphleteer--a proposition that would come \nas a shock to the Founders, who disseminated quite a few pamphlets \ncriticizing the government of their day.\n  Not surprisingly, Ms. Kagan lost the case--and in my view, it is good \nthat she did.\n  Now, I asked Ms. Kagan about her position in this case last week when \nwe met in my office. She said she made the arguments she did because \nshe had to defend the statute. And I understand that her office has to \ndefend Federal law. But the client doesn't choose the argument, the \nlawyer does. And the argument Ms. Kagan and her office chose was that \nthe Federal Government has the power to ban books and pamphlets. That \nwas the position of the Solicitor General and her office.\n  Not only was this argument troubling to those who cherish free \nspeech, it likely contributed to the government's defeat. But my \nconcerns about Ms. Kagan's position in this case extend farther than \nthe arguments she and her office made, however troubling they are.\n  Shortly after she and I met, the press reported that she had \ncowritten a memo on campaign finance restrictions when she was in the \nClinton administration. In it, she says that ``unfortunately'' the \nConstitution stands in the way of many restrictions on spending on \npolitical speech, and she believes that the Supreme Court's precedents \nestablishing protections from the government in this area are \n``mistaken in many cases.''\n  And just last Thursday, she told one of our colleagues that the Court \nwas wrong in Citizens United because it should have deferred more to \nCongress. But deferred to Congress on what? Deferred to Congress on a \nstatute that is so broad that it encompasses ``full length books'' and \n``pamphlets,'' as Ms. Kagan put it, and probably to a host of other \nmaterials as well? One can only assume that since Ms. Kagan was making \nthese comments in her individual capacity, they provide a more complete \npicture of her views about the government's ability to restrict \npolitical speech.\n  No politician likes to be criticized in books, pamphlets, movies, \nbillboards, or anywhere else, Mr. President, whether it is a President \nor a Senator.\n  But there is a far more important principle at stake here than the \nconvenience and comfort of public officials. And that principle is \nthis: in our country, the power of government is not so broad that it \ncan ban books, pamphlets, and movies just because it doesn't like the \nspeaker and doesn't like the speech. No government should have that \nmuch deference.\n  The administration has nominated one of its own to a lifetime \nposition on the country's highest court. We need to be convinced that \nMs. Kagan is committed to the principle that the first amendment is \nnot, as she put it, just some ``unfortunate,'' impediment to the \ngovernment's power to regulate. It applies to groups for whom Ms. Kagan \nand the administration might not have empathy. And it applies to speech \nthey might not like.\n  So as this process continues, I look forward to learning more about \nMs. Kagan's record and beliefs in area.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3795-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3795]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President I, too, would like to address the Supreme \nCourt nominee. I associate myself fully with the remarks of Senator \nMcConnell, which raise an important point for us to consider. I will \ncorrect the record in a couple of situations because I think, as the \ndebate unfolds, it is important for us to base our decisions on the \nsame set of facts. These are not going to be particularly newsmaking or \nbig surprises, but I think the record should be corrected.\n  I know our majority leader, for example, misspoke the other day in \ncommenting about Justice Sandra Day O'Connor because there is some \nsimilarity--she being the first woman ever appointed to the Supreme \nCourt. I wanted to make sure the record reflected the actual situation \nwith respect to Justice O'Connor.\n  Leader Reid, I totally agreed with when he described her as ``one of \nmy favorite Court Justices.'' He said it is ``not because she is a \nRepublican but because she was a good judge.'' I subscribe to that as \nwell.\n  He said:\n\n       She had run for public office. She served in the \n     legislature in Arizona. That is why she could identify with \n     many problems created by us legislators, and she could work \n     her way through that.\n\n  For the record, I wanted to indicate her experience on the bench as a \njudge, since it is not the case that she did not have prior judicial \nexperience when nominated to the Supreme Court. She was actually \nappointed to the bench by our Democratic Governor at the time, Bruce \nBabbitt. She was on the court of appeals and on the superior court \nbench before that. She served on the Maricopa County Superior Court \nbench from 1975 to 1979, and in 1979 Governor Babbitt appointed her to \nserve on the Arizona Court of Appeals. So she had extensive experience, \nfrom 1975 through 1981, as a judge, including in an appellate capacity.\n\n[[Page S3796]]\n\n  Prior to that time, as Leader Reid noted, she served in the Arizona \nState Legislature. In fact, she was the majority leader. She had an \nextensive legal career before that. She was a deputy county attorney. \nShe was a civilian attorney. She was in the private practice of law. \nShe was an assistant attorney general. Therefore, she had a very varied \nand rich experience both as a lawyer practicing law in regular \nsituations in both criminal and civil context, as well as a trial court \njudge, which is great experience, I believe, and as an appellate court \njudge.\n  In many respects, it is almost a perfect resume for someone to \ndemonstrate broad experience and who could understand what cases are \nall about when they come from Main Street, as opposed to some of the \nmore high-profile cases that tend to come before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. By every measure, I think anybody would agree that her tenure on \nthe Supreme Court reflected those values and the experience that she \nhad when she came to the Court.\n  As I said, I know the majority leader simply misspoke when he \nsuggested that she didn't have judicial experience. I did think it \nimportant to make that point.\n  Second point: There was a statement made on TV yesterday by some \nfolks who were comparing Elena Kagan and Chief Justice John Roberts; in \neffect, that John Roberts only had 2 years on the appellate court, so \nthey are pretty similar. In two respects that is not correct.\n  First, spending a couple a years on the court of appeals for the \ncircuit court is extensive and important experience. It at least gave \nus an idea of how he approached judging. I think almost everybody in \nthe Senate who voted on his confirmation understood that whatever his \npersonal views were, he could clearly leave them behind and decide \ncases, as he referred to it, ``like an umpire calls the balls and \nstrikes.'' That is one of the reasons he was overwhelmingly confirmed.\n  I also recall that Justice Roberts' prior legal experience \nrepresented numerous arguments before the courts of appeals and the \nU.S. Supreme Court. At the time of his confirmation, he had probably \nhad more U.S. Supreme Court arguments than any other lawyer. So this \nwas a lawyer experienced in appellate work and U.S. Supreme Court work.\n  In contrast--and this is not to take away from Ms. Kagan--the truth \nis, I don't think she ever tried a case or argued a case to an \nappellate court. She certainly hadn't argued before the Supreme Court \nuntil about 6 months ago in her capacity as Solicitor General. She has \nother positions in her background. She has been a law school teacher \nand a dean of a law school. But I submit that is hardly comparable to \nthe litigation experience and, particularly, the appellate experience \nJohn Roberts had.\n  All I am suggesting is, when we make these comparisons to other \npeople, we need to be accurate about it. It is taking away nothing from \nElena Kagan, but she did not have the experience of Sandra Day O'Connor \nor John Roberts. That is something we have to deal with--something \nlacking in her record.\n  One other thing--and this is personal to me because my views were \nmischaracterized. I hope this will be seen as a favorable comment \ntoward Elena Kagan. It was reported today by Al Hunt that I thought \nElena Kagan was too young for the Supreme Court. No, I don't, and I \nnever said that. He was wrong when he reported that.\n  I said she was relatively young for an appointment to the Supreme \nCourt, and that is true. At this point, I think she is 49. She would be \n50 if she is confirmed. That is a fine age to be on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. My point was, that means, assuming her health is good--and I \nbelieve it is--she could have many decades on the Court. That is all \nthe more reason it is important that we know her approach to judging.\n  My only question about her judging has been whether she would leave \nher personal views behind as she approaches the decisions in cases that \npresent two conflicting sides in adjudicating their dispute before the \nCourt. It is not hard, when somebody has been an appellate court judge \nfor years, to see how they approach judging and whether they can leave \nany of their personal views behind them.\n  Most judges can, and that is a great thing about our system. \nOccasionally, we find a judge who has a particular conservative or \nliberal bent, and it is pretty clear they have a hard time leaving \ntheir political views behind and that they tend to want to figure out \nhow they would like a case to come out and then rationalize a way for \nit to come out that way. Any good lawyer or judge can probably find an \nargument to support a position. But that is not the way judging should \noccur.\n  My concern expressed about Elena Kagan is that there are a couple of \nthings in her background that suggest that she might have a hard time \nleaving her political views behind and approaching cases, as Chief \nJustice Roberts said, as ``an umpire would call balls and strikes in a \ngame.''\n  Remember, he was asked whether he would favor the little guy in a \ndispute or the big guy. He said if the law was on the little guy's \nside, he would favor the little guy but, if the law was on the big \nguy's side, he would favor the big guy.\n  Why is that important? We all know Lady Justice has on a blindfold, \nand there is a reason for that. The oath of office of a judge and our \ntradition in this country is for a judge to approach a case not based \non how he wants that case to come out in his heart of hearts, not how \nhe would write the law if he were a legislator but, rather, how he has \nto apply the law to the facts of that particular case.\n  Occasionally, a court will even say we do not necessarily like the \nway this case has to come out, and we invite the legislature to change \nthe law. In fact, the Supreme Court did that in a bill which I \nsponsored recently. I regretted the way the case came out. I do not \nthink the Court had to rule the way it did. But eight of the nine \nJustices believed that Congress had gone too far in prohibiting a \ncertain kind of film-making activity called crush videos where usually \na woman with high-heeled shoes is shown crushing a small animal to \ndeath.\n  That did not seem to me to be free speech, and it is something \nCongress could prohibit. But the Supreme Court disagreed. Eight of the \nnine Justices said: No, even though we do not necessarily like the way \nthis case came out because we abhor that kind of thing, it is our view \nthat the first amendment has to allow that kind of ``speech.''\n  Again, I disagree that it is speech, but I admire the Justices, both \nliberal and conservative, who decided they have to apply the law even \nthough the result was not something they liked, and they invited the \nCongress to fix the law, giving us a little bit of instruction as to \nhow we can do that.\n  I am working with colleagues in the House of Representatives to \nrestructure the law so we can pass it again, overwhelmingly I am sure, \nand this time get it right within the first amendment because I do not, \nobviously, want to violate the first amendment.\n  The point here is that Justices can rule in ways that force them to \nmake a decision even though they do not like the way the case comes \nout. Then the legislature, if it involves a law we have passed, can fix \nit. That is the way our system is supposed to work. Rather than--and I \nmuch prefer that even though, in effect, I lost the case. I would much \nrather that than the Justices say: We think these crush videos are \nterrible, and even though the first amendment probably protects it, we \nare going to try to craft an argument where we can declare this law \nvalid because from a public policy standpoint, we think that is a \nbetter result. I am pleased they ruled against my bill by saying: No, \nwe cannot do that. We have to adhere to the law, as we read it.\n  What I am going to be looking for in Elena Kagan is a judge who, \ndespite her political views--and she has been candid about what they \nare and others have been candid as to what they are. One of her Harvard \ncolleagues said her heart beats on the left. OK, I do not expect \nPresident Obama to appoint somebody whose heart beats on the right as \nmine does. He is going to appoint someone with his more liberal \npolitical views, and that is fine.\n  The question is: Can she then approach cases the same way the judges \ndid in the Supreme Court case I just described where even though they \ndid not like the result, they felt they had\n\n[[Page S3797]]\n\nto rule that way in order to remain consistent with their view of the \nfirst amendment.\n  There have been a couple of things in which her personal view clearly \naffected her judgment as, in this case, the dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool. The one case everybody is familiar with is she disagreed with \nthe congressional policy on don't ask, don't tell. But instead of \nhaving a policy that said President Clinton, who signed the bill, was \nunwelcome on the Harvard campus or the Senators and Representatives who \nhad passed the bill--by the way, it was a Democratic House and Senate--\nthat they were not welcome on the campus, she wrote at the time \nextensively that this was a discriminatory policy of the military and \nthat, therefore, the military would not be allowed on campus to \nrecruit, as were all other businesses.\n  Eventually, she had to change her position because the Solomon \namendment said the university would not get any Federal funding, and \nthey got about 15 percent of their funding from the Federal Government. \nThey finally, after about a year, went back to the policy of allowing \nmilitary recruiters on campus.\n  In my view, she not only mischaracterized the situation by calling it \nthe military's discriminatory policy, when the military is obviously \nsimply following the orders of their Commander in Chief, President \nClinton, and the law passed by the Congress, but also she discriminated \nby not criticizing or denying entry onto the campus the people who had \npassed and signed the law into effect but instead discriminated against \nthe military who at the time was fighting a war. That represents a \nmisjudgment on her part based on, obviously, her personal convictions. \nIt interfered with the job she was supposed to be doing at the time.\n  Would she apply that same kind of rationale when she sits on the U.S. \nSupreme Court? She obviously has strong personal views about this \nissue. How will she apply those personal views in cases of, let's say, \n``the don't ask, don't tell policy that may come before her or some \nother policy that she believed discriminated against gays or \nhomosexuals. She will have to somehow find a way to demonstrate to us \nthat she will not allow those personal convictions to color her \njudgment on the Court. It might be kind of hard, given it did color her \njudgment in this previous situation.\n  More recently, she wrote to Members of the Senate deeply critical of \na bill Senator Lindsey Graham and I had introduced and was eventually \npassed by the Senate and signed into law that provided a mechanism for \ndealing with the terrorists at Guantanamo Bay. We defined ``military \ncombatants'' in this legislation. We provided for a determination of \ntheir status, for a review of that determination of status, by a direct \nappeal to the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Nothing like that had ever been done, where after determination of \nstatus as an enemy combatant, those people would be able to go directly \nto a Federal court--and not just any Federal court, the DC Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, which is one step below the Supreme Court--to have \nthat determination reviewed. That was not sufficient for her. She said: \nNo, this was discriminatory; that they had to have a right to appeal to \nother Federal courts any sentencing or determination of guilt, if they \nstood trial in military commissions. That has never been the law. The \nSupreme Court has never said that is the law. Yet she compared what we \ndid in that bill to the discriminatory and unlawful actions of a \ndictator.\n  I do not like to be called or compared to a dictator, and I can \nassure my colleagues Lindsey Graham, my colleague who was primarily \nresponsible for drafting that legislation, very much had in mind the \nbest way to deal with this situation from a legal standpoint, as well \nas to protect American citizens. He was not trying to enact policies \nsimilar to dictators'.\n  In addition to the language being quite injudicious, it seems to me \nit raises questions about whether if these kinds of questions were \nposed to her in the future she could lay aside what are obviously her \nstrong personal convictions about this issue.\n  There are bound to be cases involving enemy combatants and others in \nthis war on terror that will continue to come to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Will she recuse herself from these cases because she has \nexpressed strong personal views? That would seem to me to be \nappropriate, unless she could somehow demonstrate she can put all that \nbehind her and decide these cases strictly on the law, irrespective of \nher personal prejudices.\n  I hope I am not perceived by these comments to have made a judgment \nabout Elena Kagan. When I voted for her confirmation as Solicitor \nGeneral, I said I thought she was well educated, very intelligent, very \npersonable, and I wanted her to have a chance to do the job as \nSolicitor General. I had hoped she would remain in the position for a \nlittle bit longer than a year before being nominated for a position as \nprestigious as the U.S. Supreme Court. Nonetheless, I am firmly \ncommitted to examining her record as thoroughly as possible and then \nmaking a judgment based on that entire record.\n  Despite the fact I have raised two questions, I do not want that to \nbe suggestive of any conclusion I have reached because I have not \nreached a conclusion. In fact, I am a little bit critical of my \ncolleagues who have immediately reached a conclusion without even \nexamining the record. There is something like 160,000 pages of \ndocuments in the Clinton Library relative to her record as a policy \nadviser in the Clinton White House. Obviously, some of her views will \nbe reflected in those documents and I think it is important to see what \nthey say.\n  It may well be that she represents a very tempered thought that is \npragmatic and not overly ideological and which appears to suggest that \nin the position she held, she could lay aside her personal views and \ngive good advice. It is quite possible that is what those records will \nreflect. It may also reflect something different.\n  Until I have the benefit of reviewing those documents and then \ntalking with her personally and hearing her testify, it seems to me a \nbit premature to be making a judgment about whether she should be \nconfirmed.\n  Again, I wanted the opportunity to reassure all of my colleagues that \nSandra Day O'Connor, the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court, \ndid, indeed, have a good judicial experience on the bench prior to her \nnomination. That is not an absolute requirement, in my view, because \nher colleague from Arizona on the Court for a while, Chief Justice \nRehnquist, had not had judicial experience. Every other nominee in the \nlast 40 years has. He had not. Nonetheless, he had extensive experience \nof over 20 years in law practice, both in the private law practice as \nwell as the Department of Justice. So he, too, had a very long record \nfrom which one could judge whether his personal views could be set \naside in judging cases.\n  That, at the end of the day, is the test that should apply to all \nnominees, should apply to Elena Kagan. I am sure my colleagues and I \nwill have ample time to review the report, reflect on it, discuss it \nwith her, and then come to our judgments as to whether she satisfies \nthat judgment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3797-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3797-S3800]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GLOBAL WARMING\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, if you have been watching the global \nwarming debate lately, you will notice the supporters of cap and trade \nare getting kind of nervous. They realize the political environment for \ncap and trade couldn't be more favorable--they have a majority of \nliberals in the Senate, a majority of liberals in the House, and \nliberals in the White House. But they also realize time is running out. \nThe November elections are looming, and there are a lot of people \ncoming up for reelection who don't want to go back to the electorate \nand say: Look at me;\n\n[[Page S3798]]\n\naren't you proud; I voted for the largest tax increase in American \nhistory.\n  As Senator Kerry put it, this is the last call to pass the bill, and \nthat is exactly what Senator Kerry is trying to do. But he will not get \n60 votes. He will not get the support of the Democrats in the \nheartland, and he will not convince the American public they need this \ntax increase. I say this with confidence because the bill Senator Kerry \nintroduced last week with Senator Lieberman is the same old cap-and-\ntrade scheme the Senate rejected in the McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003, \nthe McCain-Lieberman bill in 2005, the Warner-Lieberman bill in 2008, \nand the Waxman-Markey bill in 2009. Let us keep in mind that cap and \ntrade is cap and trade, and that is a very large tax increase.\n  Don't forget that the Senate support for cap and trade over that time \nhas actually dropped. If you take it from 2003 to the present time, in \n2003, they got 43 votes; in 2005, they got 38 votes; and in 2008, they \ngot 48 votes. But you have to keep in mind that 10 of those were for a \nprocedural vote and they said they wouldn't vote for it, so it went \ndown to 38 votes at that time. So that is a far cry from the 60 that \nwill be necessary.\n  The Kerry-Lieberman bill is not going to pass. However, those who \nstill believe in the anthropogenic catastrophic warming--which I don't, \nbut even if you did believe it--should keep in mind that this wouldn't \nsolve the problem. What I am saying is this: There are a lot of people \naround--not nearly as many as 5 or 10 years ago--who believe that \nanthropogenic gases--CO2, methane, carbon dioxide--are \ncausing catastrophic global warming.\n  They are still here. They still believe that. But even if you \nbelieved it, passing this bill would not help the situation because in \nthis bill, all it applies to is the United States of America. We could \ngo ahead and restrict all the CO2 we want to in the United \nStates, it is not going to lower it at all.\n  I have a lot of respect for the new--not too new, now she has been \nhere for a while--EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson. I appreciate her \nhonesty. I asked her the question back when we had the Waxman-Markey \nbill before the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, \nI said to the Administrator: In the event we were to pass any of these \ncap-and-trade bills in the United States, would it have the effect of \nlowering the CO2 worldwide?\n  She said no, it wouldn't. In fact--we showed a chart. I should have \nit with me down here right now. She said it would not because this only \napplies to the United States.\n  I contend it would actually increase world emissions. The reason I \nsay that is if we were to unilaterally do this, restrict our ability to \nbuild power in America, then our jobs would have to go to countries \nwhere the power is. Consequently, they would go to countries such as \nMexico, China, and India, places where they do not have any meaningful \nrestrictions on CO2. That would have the effect of \nincreasing it, not decreasing it.\n  I have a lot of respect for Lisa Jackson. I kind of abused her time \nduring this oilspill. I called her many times. I know she is right on \ntop of things and is doing a very good job.\n  Here we go again. Look closely at the Kerry-Lieberman bill. I am sure \nyou have seen it before. It is the Waxman-Markey bill. You remember \nthat. It passed in the middle of the night in the House of \nRepresentatives. We all remember that, passing by 219 to 212. Every \nkind of deal in the world was made and nobody knew it except the vote \nfinally took place and they eked it out. Democrats, 44 of them, voted \nno because they knew the cost of the bill. The Waxman-Markey bill, \naccording to the National Black Chamber of Commerce, would lead to a \nnet reduction of 3.6 million jobs, raise electricity rates by 48 \npercent, and disproportionately affect the West, Midwest, South, and \nGreat Plains, which rely heavily on fossil fuels.\n  The word about Waxman-Markey spread across the country and the \nAmerican people were listening. Citizens at townhall meetings expressed \ntheir outrage. They said no to a bill that would give big government \ncontrol over how we use electricity and how we live every day of our \nlives. That is what the public would get with Kerry-Lieberman.\n  They also get a gas tax or linked fee. This is Washington jargon for \na thing like gas tax: they don't call it a gas tax, they call it a \nlinked fee for transportation fuels. From what I understand, this \nlinked fee is being pushed by a select group of big oil companies. That \nis right, oil companies. I said some time ago the only way they can \nsomehow pass any kind of cap and trade is to somehow divide and \nconquer. In other words, go to some of the oil companies, gas \ncompanies, coal companies, nuclear companies, and tell them we are \ngoing to pick winners and losers, but guess what. You are a winner. We \nwill pick you and everything is going to be wonderful. The public needs \nto know a lot of big oil companies are involved. They are pushing a tax \nthey know will be paid for by consumers, the same consumers suffering \nfrom an economy with 10 percent unemployment. I will make myself clear: \nI stand with the consumers, and by that I mean farmers, families, \ntruckers, businesses large and small in rural Oklahoma, who drive long \ndistances. They don't need this tax increase now or ever.\n  It is a sad thing that we have to use those tactics. Then it is even \nnot all that smart, when you stop and think that has not worked before. \nThey tried the same thing, to divide and conquer, before. In this case \nthey brought in some of the refiners and said if you will join with us, \nthis will be fine with you. You have to raise your rates, but then you \ncan pass that on to the consumers. Then we pass a gas tax increase and \nthose consumers will be hit twice, but you will be all right.\n  That is not the way it works. The other provision is crafted and \nselect business groups. Do they think a bill on cap and trade is good \nfor the economy, good for your members? I don't think so.\n  Don't forget what happened with Waxman-Markey; some utilities thought \nthey had a deal. When the language was actually drafted, the deal made \nWaxman and Markey happy but not the utilities.\n  This is interesting, because they had the great unveiling that took \nplace last week but didn't have the bill language. It had an outline of \nsome things but not the exact bill language. That is exactly what they \ntried to do with Waxman-Markey. This time we will insist on seeing the \nactual language.\n  I remind my colleagues of a pattern here. We had the Waxman-Markey \nvote under the cover of night. We had the ``Cornhusker'' kickback, with \nthe Senate health care bill. Now we have secret meetings with \nstakeholders and CEOs. There is a sense that what they are doing has \nlittle support with the American people. They are hiding and obscuring \nand evading.\n  I suppose I can't blame them. Remember the August recess of last \nyear? That was the beginning of what we call the tea party movement. \nThis was interesting because this all happened during the August recess \nwhen those of us in the House and Senate were back in our States. The \npeople of the tea party movement were objecting to four things. There \nare four things they are complaining about.\n  No. 1 was the runaway cost of government, the increased deficits. \nLet's stop and think about it. In the first year of the Obama \nadministration the deficits increased by $1.4 trillion. That is what \nhappened the first year. That was after the tea parties, the August \nrecess of 2009.\n  The second issue then was not to have a government-run health care \nsystem. We temporarily lost that. There will be some changes in the \nSenate and House after the November elections. A lot of that can be \ncorrected. Nonetheless, those are the first two issues of the tea \npartiers who are out there today. These are people who have not \nidentified with any party but they want to save America from this \nsocialist trend we have right now.\n  The third issue was complaining about the closing of Guantanamo Bay \nor Gitmo. I look at this and I wonder, we have a President with an \nobsession to close Gitmo, a place where we have been able to put people \nwho do not fit into a prison system since 1903. It is one of the best \ndeals the government has. I think we only pay a lease of $4,000 a year. \nIt is just like it was in 1903. Here is a place where you can put \nterrorists, the terrorists who are the\n\n[[Page S3799]]\n\ndetainees. These people are not criminals in the sense of our criminal \ncode. These are terrorists. They don't fit in our court system. There \nis not an American out there who has not heard about what they are \ndoing with the constitutional rights and Miranda rights and all that. \nThat does not apply in these cases. It should not apply in these cases. \nBut this President has wanted to bring these terrorists--close GITMO, \nwith no place else to put them--bring them back to the United States \nfor either trial or incarceration.\n  At the beginning the President had identified some 17 institutions in \nAmerica where you could put these terrorists. One happened to be in my \nState of Oklahoma. It was Fort Sill. Fort Sill has a great artillery \ninstallation there and they do have a small prison. I went down after \nhe had made these suggestions of putting terrorists throughout the \nUnited States and I talked to--there is a Sergeant Major Carter down \nthere in charge of that prison. She said go back and tell those people \nin Washington keep GITMO open. She happened to have had two tours of \nduty in Gitmo. She said that is state of the art. People are treated \nwell; they don't torture anyone; it is the only safe place to keep \nterrorists; they have a courthouse they can use for tribunals that \ncannot be found anyplace else in the United States.\n  The third issue of these tea partiers was to reject the idea that we \nshould close Gitmo and bring these terrorists to the United States.\n  That comes to the fourth one, the one of our discussion today, and \nthat is the fact that they were protesting cap and trade. Cap and trade \nis a tax increase. A lot of people say if you want to reduce \nCO2 emissions, why don't you put a tax on CO2 \nemissions? Some of the strongest supporters of the global warming \nconcept are the ones who say let's have a tax on CO2. Do you \nknow why they don't? They don't have it because that way, people know \nwhat it costs, and they will reject it.\n\n  If you have cap and trade, that is a way you can pick winners and \nlosers and convince everyone he or she is going to be a winner. So one \nof the things they were protesting during the August recess of 2009 was \nthis thing that would result in being the largest tax increase in the \nhistory of the country.\n  I have often said the most egregious vote in this Senate's history, \nup to that time, up to October 1, 2008, was the $700 billion bailout. \nThat led to the AIG bailout and the Chrysler bailout and the General \nMotors bailout. All of that took place and that was on October 1, 2008; \n$700 billion to have an unelected bureaucrat to do whatever he wanted \nwithout any constraints. As bad as that is, a cap-and-trade bill would \nend up--at least $700 billion, that is a one-shot deal. With the cap \nand trade it is every year.\n  I know it is difficult for people in America when you start talking \nabout billions and trillions of dollars, so I always do my math in \nrelation to the State of Oklahoma. In Oklahoma, I take the number of \nfamilies who file a tax return and do the math. For example, the $700 \nbillion came out that would cost each taxpaying family in Oklahoma \nabout $5,000 for that. A cap-and-trade tax--they have actually done \nsome calculations, the Wharton School of Economics, MIT, CRA, and other \ngroups. The range is always between $300 and $400 billion, but that is \nevery year. That would cost my people in Oklahoma, according to the \ncalculations of CRA, a little bit over $3,100 a year and you don't get \nanything for it.\n  The opposition has only grown stronger and more intense. Thus, the \nback-room dealing and secret deals to get 60 votes are not going to \nwork.\n  I should note, if Kerry-Lieberman were successful in passing, which \nit will not be, but if it were, it would go to conference--that is the \nway things are worked here--with the Waxman-Markey bill. If this bill \npassed the House, that would go to conference, and if this goes to \nconference that means that Waxman-Markey lives.\n  We all remember what it did, the Waxman-Markey bill. The authors of \nthat bill, as well as Senators Kerry and Lieberman, have argued that we \nneed one standard, one framework to regulate greenhouse gases. However, \nthe problem is in addition to imposing what would be the largest tax \nincrease in history, these bills do not preempt other laws now being \nused to regulate greenhouse gases and drive up costs for industries. \nThis would mean there would be multiple standards, multiple \nregulations, creating more confusion, more bureaucracy and, of course, \nmore taxes.\n  But we still have a liberal press that is in denial, the same as some \nof the Senators who are promoting this. I picked up USA Today last \nFriday on my way back to Oklahoma and I think on page 3 at the top was \nthis article talking about how the lizards are going to become extinct \nas a result of global warming. They don't say ``alleged global \nwarming,'' they just say it is global warming. So a lot of people, even \nthough they realize the truth of this, because the truth has come out \nwith climate change and all that stuff, they keep reading this over and \nover so they assume it is true.\n  Today I should have been speaking in Chicago, at the Heartland \nInstitute's climate conference, but because we had votes this afternoon \nI was not able to do it. I didn't want to miss these votes. I thank my \nformer staffer Marc Morano, who will be speaking at the event, for his \nefforts at exposing global warming alarmism. At the Heartland \nInstitute, it is my understanding, is the Fourth International \nConference on Climate Change. It will be held in Chicago today, held as \nwe speak. The theme of the ICCC-4 will be ``Reconsidering the Science \nand Economics.''\n\n       New scientific discoveries are casting doubt on how much of \n     the warming of the twentieth century was natural and how much \n     was manmade, and governments around the world are beginning \n     to confront the astronomical cost of reducing emissions. \n     Economists, meanwhile--\n\n  I am reading now from their statement--\n\n     are calculating that the cost of slowing or stopping global \n     warming exceeds the social benefits.\n       The purpose of the ICCC-4 is the same as it was for the \n     first three events, to build momentum and public awareness of \n     the global warming ``realism'' movement, a network of \n     scientists, economists, policymakers and concerned citizens \n     who believe sound science and economics, rather than \n     exaggeration and hype, ought to determine what actions, if \n     any, are taken to address the problem of climate change.\n\n  They do not all agree on the causes and the extent, but it is kind of \ninteresting because one of the attendees there came out--I just read \nthis. I have it in front of me now. It is a geologist who is a very \nprominent U.S. geologist--urging the world to forget about global \nwarming because global cooling has already begun.\n\n       Dr. Don Easterbrook's warning came in the form of a new \n     scientific paper he presented to the fourth International \n     Conference on Climate Change in Chicago . . .\n\n  That is today. Dr. Easterbook is an emeritus professor at Western \nWashington University, who has authored 8 books and 150 journal \npublications. His full resume is here.\n  So today the event is taking place. On his Web site, \nclimatedepot.com, we highlight some of the details.\n  Over the next several weeks, I will be speaking on the EPA's so-\ncalled tailoring rule because this all goes back to the Clean Air Act \nand the Clear Air Amendments. What it says is, they are going to change \nthat, since that belongs to--that would cover almost every church, \nevery small business, everything in America, to only cover the great \nbig giants.\n  It is not going to work. Everyone is going to be in on this deal. \nThat would not be constitutional. I think everyone knows it. Along with \nthe tailoring rule, I will continue to point out that the endangerment \nfinding is based on IPCC's flawed science.\n  By the way, the IPCC is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange. It is a part of the United Nations. They are the ones that \nstarted this whole thing back in 1988. The problem we have with that is \nthey had an agenda when they started. I can recall, over the years, \nscientists coming to me and I would stand at this podium and I would \nmake truthful statements about how the science is being fixed.\n  I have one, if anyone doubts my sincerity when I say this, it is on \nmy Web site. You can look it up. Five years ago, I talked about how the \ntop scientists in America were coming to me and saying: Look, they will \nnot allow people who disagree with their hypothesis, who disagree with \ntheir opinions, to even be part of the IPCC.\n  Well, I was vindicated last December when the Climategate thing came \nout,\n\n[[Page S3800]]\n\nand all these people who had been sending stuff in, they uncovered some \nmemos going back and forth on how they were going to try and make \npeople believe that actually anthropogenic gases cause global warming. \nAnyway, that came at a very appropriate time. I think the people are \naware of what is happening.\n  Let me make one last comment about this endangerment finding. We have \ntried--not ``we'' but those who are promoting the idea of the \nanthropogenic gases cause global warming, they have been trying to \nintroduce the bills to have a cap-and-trade system for the United \nStates. They have been doing this now about for about 9 years. It has \nnot worked.\n  So President Obama has stated: All right, if the House and the Senate \nare not going to vote to do this, we will do it administratively. All \nwe have to do is have an endangerment finding, which we could \ninfluence, and once the endangerment finding is there, then that would \ninclude, with the real pollutants, SOX, NOX, and \nmercury, CO2. If they do that, then they can start \nregulating CO2.\n  Well, it is not quite that easy. Lisa Jackson, I have already said \nsome nice things about her, and I appreciated her honesty in response \nto this question. Right before Copenhagen, I suspected that the Obama \nadministration was going to have an endangerment finding. When they \ndid, I knew it had to be based on science, so I asked her: What science \nwould this, by and large, be based on, if you have the endangerment \nfinding.\n  She said the IPCC. Well, wait a minute. That is the same science \nthat, through Climategate, has been totally rebuffed and no longer is \nlegitimate, either in reality or in the eyes of the American people and \npeople around the world.\n  So while I am concerned obviously that we should try to do something \nsuch as this through an endangerment finding, do administratively what \nhe is unable to do through the House and Senate, that is not going to \nwork. So I would only say, I know all the Tea Party people are still \nout there. Keep in mind, you lost your fight with the government-run \nhealth care, you lost your fight with the huge deficit, and so far we \nhave not lost on the closing of Gitmo. I think we will be able to keep \nit open. But the one issue that is up for grabs right now is this \nendangerment finding.\n  Let's keep reminding all the people whom you meet with prior to the \nelections of November, and particularly during the upcoming August \nrecess, that a cap-and-trade system would end up being the largest tax \nincrease in the history of America and it would happen every year and \nit would not accomplish anything.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak \nas in morning business but on an amendment that I will bring up later \non the bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3800-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3800-S3801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have had some concerns over the consumer \nprotection part of the financial reform bill, mostly because I do not \nthink there are very many limitations on it. Particularly in the area \nof personal privacy, I have some major concerns. So I have developed an \namendment that I think will solve that. It is the kind of amendment I \nhave often seen brought up by both sides of the aisle to make sure no \nagency is going through your personal finances without your permission \nor any other thing that is personal.\n  So if you think full-body scans at the airport security is bad, they \ndo pale in comparison to the consumer protection provisions in the \nfinancial regulatory bill we are debating. Even if you are okay with \nthe heightened airport security measures, will you be OK with a full \nscan of your financial records?\n  If left alone, this bill will set up a Federal bureaucracy that will \nbe able to comb through the personal financial records of millions of \nAmericans in the name of protecting consumers.\n  Also, in the name of protecting us from ourselves, this bill would \nrequire banks to keep and maintain records of all bank account activity \nand financial activity of their clients for at least 3 years, while \nalso requiring this information to be sent regularly to the bureau for \nsafekeeping.\n  I have serious concerns about our government collecting information \non the daily activities of its citizens and equal concerns about the \ngovernment approving or disapproving the financial choices of its \ncitizens. For those who agree with me, and even those who disagree with \nme on the consequences or meaning of the language in this bill, I have \na straightforward and easy solution.\n  My amendment, 4018, simply says that if the new bureau created in \nthis bill wants to investigate a consumer's individual transactions, \nthen the bureau must get written permission from that individual. All \nthis means is that the bureau cannot investigate someone's banking \nactivities or credit card purchases without that person's permission.\n  The bill is simply that. This is one page going into thousands of \npages. It says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any \n     provision of the enumerated consumer laws or any provision of \n     Federal law, the Bureau may not investigate an individual \n     transaction to which a consumer is a party without the \n     written permission of that consumer.\n\n  It is pretty straightforward. It makes sure they aren't going to \ninvestigate a consumer's individual transactions without written \npermission from that individual, and they can't investigate someone's \nbanking activities or their credit card purchases without that person's \npermission.\n  My amendment would also make it so that the government can't watch \nover my financial transactions without my saying so or without you \nsaying so on yours. My amendment gives consumers a choice. I don't \nthink the bureau should be allowed to look over my credit card \nstatement to see if I am spending too much money. I don't think the \nbureau should be allowed to monitor my purchases and note that I bought \na new car, a new boat, or a gun.\n  I recognize there are consumers out there who may want the government \nin their lives, monitoring their transactions. I don't claim to \nunderstand that desire. But my amendment would not take away their \nchoice in the matter. In fact, as a consumer, if I get into credit card \ntrouble and want the bureau's help, all I have to do is contact the \nbureau and give them permission to look at my financial documents. My \namendment would also give consumers that ability. As long as the bureau \nhas my written permission as a consumer, they can look at my financial \npast, present, and future.\n  Our State offices have that kind of a procedure when they do case \nwork for individuals. Our State offices have a process where they will \nlook into problems that an individual is having with the Federal \nGovernment. But in order to do that, they have to get a signed privacy \nrelease. That is so we can't just be looking into constituents' \nproblems that we think might be a problem for them without their \nknowledge or their permission. That is all I am doing with this \ngovernment bureau, is making sure the consumer knows that bureau will \nbe going through their records with their permission.\n  In reality, this bill encourages consumers to rely on the government \nto protect them from bad decisions instead of empowering due diligence. \nThe role of the Federal Government should not be to stand over our \nshoulders telling us if our decisions are right or good. I was here on \nthe Senate floor just a few short days ago saying that you and I have \nthe inherent freedom to make choices, even the freedom to make bad \nchoices. In America, that is the way it works. Big Brother is not \nallowed to hang over your shoulder to decide whether you are making a \npoor decision.\n  Because of this bill and the actions of the current administration, \npeople are more concerned about their freedoms right now than they ever \nhave been,\n\n[[Page S3801]]\n\nand this underlying bill--specifically title X, with its ironic name, \n``consumer protection''--would take away those freedoms without this \namendment.\n  The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau created through this bill \nwould suddenly become the most powerful agency within the Federal \nGovernment. By placing this bureau within the Federal Reserve, \nCongress's last ability to oversee this agency would be when the \ndirector of the bureau is nominated by the President and the Senate \ngets to vet that candidate. That is it. Congress would have no \noversight of the bureau's budget. Congress would have no oversight of \nthe rules created by the bureau either.\n  By the way, this bureau would not only have the authority to create \nits own rules for banks and consumers to follow, it would have the \nauthority to enforce those rules as well. No other agency has that kind \nof unchecked power. Let me tell my colleagues, unchecked power does not \nlend itself to accountability.\n  Why am I so concerned about this supposed consumer protection bureau? \nI am concerned about our freedoms. I know the Federal Government should \nnot operate with the belief that it always knows best. Protecting \nconsumers doesn't always mean naming advocates to work on their behalf. \nIt also means allowing them the freedom and power to advocate for \nthemselves.\n  I mentioned this earlier, but I want to illustrate an example of why \nI am concerned about this bureau's unchecked power and why every \ncitizen in the country should be up in arms, beating down the doors of \nCongress to keep big government powers from getting even bigger in \ntheir lives. The example I am about to give would be small compared to \nthe powers of this proposed bureau.\n  Let me tell my colleagues, this is not a small issue to the public. \nNot too long ago, the Transportation Security Administration, TSA, \nannounced its intention to put full body scanning into major airports. \nLet me remind my colleagues, this was not even in every major airport, \nonly a few. Many may not have seen one of these scanning machines. \nTravelers go into a three-sided piece of equipment fully clothed, and \nthe machine essentially creates an x-ray-like scan of the traveler. The \nresulting image from the scan can be used to determine whether someone \nis carrying an explosive, has objects hidden under their clothing, or \nmerely had a joint replaced. This new step in security was all done in \nthe name of protecting citizens from terrorists. This new measure was \nfor our physical safety.\n  I have heard from hundreds of Wyoming citizens and from hundreds of \ncitizens across the country desperate not to have the government \nintrude into their lives even in the name of physical safety from \nterrorism. There was such a rush of emotion from these folks, anger at \nthe inconvenience and intrusion, nervousness and anxiety that the \ngovernment would be able to image them for 30 seconds or the \npossibility that the government could keep the scanned image in a file. \nI even had some of the more middle-of-the-road folks tell me they just \nwanted a choice of whether to have the full body scan or simply an in-\nperson screening. That is what is done over most of the country.\n  My point with this story is that with TSA screening, we are talking \nabout a single image of a person as they travel through the Nation's \nairports. What the bureau of consumer protection proposes to do in the \nname of financial security is not just a snapshot of us during a single \nday of travel. What the bureau proposes to do is scrutinize the \ntransactions of our daily lives, our spending habits, monitor our \nfinancial decisions as we plan for retirement, as we plan and spend for \nour families, and, as consumers, as we make choices on loans for \neducation, vehicles, homes, and any other expenses. This isn't a single \nstep encroaching on privacy like a body scan image. What the bureau \nproposes to do skips over the privacy boundary. It is not a single \nscan; it is a life audit.\n  This bureau may create some much needed protections for consumers, \nbut it could also go much further. Without my amendment, the bureau \nwill be required to collect daily transactional information on every \nconsumer. The government would see every time you needed money for a \ncollege loan, for $20 from the nearest ATM. The bureau would require \nyour community bank to not only keep all the information on file but to \nregularly share that data with the government.\n  Some may say they don't care if the government knows they buy \ngroceries at Safeway every Tuesday, but I daresay allowing the \ngovernment to assess and analyze every transaction could easily \nescalate beyond mundane details and consumer protection to truly having \nBig Brother watching over us. You may not care about the government \nknowing your shopping habits or how and when you fill your car with \ngas, but you will care if the government has the ability to say how, \nwhen, and why you spend your own money.\n  We already give the government control of our tax dollars. I would \nsay that isn't going so well for us. A $12 trillion, almost $13 \ntrillion deficit shows this. So why should the public be OK with \nallowing the Federal Government to watch over our shoulders, saying \nwhether our financial decisions are OK? The point is that the Federal \nGovernment should not have this power, but this bill will be giving it \nunless we have this amendment.\n  I have risen to bring light and awareness to the additional, enormous \nunchecked power that would be given to the bureau of consumer \nprotection in the name of protecting consumers. This power would be \ngiven not in the name of protecting us from physical threat or harm but \nin the name of making decisions for us.\n  I offer another choice to my colleagues and to the people. This \nchoice allows consumers to let the bureau into their personal lives if \nthey so choose. My amendment would not stop the bureau from existing. \nMy amendment would not prevent the bureau from assisting consumers with \ntheir finances or debt. My amendment would simply require the bureau to \nget written permission from consumers. It is that simple. I urge \ncolleagues to consider the amendment so that we are empowering \nconsumers, not perpetuating big government growth in the name of \nprotecting us from ourselves.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Shelby be added as a cosponsor \nto the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I continue to have deep concerns about the \nlegislation we are debating. I mentioned some of those concerns last \nweek, including the bailout provisions that still effectively remain in \nthe bill and the so-called orderly liquidation process that could give \nsome firms special treatment outside of the Bankruptcy Code.\n  I repeat my appreciation to Senator Sessions from Alabama for \noffering his amendment last week which would have corrected that. \nUnfortunately, it was defeated last Thursday, as most of the amendments \nhave been.\n  At this time, I offer another amendment that would protect the \nAmerican taxpayer from bailing out foreign governments. We all know \nthat this scene, which we saw displayed across cable television and in \nthe newspapers, is being played out now in Greece where literally a \nGreek tragedy is unfolding.\n  How did this happen? First, Greece's public debt was 115 percent of \nits gross domestic product, according to the International Monetary \nFund. Putting that in context, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice report of March 2010, the public debt of the United States is \ncurrently 53 percent of our gross domestic product. However, the \nCongressional Budget Office, the official scorekeeper of the \ngovernment, says, all else being equal--in other words, if nothing else \nhappens--the baseline estimate for that debt in ten years will be 67.5 \npercent, up from 53 percent last year. Under the President's proposed \nbudget, that number skyrockets to 90 percent of gross domestic product \nby 2020. While some may say here in America we are in relatively good \nshape because our debt is only 53 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that under the \nPresident's own budget, that will soar from 53 percent of the gross \ndomestic product to 90 percent of GDP by the year 2020, which makes \nthat 115 percent number for Greece look not so much higher than what \nthe American number will be come 2020.\n  Deficits are high in Greece for the same reason they are too high in \nthe United States--too much government and too much reckless spending.\n  Similar to the U.S. Government, the Greek Government has been \nfinancing its operations by borrowing money. But over the last few \nweeks, the capital markets made clear investors--the people who buy \nthat debt--do not trust the Greeks to be able to pay it back, hence, \nthe need for these extraordinary bailouts by the International Monetary \nFund.\n  But, again, the comparison is unavoidable. What happens if the United \nStates does not change its current trajectory of going to 90 percent of \nour gross domestic product when it comes to our debt by 2020, as \nprojected by the Congressional Budget Office? What do we do if we \ncontinue to borrow and spend? What do we do if China, for example--\nwhich is the primary country that buys that debt--either refuses to \ncontinue to finance our deficit spending and our debt or demands higher \ninterest rates.\n  What is happening now in Greece with these kinds of demonstrations I \ndo not think it takes a great imagination to say could happen in \nAmerica if we are not more responsible in dealing with our out-of-\ncontrol spending, our out-of-control debt--unless we say no to the \nPresident's proposed spending budget, which would grow that to 90 \npercent of our gross domestic product by 2020.\n  But back to my amendment. Why is it people are so upset about bailing \nout Greece, using the International Monetary Fund to do so? Well, I am \nreferring to an article from the Associated Press entitled ``Europe \nbristles at paying for Greek retirement.'' Let me read a couple \nparagraphs:\n\n       In Greece, trombone players and pastry chefs get to retire \n     as early at 50 on grounds their work causes them late career \n     breathing problems. Hairdressers enjoy the same perk thanks \n     to the dyes and other chemicals they rub into people's \n     scalps.\n\n  Skipping down a couple paragraphs:\n\n       Like many [European Union] countries, the general \n     retirement age in Greece is 65, although the actual average \n     [retirement age] is about 61. However, the deeply fragmented \n     system also provides for early retirement--as early as 55 for \n     men and 50 for women--in many professions classified as \n     ``arduous and unhealthy.''\n\n  So we see why people are reluctant, to say the least, to bail out \nGreece because of these reckless pensions that facilitate these early \nretirements under the thinnest of pretenses. But we know the European \nUnion and the International Monetary Fund recently approved a $145 \nbillion bailout for the Greek Government. Mr. President, $40 billion of \nthat represents loan guarantees from the International Monetary Fund. \nSince the United States has funded about 17 percent of the IMF's \nbudget, our share--that is, the American taxpayers' share--of that \nbailout would be at least $7 billion. That is right, U.S. taxpayers are \non the hook to help bail out Greece to the tune of at least $7 billion.\n  We know a $1 trillion bailout fund is being discussed for other \nEuropean nations. While the details are being discussed, once again, \nU.S. taxpayer funds could make their way through the International \nMonetary Fund to bail out irresponsible foreign governments.\n  As CNBC reported on Tuesday:\n\n       U.S. taxpayers could be on the hook for $50 billion or more \n     as part of the European debt bailout, which is likely to be a \n     close cousin to the strategy used to rescue the American \n     financial system.\n\n  CNBC went on to say:\n\n       The entire bailout package has been nicknamed ``Le Tarp'' \n     for its similarity to the Troubled Asset Relief Program that \n     bailed out US companies with taxpayer-backed loans.\n\n  They are calling this bailout fund Le Tarp for a reason. Once again, \nbillions\n\n[[Page S3803]]\n\nof dollars will be in the hands of government bureaucrats, and the U.S. \ntaxpayer will be asked simply to trust those so-called experts who have \nlet us down before and who seem to be making much of this up as they go \nalong.\n  It is no surprise that 63 percent of respondents to a recent \nRasmussen poll have said they oppose using U.S. taxpayer funds to bail \nout foreign governments. I am actually surprised it is only 63 percent.\n  American taxpayers should not be involved in bailing out foreign \ngovernments. As George Will pointed out last week in the Washington \nPost, Greece has a gross domestic product that is less than the Dallas-\nFort Worth metropolitan area's. Greece is simply not, under any stretch \nof the imagination, too big to fail. If Greece defaults on its debt, \nthen the European banks that bought the debt need do write it off. If \nthe European governments want to bail out their banks or prop up their \ncurrency, let them do it without help from the American taxpayer.\n  American taxpayers simply should not be involved in this process. Our \nfirst priority should be to unwind all the bailouts we have, thanks to \nthis administration, not to create new ones overseas.\n  Moreover, there is a good chance this Greek bailout is not even going \nto work; in other words, that we will not even be able to get our money \nback. It will not be a loan; it will be throwing more good money after \nbad.\n  The chief executive of the Deutsche Bank doubts the Greeks can even \nrepay this debt. We have all seen pictures of these protests that have \ncontinued under the ``austerity measures'' that have now been imposed \nthat the government was forced to make in order to secure the deal.\n  As one blogger recently put it:\n\n       It was the Greeks who gave us the word for democracy. They \n     also gave us the words for demagoguery, tyranny, crisis and \n     chaos.\n\n  That is what this photograph looks like: chaos as a result of \nuncontrolled spending and out-of-control debt.\n  What we are seeing is what Robert Samuelson calls the ``Death Spiral \nof the [Modern] Welfare State.'' He said: ``The reckoning has arrived \nin Greece, but it awaits most wealthy countries,'' including, I might \nadd, the United States of America--unless we change our ways.\n  The President of the European Council put it this way:\n\n       We can't finance our social model anymore--with 1 percent \n     structural growth we can't play a role in the world.\n\n  What my amendment--which will be among the four amendments voted on \nwhen we gather again at 5:30--does is, it says the American people are \ntired of bailouts, and Congress should protect the American taxpayer \nfrom bailing out foreign governments, particularly when we cannot get \nour money back afterwards.\n  My amendment would bring needed transparency and accountability to \nwhat the International Monetary Fund is doing with American taxpayer \ndollars, including the roughly $60 billion our country has already \nprovided to the IMF over the years.\n  Specifically, this amendment would require the administration to look \nmore closely at any proposed IMF loan to see if that country's debt \nexceeds its GDP; and when it does, as Greece's does, to certify to \nCongress that the loan will be repaid.\n  If the U.S. Executive Director of the IMF cannot certify to Congress \nthat the loan will be repaid, my amendment would require the President \nof the United States to direct the Executive Director to vote against \nthe bailout by the International Monetary Fund.\n  The logic of this amendment could not be more clear: Any country that \nowes more money than its entire economy produces is, by definition, a \nvery bad credit risk, and the United States should not be loaning money \nto such a nation, unless we are absolutely confident our taxpayers are \nnot subsidizing failure and will ultimately get their money back.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. We must act \nquickly, so the amendment will apply to future bailouts of nations like \nGreece that have spent way beyond their means.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3746 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words on the \namendment I have pending and that we will be voting on in the next 2 \ndays that will restore the historic power of States to control interest \nrates they charge to their citizens.\n  One of the things I hear most about when I am home in Rhode Island is \nfrom folks who can't understand why their credit card interest rate \nsuddenly jumped to over 30 percent. For a long time, the tricks and the \ntraps in those long credit card contracts pitched people into these \npenalty rates. I think a lot of people don't read all the fine print \nand aren't sure exactly what it means. We have individual consumers up \nagainst the craftiest lawyers the credit card industry can hire, and \nthe result is when they trigger one of these traps and they get caught \nby one of these little tricks, they end up being kicked into a very \nhigh penalty rate.\n  Recently, after the credit card reform bill passed a year ago, we saw \nthe credit card industry actually not even waiting for the tricks or \ntraps to be triggered. They just began to spontaneously raise people's \ninterest rates; again, very often over 30 percent. The Presiding \nOfficer and I are both of an age where we can remember a time when \ninterest rates of that level would have been a matter to refer to the \nauthorities, not a commonplace business practice of our biggest \nindustries. When we think of the pain and the suffering and the \neconomic stress families get put under when they fall into these \nburdensome, exorbitant penalty rates--I think we should do something \nabout it. My amendment would allow us to do just that.\n  It doesn't take any new risks. It doesn't create dramatic new policy. \nIt does things that my friends on the other side of the aisle have been \nsupportive of over the years. It honors the independent authority of \nStates to make decisions to protect their citizens. It supports \nconsumers--the little guy--against the huge corporations, and it puts \nour local banks on a level playing field with these big out-of-State \nbanks.\n  We got here because of an unusual loophole that the Supreme Court \nopened 30 years ago. We did not have a debate on the Senate floor \nsaying: What should our policy be? Should we take away the rights of \nStates to protect their consumers, to protect their citizens from \nexorbitant out-of-State interest rates? We never had that discussion. \nThis happened inadvertently.\n  It happened as a result of a Supreme Court decision back in 1978 that \nsaid when a bank in one State and a consumer in another State have a \ntransaction, it will be the laws of the home State of the bank that \ngovern. It didn't look like a very big deal at the time. It didn't take \nthe crafty bank lawyers long to see that it opened a very tricky \nloophole, and they could move to the States in this country that had \nthe worst consumer protection legislation, and from there--from those \noutposts of the worst consumer protection--they could market into other \nStates. The fact that the other State they were marketing into had good \nconsumer protections and protected those State's citizen didn't matter. \nIt didn't help because of the Supreme Court decision.\n  I submit if, as a Senate, we were to have debated that proposition, \nthere would not have been many votes for the outcome. The notion of the \npolicy of the United States on protecting consumers from interest rates \nshould be that the rules of the worst State in the country trump every \nother State is a rule that nobody in their right mind would vote for. \nBut because of this inadvertent Supreme Court loophole and because of \nthe crafty work of these big national banks and their lawyers, we are \nnow in that exact situation--a situation that none of us would ever \nhave voted for and that we shouldn't tolerate now.\n  So I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to vote for \nthis amendment. I wish to thank Senator Cochran from the other side of \nthe aisle for cosponsoring it, and I wish to ask his colleagues in the \nRepublican caucus to join him in supporting it.\n\n[[Page S3804]]\n\n  This bill we are looking at right now is very esoteric and technical. \nIt is preventive medicine. It engages in things such as trying to \nrebuild the Glass-Steagall firewall, trying to promptly regulate \ncollateralized debt obligations, trying to put appropriate leverage \nlimitations on banks. That is all pretty arcane stuff.\n  The American people want this reform, and it should happen. But here \nis a deliverable they can take right home. They will see a difference \nas soon as their States respond. They can be protected from these \noutrageous 30-percent interest rates as a result of this bill. It is \nnot a big Federal Government that is coming to do this; it is the State \ngovernments, State by State. Indeed, if a State wants to have no \nconsumer protections and have its citizens vulnerable to these \npredatory and exorbitant credit card deals, fine. They can do that. \nThere is nothing in my amendment that requires a State to do anything. \nIt just empowers them with the same power they had at the founding, \nwith the same power they had for 202 years, until 1978 came along and \nthis peculiar Supreme Court decision.\n  So I think it will be a good argument to go home with, and as voters \nin this country look at what Congress has done leading up to the \nNovember elections, to be able to say: You know what. Those 30-percent \nrates we never saw when we were children and that our parents never had \nto pay, the rates that you as a head of a family are now having to deal \nwith with these credit card companies from out of State that you can \nbarely reach on the phone, and if you do, you get pushed from phone \ntree to phone tree, we have done something about that. We have helped \nyou. We have put you in a position where the States are sovereign again \nover these big national corporations rather than vice versa.\n  Right now, we, the big credit card companies, are sovereign over our \nStates. That is not the way things should be in America. That is not \nthe way the Founding Fathers set it up. It is not right for consumers. \nIt violates the principle of the States being laboratories of \ndemocracy, and it completely eviscerates consumer protection.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support it and to put themselves in a \nposition to be able to go home to their voters and say: We did \nsomething tangible for you. We didn't create bigger government. We let \nyour existing State government make the decisions that for two \ncenturies they were capable of making to protect you from the worst \npractices of the out-of-State credit card companies. The alternative is \nto have to go back and explain why people are still paying 30 percent \nwhen you have the chance to do something about it; why you chose the \nbig out-of-State corporations and exorbitant interest rates over your \nown home State's protection of your own home State's citizens.\n  I think the position my colleagues would want to be in on that one is \nwith your home State, with the doctrine of federalism, with the \ntraditions of the United States of America, and with your consumers, \nrather than on the other side with the big out-of-State banks that \ncharge these exorbitant rates.\n  So I hope I will have support, and I look forward to working with \nanyone who has questions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4020 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n (Purpose: To limit further bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, to \nenhance the regulation and oversight of such enterprises, and for other \n                               purposes)\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up the Crapo amendment No. 4020.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr. Crapo], for himself, Mr. Gregg, \n     Mr. Shelby, Mr. McCain, Mr. Vitter, and Mrs. Hutchison, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 4020 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Thursday, May 13, 2010.)\n  Mr. CRAPO. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  This amendment includes Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as part of the \nFederal budget as long as either of these two institutions is under \nconservatorship or receivership. I wish to thank Senators Gregg, \nShelby, McCain, and Vitter, Hutchison, and Corker for cosponsoring this \namendment.\n  As I believe my colleagues will recall, several days ago we voted on \na broader amendment which would actually have provided some significant \ncoverage of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in this so-called financial \nregulatory reform legislation we are addressing on the floor of the \nSenate today.\n  That legislation would have provided a pathway for us to literally \nstop the bailouts of Fannie and Freddie and move us toward a path of \nresolving the continued taxpayer exposure to the excesses of Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac. But that amendment was defeated on the floor of the \nSenate--although I supported that amendment because now, since the \namendment has been defeated, there is literally no piece of this \nlegislation before us that addresses the core problem that started the \nentire collapse in our economy; namely, the securitization of the \nmortgage industry and the actions of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which \nran up so many of these toxic assets and helped to spread them \nthroughout the globe.\n  As we debated then, the taxpayer is already on the hook for about \n$130 billion-plus for the problems Fannie and Freddie caused. Experts \ntell us, as we move forward, that liability to the taxpayer is likely \nto reach $380 billion to $400 billion. I personally think those are \nconservative estimates. When we get the full picture, I think the \ntaxpayers will have been put on the hook for way more than that.\n  This amendment simply says: Let's tell the American public what's \nhappening. Since we lost the fight last week to try to have the bill \ncover Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and provide an exit strategy for the \ntaxpayers to continue to bail them out, let's at least be open and \nclear about what we are doing with regard to Fannie and Freddie.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to show the American people the true \npicture of how much our national debt has increased as a result of the \nbailout of these two institutions--the bailout which I, again, point \nout is ongoing, uninterrupted in any way by this legislation.\n  According to the CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf:\n\n       After the U.S. Government assumed control in 2008 of Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac--two federally chartered institutions \n     that provide credit guarantees for almost half of the \n     outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S.--\n\n  This is his quote now, and because of what happened in the economy, \nFannie and Freddie, together with the FHA, account for 96.5 percent of \nall of the residential mortgages in the U.S. Continuing with the quote:\n\n     the Congressional Budget Office concluded that the \n     institutions had effectively become government entities whose \n     operations should be included in the Federal budget.\n\n  What is the Director saying? He is saying that since the U.S. \nGovernment has now taken over control and management of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, and the taxpayer is on the hook for all of their debts and \nexcesses, we ought to put it on budget and show the American people \nwhat is happening to our debt as a result of it, instead of using the \ncreative accounting that we see here in Washington all the time, where \nwe mount up spending and debt and figure out ways to keep it from \nshowing up in the national debt or in the calculations of our spending.\n  At the end of 2009, per the financial statements, those figures that \nwe are talking about, how much debt is not being reflected in our \nnational debt because we don't choose to count it? Those figures are \n$774 billion for Fannie Mae and $781 billion for Freddie Mac, for a \ntotal of $1.555 trillion, which is out there for which the taxpayer is \non the hook, and we have to figure out a way to pay it back. We as a \nCongress will not tell the American people that in the calculations of \nour national debt.\n\n[[Page S3805]]\n\n  To put into perspective how large these entities are, their combined \ntotal books of business are nearly $5.5 trillion. As I indicated, they \nare currently run and operated by the U.S. Government.\n  Again, the amendment last week would have put us on a pathway to \nsolve this and take the government out of the business, which should be \na private sector business of mortgages. But at least this amendment \nwould put us on record as telling the American people what exposure we \nare putting them to by not taking those actions.\n  By the way, the Congressional Budget Office has estimated that, in \nthe wake of the housing bubble and the unprecedented deflation in \nhousing values that resulted, the government's cost to bail out Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac will eventually reach, as indicated before, about \n$381 billion. I think that is too conservative.\n  On May 5, Freddie Mac reported losing another $8 billion in the first \nquarter and requested $10.6 billion from taxpayers, saying in the same \nbreath they are going to need more in the future.\n  On May 10, Fannie Mae reported losing $11.5 billion, its 11th \nconsecutive quarterly loss, and itself asked for another $8.4 billion \nmore from the taxpayers. That is in addition to the $126.9 billion \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac already cost the taxpayers. Get this--there \nused to be some limits on this--$400 billion or $200 billion for each \ninstitution.\n  Last Christmas--literally on Christmas Eve--the Treasury announced \nthat it was going to lift that $400 billion loss cap on these two \ncompanies, creating a potentially unlimited liability, and effectively \nproviding the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government, the \nAmerican taxpayers, for their unlimited debt. Now the limit, instead of \n$400 billion, which itself is unacceptable, is infinity. We will not \neven record it for the American people to see.\n  According to a January 2010 CBO background paper titled ``CBO's \nBudgetary Treatment of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,'' the Congressional \nBudget Office ``believes that the Federal Government's current \nfinancial and operational relationship with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \nwarrants their inclusion in the budget.''\n  This isn't just my complaint. The CBO itself has said that now that \nthe status is that the U.S. Government has taken control of the \nfinancing of and assumed the debt of the obligations and actions of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we ought to recognize they are government \nentities, and we ought to include them in our budget. That is what we \nare seeking in this amendment.\n  By contrast, the current administration has taken a different \napproach by continuing to treat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as outside \nthe Federal budget, recording and projecting outlays equal to the \namounts of any cash infusions made by Treasury into the entities. They \nare creating the appearance that there is no debt here, no impact on \nour budget. That is the kind of nontransparency this amendment is aimed \nat stopping. We are seeking to create some kind of transparency that \nwill at least allow Congress and the public to understand the finances \nwe are now being engaged in and asking the American taxpayers to back.\n  The Office of Management and Budget, in contrast to the CBO, has said \nin their Budget of the U.S. Government for Fiscal Year 2011:\n\n       Under the approach in the budget, all of the GSEs' \n     transactions with the public are non-budgetary because the \n     GSEs are not considered to be government agencies.\n\n  We have the President and the OMB at the White House saying that we \ndon't need to count this in the budget because they are not government \nagencies. The CBO, however, is saying: Wait a minute, we own them, we \nrun them, we are backing all of their debt, and essentially they are \ngovernment entities. We can engage in debates about whether Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac are Government entities, but the bottom line question \nis: Who is responsible for their debt? Who is paying for their debt?\n  Nobody denies the answer to that question. It is the U.S. taxpayer. \nIf the U.S. taxpayer is on the hook for their debt--and after what I \ncall the ``Christmas Eve massacre'' of last Christmas--and there is no \nlimit to the amount of that liability, we at least ought to put it on \nrecord.\n  CBO has included the GSEs in its budget baseline but does not include \ntheir debt in the computations of debt because CBO took a narrow view \nof the Federal debt. But as CBO's report says:\n\n       CBO's treatment of the entities' debt does not constitute a \n     statement about whether or not that debt should be considered \n     Federal debt.\n\n  Figure that out. CBO is saying: We are not going to include this in \nthe debt, even though we think they are government entities and we \nought to put them on budget. Their words were ``CBO's treatment of the \nentities' debt''--meaning not counting it--``does not constitute a \nstatement about whether or not that debt should be considered Federal \ndebt.''\n\n  Maybe CBO is saying Congress needs to give us some direction. Whether \nthat is what they are saying, Congress does need to give some direction \nhere, and that is the purpose of the amendment.\n  In light of Treasury's Christmas Eve ``taxpayer massacre'' and the \ngovernment's decision to back all losses of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, \nwe should include Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as part of the Federal \nbudget--at least as long as they are in receivership or conservatorship \nand run and backed up by the American taxpayer.\n  The amendment would also do a few other things. It would reestablish \nthe $200 billion cap per entity and accelerate the 10-percent \nreductions of the mortgage portfolios, effectively requiring the \ncompanies to shrink those portfolios by holding a combined $100 billion \nfrom their current levels.\n  This will also limit the losses that taxpayers will face as a result \nof the blank check given by the administration last December 24.\n  The amendment will also require the Secretary of the Treasury and the \nDirector of the Federal Housing Financing Agency to testify before the \nBanking Committee each time an additional $10 billion or more in \ntaxpayer funds is provided to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac combined. In \nother words, the next time, under this amendment, we have a May like \nthis May, where Fannie and Freddie have asked for more than $10 billion \nof additional taxpayer bailout, we at least ought to have the Secretary \nof the Treasury and the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, \nwho manage this, come before the Banking Committee and testify as to \nwhat is happening, why, and where we are headed.\n  This will provide at least an opportunity for congressional \noversight, which is currently totally lacking in the process. All that \nhappens now is that they issue a press release saying we need another \n$10 billion and they get it--no limits, no caps, no accountability, no \ncounting of the debt, and no explanation to Congress. It seems to me a \nlittle transparency and honesty with the American people about what our \nfinances are doing here is appropriate.\n  The amendment is also going to require the Secretary of the Treasury \nto post on the Treasury Web site, 1, the aggregate portfolio holdings \nof each enterprise and, 2, a weekly summary of taxpayer funds provided \nfor and at risk for each enterprise.\n  Again, all we are asking is to have the kind of transparency that \nwill allow the American people to understand what the Federal \nGovernment is up to with their money. It will also help explain why \nsome of us don't believe the rhetoric about the bill before us today. \nThere is a lot of talk about ending bailouts. There is a lot of talk \nabout ``too big to fail'' is never going to be allowed again in \nAmerica. There are some provisions in the bill that end some of the \nbailouts and that go quite a bit of the way down the road toward making \nit clear that a company cannot get too big to fail, and that we will \ntry to move them into a resolution process if they do fail.\n  It is not ironclad, however, and there is still the possibility that \nwe will see bailouts in the future--something in other amendments we \nhave tried to tighten.\n  But let's not mistake the fact that the biggest bailouts of all are \nnot even addressed in this legislation and are allowed to not only \ncontinue unabated but to continue without even telling the American \npublic what the facts are. When I say the biggest bailouts of all, the \nlast numbers I saw, if you take\n\n[[Page S3806]]\n\nthe auto bailout and the financial bailouts everybody heard about, and \ntotal them all up, they won't even equal the amount of money being used \nto bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Yet, Fannie and Freddie \ncontinue--because the government now owns them--to be untouched by this \nlegislation.\n  It is time for true transparency as we debate these issues of \nbailouts and too big to fail. It is time for us to address the very \ncore of the problem that caused so much of the economic disruption we \nare now dealing with--the financial mortgage industry and the \nsecuritization of those toxic mortgages.\n  Yet, again, what happens? We are simply asked, as American taxpayers, \nto pony up with a check for $10 billion here and $8 billion there, and \nwe will continue to grow, unrestricted, uncontrolled, unnoticed, and \nunidentified, because we won't even put it on record and count it in \nour own budgeting.\n  It is time for us to include the obligations and the management of \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac in our Federal budget. I encourage all of my \ncolleagues to support this amendment when we get an opportunity to vote \non it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Mr. President, at its very core, this amendment is \nabout protecting consumers. It is about making sure the Federal Trade \nCommission has the authority to act in coordination with the new \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, which is created in the \nunderlying bill.\n  This amendment would equip the FTC to cover dangerous gaps in \nconsumer protection and to go after dishonest, fly-by-night operators \ntargeting our society's weakest members. In the Commerce Committee, we \ndiscovered those folks are frequent and everywhere.\n  For nearly 100 years, the FTC has been protecting consumers in the \ngray areas where other regulatory bodies have failed to act. This \namendment will make sure the situation of the FTC and its ability to \nact does not change. Since 1914, the Federal Trade Commission has \nserved the American public as our preeminent consumer watchdog. The \nCommission's core consumer protection mission is to enforce and \nregulate against ``unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or \naffecting interstate commerce.'' This broad prohibition is at the heart \nof the FTC's underlying authority under its authorizing statute, the \nFederal Trade Commission Act.\n  This bipartisan amendment is very simple. It is a savings clause. \nThat is really all it is. It fully preserves the FTC's enforcement and \nregulatory authority under the FTC Act as it is today. The underlying \nbill creates a new consumer protection bureau within the Federal \nReserve, and I fully support that effort. But creating that new bureau \nshould not come at the expense of the FTC's mission, which is consumer \nprotection, which is not, incidentally, a zero sum game.\n  I emphasize that this amendment is hardly a novel concept. Throughout \nthe FTC's long, distinguished history, Congress has created new \nregulatory agencies that have overlapped with the FTC's core authority \nand jurisdiction. The list runs from the Securities and Exchange \nCommission and the Food and Drug Administration to the Environmental \nProtection Agency and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. But in \norder to maximize consumer protection, Congress has always preserved \nthe FTC's authority under the FTC Act, and this latest effort should be \nno different. Yet the underlying bill currently strips the FTC of its \nauthority and places it within the new bureau, undermining its consumer \nprotection mission and creating, in this Senator's judgment, dangerous \nholes in our regulatory safety net. That is because the definition and \nboundaries of the term ``financial products and services''--the ruling \ndefinition--are entirely vast and entirely vague. Anyone can avoid \nenforcement simply by claiming they are beyond the FTC's or the new \nbureau's jurisdiction. Fraudsters and scam artists could and most \ncertainly would tie the courts up in knots. Concurrent authority would \nsolve this problem.\n  What is more, there is too much financial fraud out there to take a \nvaluable cop off the beat. The FTC has particular expertise in cracking \ndown on bad actors who fleece ordinary Americans of their hard-earned \nmoney.\n  I think it is clear that these small-time crooks would not be at the \ntop of the new bureau's priority list. They will have many things to \ndo. It is just common sense to preserve the FTC's existing authority \nagainst these people.\n  Simply put, the new consumer protection bureau cannot do everything. \nNeither can the FTC. There will be plenty of work to go around for both \nagencies.\n  I wish to be absolutely clear about something. This amendment would \nnot subject businesses to dual regulations. As I said earlier, the FTC \nhas always coexisted with newly created agencies, and they have avoided \ntripping over one another with conflicting regulations or enforcement \nactions. To make absolutely certain this does not happen, the \namendment, as modified, directs the FTC and the new bureau to enter \ninto a memorandum of understanding and coordinate their regulatory \nefforts. That is sensible. The bottom line is that businesses will not \nbe subject to multiple layers of regulation or rules.\n  I close by thanking particularly Senator Hutchison, Senator Dorgan, \nand Senator Pryor for their steadfast support and effort, and, of \ncourse, Chairman Dodd, who has worked long and hard, it seems to me, \nfor months on end, never moving from that seat. He has been crucial in \nworking with me on this issue and with Senator Hutchison.\n  So many of the enormous economic problems we face today are a direct \nresult of weak consumer protections in the financial sector. It is the \nhard-working families in places such as West Virginia and many other \nplaces all across the country who are hurt the most. They are \nstruggling just to scrape by, to pay their bills, and to put food on \nthe table. It is so hard to know, frankly, whom to trust. They need to \nknow somebody is by their side looking out for them. The Restoring \nAmerican Financial Stability Act of 2010 will be that safeguard. It is \na profound achievement that will make a real and lasting difference in \nthe lives of hard-working Americans for generations to come. Our \namendment is a small but essential part of that work to make sure \nconsumers are protected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will not go into the specifics of \nthe Rockefeller-Hutchison amendment because the distinguished chairman \nof the Commerce Committee said it very well. Let me make a couple of \nother points to show what I think is the important reason for this \namendment to be adopted.\n  Over the past 5 years the Federal Trade Commission has filed over 100 \nactions against providers of financial services, and in the past 10 \nyears the Commission has obtained nearly $\\1/2\\ billion in redress for \nconsumers of financial services. In 2009 alone, the FTC and the States, \nworking in close coordination, brought more than 200 cases against \nfirms that pedaled phony mortgage modification and foreclosure rescue \nscams. Despite these successes, the substitute that is before us would \ntransfer all consumer protection functions of the FTC to the newly \ncreated Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  The FTC, in a bipartisan letter signed by all five Commissioners, has \nexpressed concern that the current Senate language could inadvertently \nrestrict the ability of the FTC to work with this new financial \nprotection bureau to stop unfair and deceptive practices that prey on \nconsumers of financial products and services. The FTC has warned that \nthe current bill, which grants the new agency exclusive rulemaking and \nenforcement authority in several areas, could even inhibit the FTC's \nauthority in consumer protection with respect to consumer protection \nlaws of nonfinancial products and services.\n  The bottom line is, I do not think it was the intention of the bill \nto take away from the FTC the authority and the record they have. It is \nimportant that they have a record in this area. They have experience. \nThey have experienced staff. And we do not need to reinvent the wheel. \nWe do not need another whole agency to do the same things the FTC \nalready does.\n  It also is confusing to the regulator. It is confusing when they have \ntwo agencies. They may have conflicting rules. Sometimes, as a \nbusinessperson, I have been in a position where two agencies have \nrulings that if you do what one ruling says, the other agency's ruling \nwould be violated. That is unfair to our small businesses. It is unfair \nto the regulated entities not to have one regulatory authority that \ndoes not in any way have a double burden or make a double burden on the \nregulated. We need to keep commerce going and we also need to protect \nconsumers and our amendment will ensure that happens. So I am very \npleased to be a cosponsor.\n\n  I will say the leadership for this amendment certainly resided with \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee, the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer in the chair now, and also I appreciate that Chairman Dodd and \nRanking Member Shelby worked on this amendment to make sure it was \nwritten in the correct way and that the FTC will keep its basic \nauthority it has now. It will not get new authority, and it will not \nhave authority taken away. It will\n\n[[Page S3808]]\n\njust be that their staff and their experience will be utilized--and \ncertainly in a more fair way--and particularly in nonfinancial \ninstitutions consumers will have the protection of the FTC, where they \nare the relevant agency, rather than transferring to a new agency that \nis going to be set up and that doesn't even have rules yet, much less \nstaff.\n  So I think it is a good amendment, and I appreciate the leadership of \nthe distinguished chairman, Senator Rockefeller.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Rockefeller). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to withhold the \nquorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is withheld.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a minute or so to thank both \nthe Presiding Officer and the author of this amendment, along with his \ncoauthor and my good friend, the distinguished Senator from Texas.\n  This is a good amendment, as my colleague from West Virginia has \npointed out. The role of the Federal Trade Commission has been \ncritically important and goes back a long time. I often cite to people \nthat one of my favorite pieces of statuary is outside the Federal Trade \nCommission. It is an explanation of what the free enterprise system is \nand how it is supposed to work. It is a rather dated piece of \nsculpture, goes back I think to the Depression era, and it shows that \nvery powerful horse straining at the bit, trying to charge forward, and \na rather muscular farmer holding the horse back. You are not quite \nsure, looking at the piece of statuary, whether the horse is going to \nwin or the farmer is going to win, which is about as good a visual \nexpression as we have of our free enterprise system.\n  We want a robust free enterprise system that is charging forward, \ncreating new ideas and innovations in order to allow jobs to be created \nand wealth to be created. At the same time, we realize we have to have \nthat regulator in place to make sure it doesn't run wild, in the sense \nthat everyone else could be adversely affected by it. So I have always \nthought that particular piece of statuary captured the essence of what \nour free enterprise system is that sits outside the FTC.\n  I think this amendment strengthens the bill and is a very worthwhile \naddition to it. So I thank both my colleagues for their indulgence and \ntheir patience as we took a little time to get to this.\n  Either we will have a recorded vote or a voice vote, as soon as the \nleadership decides how they want to handle that in the next hour or so.\n  Why don't we do this. If there is no objection, we will go to it, and \nI will call the question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 3758), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that motion on the \ntable.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3746, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, may I ask for regular order with \nrespect to my pending amendment, No. 3746.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is now pending.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I offer a modification.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4020\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I understand I have 2 minutes; is that \ncorrect?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not a formal order.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me be brief.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I have a tremendously high regard for my \ncolleague from Idaho. We serve on the Banking Committee together. He is \nmore than just a member; he is an excellent member of the committee and \nbrings great knowledge in the area of financial services. It is always \nwith reluctance that one disagrees with someone they admire. I thank \nhim for his work. For the last 38 or 39 months I have been chairman he \nhas been a very valuable asset to our committee and a solid thinker.\n  We have had a couple amendments already--the Ensign amendment and the \nMcCain amendments--on the GSEs. We have had three amendments because I \noffered a side-by-side amendment on the government-sponsored \nenterprises, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Clearly, all of us, \nwithout exception, understand we must have reform of the GSEs. We need \nan alternative to the housing financing system. The present one is not \nworking. We also understand in the absence of it, we would be in deep \ntrouble in terms of housing issues today.\n  The Senate has spoken on the importance of addressing the issue. My \ncolleague from New Hampshire said it well when we were debating whether \nto include this. As he pointed out, this was so complex an issue, no \none really had an alternative idea as to how to come up with a housing \nfinancing system, and to include one in this bill would have been \ndifficult. We have debated that. But aside from the substantive issue, \nthe pending amendment deals with a matter within the Budget Committee's \njurisdiction.\n  Therefore, I raise a point of order that the pending amendment \nviolates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  For those reasons, the point of order should lie against this, aside \nfrom the substantive debate we have already had and the full awareness \nthat we must address this issue in the coming Congress if we are going \nto be successful in dealing with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. For those \nreasons, I raise the point of order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(g)(3)of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of my \namendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that I have an equivalent amount of time \nto respond on the amendment before we vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I oppose the Crapo amendment because of the \nlimitations that it would impose on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  These institutions have been very helpful to homeowners in West \nVirginia who are seeking home loan modifications. I do not believe this \nis the right time to be limiting the assistance that Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac can offer to struggling homeowners in paying for their \nmortgages and keeping their homes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, as the Senator from Connecticut indicated--\nand I appreciate his kind remarks--we have had several votes on the GSE \nissue. Remarkably, this Senate continues to refuse to deal with Fannie \nand Freddie, the core issue of the problem on the bill we are debating. \nFannie and Freddie are nowhere to be seen in the legislation. \nRecognizing that the Senate has refused in its votes to allow us to try \nto focus on Fannie and Freddie, which are the biggest bailouts of all--\nin fact, the bailouts of Fannie and Freddie are more in volume and cost \nto the taxpayers than all other bailouts combined--this amendment \nsimply says: Let's be honest with the American taxpayer and at least \nput the debt that Fannie and Freddie are now becoming responsible for \non our calculations of the national debt.\n  CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf said:\n\n       After the U.S. government assumed control in 2008 of Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac--two federally chartered institutions \n     that provide credit guarantees for almost half of the \n     outstanding residential mortgages in the U.S.--the \n     Congressional Budget Office concluded that the institutions \n     had effectively become government entities whose operations \n     should be included in the federal budget.\n\n  This amendment simply says: Let's put the calculations of debt for \nwhich taxpayers are now on the hook, which now totals over $130 \nbillion, which we are told is going to rise to $381 billion, and the \ndebt, which is over $1.5 trillion, of these two institutions that is \nnow on their books, let's put it in our calculation of the national \ndebt.\n  We are not asking to solve the problem in the bill with this \namendment. We fought that last week. This simply says let's put it on \nthe national debt.\n  I urge colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion. The yeas and nays have \nbeen ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), the \nSenator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. \nKaufman), the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), the Senator from \nNew Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nSpecter) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Alaska (Ms. Murkowski).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Alaska (Ms. \nMurkowski) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The yeas and nays resulted--yeas 47, nays 46, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 151 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--47\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--46\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n\n[[Page S3810]]\n\n\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--7\n\n     Begich\n     Harkin\n     Kaufman\n     Lincoln\n     Murkowski\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n  On this vote, the yeas are 47, the nays are 46. Three-fifths of the \nSenators duly chosen and sworn not having voted in the affirmative, the \nmotion is not agreed to. The point of order is sustained, and the \namendment falls.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3986\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, as I understand it, the next vote will occur \non the Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote in relation to \namendment No. 3986 offered by the Senator from Texas, Mr. Cornyn.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me say, if I may--I am looking to the \nleader here, if I can find him--I believe this will be the last \nrecorded vote this evening. There will be potentially a couple of voice \nvotes after this on matters involving, one, Senator Bond's amendment \nthat I am cosponsoring with him, along with Senator Warner and Senator \nCorker--this will be the last recorded vote, but there will be a voice \nvote on the angel investor amendment Senator Bond is interested in, and \nthere will be a vote on the amendment offered by Senator Udall of \nColorado dealing with credit scores that I believe we all can support \nas well. Then we will be laying down a Lugar-Cardin or Cardin-Lugar \namendment for discussion this evening, with a possible vote in the \nmorning. Then we will be working this evening, Senator Shelby and I, to \ntry to lay out some amendments tomorrow to give people a clear picture \nas to what the roadmap will be for tomorrow as well.\n  So with that, I turn to Senator Cornyn.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will make two points. No. 1: This \namendment will help protect American taxpayers from bailouts of foreign \ngovernments. Greece is going to get $40 billion in loans from the IMF, \nout of which $7 billion is attributable to the contributions of the \nAmerican taxpayer. They shouldn't have to do that unless we have an \nassurance we will be paid back.\n  The second point is that Greece's current public debt relative to its \ngross domestic product is 115 percent--meaning it owes more money than \nits entire economy produces.\n  Under the President's budget, in 2020, looking at the same metric for \nthe U.S. Government--our debt will be 90 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. If we are not careful, America will turn into Greece and need \na bailout, except there won't be anybody there to bail us out, \nincluding the American taxpayer.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I intend to support the Cornyn amendment, \nand I ask my colleagues to do so as well. Our colleague from \nMassachusetts, the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, Senator \nKerry, has raised some very legitimate issues about the amendment that \nmay need to be worked on as we move forward in our conference. But I \nbelieve the thrust of the amendment is a correct one. We are concerned \nabout some very poor countries that may be in a different position, \nincluding some additional thought that may need to be put into that, \nand I respect the concerns raised by the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  I believe this is a good amendment deserving of our support; \ntherefore, I ask for the yeas and nays and ask my colleagues to support \nthe Cornyn amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), the \nSenator from Iowa (Mr. Harkin), the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. \nLincoln), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mrs. Shaheen), and the \nSenator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, there are two amendments I am aware of. The \nnext order of business is the amendment by the Senator from Colorado, \nMr. Udall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 4016, offered by the Senator from Colorado, Mr. Udall.\n  The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, we have had a lot of spirited \ndebate on the floor about the Wall Street Accountability Act, and there \nhave been some differences. One area we all agree on is that we ought \nto empower consumers with this important piece of legislation.\n  The amendment I am offering with Senator Lugar does just that. It \nprovides that if you are turned down for credit because you have \napplied for a loan or you have a higher loan rate, you will have access \nto your credit score, your FICO score.\n  I believe this will empower consumers, increase financial literacy in \nour country, and it is a win-win across the board. I want to thank the \ngroup of Senators--some 20-plus--who supported this amendment. I \nparticularly thank the chairman, Senator Dodd, for his yeoman's work. I \nurge an ``aye'' vote on this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall. He has done a great \njob on this with Senator Lugar. They made an alternative suggestion \nthat would allow the release of these credit scores on a transactional \nbasis for the purchase of a automobile or a home, so you will get to \nknow what the credit score is, and that will be a great value.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4016) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe the Bond-Warner-Corker amendment \nis next.\n\n[[Page S3811]]\n\n                            Cloture Motions\n\n  Mr. REID.

Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement \nbe modified to include the Wyden-Grassley amendment No. 4019 to finally \nend secret holds and add that amendment to the list of amendments \nincluded in the agreement.\n  I point out that last Thursday, the Wyden-Grassley amendment was \npending to the financial reform bill, and it was ready for a vote by \nthe Senate. Then at the last minute, out of nowhere, this bipartisan \neffort was blindsided without any notice whatever by a second-degree \namendment that effectively prevented a vote to open government and end \nsecret holds.\n  In light of what happened, I think it is only fair that this \nbipartisan amendment be given the opportunity for a vote as part of \nthis consent agreement.\n  I also wish to make it clear that, in my view, anyone who objects to \nadding the bipartisan Wyden-Grassley amendment to this agreement is \nobjecting to ending secret holds. They are objecting to even have a \nvote in the Senate on ending secret holds, therefore, allowing the \nSenate to continue to operate in secret and against ending this \nindefensible denial of the public's right to know.\n  Therefore, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement be modified to \nadd the Wyden-Grassley amendment to end secret holds, and it is No. \n4019.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the modification?\n  Mr. RISCH. Reserving the right to object, I do not have any problem \nwith the substance, but I know Senator DeMint has serious issues with \nit. We would like to have an opportunity to talk with him.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator does not have the floor.\n  Mr. RISCH. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today to discuss a \nbipartisan amendment critical to small business and job creation, \namendment No. 4056.\n  Thank you to my friend and colleague Senator Dodd for his leadership \non this amendment. I am proud to cosponsor this amendment with Senators \nDodd, Mark Warner, Scott Brown, Cantwell, Begich, and Murray.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle agree that Wall Street needs to \nbe reformed to protect Main Street from a future crisis.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle can also agree that small \nbusiness job creation is critical to our economic recovery and \ncommunities in my State of Missouri and across the Nation.\n  That is what this bipartisan amendment is all about--protecting the \nsmall business startups that are so vital to job creation and economic \ndevelopment.\n  Specifically, our amendment removes onerous regulations and \nrestrictions in the financial reform bill that would have \nunintentionally stifled job creation.\n  The provision would have unintentionally threatened small business \nstartups by delaying and limiting the availability of essential seed \ncapital from qualified investors.\n  Our country's entrepreneurs need immediate access to capital as they \nwork to move an idea from concept to production--especially when banks \nor traditional lenders may not be willing to extend large lines of \ncredit to them.\n  We want to encourage--not discourage--investors to take a chance on \nthese entrepreneurs by providing seed capital to startups in hopes that \nthe business will flourish and remain a viable company.\n  Our amendment allows this investment and job creation to continue. \nWith our amendment agriculture research and biotechnology startup \ncompanies like those in my State of Missouri, will continue to be the \nengine of job creation.\n  We all agree that we must reform Wall Street, but we must not punish \nMain Street and the very small business startups that are so critical \nto job creation.\n  This bipartisan amendment will help protect the small business \nstartups vital to job creation across the country, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what I would like to do, if I may, I would \nlike to make a statement on the Bond, et al, amendment. If my colleague \nfrom Oregon would like to make some comments about this consent request \nhe made, if it is not too long, then I will reserve my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4019\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the committee. I \nintend to be very brief in my comments tonight. I thank the chairman \nfor his indulgence.\n  I note that Senator Grassley, who is on the floor, and I have \nprosecuted this cause for more open government in the Senate for over a \ndecade. Senator McCaskill is here. She has tried relentlessly to do the \nsame thing. I think it is very regrettable, because we have seen, once \nagain, tonight, as we did on Thursday, that defenders of secret holds \nin the Senate continue to pull out all the stops, employ every tool in \nthe toolbox to throw a monkey wrench into the effort to open the Senate \nto transparency and accountability.\n  This has been a bipartisan effort. It has always been a bipartisan \neffort. I particularly credit my friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, \nbecause when we talked about this over a decade, the two of us said we \nare going to make this bipartisan every step of the way because \nsometimes in the Senate you are in the minority, sometimes you are in \nthe Senate as part of the majority, but the cause of open and \ntransparent government ought to be available all the time. It should \nnot matter who is in the majority and who is in the minority.\n  I will say the American people are furious at the way business is \ndone in Washington, DC. The fact that it has been impossible to even \nget an up-or-down vote on doing Senate business in public is a textbook \ncase of why people are so angry.\n  It is my intent to come with colleagues to the floor again and again \nand try to make sure that once and for all we change this pernicious \npractice, a practice that, in my view, is an indefensible violation of \nthe public's right to know.\n  At a minimum, every Senator ought to be on record publicly with \nrespect to how they feel about doing the Senate's business in public. \nThat is what this is all about.\n  This is not complicated. A hold is one of the most powerful tools a \nSenator has. With a secret hold, one colleague can keep the American \npeople from even getting a peak at important Senate business. That is \nnot right. That is not accountable government. That is not transparent \ngovernment.\n  What we ought to do--and I commend particularly Senator Grassley, \nSenator Inhofe, and Senator Collins on the other side of the aisle; \nSenator Udall has joined me in this effort, Senator Bennet--we have \nmade this bipartisan every step of the way. It is time for an up-or-\ndown vote in the Senate with respect to ending secret holds.\n  We have not even been able to get a direct vote, though we have been \nworking now for weeks and weeks on a measure that is bipartisan. The \nAmerican people want public business done in public, and they certainly \nwant Democrats and Republicans to come together. That is what Senator \nGrassley and I have sought to do.\n  It is unfortunate that, once again, there has been an objection \ntonight to doing public business in public. That is something that \nought to change around here. There is a bipartisan group of us who are \ngoing to stay with it until it does.\n  I particularly thank the bipartisan group of colleagues on the floor \ntonight, led by Senator Grassley and Senator McCaskill. We will be \nback, and we will be back at it until there is the kind of transparency \nand openness in the way the Senate does business so, once and for all, \nevery hold in the Senate has a public owner. That is what this is all \nabout. If you want to put a hold on a bill or a measure, as Senator \nGrassley has said, you ought to have the guts to go public. Every hold \nought to have a public owner. We are going to stay with it until that \nhappens.\n  I express my appreciation again to the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee who has, at a time when he has a very important piece of \nlegislation on the floor, indulged this Senator repeatedly in giving me \nthe opportunity to be on the floor and prosecute this cause for more \nopenness and transparency. I thank my good friend, the chairman of the \ncommittee. He has done an excellent job on this bill. I appreciate the \ntime tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add Senator \nTester of Montana as a cosponsor of amendment No. 4056, the Bond-Dodd, \net al, amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I should point out that Senator Brown of \nMassachusetts, Senator Cantwell, Senator Begich, and Senator Murray are \ncosponsors of that amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nbe the next amendments in order: Senator Cardin and Senator Lugar, \namendment No. 4050, and an amendment of Senator Corker of Tennessee \nregarding preemption, with a Senator Carper amendment side by side to \nthe Corker amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4056\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues Senators \nBond, Warner, Brown, Cantwell, Begich, Murray and Tester in offering \nthis amendment to sections 412 and 926 to protect investors and promote \ncapital formation.\n  During the Banking Committee's hearings on the financial crisis, the \nNorth American Securities Administrators Association, NASAA, testified \nabout a serious investor problem. A growing number of private placement \nare being used to defraud ``accredited investors.'' An investor is \ndeemed ``accredited,'' or financially sophisticated and able to \nwithstand investment losses, if he or she has $1 million in net\n\n[[Page S3813]]\n\nworth, including the value of his or her home, or $200,000 in annual \nsalary, amounts that have not been changed since 1982. ``Accredited \ninvestors'' are presumed to be able to fend for themselves, receive \nfewer protections, and are eligible to invest in private placements.\n  Secretary William F. Galvin, the chief securities regulator of the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts, stated that ``my office has seen a \ndramatic increase in the number of 506 [private placement] transactions \nsold to inexperienced investors who, on paper, may have met the \naccreditation standards but in reality didn't understand the \ninvestments, could not incur the risk of loss these transactions often \nentail and did not have the financial sophistication to monitor or \nevaluate their investments.''\n  The committee was concerned to protect such investors, particularly \nthose who fall victim to sellers who repeatedly engage in securities \nfraud.\n  NASAA testified that:\n\n       These offerings enjoy an exemption from registration under \n     federal securities law, so they receive virtually no \n     regulatory scrutiny even where the promoters or broker-\n     dealers have a criminal or disciplinary history. As a result, \n     Rule 506 offerings have become the favorite vehicle under \n     Regulation D, and many of them are fraudulent.\n\n  Regarding the ``accredited investor'' standard, NASAA testified that \n``[I]nflation has seriously eroded the efficacy of the existing \nthresholds in the definition of `accredited investor' since their \nadoption in 1982'' and supports periodic adjustments of these \nstandards.\n  For the past several weeks, I have worked with and consulted the \nNorth American Securities Administrators Association, Angel Capital \nAssociation, Private Equity Council and others, and I thank them. We \nhave crafted language suited to protect investors from those \nunscrupulous persons while encouraging capital formation.\n  New section 926 would disqualify felons and other ``bad actors'' who \nhave violated Federal and State securities laws from continuing to take \nadvantage of the rule 506 private placement process. This will reduce \nthe danger of fraud in private placements.\n  New section 412 would amend the ``accredited investor'' wealth \nthreshold by excluding the value of an investor's primary residence. \nFor example, a widow whose financial wealth was $1 million but had the \nmajority of that in the value of her home and had a salary of less than \n$200,000, would not be deemed to be an ``accredited investor.'' \nInstead, she would benefit from the broader range of protections \navailable generally to investors. There are several reasons for this \nchange:\n  The net worth test signals a person's ability to bear a loss. If the \ncushion for a loss is a person's home, a person making a bad investment \ncould end up losing his or her home.\n  Net worth is intended to be a proxy for financial experience and \nsophistication. Some people who own valuable homes may not be \nsophisticated investors.\n  Furthermore, real estate prices have greatly appreciated since the \nnet worth standard for accredited investors was adopted in 1982. \nAccordingly, many more investors are now able to meet the current \nthresholds based on the value of their homes than was the case in 1982, \nwhich is inconsistent with original regulatory intent.\n  Also, the SEC would be directed to review the financial standards at \nleast 4 years to make sure the standards stay relevant.\n  I am pleased at the support the legislative proposals have received. \nThe North American Securities Administrators Association on April 27, \n2010 issued a letter stating,\n\n       We strongly support the adoption of a disqualification \n     provision to prevent recidivists from conducting securities \n     offerings under Regulation D, Rule 506 (a regulatory \n     exemption for private placements). This change would provide \n     much needed investor protection from securities law violators \n     and would not prevent legitimate issuers, including small \n     businesses, who use this exemption, to raise capital. \n     Participants in the Regulation D offerings are ``accredited \n     investors'' as established under SEC rules. The monetary \n     standards for determining who qualifies for ``accredited \n     investor'' status haven't changed since it was established in \n     1982 and inflation has rendered them almost meaningless. \n     Therefore, we support, at a minimum, excluding the investor's \n     primary residence from the net worth standard.\n\n  The Angel Capital Association on April 21, 2010 issued a statement \nsaying that ``[t]hese amendments will ensure that high growth \nentrepreneurs have access to a strong pool of angel capital and that \ninvestors are better protected from fraud.''\n  The purposes of sections 412 and 926 of the bill have been to better \nprotect investors while facilitating capital formation. This amendment \nmore completely accomplishes these goals.\n  It is an important contribution Senator Bond has made, along with \nothers, to this bill. It was never our intention at all. Startup \ncompanies need what are called angel investors who are critically \nimportant for startup ideas that do not necessarily attract the \ntraditional capital to get behind them. People who step up and take a \nchance on new ideas deserve some special recognition. The fact is, they \nhave played a very critical role in capital formation over the years.\n  Therefore, I was pleased to be able to accept the amendment and make \nit a part of this bill. This will allow for efficient capital access \nfor entrepreneurs and also provide fraud protection for investors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter from the Angel Capital Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          [From the Angel Capital Association, Apr. 21, 2010]\n\n Angel Capital Association Supports Amendments to Financial Reform Bill\n\n\n     Sen. Dodd's amendments allow for efficient capital access for \n     entrepreneurs and also improve fraud protection for investors\n\n       Kansas City, MO.--The Angel Capital Association (ACA) \n     supports two amendments that we understand will be offered by \n     Sen Christopher Dodd on the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010. These amendments will ensure that high \n     growth entrepreneurs have access to a strong pool of angel \n     capital and that investors are better protected from fraud.\n       ACA has been vocal in our concerns about this bill to date \n     as two of the original sections had the potential of \n     significantly reducing the number of accredited angel \n     investors and creating complicated and potentially expensive \n     regulations for entrepreneurs raising angel financing. ``It \n     is clear that concerns conveyed by ACA and many others about \n     hurting start-up businesses struck a chord with Sen. Dodd and \n     his staff,'' said Elizabeth Karter, ACA's public policy \n     committee chair and president of the Angel Investor Forum in \n     Connecticut. ``They have worked hard to improve the bill so \n     that it balances the importance of small business capital \n     formation while protecting angels and other types of private \n     investors from securities law violators.''\n       The amendments bring new meanings to two sections of the \n     bill:\n     Section 412: Adjusting the Accredited Investor Standard.\n       The thresholds for ``accredited investor'' would stay the \n     same as they are currently, although the standard for net \n     worth of $1 million would now exclude the investor's primary \n     residence. While ACA would have preferred no adjustment to \n     the standard for angel investors, we believe this is a good \n     compromise.\n       The act would also have the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission review the thresholds at least every four years, \n     with any adjustments considering the protection of investors, \n     the public interest and the state of the economy. ``We \n     appreciate the direction to consider the economic impact of \n     any adjustments to accredited investor standards in the \n     future, as we believe that innovative start-up businesses are \n     some of the most important creators of high quality jobs in \n     the country,'' said Karter.\n     Section 926. Regulation D Offerings.\n       The amendment deletes all previous language and \n     disqualifies individuals who have been determined to be ``bad \n     actors'' by Federal and State authorities from using \n     Regulation D 506 private offerings (which include angel \n     investments, but many other types of investments as well).\n       ``ACA particularly likes this amendment because not only \n     does it increase investor protections, but it ensures uniform \n     regulation of these private offerings across the United \n     States and it keeps the reporting requirements for \n     entrepreneurs the same as they are currently. The current \n     uniform system is efficient for small businesses that attract \n     angel capital,'' said Marianne Hudson, executive director of \n     ACA.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond. He is the initiator of \nthe idea. Others joined with him. It is, again, a strong contribution \nto this bill.\n  I see my colleagues from Indiana, Kansas, and Maryland. I yield the \nfloor.\n\n[[Page S3814]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the interest of the United States to promote \n     good governance in the extractive industries sector. \n     Transparency in revenue payments benefits oil, gas, and \n     mining companies, because it improves the business climate in \n     which such companies work, increases the reliability of \n     commodity supplies upon which businesses and people in the \n     United States rely, and promotes greater energy security.\n       (2) Companies in the extractive industries sector face \n     unique tax and reputational risks, in the form of country-\n     specific taxes and regulations. Exposure to these risks is \n     heightened by the substantial capital employed in the \n     extractive industries, and the often opaque and unaccountable \n     management of natural resource revenues by foreign \n     governments, which in turn creates unstable and high-cost \n     operating environments for multinational companies. The \n     effects of these risks are material to investors.\n\n     SEC. 996. DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS BY RESOURCE EXTRACTION \n                   ISSUERS.\n\n       Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78m), as amended by this Act, is amended by adding at \n     the end the following:\n       ``(p) Disclosure of Payments by Resource Extraction \n     Issuers.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       ``(A) the term `commercial development of oil, natural gas, \n     or minerals' includes exploration, extraction, processing, \n     export, and other significant actions relating to oil, \n     natural gas, or minerals, or the acquisition of a license for \n     any such activity, as determined by the Commission;\n       ``(B) the term `foreign government' means a foreign \n     government, a department, agency, or instrumentality of a \n     foreign government, or a company owned by a foreign \n     government, as determined by the Commission;\n       ``(C) the term `payment'--\n       ``(i) means a payment that is--\n\n       ``(I) made to further the commercial development of oil, \n     natural gas, or minerals;

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to thank \nSenator Dodd for his extraordinary leadership on this bill. I know he \nis working through a lot of amendments. I know a lot of us have been \nurging him to allow us to present amendments. I know he has been \nchallenged by the efforts on trying to schedule votes on amendments. I \nthank him, on behalf of all his colleagues in the Senate, for his \nextraordinary leadership in bringing this bill forward. I thank Senator \nShelby for working with Senator Dodd. I know we are close to bringing \nthis bill to completion. I am very proud to be a supporter of this \nbill. It is critically important that we do what we need to do in \nregulating Wall Street.\n  This amendment is a bipartisan amendment. Senator Lugar has filed a \nbill, of which I am a proud cosponsor, that accomplishes basically the \nsame purpose. He has been a real leader in the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee on transparency in the oil industry and its contracts.\n  The nature of the oil, gas, and mining sector means that companies \noften have to operate in countries that are often autocratic, unstable, \nor both. Investors need to know the full extent of a company's exposure \nwhen they are operating in countries where they are subject to \nexpropriation, political and social turmoil, and reputational risks.\n  In Nigeria, for example, American companies have taken oilfields \noffline because of rebel activity and instability in the Niger Delta. \nIn 2009, Nigeria was producing almost 1 million barrels less than it is \nable to produce because of conflict and instability. With so much \nproduction offline, American oil companies, such as Chevron and Exxon, \nhave lost jobs and have lost profits and are forced to pay higher \nproduction costs because of added security.\n  This amendment goes a long way in achieving that transparency by \nrequiring all foreign and domestic companies registered with the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to report, in their annual reports \nto the SEC, how much they pay each government for access to their oil, \ngas, and minerals.\n  In short, this amendment is a critical part of the increased \ntransparency and good governance we have been striving to achieve in \nthe financial industry. We have been working with a lot of groups on \nperfecting this amendment, and we have made some changes that will give \nthe SEC the utmost flexibility in defining how these reports will be \nmade so that we not get the transparency we need without burdening the \ncompanies.\n  I thank all involved in the modifications that have been made to this \namendment from how it was originally filed in order to make it not a \nburden on the industry but to provide the necessary information to \ninvestors.\n  This amendment also is about creating jobs and preserving jobs. This \namendment is important because it will help create and preserve U.S. \njobs in the oil, gas, and mining sector by improving the conditions in \nwhich oil and mining companies have to work.\n  Transparency will help create more stable governments, which in turn \nallows U.S. companies to operate more freely--and on a level playing \nfield--in markets that otherwise are too risky or unstable.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment because Democratic and Republican \ncolleagues both know we are creating a new standard of transparency \nthat will apply to the world's extractive industries and is in the best \ninterest of companies in competing on a level playing field. That has \nbeen what Senator Lugar has been standing for within the Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations, and I applaud him on his leadership.\n  In fact, this amendment would apply to all oil, gas, and mining \ncompanies required to file periodic reports with the SEC, which \nincludes 90 percent of the major internationally operating oil \ncompanies and 8 out of the 10 largest mining companies in the world--\nonly 2 of which are U.S. companies.\n  We currently have a voluntary international standard for promoting \ntransparency. A number of countries and companies have joined the \nExtracted Industries Transparency Initiative, an excellent initiative \nthat has made tremendous strides in changing the cultural secrecy that \nsurrounds extractive industries. But too many countries and too many \ncompanies remain outside this voluntary system.\n  I had the honor of chairing the Helsinki Commission for this \nCongress. This has been one of our top priorities because it deals with \ngood governance as well as investors knowing whether a company is \nmaking payments. The U.S. needs to take a leadership position in regard \nto the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. This amendment, \nattached to this bill, will go a long way in promoting that leadership \nfor the United States.\n  The notion of transparency has been endorsed by the G8, the IMF, the \nWorld Bank, and a number of regional development banks. It is clear to \nthe financial leaders of the world that transparency in natural \nresources development is key to holding government leaders accountable \nfor the needs of their citizens and not just building up their personal \noffshore bank accounts.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for investors and citizens and give \nthem the information they need to hold governments accountable. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me and the other cosponsors of this amendment and \nsupport the creation of a historic transparency standard that will \npierce the veil of secrecy that fosters so much corruption and \ninstability in resource-rich countries.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I join my distinguished colleague in \ncommending the work of Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby and the \nprivilege of offering this amendment now with Senator Cardin.\n  I rise to support the transparency amendment, No. 4050, introduced by \nSenator Cardin on behalf of myself, Senator Durbin, Senator Schumer, \nSenator Feingold, Senator Merkley, Senator Johnson, and Senator \nWhitehouse. This amendment builds on language introduced in the Energy \nSecurity Through Transparency Act of 2009. If passed, the amendment \nwould help to reverse the ``resource curse'' by\n\n[[Page S3816]]\n\nrevealing payments made here and abroad to governments for oil, gas, \nand minerals.\n  The Senate debate on financial regulatory reform has included a great \ndeal of debate on transparency. Transparency empowers citizens, \ninvestors, regulators, and other watchdogs and is a necessary \ningredient of good governance for countries and companies alike. \nAdoption of the Cardin-Lugar amendment would bring a major step in \nfavor of increased transparency at home and abroad. Its passage would \nempower investors to have a more complete view of the value of their \nholdings. It would bring more information to global commodity markets, \nwhich would benefit price stability. More importantly, it would help \nempower citizens to hold their governments to account for the decisions \nmade by their governments in the management of valuable oil, gas, and \nmineral resources and revenues.\n  In countries abundant in natural resources, corruption and \nauthoritarianism, transparency is a vital tool. Yet in recent weeks we \nhave also been reminded of the need for greater transparency in \nmanagement at home. The amendment builds on the findings of a Senate \nCommittee on Foreign Relations staff report entitled the ``Petroleum \nand Poverty Paradox: Assessing U.S. and International Community Efforts \nto Fight the Resource Curse,'' which noted that many resource-rich \ncountries that should be well off are, in fact, terribly poor.\n  History shows that oil, gas reserves, and minerals frequently can be \na bane, not a blessing, for poor countries, leading to corruption, \nwasteful spending, military adventurism, and instability. Too often, \noil money intended for a nation's poor ends up lining the pockets of \nthe rich or is squandered on showcase projects instead of productive \ninvestments. A classic case is Nigeria, the eighth largest oil \nexporter. Despite $\\1/2\\ trillion in revenues since the 1960s, poverty \nhas increased, corruption is rife, and violence roils the oil-rich \nNiger Delta.\n  This ``resource curse'' affects us as well as producing countries. It \nexacerbates global poverty which can be a seedbed for terrorism, it \nempowers autocrats and dictators, and it can crimp world petroleum \nsupplies by breeding instability.\n  The essential issue at stake is a citizen's right to hold its \ngovernment to account. Americans would not tolerate the Congress \ndenying them access to revenues our Treasury collects. We cannot force \nforeign governments to treat their citizens as we would hope, but this \namendment would make it much more difficult to hide the truth.\n  Transparency also will benefit Americans at home. Improved governance \nof extractive industries will improve investment climates for our \ncompanies abroad, it will increase the reliability of commodity \nsupplies upon which businesses and people in the United States rely, \nand it will promote greater energy security.\n  This amendment requires foreign and domestic companies listed on U.S. \nstock exchanges and exchanging American depository receipts to disclose \nin their regular SEC filings their extractive payments to governments \nfor oil, gas, and mining.\n  Nothing in this amendment accuses companies of malfeasance. Quite the \ncontrary. Several oil, gas, and minerals companies have taken important \nsteps in this arena. The aforementioned Foreign Relations Committee \nminority staff report details several examples of individuals going the \nextra mile to convince governments of the importance of transparency \nand to provide training to meet international standards.\n  Yet the value of companies themselves can be negatively impacted when \nthere is not transparency. As noted in the findings of this amendment:\n\n       Companies in the extractive sector face unique tax and \n     reputational risks in the form of country-specific taxes and \n     regulations. Exposure to these risks is heightened by the \n     substantial capital employed in the extractive industries, \n     and the often opaque and unaccountable management of natural \n     resource revenues by foreign governments, which in turn \n     creates unstable and high-cost operating environments for \n     multinational companies. The effects of these risks are \n     material to investors.\n\n  Many analysts say among the root causes of the current financial \ncrisis was a failure by investors to have access to sufficient \ninformation about their investments and an excessive reliance on the \njudgments of the ratings agencies, which proved to be highly faulty. \nThat experience argues strongly for more disclosure and information.\n\n  Considering the well-established link between oil payments and the \nbusiness climate, many investors might be interested in this \ninformation--particularly socially responsible investors.\n  This domestic action will complement multilateral transparency \nefforts such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative--the \nEITI--under which some countries are beginning to require all \nextractive companies operating in their territories to publicly report \ntheir payments.\n  We encourage the President to work with members of the G8 and the G20 \nto promote similar disclosures through their exchanges and their \njurisdictions. As Secretary Clinton noted in her questions for the \nrecord on January 12, 2009:\n\n       President-Elect Obama has put a high priority on promoting \n     transparency in government more broadly. I look forward to \n     working with the President-Elect and the Treasury Department \n     to promote greater transparency at the G-8 and now the G-20 \n     as well.\n\n  In developing this amendment, our staffs consulted with the \nSecretary, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Treasury \nDepartment, the Department of the Interior, energy companies, mining \ncompanies, the industry representatives, and nongovernmental \norganizations.\n  When financial markets see stable economic growth and political \norganization in resource-rich countries, supplies are more reliable and \nrisk premiums factored into the process at the gas pump are diminished. \nInformation is critical to maintaining healthy economies and healthy \npolitical systems. I ask for your support on passage of this important \namendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I am happy to come to the Senate floor and \njoin in support of the Cardin-Lugar amendment. I am an original \ncosponsor along with Senators Feingold, Whitehouse, and others. It is \nvery straightforward, as Senator Lugar explained, and Senator Cardin \nbefore him.\n  It would require companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange to \ndisclose in their SEC filings extractive payments made to governments \nfor oil, gas, and mining. This encourages greater corporate \ntransparency, particularly in terms of those operating in countries \nwhere corruption and violence are rampant.\n  I would also say there is a complementary amendment, which I hope \nwill be considered at the same time because it is in that same vein. It \nis amendment No. 3997, offered by Senators Brownback, Feingold, and \nmyself, and it basically would make the same requirement related to \nextractive minerals.\n  Mr. President, I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo 5 years ago \nwith Senator Brownback. We visited Goma, and I returned to that \nlocation just a few months ago with Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio. On \nthose two visits I saw a situation in Goma which is almost impossible \nto describe. Imagine one of the poorest places on Earth, where people \nliterally are starving to death, where they are facing the scourge of \ndisease, where malaria and AIDS cuts short the lives of far too many, \nwhere there are thousands who are bunched into these just desolate and \ndesperate refugee camps, and then imagine nearby an active volcano. \nThat is the situation in Goma.\n  If you think that is the combination that would be the worst on \nEarth, there is more. Superimpose on this misfortune an ongoing war and \nunrest that has been part of this section of Africa at least since the \ntime of the Rwandan genocide--that long--more than 16 years ago. \nUnspeakable crimes are being committed, particularly against women in \nthis region, and one of the major reasons is this turns out to be one \nof the most powerful sections of Africa. You will find Dian Fossey's \ngorillas, and you will find some of the richest stores of virgin timber \nand extractive minerals in the world. The fighting goes on every single \nday, and these poor people are caught in the crossfire of this terrible \nconflict. Armed militias--some left over from\n\n[[Page S3817]]\n\nthe genocide in Rwanda--continue to operate in the region, terrorizing \ncitizens and inflicting horrific brutality. The United Nations has a \n20,000-member peacekeeping force, known as MONUC, but it isn't enough.\n  What is really behind this ongoing violence? Money. Some of it is a \nresult of a weak Congolese state, and some of the problem is due to the \nlarge number of criminals who have invaded this nation. But what helps \nfund the continued violence is an illicit minerals trade that enriches \nand helps arm those who continue this mayhem.\n  Most people probably don't realize the products we use every day--\nfrom automobiles to cell phones--may use one of these minerals from \nthis area of conflict and that there is a possibility it was mined from \nan area of great violence.\n  We can't begin to solve the problems of eastern Congo without \naddressing where the armed groups are receiving their funding, mainly \nfrom the mining of a number of key conflict minerals. We, as a nation \nof consumers as well as industry, have a responsibility to ensure that \nour economic activity does not support such violence.\n  That is why I join with Senators Brownback and Feingold to support \nthe Congo conflict minerals amendment, which is now pending on this \nbill. It is a requirement that if a company registered in the United \nStates uses any of a small list of key minerals from the Congo--\nminerals known to be involved in the conflict areas--then such usage \nmust be disclosed in that company's SEC disclosure. Such companies can \nalso include additional information to indicate the steps they have \ntaken to ensure their minerals were mined and paid for legitimately and \nlegally.\n  The requirement would sunset in 5 years unless the Secretary of State \ncertifies that the violence continues to receive support from the \nmineral trade. It is a reasonable step to shed some light on this \nliterally life-and-death issue, and it encourages companies using these \nminerals to source them responsibly.\n  I thank Senators Dodd and Shelby for their consideration of this \namendment. I hope, like the Cardin-Lugar amendment, there will be a \nchance \nfor this Brownback-Feingold-Durbin amendment to be considered before \nthis bill is completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4056\n\n  Mr. DODD. I, too, wish to make a comment, but before I do, I think \nthe pending business before the Senate and the request consent is the \nBond amendment. Has that been adopted? I urge the question, if I can.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, the \namendment is pending.\n  Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 4056) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider and lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4050\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to make a few comments on \nthe two proposals. One is, I say to my \ngood friend from Illinois, Senator \nShelby and I have agreed to ac-\ncept the Brownback-Cardin--Cardin-Brownback-Durbin amendment. I am not \nsure who the principal authors are. Maybe we can do that on a voice \nvote. We submitted that as part of the managers' amendment but, given \nthe pace of the managers' amendment, it may be necessary to deal with \nthat separately. But I thank my colleagues for that.\n  I commend my good friends, Senator Cardin and Senator Lugar from \nIndiana, once again. He has taken a leadership role. I am struck by the \nfact that just a little while ago we adopted the Cornyn amendment. The \nCornyn amendment puts restraints on the IMF's ability to accept that in \nsome very poor countries they are going to have to repay their IMF \nobligations. That amendment needs some work. But having adopted that \namendment almost unanimously it is now critically important we adopt \nthis amendment, in my view, because it complements, in a sense, the \nCornyn amendment. Many of these people living in poor countries have \nlittle ability--despite being mineral and resource rich--to accumulate \nthe wealth so they can avoid having to have IMF assistance to bail them \nout or give them assistance during difficult times.\n  If we are truly interested in the language of the Cornyn amendment, \nthen we must complement it, in my view, by accepting the Cardin-Lugar \namendment because it goes beyond just the Congo. Despite the good work \nbeing done on that amendment, this goes beyond that.\n  So I thank Senators Cardin and Lugar for their important bipartisan \namendment requiring additional disclosure to millions of investors who \nare making decisions about investing in the extractive industries--\nmainly oil, natural gas, and mining--around the world. And I thank them \nfor modifying the original amendment to streamline the reporting \nrequirements, adapt as far as practicable the voluntary Extractive \nIndustries Transparency Initiative disclosure standards, and make other \nchanges to ease implementation.\n  We have a similar but more targeted amendment from Senator Brownback, \nSenator Durbin, and Senator Cardin, I think, focused on the Congo and \nadjoining countries, since mining operations there have for years \nhelped fuel the brutally violent militias that have caused so much \ndamage and heartbreak, and killed so many in that strife-torn region. \nGiven the ongoing emergency in the Congo, I am glad that Senator Shelby \nand I have been able to work out an agreement to adopt this Congo \namendment.\n  This amendment by Senator Cardin is much broader, and is designed to \nimpose a new international transparency standard on companies listed \nand traded on US exchanges who are active in the oil and gas and mining \nindustries. Senator Cardin and Senator Lugar have focused on these \nindustries because in many places, especially in Africa, they involve \nunique exposures to country- and industry-specific risks--including \nreputational risks, tax and regulatory risks, expropriation risks, and \nothers--as they conduct business operations in countries where \ngovernance and accountability systems are rudimentary, at best--and \nwhere corruption, secrecy and a lack of transparency regarding public \nfinance are pervasive. Those risks are heightened by the very large \nmulti-year investments that are required of this industry, their need \nto gain access to natural resources, and the often compelling national \nsecurity considerations tied to the products developed by this \nindustry.\n  In the last few decades many American investors have begun to \nconsider more seriously the ethical and socially responsible \nimplications of their investments, and this amendment is a part of that \nlarger effort. It is also a part of broader international effort to \ncombat corruption, poverty, hunger and disease throughout Africa, Asia \nand Central America by providing a mechanism to ensure greater \ntransparency for the many ways in which sometimes corrupt and \nauthoritarian governments in these regions take in huge revenue flows \nfrom oil and gas producers or mining companies, and then fail to \nadequately meet the needs of their own vulnerable populations with \nsocial spending funded by the income from those projects.\n  Let me remind my colleagues of the scale of this problem. A recent \nreport by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee under the leadership \nof Senator Lugar and Senator Kerry concluded that 3.5 billion people \nlive in countries rich in extractive natural resources such as oil, \ngas, minerals and timber. With good governance and transparency, these \nresources can generate vast sums to foster growth and reduce poverty. \nInstead, many of these countries have weak governance and \nadministrative systems, so the revenues have often served to actually \nworsen corruption and generate violent conflict.\n  It is known as the ``resource curse,'' or the ``petroleum and poverty \nparadox,'' where countries with huge revenue flows from energy \ndevelopment also frequently have some of the highest rates of poverty, \ncorruption and violence. Where is all that money going? This amendment, \nthe Lugar-Cardin Amendment, is a first step toward addressing that \nissue by setting a new\n\n[[Page S3818]]\n\ninternational standard for disclosure. I hope that other nations, and \nthose in charge of major exchanges in London, Hong Kong and elsewhere, \nwould follow our lead on this. There is some indication of interest \nthere, especially in the British Parliament.\n  The amendment would require companies to better account for the risks \nassociated with such investments by disclosing basic information about \npayments to governments. I believe that many Americans--including \ninvestors and other stakeholders in these firms--would consider this \nkind of information material and relevant to their decisions about \nwhether or not to invest, or whether to divest their current holdings, \nfrom firms engaged in this sort of activity. On its face this interest \nappears not to rise to the level of materiality for investors that \ncurrently governs the disclosure requirements of public companies under \nFederal securities laws. That is a question we may want to look at more \nclosely in the Banking Committee. There are also questions about the \nprecedent this would set for Congress to require disclosures usually \nconsidered to be non-material.\n  Currently, nearly thirty countries are participants in a voluntary \nprogram designed to increase transparency called the EITI. That is an \nimportant initiative, and I applaud it. Strengthening America's \nleadership in the program, with broad new requirements for greater \ndisclosure by resource extractive companies operating around the world, \nwould be an important step. Senators Cardin and Lugar have modified his \namendment to base some of the reporting on the standards which have \nevolved within this initiative, supported by many oil, energy and \nmining companies, and many countries. I am not persuaded by the \narguments some make that this would weaken the EITI and make some \nnations less prone to participate in it. To the contrary, I believe it \nwould strengthen the initiative. And I believe those who have worked \nclosely within EITI agree.\n  Because we have not yet been able to hold hearings on this measure \nthis year--something which I had hoped to do in the Banking Committee \nonce we had completed this historic financial reform measure--I am not \nsure we have all the precise details and the language exactly right, \nbut the thrust is exactly right and, therefore, in my view, the \namendment by Senators Cardin and Lugar ought to be adopted. We can work \non the details, if we have to, later on, but we should not miss this \nopportunity provided by this legislation to make this historic \ncontribution to something that not only benefits investors here at home \nbut might make a huge difference in the wealth and opportunity in these \ncountries.\n  Again, in some ways I didn't plan it this way, but the fact we have \nadopted the Cornyn amendment dealing with the International Monetary \nFund--now, if you wanted to make a difference in all that, this \namendment I think does all that.\n  I thank my two colleagues--Senator Cardin, who is relatively new to \nthis institution but has brought a history of his interest in this \nsubject matter. Of course, my 30 years with Senator Lugar have been \namong the most joyous of the relationships I have had in this body. He \nnever ceases to amaze me in his commitment, his energy, and his passion \non these issues, and we are a richer and better country because of his \nparticipation in these debates over many years. Again, I am delighted \nto be associated with him in an effort such as this. I urge my \ncolleagues tomorrow, either on voice vote or recorded vote, to adopt \nthe Cardin-Lugar amendment.\n  I would like to add Senators Baucus, and I believe I have, Senator \nTester, as cosponsors of the Bond-Dodd, et al., amendment, No. 4056.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. I commend the work of Senator Dodd on this legislation. We \nhave more work to do.\n  I rise to speak to an amendment I have filed, amendment No. 3891, the \nhomeowners' relief and stabilization amendment.\n  The reason I rise is to speak about a topic we have all talked about \nand we have taken action about over the last couple years. We have had \nsome progress made, but unfortunately not enough progress has been \nmade. I speak tonight about foreclosures.\n  Foreclosures in America are still a huge problem for the American \npeople. RealityTrac, one of the entities that keeps records on \nforeclosures and has been a leading source for this information, tells \nus that the numbers of U.S. residential properties receiving at least \none foreclosure filing jumped 21 percent in 2009 to a record of 2.82 \nmillion housing units.\n  Foreclosure activity has increased sharply in March of 2010. The \nnumber of homes in some stage of the foreclosure process rose from the \nprevious quarter.\n  Given the significant Federal response to the foreclosure crisis, it \nis disheartening--I think that is an understatement--that foreclosure \nfilings in March of 2010 were up nearly 8 percent from March of 2009, \nthe highest monthly total since RealtyTrac began reporting the numbers \nin January of 2005. So we have a ways to go on this very difficult \nchallenge that our Nation has faced.\n  I commend the administration for using the so-called TARP funds, the \nTrouble Asset Relief Program funds, for initiatives to help homeowners, \nwhich I think indicates that the Federal Government is concerned about \nassisting those who have lost their jobs or have seen their home values \nplummet as a result of Wall Street recklessness.\n  You could add a few more words to ``recklessness,'' but in the \ninterest of time, I will not.\n  Despite the actions of the Congress over the last several years, \ndespite the actions of the prior administration and this administration \nespecially, despite all that effort, according to the Congressional \nOversight Panel of the Troubled Asset Relief Fund, as of February of \n2010, 6 million borrowers were more than 60 days delinquent on \nmortgages and only 168,708 homeowners had received final 5-year loan \nmodifications.\n  We have a long way to go and we have to implement, in my judgment, \nnew and different and more effective strategies to deal with \nforeclosures. More must be done to stem this tide of foreclosures that \nhas resulted not only from widespread subprime mortgages but also from \nincreasing unemployment, which has devastated communities and \nneighborhoods across America.\n  This amendment--which I thank both colleagues from New York, Senators \nGillibrand and Schumer, for cosponsoring--would also use TARP dollars \nto help unemployed homeowners. It is very simple: $3 billion would go \ninto a HUD fund to establish a temporary emergency funding relief \nprogram based on a very successful program run in Pennsylvania since \n1983. It has helped tens of thousands of homeowners in Pennsylvania.\n  This may be the most successful mortgage foreclosure relief program \nin the country, at least that I am aware of. Some may want to debate \nthat. But I think in Pennsylvania we have a good track record. We need \nsomething akin to that, something very similar to that on a national \nscale.\n  This program and this idea are designed to respond to high \nunemployment situations where homeowners are temporarily unable to \nafford their monthly mortgage payment due to at least three conditions: \nunemployment, of course; underemployment is another situation; thirdly, \na medical condition could also prevent someone from making their \nmortgage payment every month.\n  Subprime mortgage loans and predatory lending sparked a wave of \nforeclosures, as many borrowers defaulted on loans that they were sold \nusing predatory practices, that they could never afford in the first \nplace to make the payments for. Now the country finds itself in the \nmidst of a second wave--a second wave of foreclosures, where prime \nborrowers struggle to make their monthly payments after a job loss or \nunsuccessful attempts at refinancing or modifications.\n  Despite all of the work that has been done here over the last couple \nof years, despite all of the work done by the administration, we still \nfind borrowers, homeowners, who, because of a job loss or another \nadverse circumstance, cannot make their monthly payments. We need \ndirect help for them. We do not need something around the margins; we \nneed direct help for them.\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\n  The amendment provides for loans to homeowners only after determining \nthe borrower has a reasonable prospect of being able to resume making \nfull mortgage payments, and we will consider their ability to repay in \nestablishing loan terms, conditions, or rates.\n  In addition to the individual homeowner problem--someone who has lost \ntheir job or has some circumstance that prevents them from making their \npayments--in addition to the individual, we have full neighborhoods \nacross the country that continue to suffer from housing price declines, \nlost property tax revenues, abandoned properties, and, of course, \nblight. This amendment would also direct $1 billion of TARP funds to \nthe Neighborhood Stabilization Program created by the Housing and \nEconomic Recovery Act of 2008 to provide grants to State and local \ngovernments and eligible entities to purchase and redevelop foreclosed \nand abandoned properties with the goal of stabilizing communities. So \nthis is a neighborhood problem in addition to being a problem with \nindividual homeowners.\n  The language from this amendment was included in H.R. 4173, the Wall \nStreet Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2009 which passed the \nHouse of Representatives late last year.\n  In conclusion, I wish to reemphasize the need for this type of an \namendment because we still, unfortunately, have not tackled the \nforeclosure problem in America. In fact, it is a foreclosure crisis \nwhich will prevent us from having an economy that is in full recovery. \nWe did the right thing by making sure the TARP dollars were able to \nsustain what happened in the strategy to help our financial companies \naround the United States of America, especially those that were in real \ntrouble in 2008 and 2009. We did the right thing on the recovery bill. \nWe did the right thing on the HIRE Act a couple of months ago. We have \ntaken a lot of steps to rescue and stabilize our economy. We are \ngrowing now. We have some growth. We have some employment growth. But \nunless we tackle completely the foreclosure problem with a very direct, \nfocused effort, we are not going to fully recover and we are not going \nto have the kind of economic growth we should.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to join Senator Schumer, Senator \nGillibrand, me, and others in voting for and seeking the passage of \nthis amendment, No. 3791, the homeowners relief and neighborhood \nstabilization amendment.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nby Senator Corker of Tennessee on preemption be in order, and that the \nside-by-side amendment offered by Senator Carper be in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life of Marine LT \nBrandon Barrett from Marion, IN. Brandon was only 27 years old when he \nlost his life on May 5 while serving bravely in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom in Afghanistan.\n  Lieutenant Barrett was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 6th Marine \nRegiment, 2nd Marine Division, II Marine Expeditionary Force at Camp \nLejeune.\n  Today, I join family and friends in mourning his death who will \nforever remember him as a loving son, brother, and friend. He is \nsurvived by his mother, Cindy Barrett, his father, Brett Barrett, his \nsisters, Ashley and Taylor Barrett and his brother, Brock Barrett.\n  Brandon was a native of Marion. Prior to entering the Marine Corps in \n2006, Brandon graduated from Marion High School and attended the U.S. \nNaval Academy. His family and friends describe him as a bright student, \na gifted football and baseball star, and a proud Hoosier who \ncourageously refused to take freedom for granted.\n  Brandon was deployed on his second tour of duty in Afghanistan. \nDuring his service, Brandon earned an array of awards, including the \nNavy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, National Defense Service \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal and NATO International Security Assistance Force Medal.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we take pride \nin the example of this American hero. We cherish the legacy of his \nservice and his life.\n  As I search for words to honor this fallen Marine, I recall President \nLincoln's words to the families of the fallen at Gettysburg: ``We \ncannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. \nThe brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated \nit, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little \nnote nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what \nthey did here.''\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Brandon Barrett in the Record \nof the U.S. Senate for his service to our country and for his profound \ncommitment to freedom, democracy, and peace.\n  I pray that Brandon's family finds comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3819-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3819-S3820]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

HICKEL\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, on Saturday morning, May 8, \nAlaskans awakened to the sad news that our beloved former Governor, \nWalter J. Hickel, passed away at the age of 90.\n  While those in my State viewed him as an Alaska legend, students of \nAmerican political history may recall Governor Hickel more vividly as \nPresident Nixon's first Secretary of the Interior. They may recall that \nHickel left that position after criticizing President Nixon for his \nhandling of the Vietnam war and the student protests that gripped the \nNation over our involvement in Southeast Asia.\n  In 1970, following what has come to be known as the ``Kent State \nMassacre,'' Secretary Hickel wrote a letter urging President Nixon to \ngive more respect to the views of young people critical of the war. \nThat letter included the passage, ``I believe this administration finds \nitself today embracing a philosophy which appears to lack appropriate \nconcern for the attitude of a great mass of Americans--our young \npeople.''\n  On November 25, 1970, Governor Hickel was fired over the letter. His \nfiring came days after he told ``60 Minutes'' that he had no intention \nof quitting. He said he would only go away ``with an arrow in my heart, \nnot a bullet in my back.'' The Nixon administration was all too pleased \nto oblige.\n  If President Kennedy were still alive, he surely would have viewed \nthis series of events as a ``profile in courage.'' To this day, when \nAlaskans are asked for one word that describes Walter Hickel, the word \n``backbone'' immediately comes to mind.\n  They may have fired Wally Hickel but they didn't silence him. \nGovernor Hickel left the national political scene following this \nincident to focus on Alaska and the Arctic, and his independence, his \njudgment, and his backbone inspired leaders of Alaska for decades to \ncome.\n  Governor Hickel appreciated that public policy is a team effort, not \nan individual sport. Two of Governor Hickel's enduring legacies to the \nState--Commonwealth North, Alaska's leading public affairs forum, and \nthe Institute of the North, a public policy think-tank--continue to \nshape public discourse today. Governor Hickel would be proud that last \nweek, even as Alaskans grieved his loss, the Institute of the North \nconducted its annual Emerging Leaders Dialogue in Sitka.\n  Governor Hickel's life was large, as large as all of Alaska. Alaska \nis one of the few corners of America in which legends can still be \nmade. And Governor Hickel surely will go down in history as an Alaska \nlegend.\n  Born August 18, 1919, in Kansas, Walter J. Hickel came to Alaska in \n1940 with 37 cents in his pocket. As he sailed into Prince William \nSound on the S.S. Yukon, overwhelmed by the breathtaking natural \nbeauty, Hickel remarked, ``You take care of me, and I'll take care of \nyou.''\n  The words were prophetic. After working as a bartender, a carpenter, \nand an aircraft inspector, Governor Hickel saved enough money to \npurchase a half-completed house. He finished building the house, sold \nit, and then built two more. Eventually, he built several hundred \nhomes.\n  Long time Fairbanks newspaper columnist Dermot Cole recalls Governor \nHickel's success in enlisting community support to build Fairbanks' \nfirst modern hotel in 1955. Fairbanks needed a hotel, and Governor \nHickel needed financing. He asked the Fairbanks community to invest in \nits future by purchasing bonds to finance the project, and 583 \nbondholders invested in the project. The smallest investment was $10, \nthe largest $25,000. The project was built in 7 months. The bondholders \nwere paid back by 1960. And that hotel, The Travelers Inn, still greets \nvisitors to Alaska's Golden Heart City. Today, it is known as the \nWestmark Fairbanks.\n  Governor Hickel went on to build Anchorage's Captain Cook Hotel, as a \nshow of confidence in the economy of Southcentral Alaska following the \n1964 earthquake. Today, the Captain Cook Hotel offers 547 rooms, in 3 \ntowers, and is Alaska's member of the Preferred Hotel Group.\n  Alaska sure took care of Wally Hickel, and Governor Hickel more than \nfulfilled his promise to take care of Alaska, proving that economic \ndevelopment and environmental conservation are not mutually exclusive \nconcepts. His life demonstrates that a developer can be a \nconservationist and a conservationist can be a developer. One is left \nto wonder which title he preferred.\n  Governor Hickel believed that economies can be grown through big \nprojects. He certainly was not one who shared the view prevalent in \nsome circles of the Lower 48, that Alaska should be locked up as a \nmuseum to compensate for poor land use decisions made elsewhere in \nAmerica. During a 1978 interview, he referred to Alaska as a ``happy, \nyoung, vibrant country.'' Blunt and honest, he lamented those who \nargued, ``Don't walk here. Don't walk there. Don't step on the \ndandelions. You can't use this.'' He referred to this kind of thinking \nas ``What a bunch of bull.''\n  Yet this is the same Walter Hickel who dispatched legions of Interior \nDepartment employees to commemorate the first observance of Earth Day \nin 1969; the same Walter Hickel who told the National Petroleum Council \nin 1970, ``The right to produce [petroleum] is not the right to \npollute. America must prove to itself as well as to others worldwide \nthat it has the ability to clean up the garbage it has left in its \nwake.''\n  He insisted that those who benefited from the development of Alaska's \nresources pay Alaskans their due. And during Governor Hickel's second \nstint as Governor during the 1990s, the major oil companies were \npersuaded to pay the State more than $4 billion in disputed back taxes \nand royalties. Historian Stephen Haycox refers to this as ``a very \nsignificant legacy . . . because he forced the oil companies to \nacknowledge that they had a debt they owed to Alaska.'' In the wake of \nthe Exxon Valdez oilspill, Governor Hickel used settlement funds to \npurchase land for Kachemak Bay State Park and Afognak State Park.\n  I could go on all day about the life of Wally Hickel. A man who \nconstantly struggled with dyslexia, he authored several books and \nmonographs and many articles. A self-educated individual, he received \nnumerous honorary degrees and befriended foreign heads of state.\n  A fighter for Alaska's statehood, Hickel attended the birth of the \nState of Alaska. And history will remember that very little of \nsignificance happened in Alaska in the ensuing 50 years that Walter J. \nHickel was not involved in. It is no overstatement to suggest that \nGovernor Hickel had a substantial hand in Alaska's start, its present, \nand its future.\n  During Alaska's 50th anniversary of statehood celebration last year, \nI marveled at the fact that so many of the people who made our history \nare still alive and available to inspire succeeding generations of \nAlaskans as we continue to grow our State. I would like to think that \ngiants such as Wally Hickel could live forever.\n  On behalf of all of our Senate colleagues, I extend condolences to \nGovernor Hickel's wife Ermalee, his children, grandchildren, and great \ngrandchildren. Thank you for sharing this\n\n[[Page S3821]]\n\ngreat American with Alaska and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3821-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3821]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO WALTER SCOTT, JR.\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, on the occasion of his \n79th birthday, I want to take this opportunity to honor fellow \nNebraskan Walter Scott, Jr. for his exceptional business and civic \nleadership and his significant contributions to the telecommunications, \nconstruction, and mining industries, as well as his community, State, \nand country.\n  Walter began his distinguished career at Peter Kiewit Sons' Inc., \nformerly Kiewit Construction, working during the summers for Kiewit's \nconstruction operations, where his father also worked. In 1953 after \nearning his civil engineering degree from Colorado State University, he \nbecame an engineer for Kiewit in Omaha. A year later, Walter joined the \nU.S. Air Force as an air installation officer, inspecting military \nconstruction projects. Upon returning to Kiewit after his service, \nWalter excelled in the company, being elected to the board of \ndirectors, then becoming vice president in 1964. In 1979 Walter was \nnamed president and, later that year, succeeded Peter Kiewit as \nchairman of the board.\n  Over the next decade, Walter used his leadership and keen insights to \nadvance Kiewit and develop the company to its full potential. \nForeseeing the needs of society, Walter began diversifying the \ncompany's investment to include mining, energy, and telecommunications \ninterests. By 1992 this expansion had led to the division of Peter \nKiewit Sons' Inc. into two major subsidiaries: Kiewit Construction \nGroup, continuing the company's historical excellence in construction \nand mining; and Kiewit Diversified Group, later renamed Level 3 \nCommunications, focusing on high-speed fiber optics networks and \ngeothemeral powerplants. Kiewit is now a Fortune 500 company and is a \nrecognized industry leader.\n  To this day, Walter remains engaged in the industries he helped to \nshape, continuing as director and chairman emeritus at Kiewit and \nserving as chairman of the board at level 3. Walter's numerous \ncontributions to business have been acknowledged with dozens of \naccolades, including the Horatio Alger Award, the Golden Plate Award \nfrom the American Academy of Achievement, and induction into the \nNebraska Business Hall of Fame.\n  Beyond his notable accomplishments in business, Walter's civic \nservice and philanthropic contributions have enriched Nebraska and left \na lasting impact on our home State. In 1996 Walter helped create the \nPeter Kiewit Institute, working with the University of Nebraska to \nprovide tomorrow's leaders in information science, technology, and \nengineering with an unparalleled education.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to establish a \n     National Military Family Relief Fund and create a simple and \n     cost-effective way for taxpayers to lend a helping hand to \n     military families in need; to the Committee on Armed \n     Services.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 43\n\n       Whereas, United States service members, especially national \n     guardsmen and reservists, often face a significant salary \n     reduction when called upon to serve our country; and\n       Whereas, recent studies show that fifty-five percent of \n     married national guard members and reservists report a loss \n     of income in relation to their civilian jobs when they are \n     called to active duty, and fifteen percent experience a pay \n     cut of thirty thousand dollars or more; and\n       Whereas, national guard members and reservists serving in \n     the Global War On Terrorism make up a larger percentage of \n     frontline fighting forces than in any other war in U.S. \n     history; and\n       Whereas, all military families deserve thanks and \n     recognition for their sacrifices, and helping to ease the \n     financial pressures that challenge so many of America's \n     finest families must be a top priority; and\n       Whereas, U.S. Congressman Bill Foster has introduced House \n     Resolution 5941, legislation designed to provide relief for \n     military families that would allow taxpayers to contribute to \n     a National Military Family Relief Fund by filling a voluntary \n     donation in a check-off box on federal income tax forms; and\n       Whereas, the individually determined donation for the \n     National Military Family Relief Fund would be added to the \n     supporter's tax bill or deducted from a rebate allowing U.S. \n     citizens to support military families without placing any \n     extra burden on the federal budget; and\n       Whereas, all service members and veterans who are serving, \n     or have served, in Iraq or Afghanistan or other regions of \n     service would be eligible for grants from the National \n     Military Family Relief Fund; and\n       Whereas, military family relief funds have already been \n     introduced or established in at least twenty-seven states \n     with citizens, corporations and community organizations \n     proving an eagerness to lend a helping hand by generously \n     donating to military families in need. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to approve H.R. 5941 to \n     establish a National Military Family Relief Fund and create a \n     simple and cost-effective way for taxpayers to lend a helping \n     hand to military families in need; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-101. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah expressing support for policies that \n     promote and foster energy innovation development in the state \n     of Utah; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 15\n\n       Whereas, 23 U.S.C. Sec. 159 requires states to enact \n     legislation requiring the revocation or suspension of an \n     individual's driver license for at least six months upon \n     conviction of any drug-related offense;\n       Whereas, 23 U.S.C. Sec. 159 requires withholding 10% of \n     certain federal aid from states that fail to enact this \n     legislation;\n       Whereas, the federal government should not dictate policy \n     or legislation of this kind for the state;\n       Whereas, for Utah to be exempt from this federal \n     requirement, the Governor must submit to the United States \n     Secretary of Transportation a written certification that he \n     is opposed to the enactment or enforcement of a law related \n     to revocation of a person's driver license for any drug-\n     related offense, and also submit a written certification that \n     the Utah Legislature has adopted a resolution expressing \n     opposition to the federal requirement; and\n       Whereas, the state of Utah shall enforce its own driver \n     license law, which provides that Utah's Driver License \n     Division is not required to suspend a person's license for a \n     violation of certain drug-related offenses if the violation \n     did not involve a motor vehicle and the convicted person is \n     participating in, or has successfully completed, substance \n     abuse treatment at a licensed substance abuse treatment \n     program that is approved by the Division of Substance Abuse \n     and Mental Health or is participating in, or has successfully \n     completed, probation through the Department of Corrections \n     Adult Probation and Parole: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, declare their opposition to the \n     enactment or enforcement of a federal law mandating, in all \n     circumstances, the revocation or suspension of an \n     individual's driver license upon conviction of any drug-\n     related offense; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor declare the \n     state's determination to enforce its own law on the subject, \n     which provides that persons convicted of certain drug-related \n     offenses will not have their driver licenses revoked or \n     suspended if the violation did not involve a motor vehicle \n     and the convicted person is participating in, or has \n     successfully completed, substance abuse treatment at a \n     licensed substance abuse treatment program that is approved \n     by the Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health or is \n     participating in, or has successfully completed, probation \n     through the Department of Corrections Adult Probation and \n     Parole; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be prepared and \n     delivered to the Governor of the state of Utah, and that the \n     Governor submit a copy of the resolution to the United States \n     Secretary of Transportation; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Utah Department of Transportation and to the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-102. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to amend federal law to \n     ensure that consumers have the right to access their Fair \n     Isaac Corporation credit scores or any other source for \n     credit scores used by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or Ginnie Mae \n     from the three major credit agencies annually at no cost; to \n     the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 7\n\n       Whereas, under the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions \n     Act of 2003, consumers are entitled to a free credit report \n     once each year from any credit agency, including the nation's \n     three major credit bureaus, which are Experian, Trans Union, \n     and Equifax;\n       Whereas, the credit scores used in over 90% of financial \n     transactions, including Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie \n     Mae, are a version of a Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO) credit \n     score;\n       Whereas, FICO's website, www.MyFico.com, is the only \n     location where consumers may access their true FICO credit \n     scores;\n       Whereas, FICO takes the credit information furnished by \n     Experian, Trans Union, and Equifax and calculates that \n     information using an algorithm to develop the three credit \n     scores;\n       Whereas, after Experian partially severed its relationship \n     with FICO in 2009, consumers can no longer access their FICO/\n     Experian credit score;\n       Whereas, now consumers can only access their Trans Union/\n     FICO and Equifax/FICO credit scores on FICO's website, and \n     they are charged $14.95 each, while lenders and other \n     creditors can still access all three FICO credit scores from \n     the three major credit agencies;\n       Whereas, although other companies have developed their own \n     credit scores using their own formulas, ranges, and scores, \n     lenders and creditors and other financial service companies \n     generally do not consider them reliable;\n       Whereas, these scores generated by other companies are \n     often found to be substantially different than the FICO \n     credit scores, even though they are widely promoted as the \n     actual consumer credit score;\n       Whereas, current federal law should be changed to address \n     the consumers' right to access their FICO credit scores from \n     the three major credit agencies once each year;\n       Whereas, when consumers access their free credit report \n     from www.AnnualCreditReport.com, they should be given the \n     right to their FICO credit scores annually at no cost;\n       Whereas, credit agencies should not be required to bear any \n     pass through costs from FICO in providing free FICO credit \n     scores once each year to consumers;\n       Whereas, credit agencies should allow consumers the right \n     to access their credit scores from each major credit agency \n     used by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae; and\n       Whereas, by making it possible for consumers to access \n     their credit scores, which are used in almost every financial \n     transaction, true fairness will return to the credit scoring \n     access system: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urge the United States Congress \n     to amend federal law to ensure that consumers have the right \n     to access their Fair Isaac Corporation credit scores or any \n     other source for credit scores used by Fannie Mae, Freddie \n     Mac, or Ginnie Mae from the three major credit agencies \n     annually at no cost; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-103. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging the President and Congress to \n     refrain from designating new national monuments in the San \n     Rafael Swell area, the Cedar Mesa area, and any other area in \n     Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, the Antiquities Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 431, empowers \n     the President of the United States to singlehandedly bypass \n     congressional, state, and local land management policies and \n     tie up any federal land in Utah through national monument \n     declarations;\n\n[[Page S3823]]\n\n       Whereas, a recent confirmed United States Department of \n     Interior (DOI) internal memorandum declares that the 75-by-40 \n     mile San Rafael Swell and surrounding ``canyons, gorges, \n     mesas, and buttes,'' plus an area of unspecified size \n     referred to as the Cedar Mesa area, among others, ``may be \n     good candidates for National Monument designation under the \n     Antiquities Act;''\n       Whereas, the San Rafael Swell and surrounding areas and the \n     Cedar Mesa area described in the DOI memorandum are in Emery, \n     Wayne, and San Juan Counties, Utah;\n       Whereas, Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United \n     States Constitution grants the United States government the \n     power to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over the District of \n     Columbia and over all ``places purchased by the consent of \n     the Legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for \n     the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and \n     other needful buildings'';\n       Whereas, no lands in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa \n     areas of Utah fit into this category;\n       Whereas, the United States Constitution delegates to the \n     government of the United States no other power of exclusive \n     jurisdiction over land in Utah, other than that referenced in \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 17;\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution states, ``The powers not delegated to the United \n     States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the \n     States, are reserved to the States'';\n       Whereas, Article IV, Section 4 of the United States \n     Constitution states, ``The United States shall guarantee to \n     every State in the Union a Republican Form of Government'';\n       Whereas, the constitutional guarantee to Utah of a \n     republican form of government is abrogated and violated when \n     the President of the United States purports through the \n     Antiquities Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 431, to exercise exclusive \n     jurisdiction with the mere stroke of a pen over lands in the \n     San Rafael and Cedar Mesa areas that do not fit the category \n     of Article I, Section 8, Clause 17, exclusive jurisdiction \n     land;\n       Whereas, lands in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa areas \n     of Utah are currently managed by the United States Bureau of \n     Land Management (BLM) pursuant to the Federal Land Policy \n     Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976, and the Act directs the BLM \n     to manage public lands according to Resource Management Plans \n     (RMPs) which ``shall be consistent with State and local plans \n     to the maximum extent [the Secretary of Interior] finds \n     consistent with Federal law and the purpose of [FLPMA]'';\n       Whereas, the state of Utah and the counties of Emery, \n     Wayne, and San Juan have recently completed an expensive and \n     protracted multi-year FLPMA and National Environmental Policy \n     Act (NEPA) process with the BLM and the public to revise and \n     update the BLM's RMPs in planning areas which include the San \n     Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa areas;\n       Whereas, the revised RMPs do not call for the creation of \n     national monuments in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa \n     areas;\n       Whereas, creating national monuments in the San Rafael \n     Swell and Cedar Mesa areas would violate and undercut the \n     integrity of the RMPs revision process in Emery, Wayne, and \n     San Juan Counties where the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa \n     areas are situated, and would be inconsistent with the plans \n     and policies of the state of Utah and those counties and \n     their duly elected governmental boards and leaders, all in \n     violation of the constitutional guarantee of a republican \n     form of government as well as violating federal statutory \n     consistency requirements of FLPMA;\n       Whereas, a presidential proclamation declaring national \n     monuments in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa areas would \n     single-handedly bypass the revised RMPs and the universal \n     opposition by the duly elected leaders of the state of Utah \n     and the counties where those lands lie;\n       Whereas, a presidential proclamation of this type would \n     constitute an illegitimate arrogation of exclusive \n     jurisdiction over lands by the President, exceeding the \n     bounds of legitimate and lawful authority permitted by the \n     United States Constitution;\n       Whereas, the Antiquities Act states, ``The President . . . \n     may reserve as a part [of a national monument] parcels of \n     land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to \n     the smallest areas compatible with the proper care and \n     management of the objects to be protected. . . .''\n       Whereas, the size of the 1996 Grand Staircase National \n     Monument in Garfield and Kane Counties far exceeded ``the \n     smallest areas compatible'' with the feigned object of that \n     monument;\n       Whereas, the size of the San Rafael Swell area stated in \n     the DOI memo, namely 75-by-40 miles plus surrounding canyons, \n     gorges, mesas, and buttes, is staggering in terms of a \n     national monument;\n       Whereas, Utah favors protecting the remarkably scenic, \n     recreational, and sensitive areas of the San Rafael Swell and \n     Cedar Mesa areas, however highest and best use of vast \n     tracts of land in those areas is continued grazing and \n     environmentally sensitive energy and mineral development \n     done in such a way as to protect and preserve the scenic \n     and recreational values;\n       Whereas, as history has demonstrated in the case of the \n     Grand Staircase National Monument, many thousands of acres of \n     important grazing and mineral and other multiple use \n     resources and values have been closed to reasonable \n     development due to the multi-hundred thousand acre national \n     monument designation;\n       Whereas, Senator Bob Bennett has introduced S. 3016 in the \n     United States Senate, which would prohibit the further \n     extension or establishment of national monuments in Utah, \n     except by express authorization of Congress; and\n       Whereas, Utah's economy, industry, culture, way of life, \n     and its viability as a sovereign state guaranteed a \n     republican form of government depend on reasonable multiple-\n     use access to the BLM lands in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar \n     Mesa areas of the state, most of which will be taken away \n     through national monument designation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, express their opposition to the \n     presidential creation of any large area national monument, as \n     an abuse and violation of the Antiquities Act's smallest-\n     area-compatible mandate;

be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor declare \n     openly to the United States government that this unchecked \n     exercise of power concentrated in the President portends \n     serious consequences for Utah, as nearly 70% of the State is \n     federally owned; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor declare \n     openly to the United States government that the exercise of \n     this power would essentially coronate the President, giving \n     him the ultimate ability to determine the fate of nearly 70% \n     of the entire state with the mere stroke of an unchecked \n     presidential pen; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     Congress to check the President's ability to exercise such \n     power by amending the Antiquities Act to clarify its actual \n     intent, which is to establish small discrete monuments or \n     memorials as existed in Utah prior to the unfortunate \n     creation of the 1996 Grand Staircase National Monument;

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging the President and Congress to \n     refrain from designating new national monuments in the San \n     Rafael Swell area, the Cedar Mesa area, and any other area in \n     Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, the Antiquities Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 31, empowers \n     the President of the United States to singlehandedly bypass \n     congressional, state, and local land management policies and \n     tie up any federal land in Utah through national monument \n     declarations;\n\n[[Page S3826]]\n\n       Whereas, a recent confirmed United States Department of \n     Interior (DOI) internal memorandum declares that the 75-by-40 \n     mile San Rafael Swell and surrounding ``canyons, gorges, \n     mesas, and buttes,'' plus an area of unspecified size \n     referred to as the Cedar Mesa area, among others, ``may be \n     good candidates for National Monument designation under the \n     Antiquities Act'';\n       Whereas, the San Rafael Swell and surrounding areas and the \n     Cedar Mesa area described in the DOI memorandum are in Emery, \n     Wayne, and San Juan Counties, Utah;\n       Whereas, Article I, Section 8, Clause 17 of the United \n     States Constitution grants the United States government the \n     power to exercise exclusive jurisdiction over the District of \n     Columbia and over all ``places purchased by the consent of \n     the Legislature of the State in which the same shall be, for \n     the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dock-yards, and \n     other needful buildings'';\n       Whereas, no lands in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa \n     areas of Utah fit into this category;\n       Whereas, the United States Constitution delegates to the \n     government of the United States no other power of exclusive \n     jurisdiction over land in Utah, other than that referenced in \n     Article I, Section 8, Clause 17;\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution states, ``The powers not delegated to the United \n     States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the \n     States, are reserved to the States'';\n       Whereas, Article IV, Section 4 of the United States \n     Constitution states, ``The United States shall guarantee to \n     every State in the Union a Republican Form of Government'';\n       Whereas, the constitutional guarantee to Utah of a \n     republican form of government is abrogated and violated when \n     the President of the United States purports through the \n     Antiquities Act, 16 U.S.C. Sec. 431, to exercise exclusive \n     jurisdiction with the mere stroke of a pen over lands in the \n     San Rafael and Cedar Mesa areas that do not fit the category \n     of Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17, exclusive jurisdiction \n     land;\n       Whereas, lands in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa areas \n     of Utah are currently managed by the United States Bureau of \n     Land Management (BLM) pursuant to the Federal Land Policy \n     Management Act (FLPMA) of 1976, and, the Act directs the BLM \n     to manage public lands according to Resource Management Plans \n     (RMPs) which ``shall be consistent with State and local plans \n     to the maximum extent [the Secretary of Interior} finds \n     consistent with Federal law and the purpose of [FLPMA]'';\n       Whereas, the state of Utah and the counties of Emery, \n     Wayne, and San Juan have recently completed an expensive and \n     protracted multi-year FLPMA and National Environmental Policy \n     Act (NEPA) process with the BLM and the public to revise and \n     update the BLM's RMPs in planning areas which include the San \n     Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa areas;\n       Whereas, the revised RMPs do not call for the creation of \n     national monuments in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa \n     areas;\n       Whereas, creating national monuments in the San Rafael \n     Swell and Cedar Mesa areas would violate and undercut the \n     integrity of the RMPs revision process in Emery, Wayne, and \n     San Juan Counties where the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa \n     areas are situated, and would be inconsistent with the plans \n     and policies of the state of Utah and those counties and \n     their duly elected governmental boards and leaders, all in \n     violation of the constitutional guarantee of a republican \n     form of government as well as violating federal statutory \n     consistency requirements of FLPMA;\n       Whereas, a presidential proclamation declaring national \n     monuments in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar Mesa areas would \n     single-handedly bypass the revised RMPs and the universal \n     opposition by the duly elected leaders of the state of Utah \n     and the counties where those lands lie;\n       Whereas, a presidential proclamation of this type would \n     constitute an illegitimate arrogation of exclusive \n     jurisdiction over lands by the President, exceeding the \n     bounds of legitimate and lawful authority permitted by the \n     United States Constitution;\n       Whereas, the Antiquities Act states, ``The President . . . \n     may reserve as a part [of a national monument] parcels of \n     land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to \n     the smallest areas compatible with the proper care and \n     management of the objects to be protected.\n       Whereas, the size of the 1996 Grand Staircase National \n     Monument in Garfield and Kane Counties far exceeded ``the \n     smallest areas compatible'' with the feigned object of that \n     monument;\n       Whereas, the size of the San Rafael Swell area stated in \n     the DOI memo, namely 75-by-40 miles plus surrounding canyons, \n     gorges, mesas, and buttes, is staggering in terms of a \n     national monument;\n       Whereas, Utah favors protecting the remarkably scenic, \n     recreational, and sensitive areas of the San Rafael Swell and \n     Cedar Mesa areas, however the highest and best use of vast \n     tracts of land in those areas is continued grazing and \n     environmentally sensitive energy and mineral development done \n     in such a way as to protect and preserve the scenic and \n     recreational values;\n       Whereas, as history has demonstrated in the case of the \n     Grand Staircase National Monument, many thousands of acres of \n     important grazing and mineral and other multiple use \n     resources and values have been closed to reasonable \n     development due to the multi-hundred thousand acre national \n     monument designation;\n       Whereas, Senator Bob Bennett has introduced S. 3016 in the \n     United States Senate, which would prohibit the further \n     extension or establishment of national monuments in Utah, \n     except by express authorization of Congress; and\n       Whereas, Utah's economy, industry, culture, way of life, \n     and its viability as a sovereign state guaranteed a \n     republican form of government depend on reasonable multiple-\n     use access to the BLM lands in the San Rafael Swell and Cedar \n     Mesa areas of the State, most of which will be taken away \n     through national monument designation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, express their opposition to the \n     presidential creation of any large area national monument, as \n     an abuse and violation of the Antiquities Act's smallest-\n     area-compatible mandate; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor oppose the \n     presidential creation of new national monuments in the San \n     Rafael Swell area, Cedar Mesa area, and any other area of \n     Utah; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor declare \n     openly to the United States government that this unchecked \n     exercise of power concentrated in the President portends \n     serious consequences for Utah, as nearly 70% of the State is \n     federally owned; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor declare \n     openly to the United States government that the exercise of \n     this power would essentially coronate the President, giving \n     him the ultimate ability to determine the fate of nearly 70% \n     of the entire state with the mere stroke of an unchecked \n     presidential pen; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge \n     Congress to check the President's ability to exercise such \n     power by amending the Antiquities Act to clarify its actual \n     intent, which is to establish small discrete monuments or \n     memorials as existed in Utah prior to the unfortunate \n     creation of the 1996 Grand Staircase National Monument; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor strongly \n     urge the federal government to manage federal public lands in \n     Utah according to state and local government plans, policies, \n     and public input as promised by the Federal Land Policy \n     Management Act of 1976 and the United States constitutional \n     guarantee of a republican form of government on equal footing \n     with all states in the Union, or otherwise convey the federal \n     public lands to Utah for proper care and management, \n     consistent with the original intent of the Constitution's \n     Framers; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor express \n     support for S 3016, introduced in the United States Senate, \n     which would prohibit the further extension or establishment \n     of national monuments in Utah, except by express \n     authorization of Congress; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor express \n     strong opposition to presidential or congressional action \n     that would unnecessarily restrict and reduce public access to \n     federal lands; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-110.

to the \n     Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 1\n\n       Whereas, the economic prosperity of the United States is \n     best served by embracing free and fair trade in global \n     markets, investing in innovative research and technologies, \n     and providing assistance to workers impacted by technology \n     and trade trends;\n       Whereas, expanding trade opportunities for American workers \n     and businesses depends on cooperation between the federal \n     government and the states;\n       Whereas, the trade liberalization efforts of the early \n     1990s and trade agreements such as the North American Free \n     Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization Uruguay \n     Round agreements have increased the need for state \n     policymakers to play a greater role in international trade \n     decisions;\n       Whereas, trade liberalization has transformed the \n     historical state-federal division of power into one of \n     necessary and critical partnership, and thereby taxed state \n     agency resources in determining the impact on state laws and \n     regulations;\n       Whereas, state sovereignty should be preserved by the \n     federal government in trade promotion activities;\n       Whereas, states often lack a clearly defined institutional \n     trade policy structure and resources, making it difficult to \n     handle requests from trading partners and federal agencies, \n     and to articulate to a unified state stance on trade issues;\n       Whereas, recent trade agreements have proceeded beyond just \n     discussion of tariffs and quotas and now substantially \n     address and affect government regulation, taxation, \n     procurement, and economic development policies that are \n     historically legislated and implemented at state and local \n     levels;\n       Whereas, recent trade agreements that proceed beyond \n     tariffs and quotas intersect with traditional areas of state \n     authority under the Tenth Amendment of the United States \n     Constitution, such as regulating the environment, health, and \n     safety and, thus, have a major impact on the states' \n     continuing authority to legislate and regulate in these \n     areas;\n       Whereas, international lawsuits may be brought against the \n     United States alleging that its states and localities have \n     violated trade agreements;\n       Whereas, international trade agreements must ensure that \n     non-discriminatory state laws and regulations adopted for a \n     public purpose and with due process are not preempted or \n     otherwise undermined and weakened by international sanctions \n     or penalties;\n       Whereas, states' interests must be paramount during the \n     negotiation of international agreements given the direct \n     impact on their police powers, policies, and programs;\n       Whereas, there is a need for a strong federal-state trade \n     policy consultation mechanism;\n       Whereas, the Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee, a \n     state-supported advisory committee to the United States Trade \n     Representative, plays an important role in providing state \n     input to the United States Trade Representative but which is \n     limited in its effectiveness by an inability to share \n     classified information with relevant state officials and \n     members of the general public;\n       Whereas, compartmentalization of information within the \n     Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee prevents members \n     from gathering important and relevant information from those \n     state officials and members of the general public;\n       Whereas, in August 2004, the Intergovernmental Policy \n     Advisory Committee recommended that a federal-state \n     International Trade Policy Commission would be an ideal \n     resource for objective trade policy analysis and would foster \n     communication among federal and state trade policy officials;\n       Whereas, the creation of an effective federal-state trade \n     policy infrastructure would assist states in understanding \n     the scope of federal trade efforts, would assist federal \n     agencies in understanding the various state trade processes, \n     and would give states meaningful input into the development \n     and implementation of United States Trade Representative's \n     activities;\n       Whereas, federal-state consultation should include the \n     timely and comprehensive sharing of information on the \n     substance and likely impact of trade agreements on state laws \n     and regulations, appropriate use of the state single points \n     of contact, improved trade data to assess the impact of \n     proposed and existing agreements, and a reasonable \n     opportunity for meaningful input by the states; and\n       Whereas, in 2006, the Utah State Legislature statutorily \n     created the Utah International Trade Commission to study and \n     make recommendations to the Legislature concerning the impact \n     of international agreements adopted by the United States on \n     the Legislature's constitutional power to regulate state \n     affairs, public and private, and to promote Utah exports: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urge Congress to improve \n     federal-state consultation on international trade, including \n     improving the availability of data to states necessary to \n     evaluate the impact of free trade agreements on economic \n     development within the states and state authority;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging Congress to refrain from instituting \n     a new federal review, oversight, or preemption of state \n     health laws, refrain from creating a federal health insurance \n     exchange or connector, and refrain from creating a federal \n     health insurance public plan option; to the Committee on \n     Finance.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, the Tenth Amendment to the United States \n     Constitution states, ``The\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\n     powers not delegated to the United States by the \n     Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are \n     reserved to the States respectively, or to the people'';\n       Whereas, the states primarily regulate today's health \n     insurance market, provide aggressive oversight on all aspects \n     of this market, and enforce consumer protection as well as \n     ensure local, responsive presence for consumers;\n       Whereas, the state-based system of health insurance \n     regulation has served all interests well;\n       Whereas, the United States Congress is considering \n     legislation that may impose restrictions on states' ability \n     to regulate health plans, including overriding already \n     adopted state patient protections;\n       Whereas, Congress is considering legislation that would \n     mandate the purchase of health care insurance by all \n     Americans and require those who do not comply to pay a fine, \n     in effect unfairly forcing Americans to buy health insurance;\n       Whereas, the creation of a new federal system of regulation \n     for health insurance would be inefficient, unnecessary, not \n     cost-effective, and an additional burden on the health care \n     delivery system;\n       Whereas, private sector health plans are leaders in \n     innovations to improve quality, benefits, and customer \n     service that government-sponsored health plans have been slow \n     to adopt;\n       Whereas, Congress is considering legislation that would \n     create a federal health insurance exchange or connector to \n     facilitate the purchase of health insurance by individuals \n     and small employers, including offering a new public plan \n     option;\n       Whereas, a federal exchange would create conflicting state \n     and federal rules, resulting in consumer confusion and \n     leading to adverse selection;\n       Whereas, a federal exchange would require substantial \n     resources to create a new federal entity that duplicates \n     functions currently performed by states;\n       Whereas, a federal exchange would undermine states' \n     oversight role in health insurance and cause a substantial \n     shift in the regulation of the health insurance market from \n     the states to the federal government;\n       Whereas, a federal exchange would undermine state authority \n     to design programs that reflect local needs;\n       Whereas, a new public plan would not improve competition, \n     but would result in an uneven playing field that would shift \n     costs to the private sector and undermine private plans;\n       Whereas, a new public health insurance plan would be \n     subject to constant federal changes; and\n       Whereas, a new public plan is unnecessary in light of the \n     private sector's product offerings and innovations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     the United States Congress to refrain from instituting a new \n     federal review, oversight, or preemption of state health \n     insurance laws, refrain from creating a federal health \n     insurance exchange or connector, and refrain from creating a \n     federal health insurance public plan option; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to the \n     members of Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-114. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging Congress to refuse to enact, and \n     the President of the United States to refuse to sign, any \n     legislation that imposes further restrictions on any state's \n     ability to regulate the payment and delivery of health care, \n     imposes additional financial burden related to health care on \n     any state, or limits the ability of consumers and businesses \n     to create innovative models for higher quality, lower cost \n     health care; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, people's health affects not only their sense of \n     well being, but their capacity to contribute to their \n     families, to their employers, and to society at large;\n       Whereas, the improvement and maintenance of individual \n     health depends to a significant extent on the widespread \n     availability of affordable, high quality health care;\n       Whereas, the widespread availability of affordable, high \n     quality health care is threatened by long-term runaway \n     spending in a system that too often delivers suboptimal care;\n       Whereas, runaway spending and suboptimal care are \n     attributable to various factors, but are perpetuated to a \n     large extent by a third-party payer system that fails to \n     reward individual effort to preserve and improve one's health \n     and that fails to reward delivery of the most effective care \n     at the lowest cost;\n       Whereas, for many years, Utah has been laying the \n     foundation for genuine long-term health system reform;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the creation of the Utah \n     Health Data Authority in 1990 and the subsequent collection \n     and publication of hospital charges by facility and adjusted \n     for risk;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the establishment in 1993 \n     of the Utah Health Information Network, a nationally \n     recognized statewide system for processing health insurance \n     claims at a small fraction of the cost often charged by other \n     claims processors;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the 2005 requirement that \n     the Utah Health Data Authority publish reports that compare \n     health care facilities based on charges, quality, and safety;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the 2007-08 development \n     of an all-payer database that will report payments, as \n     opposed to charges, for entire episodes of medical care, and \n     will ultimately allow consumers to choose from among \n     competing providers of treatments for any particular \n     condition based on outcomes, price, and other attributes \n     important to the consumer;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the 2008-09 creation of \n     the first statewide system in the nation for standardized \n     electronic exchange of clinical health information across \n     provider systems, including exchange of diagnostic test \n     results and electronic medical record information;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the 2008 creation of the \n     Health System Reform Task Force, a legislative body that has \n     engaged consumers, employers, doctors, hospitals, and \n     insurers in a voluntary, cooperative effort spanning two \n     years, and involving thousands of hours, to develop a \n     strategic plan for health system reform;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the 2009-10 creation of \n     payment and delivery reform demonstration projects designed \n     to align third-party payment structures with provider \n     practices that result in the highest quality of care for both \n     chronic and acute conditions;\n       Whereas, this foundation includes the 2009 creation of the \n     nation's second-only health insurance exchange, a virtual \n     marketplace where employees may enroll under a defined \n     contribution arrangement, select from a range of plans \n     broader than what an employer traditionally offers, and fund \n     premiums with contributions from multiple sources;\n       Whereas, this foundation outlined above is the result of an \n     iterative process of creation and refinement that has relied \n     heavily on the input of all major stakeholders in the health \n     care system and has been established largely on the basis of \n     cooperation and consensus rather than compulsion;\n       Whereas, many of the perverse incentives that plague our \n     health care system are rooted in federal Medicare and \n     Medicaid payment policies, which exert a disproportionate \n     influence on the privately funded portions of our health care \n     system;\n       Whereas, federal proposals for health system reform \n     recently considered by Congress emphasize enrollment \n     expansion rather than cost containment, much like boarding \n     additional passengers on an already sinking Titanic;\n       Whereas, those proposals include laudable authorizations \n     for payment and delivery reform demonstration projects but \n     otherwise largely lack significant cost containment \n     provisions;\n       Whereas, those proposals include many provisions to improve \n     quality of care but fall short of the systemic changes needed \n     to fully link outcomes and payment;\n       Whereas, states have consistently proven themselves \n     laboratories of policy innovation, in spite of sometimes \n     stifling federal regulatory restrictions;\n       Whereas, the best hope for health system reform lies with \n     individual states, where an iterative process of \n     experimentation, evaluation, and modification will minimize \n     the unintended consequences of one-size-fits-all national \n     policies and will produce results worth replicating; and\n       Whereas, states are in need of additional financial \n     resources and flexibility to experiment rather than \n     additional benefit mandates, Medicaid eligibility mandates, \n     and rating restrictions, all of which will inevitably drive \n     up health care spending and costs to states: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urge Congress to refuse to \n     enact, and the President of the United States to refuse to \n     sign, any legislation that imposes further restrictions on \n     any state's ability to regulate the payment and delivery of \n     health care, imposes additional financial burden related to \n     health care on any state, or limits the ability of consumers \n     and businesses to create innovative models for higher \n     quality, lower cost health care; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge that \n     Congress pass, and the President sign, legislation that \n     grants states greater flexibility under federal laws and \n     regulations related to health care and encourages states to \n     create health reform demonstration projects with the \n     potential for replication elsewhere; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor urge that \n     should Congress pass, and the President sign, legislation \n     that further restricts states in any manner, the legislation \n     recognize states' efforts to reform health care by \n     grandfathering any state laws, regulations, or practices \n     intended to contain costs, improve quality, increase \n     consumerism, or otherwise implement health system reform \n     concepts; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Majority Leader of the United States Senate, the Speaker of \n     the United States House of Representatives, the President of \n     the United States, and the members of Utah's Congressional \n     delegation.\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       POM-115. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to review the GPO and \n     WEP Social Security benefit reductions and to consider \n     eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social Security \n     Fairness Act of 2009, the Public Servant Retirement \n     Protection Act of 2009, the Windfall Elimination Provision \n     Relief Act of 2009, or a similar instrument; to the Committee \n     on Finance.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, the Congress of the United States has enacted both \n     the Government Pension Offset (GPO), reducing the spousal and \n     survivor Social Security benefit, and the Windfall \n     Elimination Provision (WEP), reducing the earned Social \n     Security benefit for any person who also receives a public \n     pension benefit; and\n       Whereas, the intent of Congress in enacting the GPO and the \n     WEP provisions was to address concerns that a public employee \n     who had worked primarily in federal, state, or local \n     government employment might receive a public pension in \n     addition to the same Social Security benefit as a person who \n     had worked only in employment covered by Social Security \n     throughout his career; and\n       Whereas,the purpose of Congress in enacting these reduction \n     provisions was to provide a disincentive for public employees \n     to receive two pensions; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively affects a spouse or survivor \n     receiving a federal, state, or local government retirement or \n     pension benefit who would also be entitled to a Social \n     Security benefit earned by a spouse; and\n       Whereas, the GPO formula reduces the spousal or survivor \n     Social Security benefit by two-thirds of the amount of the \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefit received by the spouse or survivor, in many cases \n     completely eliminating the Social Security benefit; and\n       Whereas, nine out of ten public employees affected by the \n     GPO lose their entire spousal benefits, even though their \n     spouses paid Social Security taxes for many years; and\n       Whereas, the GPO often reduces spousal benefits so \n     significantly it can make the difference between self-\n     sufficiency and poverty; and\n       Whereas, the GPO has a harsh effect on thousands of \n     citizens and undermines the original purpose of the Social \n     Security dependent/survivor benefit; and\n       Whereas, the GPO negatively impacts approximately 21,900 \n     Louisianans; and\n       Whereas, the WEP applies to those persons who have earned \n     federal, state, or local government retirement or pension \n     benefits, in addition to working in employment covered under \n     Social Security and paying into the Social Security system; \n     and\n       Whereas, the WEP reduces the earned Social Security benefit \n     using an averaged indexed monthly earnings formula and may \n     reduce Social Security benefits for affected persons by as \n     much as one-half of the retirement benefit earned as a public \n     servant in employment not covered under Social Security; and\n       Whereas, the WEP causes hard-working individuals to lose a \n     significant portion of the social security benefits that they \n     earn themselves; and\n       Whereas, the WEP negatively impacts approximately 18,300 \n     Louisianans; and\n       Whereas,because of these calculation characteristics, the \n     GPO and the WEP have a disproportionately negative effect on \n     employees working in lower-wage government jobs, like \n     policemen, firefighters, teachers, and state employees; and\n       Whereas, many workers rely on Social Security \n     Administration Annual Statements that fail to take into \n     account the GPO and WEP when projecting benefits; and\n       Whereas, because the Social Security benefit statements do \n     not calculate the GPO and the WEP, many public employees in \n     Louisiana are unaware that their expected Social Security \n     benefits shown on such statements will be significantly lower \n     or nonexistent due to the service in public employment; and\n       Whereas, these provisions also have a greater adverse \n     effect on women than on men because of the gender differences \n     in salary that continue to plague our nation and the longer \n     life expectancy of women; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana is making every effort to improve the \n     quality of life of its citizens and to encourage them to live \n     here lifelong, yet the current GPO and WEP provisions \n     compromise that quality of life; and\n       Whereas, retired individuals negatively affected by GPO and \n     WEP have significantly less money to support their basic \n     needs and sometimes have to turn to government assistance \n     programs; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and the WEP penalize individuals who have \n     dedicated their lives to public service by taking away \n     benefits they have earned; and\n       Whereas, our nation should respect, not penalize, public \n     service; and\n       Whereas, the number of people affected by GPO and WEP is \n     growing every day as more and more people reach retirement \n     age; and\n       Whereas, the GPO and WEP are established in federal law and \n     repeal of the GPO and the WEP can only be enacted by the \n     United States Congress: Now therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     memorialize the Congress of the United States to review the \n     GPO and the WEP Social Security benefit reductions and to \n     consider eliminating or reducing them by enacting the Social \n     Security Fairness Act of 2009 (H.R. 235 or S. 484), the \n     Public Servant Retirement Protection Act of 2009 (H.R. 1221, \n     S. 490), the Windfall Elimination Provision Relief Act of \n     2009 (H.R. 2145), or a similar instrument; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-116. A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Utah strongly urging the \n     President to submit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the \n     United States Senate and the United States Senate to promptly \n     give its advice and consent for ratification of the \n     Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty; to the Committee on Foreign \n     Relations.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, a global halt to nuclear weapons testing has been \n     a bipartisan objective of the United States since the late \n     1950s when President Dwight D. Eisenhower sought a \n     comprehensive nuclear test ban;\n       Whereas, the United States has not conducted a nuclear \n     weapons test since the United States suspended testing and \n     joined with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in a \n     nuclear weapons testing moratorium in September 1992;\n       Whereas, the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) was \n     opened for signature on September 24, 1996, and President \n     Bill Clinton was the first head of state to sign the Treaty;\n       Whereas, no nuclear tests have been conducted since that \n     time by the United States, Russia, or China;\n       Whereas, as of June 2009, 180 states have signed the CTBT \n     and 148 have ratified it;\n       Whereas, ratification of the CTBT would signal a strong \n     commitment by the United States to fulfill its obligations \n     under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, prompt \n     ratification by other states which is necessary for the \n     Treaty to enter into force, reinforce the global taboo \n     against nuclear weapons testing, and set an example for the \n     rest of the world;\n       Whereas, a global verifiable ban on nuclear weapons testing \n     would prevent potential nuclear powers from proof testing \n     smaller nuclear bombs that can be delivered on ballistic \n     missiles;\n       Whereas, United States ratification of the CTBT would be a \n     significant step towards preventing the spread of nuclear \n     weapons, reducing nuclear weapons arsenals worldwide, and \n     building confidence among nations that abolition of nuclear \n     weapons can someday be achieved;\n       Whereas, after 1,030 nuclear test explosions, further \n     nuclear weapons testing is not necessary to maintain the \n     integrity, effectiveness, and deterrence value of the \n     existing United States nuclear weapons stockpile, nor is \n     there any new military requirement for new types of United \n     States nuclear warheads;\n       Whereas, the United States government acknowledges that 433 \n     of 824 United States underground tests have vented radiation \n     to the atmosphere;\n       Whereas, as part of its recognition of the 50th anniversary \n     of nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test Site, in the \n     2001 General Session, the 54th Legislature of the state of \n     Utah expressed, ``the fervent desire and commitment to assure \n     that such a legacy will never be repeated'';\n       Whereas, resumption of United States nuclear weapons \n     testing would place persons downwind of the Nevada test \n     location at risk of exposure to radioactive emissions from \n     possible venting;\n       Whereas, citizens of Utah living downwind of the Nevada \n     Test Site have already suffered significant health effects as \n     a result of nuclear weapons testing;\n       Whereas, in the best interests of their children and \n     grandchildren, Utah's remaining ``downwinders'' continue to \n     fight the resumption of any nuclear weapons testing;\n       Whereas, past nuclear weapons testing at the Nevada Test \n     Site has devastated the health and livelihoods of thousands \n     of Utahns;\n       Whereas, in 2005, the 58th Legislature of the state of Utah \n     voted in support of a Concurrent Resolution Opposing Nuclear \n     Testing, articulating that, ``The state of Utah has an \n     obligation to its citizens, especially those who have \n     suffered so much, to do all in its power to ensure that the \n     lingering wounds from nuclear testing are not reopened to \n     afflict both current and future generations'';\n       Whereas, the Legislature of the state of Utah supports a \n     strong military defense, but atomic weapons tests are not a \n     necessary component of that defense;\n       Whereas, United States' citizens must not be subjected to \n     the hazards of future nuclear weapons tests;\n       Whereas, the CTBT Organization effectively monitors \n     compliance with the CTBT through an International Monitoring \n     System, consisting of 337 stations using state-of-the-art \n     seismic, hydroacoustic, infrasound and radionuclide \n     technologies and capable of detecting and identifying a \n     nuclear weapons test explosion anywhere in the world within \n     hours;\n       Whereas, the CTBT is effectively verifiable and would \n     improve the United States' ability to detect, deter, and \n     respond to potential surreptitious nuclear weapons testing by \n     other nations;\n       Whereas, Article 9 of the CTBT permits withdrawal by the \n     United States in case extraordinary future developments, \n     including\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\n     the need to respond to a violation by another nation, were to \n     jeopardize our supreme national interests;\n       Whereas, independent expert assessments commissioned by the \n     National Nuclear Security Administration have concluded that \n     measures under the Stockpile Stewardship Program and Life \n     Extension Program can support certification of today's \n     nuclear warheads as safe, secure, and reliable for decades \n     without the need to resort to underground nuclear weapons \n     testing and\n       Whereas, the CTBT would increase international safety and \n     security and is in the best interests of Utah, the United \n     States, and the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the state of \n     Utah strongly urges the President of the United States to \n     submit the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty to the United States \n     Senate; be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the state of

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah reaffirming friendship with the people \n     of Taiwan and urging the Obama Administration to support \n     Taiwan's meaningful participation in the United Nations \n     specialized agencies, programs, and conventions; to the \n     Committee on Foreign Relations.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, July 23, 2010, will mark the 30th anniversary of a \n     sister state relationship between Utah and Taiwan;\n       Whereas, for the past 30 years, four sister county and \n     sister city relationships with Taiwan have also been \n     strengthened, resulting in better mutual understanding of the \n     economic, social, and cultural heritages of Utah and Taiwan;\n       Whereas, in 2008, Taiwan was Utah's third largest export \n     market;\n       Whereas, Utah exports to Taiwan have reached $727,000,000, \n     an increase of over 244% since 2007;\n       Whereas, Utah companies still have substantial \n     opportunities to expand their businesses and cooperation with \n     Taiwan;\n       Whereas, Utah has already attracted investment from several \n     Taiwanese companies, and there is significant potential for \n     Taiwanese enterprises to further boost investment and create \n     jobs in Utah;\n       Whereas, in May 2009, the World Health Organization invited \n     Taiwan to attend the 62nd World Health Assembly as an \n     observer;\n       Whereas, this development raises the possibility for Taiwan \n     to be meaningfully involved in other United Nations \n     specialized agencies, programs, and conventions;\n       Whereas, Taiwan is a key air transport hub in the Asia-\n     Pacific region, with approximately 2,600 weekly flights to \n     and from neighboring countries;\n       Whereas, the Taipei Flight Information Region under \n     Taiwan's jurisdiction currently serves 12 international and \n     four domestic routes and has 1,350,000 controlled flights \n     passing through every year;\n       Whereas, the 2008 statistics from Airports Council \n     International ranked Taiwan's Taoyuan International Airport \n     as the world's 11th largest airport by international cargo \n     volume, and 19th in terms of international passengers \n     services; and\n       Whereas, given Taiwan's prominent role in regional air \n     control and transport services, it would be beneficial for \n     Taiwan to have meaningful participation in the International \n     Civil Aviation Organization, in order to safeguard the \n     traveling of passengers from home and abroad: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, reaffirm their friendship with \n     the people of Taiwan and urge the Obama Administration to \n     support Taiwan's meaningful participation in United Nations \n     specialized agencies, programs, and conventions; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor express \n     support for a strong and deepening relationship between Utah \n     and Taiwan; be it further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States and to the government of \n     Taiwan.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-118. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah expressing opposition to the establishment \n     of a National Commission on State Workers' Compensation Laws; \n     to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, state workers' compensation laws should provide an \n     injured worker with all reasonable and necessary medical \n     treatment that promotes expeditious healing, a return to \n     work, a fair level of income benefits during disability, and \n     protection against lost wages;\n       Whereas, state workers' compensation laws should assure \n     that employees receive just compensation at a cost affordable \n     to employers;\n       Whereas, the state-based workers' compensation system has \n     proven over the near-century of its existence to be an \n     effective means of protecting injured workers against the \n     costs of industrial injury, while protecting employers \n     against the unlimited and unpredictable costs of workplace \n     liability;\n       Whereas, a state-based benefit delivery system reflects the \n     nature and cost of employment in individual states and is an \n     exemplar of the federal system, in which power is dispersed \n     among the states, facilitating timely response and the \n     ability to tailor remedies to state-specific conditions;\n       Whereas, the imposition of federal oversight and \n     development of federal mandates on the state workers' \n     compensation system should be opposed, including any proposed \n     legislation that would unnecessarily increase the federal \n     bureaucracy and create federal regulation in an area where \n     states are currently providing adequate oversight;\n       Whereas, federal requirements on the state-based system \n     would create unnecessary imbalances and unintended \n     consequences for a system that has been operating effectively \n     for decades;\n       Whereas, a state workers' compensation system, its \n     administration, legal precedents, funding, and fiscal \n     accountability, which is intricately linked to each state's \n     economy, is a much more effective approach m dealing with \n     workers' compensation issues;\n       Whereas, the state-based system provides the ability to \n     experiment creatively and borrow from experiences in other \n     states without the burden of a rigid, nationwide, one-size-\n     fits-all federal program that is slow to change and \n     administratively cumbersome;\n       Whereas, the rights of states and their respective \n     legislatures and stakeholders to review the performance of \n     state-based workers' compensation systems should be \n     preserved;\n       Whereas, it is not the province of Congress to interfere \n     with the state administration of workers' compensation: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses strong support for the current state-based workers' \n     compensation system and opposes any proposed federal \n     legislation that would lead to broadening the federal role in \n     that system; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah opposes \n     H.R. 635, introduced in the 111th United States Congress, \n     that would establish a National Commission on State Workers' \n     Compensation Laws, because the Commission's evaluation is \n     intended, and will assuredly lead, to recommendations that \n     would erode the independence of the state-based workers' \n     compensation benefit delivery system, would seek to impose \n     federal benefit delivery system rules, which Congress would \n     be expected to approve, that inherently interfere with state \n     benefit systems, would increase system costs nationwide, and \n     would frustrate efforts of the states to contain costs; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-119. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging the United States Department of \n     Veterans Affairs to prioritize Utah for the construction of \n     another veterans' nursing home; to the Committee on Veterans' \n     Affairs.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 9\n\n       Whereas, there is greet need for the construction of an \n     additional nursing home for veterans in Utah;\n       Whereas, Utah is still significantly below the nation's \n     average for the total number of needed veterans' nursing \n     homes statewide;\n       Whereas, due to the heavy numbers of veterans in the state \n     of Utah, the United States Department of Veterans Affairs \n     should prioritize Utah for the construction of an additional \n     veterans' nursing home;\n       Whereas, Utah should also be prioritized based on the \n     absolute promise of the United States Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to reimburse the state for the Veterans' Nursing Home \n     in Ogden;\n       Whereas, any and all efforts by the state of Utah to \n     continue to help veterans acquire properties and build a home \n     in central and southern Utah should be encouraged;\n       Whereas, the citizens of Utah and the citizens of the \n     United States owe a debt to our veterans of the past, \n     present, and future; and\n       Whereas, constructing an additional veterans' nursing home \n     will demonstrate a measure of gratitude for their service: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     strongly encourages the United States Department of Veterans \n     Affairs to prioritize Utah for the construction of another \n     veteran' nursing home; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     encourages any and all efforts by the state of Utah to \n     continue helping veterans acquire properties and build a \n     veterans' nursing home in central and southern Utah; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be sent to the \n     United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the Utah \n     Department of Veteran's Affairs, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3830-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3830-S3831]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. AKAKA, from the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, \n     without amendment:\n       S. 3378.

Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Tester):\n  S. 3381. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to modify certain \ndefinitions of the term ``renewable biomass'', and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nmy colleagues Senator Crapo and Senator Tester that will establish a \nsingle definition of renewable biomass for the purposes of the \nRenewable Fuel Standard, RFS, a future Renewable Electricity Standard, \nRES, and climate change legislation.\n  When I travel back to my hometown of Helena, MT, trees that line the \nroads there are turning red. Mountain pine beetles are killing \nMontana's trees at a terrible rate. Our legendary harsh winters once \nwere enough to keep the beetles at bay, but no longer. Global warming \nhas literally hit home for me. These thousands of acres of red, dead \ntrees are virtually worthless under current law, serving as little more \nthan kindling for wildfires.\n  This bill can help add value to this biomass while also creating a \nsource of renewable domestic energy. It will establish a simple, broad, \nsingle definition for renewable biomass that is consistent with current \nlaw--the 2008 Farm Bill.\n  Some say this definition is too broad and fails to protect \necologically sensitive areas. In fact, there are many laws that dictate \nFederal forest management, and my amendment does nothing to change \nthese laws. All projects that would create biomass due to my amendment \nwould have to comply with the National Forest Management Act, the \nEndangered Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and \nothers.\n  All projects on federal forests must go through NEPA where the land \nmanagement agency must study potential environmental impacts and \nmitigate those impacts. The public has many opportunities to comment \nand shape these projects and nothing in my amendment changes these \nsafeguards. Further, my amendment would do nothing to change designated \nWilderness areas or Wilderness Study Areas or otherwise weaken the \nWilderness Act.\n  Right now our national forests are growing 20 billion board feet per \nyear. Eight billion board feet die every year and only two million \nboard feet are removed. This has resulted in overstocked, unhealthy \nforests. We can either restore forest health, produce renewable energy \nand local high-wage jobs, or we can allow nature to impose its own will \nthrough wildfire and infestation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I look forward \nto working with them to enact this bill this year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3833-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3833-S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 532--RECOGNIZING EXPO 2010 SHANGHAI CHINA AND THE USA \n                          PAVILION AT THE EXPO\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Udall of Colorado) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S. Res. 532\n\n       Whereas Expo 2010 Shanghai China (Expo 2010) will take \n     place May 1 through October 31, 2010 with the theme ``Better \n     City, Better Life'';\n       Whereas Expo 2010 will be the largest such event in 150 \n     years of Expo history with an estimated 70,000,000 visitors \n     expected to attend, many of them from within China;\n       Whereas approximately 192 countries and 52 international \n     organizations will be represented at Expo 2010;\n       Whereas Expo 2010 is the first world exposition hosted by \n     China, representing an opportunity for the world to celebrate \n     China's progress over the past 30 years and recognize the \n     aspirations of the people of China to continue the process of \n     ``reform and opening up'' launched by Chinese Premier Deng \n     Xiao-ping in 1979;\n       Whereas Shanghai, the host city of Expo 2010, is the \n     dynamic commercial and financial capital of China, noted in \n     China as a cradle of innovation and openness;\n       Whereas Expo 2010 represents an unprecedented opportunity \n     for the United States to promote understanding of American \n     society, culture, ideas, and values with millions of Chinese \n     citizens visiting the USA Pavilion;\n       Whereas United States participation in Expo 2010 \n     demonstrates the United States commitment to a forward-\n     looking, positive relationship with China;\n       Whereas the USA Pavilion theme ``Rising to the Challenge'' \n     will entertain and educate audiences on the American spirit \n     of innovation and community-building and celebrate the \n     American ideals of collaboration, freedom, diversity, \n     openness, optimism, achievement, and opportunity;\n       Whereas Expo 2010 will emphasize sound environmental \n     conservation practices, including a solar energy system that \n     will produce 5 megawatts of power and large rooftop canopies \n     to collect rainwater to be purified for drinking;\n       Whereas support for the USA Pavilion's construction, \n     staffing, operation, and thematic presentations was provided \n     completely by private-sector and other partners consistent \n     with United States law; and\n       Whereas many of the USA Pavilion's sponsoring partners are \n     also playing an active role in the beneficial development of \n     China's economy and society: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That--\n       (1) the Senate congratulates the people of China for \n     hosting Expo 2010 and wishes them every success with this \n     endeavor;\n       (2) it is the sense of the Senate that Expo 2010 \n     constitutes an important step along the over 30-year path of \n     reform and opening up in China, and serves as a significant \n     reminder of what can be accomplished if China continues along \n     this path;\n       (3) the Senate calls on the sponsors and operators of the \n     USA Pavilion to make maximum use of this unique opportunity \n     to showcase the very best attributes that the United States \n     has to offer and to strengthen the cultural, scientific, \n     educational, people-to-people, trade, and investment links \n     between the people of the United States and the people of \n     China; and\n       (4) the Senate acknowledges the more than 60 private-sector \n     and other sponsor partners of the USA Pavilion for their \n     invaluable contributions to the success of this important \n     project and for providing a positive example of public-\n     private partnerships.\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3834-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 533--RECOGNIZING NATIONAL FOSTER CARE MONTH AS AN \nOPPORTUNITY TO RAISE AWARENESS ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF CHILDREN IN THE \n  FOSTER CARE SYSTEM AND ENCOURAGING CONGRESS TO IMPLEMENT POLICY TO \n        IMPROVE THE LIVES OF CHILDREN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Levin, Mr. \nCardin, Mr. Begich, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Inhofe, Ms. Collins, Ms. Snowe, Mr. \nBayh, Mr. Franken, Mr. Akaka, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Nelson \nof Nebraska, Mr. Casey, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Specter, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \nLautenberg) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 533\n\n       Whereas all children deserve a safe, loving, and permanent \n     home;\n       Whereas approximately 500,000 children in the United States \n     live in foster care each year;\n       Whereas children enter the foster care system for a variety \n     of reasons, including inadequate care, abuse, or neglect by a \n     parent or guardian;\n       Whereas the major factors that contribute to the placement \n     of a child in the foster care system include substance abuse, \n     mental illness, poverty, and a lack of education of a parent \n     or guardian of the child;\n       Whereas a child entering the foster care system must \n     confront the widespread misperception that children in foster \n     care are disruptive, unruly, and dangerous, even though \n     placement in the foster care system is based on the actions \n     of a parent or guardian, not the child;\n       Whereas States and communities should be provided with the \n     resources to invest in preventative and reunification \n     services and post-permanency programs to ensure that more \n     children in the foster care system are provided safe, loving, \n     permanent placements;\n       Whereas the foster care system is intended to be a \n     temporary solution, yet children remain in the foster care \n     system for an average of 3 years;\n       Whereas children of color are disproportionately \n     represented in the foster care system and are less likely to \n     be reunited with their biological families;\n       Whereas the average child in the foster care system--\n       (1) is 10 years old; and\n       (2) will be placed in 3 different homes, leading to \n     disruptive transfers to new schools, separation from \n     siblings, and unfamiliar surroundings;\n       Whereas most children ``age out'' of the foster care system \n     at the age of 18;\n       Whereas the number of children who enter the foster care \n     system each year has declined over the decade preceding the \n     date of the agreement to this resolution, but the number of \n     children who ``age out'' of the foster care system without \n     placement with a permanent family has increased \n     substantially, rising from 20,000 children in 2002 to 29,000 \n     children in 2008;\n       Whereas children who ``age out'' of the foster care system \n     lack the security or support of a biological or adoptive \n     family and frequently struggle to secure affordable housing, \n     obtain health insurance, pursue higher education, and acquire \n     adequate employment;\n       Whereas, of the children who have ``aged out'' of the \n     foster care system--\n       (1) 25 percent have been homeless;\n       (2) 51 percent have been unemployed for significant stretch \n     of time, and\n       (3) only 2 percent have obtained a bachelor's degree or \n     higher;\n       Whereas, by age 19, approximately 50 percent of young women \n     who have been in the foster care system have been pregnant, \n     compared to only 20 percent of young women who have been not \n     in the foster care system;\n       Whereas research reveals that children born to teen parents \n     are exposed to serious and high risks;\n       Whereas National Foster Care Month is an opportunity to \n     raise awareness about the special needs of children in the \n     foster care system and to recognize the important role that \n     foster parents, social workers, and advocates have in the \n     lives of children in foster care throughout the United \n     States;\n       Whereas the Fostering Connections to Success and Increasing \n     Adoptions Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-351; 122 Stat. 3949) \n     provides for new investments and services to improve the \n     outcomes of children and families in the foster care system; \n     and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster care system;\n       (3) supports the designation of a ``National Foster Care \n     Month'';\n       (4) acknowledges the needs of the children in the foster \n     care system;\n       (5) honors the commitment and dedication of those \n     individuals who work tirelessly to provide assistance and \n     services to children in the foster care system; and\n       (6) recognizes the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster care system through \n     title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) \n     and other programs designed to help children in the foster \n     care system--\n       (A) reunite with their biological parents; or\n       (B) if the children cannot be reunited with their \n     biological parents, find permanent, safe, and loving homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3834-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4048.

Exposure to these risks is \n     heightened by the substantial capital employed in the \n     extractive industries, and the often opaque and unaccountable \n     management of natural resource revenues by foreign \n     governments, which in turn creates unstable and high-cost \n     operating environments for multinational companies.

122 Stat. 3949) \n     provides for new investments and services to improve the \n     outcomes of children and families in the foster care system; \n     and\n       Whereas much remains to be done to ensure that all children \n     have a safe, loving, nurturing, and permanent family, \n     regardless of age or special needs: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes National Foster Care Month as an opportunity \n     to raise awareness about the challenges of children in the \n     foster care system;\n       (2) encourages Congress to implement policy to improve the \n     lives of children in the foster care system;\n       (3) supports the designation of a ``National Foster Care \n     Month'';\n       (4) acknowledges the needs of the children in the foster \n     care system;\n       (5) honors the commitment and dedication of those \n     individuals who work tirelessly to provide assistance and \n     services to children in the foster care system; and\n       (6) recognizes the need to continue working to improve the \n     outcomes of all children in the foster care system through \n     title IV of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) \n     and other programs designed to help children in the foster \n     care system--\n       (A) reunite with their biological parents; or\n       (B) if the children cannot be reunited with their \n     biological parents, find permanent, safe, and loving homes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/17/senate-section/article/S3847-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MAY 18, 2010\n\n  Mr. DODD.
