We also have Harold Koh. I heard on Monday, day before yesterday, \nfrom Secretary Clinton that this is somebody she needs very badly. Mr. \nKoh is going to be the lawyer for the State Department. We have a \nnumber of people under the auspices of the judiciary, and we can go \nthrough these. We have somebody who is going to help run the Department \nof Homeland Security, Rand Beers, who is well-qualified and a good \nperson. The topper of them all is LTG Stanley McChrystal to be the man \nwho runs Afghanistan.\n  I hope people will search their consciences and try to get these \ndone.

Mr. President, in a single word, the health debate is about \n``choices.'' Will our country choose to tell parents they cannot take \ntheir child to the doctor because insurance is not in existence or is \nprohibitively expensive? Will we choose to tell small\n\n[[Page S6394]]\n\nbusinesses they have to lay off employees because they cannot afford \nskyrocketing health care premiums? As was outlined by Senator Durbin \nyesterday, a small businessman he talked about was dealing with the \ntravails of trying to maintain health insurance for his employees. Will \nwe choose real, meaningful health care reform that assures everybody \nthe quality care they deserve?\n  There is another way this debate is about choice. Democrats are \ncommitted to ensuring all Americans can choose their doctors, \nhospitals, and health plans. No matter what the Republicans claim, this \ngovernment has no intention of choosing any of these things for you or \nmeddling in any of these relationships. We have said that time and \nagain. If you like the coverage you have, you can choose to keep it or \nyou can change if you desire.\n  Like most Americans, we believe there should be more choice and more \ncompetition to lift the heavy weight of crushing health care costs. \nToday, 18 cents of every dollar spent in America is on health care. If \nwe don't do something about this legislatively, by 2020 it will be more \nthan 35 percent of every dollar spent in America. If we leave it up to \nprivate insurance companies, which are more interested in keeping their \nprofits than keeping us healthy, that won't happen. One of the best \nways to do that--that is, to give people choice and competition--is to \npass the health care legislation.\n  Third, the Republicans have a choice in this debate. They can choose \nto work with us or against the interests of the American people. From \nthe start, we have reached out to Republicans in this debate. Senator \nBaucus has done everything he can to get a bipartisan bill. He still \nbelieves he can do that. I hope that is the case. Senator Dodd, filling \nin for Senator Kennedy, has done the same. He has reached out to \nRanking Member Enzi and others on the committee to try to come up with \na bipartisan bill. That bill was given to us yesterday.\n  Again, from the start, we have reached out to Republicans. We have \nlet them know we would rather write this bill with them. That is what \nwe want to do. Republicans, so far, have made it quite clear what they \nare against. We remain interested to learn what they are for. Democrats \ncontinue to save for our Republican colleagues a seat, or seats, at the \ntable, and we sincerely hope they will take those seats.\n  Last year, the American people made their choice clear. In no \nuncertain terms, they rejected the Republican status quo. Those with \ncoverage know their health care bills are higher because of tens of \nmillions of Americans who are uninsured. They know they should not have \nto go bankrupt or lose their home just to afford to stay healthy or \ncare for a loved one.\n  I am sure we will disagree in the debate at times, and that is fine. \nWe welcome an open and honest debate on the issue. We welcome a dialog.\n  One choice we do not have is to wait. We don't have a choice to wait. \nHealth care is not a luxury. It should not be a luxury. We cannot \nafford another year in which about 50 million of us have to choose \nbetween basic necessities and lining the pockets of big insurance \ncompanies just to stay healthy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6394-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, Americans are increasingly frustrated \nwith the U.S. health care system as we know it. They expect real \nreform, not just the promise of reform that never seems to come or the \nillusion of reform that ends up destroying what is good about the \ncurrent system and replacing it with something that is actually worse.\n  Americans don't think basic medical procedures should break the bank, \nand they don't understand why millions of Americans have to go without \nbasic care in a nation as prosperous as our own. Still, many Americans \nare quite happy with the health care they currently have, and they \ndon't want to be forced into a government plan they don't like.\n  So the need for reform is not in question. The real question is what \nkind of reform--the kind that makes care more affordable and accessible \nor the kind that makes existing problems worse.\n  One thing most people like about health care in the U.S. is the \nquality of cancer care that's available here. Far too many Americans \ndie from cancer. Yet for all the problems we have, the fact is, America \nboasts some of the highest cancer survival rates in the world. And that \nis not the kind of thing Americans want to see change. But it could \nvery well change if the U.S. adopts a government-run health care system \nalong the lines of the one some are proposing.\n  A recent study comparing U.S. cancer survival rates with other \ncountries found that, on average, U.S. women have a 63 percent chance \nof living at least 5 years after a cancer diagnosis compared to a 54 \npercent rate for women in Britain. As for men, 66 percent of American \nmales survive at least 5 years while 45 percent of British men do.\n  Just as important as treatment is early detection. And here again, \nthe U.S. routinely out performs countries with government-run health \ncare systems. According to one report, 84 percent of women between the \nages of 50 and 64 get mammograms regularly in the United States--far \nhigher than the 63 percent of women in the United Kingdom. Access to \npreventive care is extremely important and, frankly, when it comes to \nbreast cancer, preventive care is something we do quite well in the \nU.S.\n  These are the kinds of things Americans like about our system, and \nthese are the kinds of things that could change under a government \nplan. Americans don't want to be forced off their existing plans, and \nthey certainly don't want a government board telling them which \ntreatments and medicines they can and cannot have.\n  It is no mystery why Americans have higher cancer survival rates than \ntheir counterparts in a country such as Great Britain. Part of the \nreason is that Americans have greater access to the care and the \nmedicines they need. And they don't want that to change. All of us want \nreform but not reform that denies, delays, or rations health care. \nInstead, we need reform that controls costs even as it protects \npatients.\n  Some ways to do this would be by discouraging the junk medical \nliability lawsuits that drive up the cost of practicing medicine and \nlimit access to care in places such as rural Kentucky; through \nprevention and wellness programs that reduce health care costs, such as \nprograms that help people quit smoking, fight obesity, and get early \ndiagnoses for disease; and we could control costs and protect patients \nby addressing the needs of small businesses without imposing mandates \nor taxes that kill jobs.\n  All of us want reform, but the government-run plan that some are \nproposing for the U.S. isn't the kind of change Americans are looking \nfor. We should learn a lesson from Canada. At a time when some in the \nU.S. want government-run health care, Canada is instituting reforms \nthat would make their system more like ours.\n  According to Canadian-born doctor David Gratzer, the medical \nestablishment in Canada is in revolt, with private sector options \nexpanding and doctors frustrated by government cutbacks that limit \naccess to care. The New York Times reported a few years ago that \nprivate clinics were opening in Canada at the rate of about one a \nweek--private clinics. Dr. Gratzer asked a simple question: Why are \nAmericans rushing into a system of government-dominated health care \nwhen the very countries that have experienced it for so long are \nbacking away? Many Americans are beginning to ask themselves the very \nsame thing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6394-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6394-S6395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senator Leahy's decision to rush Judge \nSotomayor's confirmation hearing is, indeed, puzzling. It risks \nresulting in a less-informed hearing, and it breaks with years of \ntradition in which bipartisan agreements were reached and honored over \nthe scheduling of hearings for Supreme Court nominees. It damages the \ncordiality and good will the Senate relies on to do its business. These \nkinds of partisan maneuvers have always come with consequences. This \ntime is no different.\n\n[[Page S6395]]\n\n  The explanations that some of our friends offered yesterday to \njustify a rushed hearing were almost as remarkable as the decision \nitself and the partisan way in which it was handled. Some said \nRepublicans proposed unreasonable hearing dates. Yet no one can cite \nthe time and place when any of these supposed requests were made.\n  But blaming Republicans for statements they never made was not as \nludicrous as the claim that Judge Sotomayor's long judicial record is \nsomehow reason to rush the review process. Not only is this \ncounterintuitive--why should it take less time to read more cases?--it \nalso flies in the face of every statement our Democratic friends made \non the topic after the nomination of the last two Supreme Court \nnominees.\n  Time and time again, they told us the Senate was not a rubberstamp \nand that hearings for Judge Alito and Judge Roberts could not be \nrushed. As Senator Leahy put it at the time:\n\n       We want to do it right. We don't want to do it fast.\n\n  Republicans respected these requests because we recognized the \nimportance of a thorough review. On the Alito nomination, for instance, \nSenators had 70 days to prepare for a hearing on a nominee who, as \nSenator Leahy noted at the time, had handled some 3,500 cases on the \nFederal bench. Judge Sotomayor has handled over 3,600 cases, so it \nstands to reason we would have as much time to review her record as we \ndid Judge Alito's. But for some reason, the old standard has been \nthrown out as new reasons have emerged for rushing the process on this \nnominee.\n  As Senator Sessions informed us yesterday, the questionnaire Judge \nSotomayor filled out suffers from significant omissions. For example, \nshe failed to produce numerous opinions from cases in which she was \ninvolved as a district attorney.\n  In addition, she failed to produce a memorandum from her time with \nthe Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund that opposed the application of the \ndeath penalty. When this omission was brought to the judge's attention, \nI understand the White House then provided this memorandum, saying it \nwas an oversight. But in the rush to complete the questionnaire in \norder to garner a talking point, you are prone to these sorts of \nmistakes. This, of course, counsels the Senate to have a thorough, \ndeliberative process, not a rush to judgment in order to meet an \narbitrary deadline.\n  When it came to Republican nominees such as Judge Roberts and Judge \nAlito, our Democratic friends wanted to review the record, and \nRepublicans worked in a bipartisan fashion to come to a consensus on a \nfair process that respected the minority's rights. Yet when it comes to \na Democratic nominee, our friends want to deny Republicans the same \nrights. They want the shortest confirmation timeline in recent memory \nfor someone with the longest judicial record in recent memory. Let me \nsay that again.\n  They want the shortest confirmation timeline in recent memory for \nsomeone with the longest judicial record in recent memory.\n  This violates basic standards of fairness, and it prevents Senators \nfrom carrying out one of their most solemn duties--a thorough review of \nthe President's nominee to a lifetime position on the highest Court in \nthe land. The decision to short circuit that process is regrettable and \ncompletely unnecessary.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6395-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we are confronted with the news this \nweek of the first of what may be many deadly terrorists being \ntransferred to American soil, I am still left to wonder what the \nadministration's plan is for the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.\n  I recently had the privilege of visiting Guantanamo Bay. I traveled \ndown there with Senators Brownback, Barrasso, and Johanns. I would like \nto start out by saying how proud I am of the job our men and women in \nuniform who are stationed down there are doing. ADM Dave Thomas and his \nstaff are doing an outstanding job, and their efforts need to be \nrecognized. These are the kinds of individuals who make America great \nand who keep us safe.\n  This is the type of facility where you do not have a true \nunderstanding of how well run it is until you go down there and see it \nin person for yourself. I would actually encourage our President to go \ndown and see firsthand what Guantanamo Bay is like, what the facility \nis like, how the prisoners are treated down there, and how well our \nservice men and women in uniform are preforming.\n  As we are all aware, 6 months ago, President Obama set an arbitrary \ntimeline of January 2010 to close Gitmo. It is now mid-June, and it \nappears he is no closer now than he was back in January of this year in \nidentifying what his plan is. We still have seen little more than \npolitical rhetoric and no concrete plan of how to deal with the \nprisoners currently being housed at Gitmo.\n  My question to the administration is: Why are we rushing to close \nthis world-class facility without first having a plan in place? The \nadministration should work with Congress on a bipartisan basis to first \ncome up with a plan, if a plan is even possible, and then proceed from \nthere.\n  Included in this population are critical figures involved in the 9/11 \nattacks on the United States and the bombings of a U.S. warship, the \nUSS Cole, and also terrorists captured from the battlefield in \nAfghanistan. As I stated earlier, one of the most deadly terrorists who \nwas formerly at Gitmo and is directly responsible for the deaths of 224 \nindividuals is now in the United States.\n  On our trip, we were able to see the security measures that have been \nput in place to keep these evil individuals from escaping or doing \nharm. These individuals do not view this war we are in as over. A \ndocument that was found in an apartment of an al-Qaida operative in \nManchester, England, appropriately entitled the ``Manchester \nDocument,'' lays out how terrorists should act if captured.\n  According to the Manchester Document, if an individual is detained, \nhe should ``insist on proving that torture was inflicted on him. . . \n.'' Whether it was or not, they want to use the press. They want to try \nto show that torture was used on them.\n  According to this document, they want to ``take advantage of visits \nfrom outsiders to communicate with brothers outside the prison and \nexchange information that may be helpful to them in their work outside \nthe prison. . . .'' They are to ``master the art of hiding messages . . \n. and provide information about the enemy's strengths and weaknesses, \nmovements of the enemy and its members.''\n  The terrorists practice this doctrine on a daily basis. In addition, \non a regular basis, they abuse our troops down at Guantanamo Bay. It is \nnot the other way around.\n  A spokesman for the Pentagon stated that 14 percent of the over 500 \nwho were released from Guantanamo Bay have returned to some sort of \nterrorist activity--14 percent. Some people say: Boy, that is a very \nlow recidivism rate. But if we think about it, these are mass murderers \nand evil individuals. These are people who want to set out to destroy \nour country, our way of life, and kill as many Americans as they can. \nDo we want to transfer or release some of these individuals even if \nonly 14 percent of them return? The lives of American troops are at \nstake.\n  By the way, the people who were released early, the over 500, those \nare the people we actually thought were safe. The people who are still \nthere are the most dangerous and deadly.\n  One of the people who was transferred detonated a car bomb in Iraq.\n\n[[Page S6396]]\n\nAnother is now a leading al-Qaida operative in Yemen. As I said before, \nthese were supposedly the safe ones.\n  What would happen if those currently at Gitmo returned to the \nbattlefield?\n  This document and the actions of those detained at Guantanamo Bay \nillustrate what some in this Congress seem to have forgotten. We, as a \nnation, are still at war. They are trying to kill Americans and destroy \nour very way of life. The prisoners at Gitmo realize this. Our troops \nrealize this. It is time that we in Washington, DC, wake up and realize \nit as well.\n  The facilities at Gitmo are state of the art and are some of the most \nimpressive I have ever seen. After touring the facilities down there, I \nbelieve it would be next to if not impossible to recreate those \nfacilities in the United States, partially because of the physical \nlocation of the facility.\n  Guantanamo Bay is also the appropriate place to conduct military \ncommissions. The privacy and seclusion of the unique courtroom \nfacilities that have already been built there allow classified \ninformation to be protected and allow privacy for the 9/11 families who \nare grieving and have chosen to watch the proceedings down there. Too \noften, we forget about those individuals, the families of the 9/11/01 \nvictims.\n  Transferring these hardened terrorists to facilities in the United \nStates would make each of the facilities where they are transferred to, \nand the communities in which they are situated, terrorist targets. Let \nme repeat that.\n  Transferring these hardened terrorists to facilities in the United \nStates would make each one of the facilities they are transferred to \nand the communities in which they are situated terrorist targets.\n  Would you like to own a small business, a gas station or a \nconvenience store around one of these prisons that house terrorists? I \nknow I wouldn't.\n  Another observation that struck me while I was down at Guantanamo Bay \nwas the care and treatment of the detainees. Every--every--effort is \nmade to ensure their religious rights are respected. During my visit to \nthe facility, we even paused as part of our tour out of respect for \nprayer time of the detainees.\n  In addition, there are various programs and resources to provide \ndetainees with instructional training and social recreation. Listen to \nthese statistics.\n  Available to the detainees are over 13,000 books for them to read, \n910 magazines, and various newspapers in different languages that are \ndistributed weekly. They have access to a vast collection of DVDs for \nthe detainees. It is almost like they have Netflix down there. They \nalso have satellite television, including Al-Jazeera. Detainees are \npermitted quarterly phone calls to family members and have received or \nsent over 22,000 pieces of mail, including privileged attorney-client \nmail. Finally, we offer literacy classes, second language classes, and \nart classes for the detainees. These detainees are provided better \nhealth care than a lot of Americans are.\n  Does any of this sound like abuse? Does any of it sound like abuse?\n  In his first 6 months, President Obama has had to make some tough \ndecisions. Some of these decisions, such as his Afghan policy, I \npublicly supported. He needs to realize, though, that on this issue of \ntransferring these hardened terrorists to the United States there is \nstrong bipartisan opposition. If the President were to go down to \nGitmo, tour the facilities, and to be completely honest with himself, I \nbelieve he would come to the same conclusion I did. In the end, there \nare no superior alternatives to Guantanamo Bay.\n  The administration must answer this question: How does closing \nGuantanamo, especially without a plan, make the American people safer?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nArizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6396-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6396-S6397]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Nevada for his \nremarks and I want to associate myself with them.\n  I want to speak to health care and the reform that we are attempting \nto achieve here in Washington. Little disagreement exists about the \nneed for health care reform. A routine trip to the doctor's office can \nbe surprisingly expensive, and many fear if they lose their jobs or \neven if they switch jobs, they will be left without health care. Others \nwho are unemployed may be wondering how they can afford to see a doctor \nat all. So the question is, How can we reform health care so that \neveryone has access to high quality care without changing what works \nfor millions of Americans?\n  President Obama wants to centralize power in Washington, to change \nthe way health care is obtained by all. He would create what he calls a \npublic option. This would not be an insurance program run by the public \nbut one run by the Federal Government; that is to say, bureaucrats here \nin Washington, and I believe it would result in a one-size-fits-all \ngovernment system that would depend upon complex rules and financing \nschemes, some kind of Federal health board and, of course, higher \ntaxes. It would also inevitably create waiting lists for treatment and \ndenial of care for many. Why? Because the Federal Government resources \nare not unlimited, so health care for some will have to be delayed or \ndenied to keep spending in check.\n  The plan the senior Senator from Massachusetts has put forward would \ncreate a medical advisory council to determine what treatments people \nshould get and when they should be treated. The goal of this medical \nadvisory council, again, would be to control spending, not to ensure \nthat everyone gets care when they need it. It could tell Americans when \nthey can get their treatment and what medications they can and cannot \nhave. The plan of the Senator from Massachusetts would also offer \nsubsidies to those whose incomes reach 500 percent above the poverty \nline.\n  President Obama has said that if new government-run health care is \ncreated, you won't have to use it if you prefer your current plan. That \nis not the way the legislation is being written. The way the \nlegislation is being written in the Finance Committee is that after \nyour contract expires--and it is usually an annual contract--your \ninsurance is gone, and your insurance company must begin to abide by a \nnew set of Federal rules and regulations. That means you will not have \nthe same policy you had before.\n  Moreover, the government-run care would quickly crowd out other \ninsurers. Employees who have insurance through their company could be \nforced into the government plan if their employer decides it is simpler \nor cheaper to pay a fine to the Federal Government and eliminate the \ncoverage. The company might reason: Why bother doing the paperwork when \nwe can tell people to get on the government-run plan? That is exactly \nwhat the health experts say will happen.\n  The Lewin Group has estimated that 119 million people will shift from \na private plan that they currently have onto this new government-run \nplan if it is created. That would affect two-thirds of the 170 million \nAmericans who currently have private insurance, all but ending private \ninsurance in this country.\n  First, we have the takeover of the auto companies and banks and AIG \nand student loans and now health care. That is apparently the agenda at \nplay here.\n  Republicans believe that health care reform should make health care \naffordable and portable and accessible. That last point is often \noverlooked. Health care needs to be accessible. People need to get the \ncare they need when they need it, and what the doctor prescribes for \nthem rather than what a bureaucrat says they can have. Access to health \ncare does not mean access to a waiting list. Individuals and families, \nnot the Federal Government, should control decisions about their health \ncare. The principles of freedom and choice should apply here. The \ngovernment should not eliminate your choices and get between you and \nyour doctor.\n  I am not sure why some are embracing government-run insurance when \nthose programs have created so many problems in Canada and the United \nKingdom. Many people think that Canadians and Europeans get the same \nquality of health care Americans get but pay less. That is not true. \nThe stories you hear from individuals in those\n\n[[Page S6397]]\n\ncountries about months- and years-long waiting lists and denial of care \nare not cherry-picked scare stories. They are commonplace. People often \nhave to wait months for an MRI or a dental procedure or a hip \nreplacement that they urgently need.\n  According to a new study by the Fraser Institute, which is a \nCanadian-based think tank, the average wait time for treatment from a \nspecialist in Canada is 18.3 weeks. That is the average waiting time. \nStop and think for a moment. You may have had your physician say, I \nthink you have something very drastically wrong with you and I think \nyou need to see a specialist to confirm whether that diagnosis is true, \nbut you are going to have to wait on average 18 weeks for the \nspecialist to see you.\n  Some people then say, well, at least everybody in Canada has a \ndoctor. That is also not true. That same study reports that 1.7 million \nCanadians--and that is out of a country with a population of 33 \nmillion--were unable to see a family physician in the year 2007. Let me \nrepeat: 1.7 million people couldn't even see a family doctor, and that \nnumber does not include those who have a doctor and are on a waiting \nlist, so add the wait times. The bottom line is that having a \ngovernment-run plan does not guarantee that everyone will have access \nto a doctor or to medical care. Indeed, it chokes access.\n  There are some Canadian doctors who are taking action because of \nthis. Private hospitals are sprouting up all over Canada. Dr. David \nGratzer, who is a physician, recently wrote an article in the Wall \nStreet Journal about the story of another physician, Dr. Brian Day of \nVancouver. Dr. Day, who is an orthopedic surgeon, grew tired of the \ngovernment cutbacks that reduced his access to an operating room, while \nat the same time increasing the number of people waiting to see him. So \nhe opened a private clinic, the Cambie Surgery Center, which employees \nmore than 100 doctors. Public hospitals send him patients because they \nare too busy to treat them. The New York Times has reported a private \nclinic is opening each week in Canada.\n  Think about that. This is in response to a wonderful health care \nsystem? No, it is in response to a health care system that denies care \nto patients.\n  Opening a private clinic that gives health care access to more \npeople, of course, is a noble thing to do, and I commend Dr. Day, but \nthe success of these clinics also shows that many people who can get \nout of government-run health care will do so.\n  Americans do not deserve or want health care that forces them into a \ngovernment bureaucracy that will delay or deny their care and force \nthem to navigate a web of complex rules and regulations. They want \naccess to high-quality care for their own families and for their \nneighbors. They want to pick their own doctors, and they do not want \nWashington to dictate what care they can and cannot get for their \nfamilies.\n  On a personal note, none of us in the Senate or in the gallery or \nanybody who may be watching us, I suspect, cares more about anything in \nthe world--other than perhaps their own freedom--than the health of \ntheir family. If there is a health emergency right now, we will all \ndrop anything we are doing to provide whatever health care is needed \nfor our family. We don't want anybody to stand in the way of that. But \nthe bottom line is that it is inevitable; when government wants to \ncontrol the cost of providing health care, and it has control, what it \nwill do is to either deny information to people about what options are \navailable, as happens in Germany, for example; delay the care, which is \nfrequently what happens in Canada; or what frequently happens in Great \nBritain, where they have a board that makes these decisions, they deny \nthe care altogether because it is simply too expensive for what they \nconsider the value you get out of it. For example: If you are over a \ncertain age, then you are not likely to have an operation such as a hip \noperation or a knee operation. There are other restrictions that apply \nas well.\n\n  We don't want that in America. We don't want the government in \nWashington saying that because we want to save money, you can't get \ncare. I would also remind folks that the alternative that is being \ncreated in Canada--these private clinics--is not available under the \none government-run program we have in America--the Medicare system. We \nalso have a veterans' care system. But under Medicare, there is no \nalternative. You can't have private care. If you are on Medicare, and \nyou go to a doctor who serves Medicare patients, it is against the law \nfor him to treat you and then charge you individually for that. Under \nMedicare, it is either Medicare or no care. That is the law.\n  I know because I tried to get it changed. We tried to get something \ncalled private contracting, which would be the same as that alternative \nin Canada--the private clinic. We tried to get that for Medicare, so \nthat if you were not satisfied with what Medicare gave you, and you \nwanted to speed it up or get a private doctor, even if he charged you \nwhatever amount he charged you, you would have the right to do that. \nNo. What Congress did was to say--in the middle of the night, in a \nconference committee--that you cannot do that. Only if a doctor says in \nadvance, I will not treat Medicare patients for at least 2 years is he \nable to provide that care to you.\n  So we have a perverse incentive. If you want to take care of people \noutside of Medicare, you have to agree not to treat Medicare patients. \nAnd since we have so many physicians deciding not to take Medicare \npatients, that is the wrong incentive. We should be encouraging them to \ntake more Medicare patients and at least allow the option that people \nin Canada have.\n  The bottom line is, Washington-run health care is not a good idea, \nand Republicans are not going to support legislation that includes \nWashington-run insurance companies or that gets in between the \nphysician and the patient and interferes with that important \nrelationship to deny or delay care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I did on \nJune 2, to urge quick action on the nomination of Hillary Tompkins to \nbe the Solicitor in the Department of the Interior. That is an \nimportant job in this country and in the Department of the Interior, \nand the President has chosen well in choosing Miss Tompkins to be the \nSolicitor. She has broad experience in natural resource issues. She is \nextremely well qualified in all respects. She was chief counsel to the \nGovernor of New Mexico, Governor Richardson, until recently, where she \ndemonstrated her ability to lead a team of lawyers in that position and \nto provide sound legal counsel. So it is unclear to me why anyone would \nbe objecting to her being approved as our Solicitor.\n  When I came to the floor on June 2, about 8 days ago, and talked \nabout this subject, I asked unanimous consent that we proceed to \nexecutive session, that her nomination be confirmed, and that we advise \nthe President of our action and the Senate go back to other business. \nSenator McConnell, on behalf of the Republican Members in the Senate, \nobjected and said that--I think his specific response was they were \nstill working on this. Let me quote him. He said:\n\n       We have not been able to get that nomination cleared yet on \n     this side, but we will be consulting with the Republican \n     colleagues, and at some point let him know whether it is \n     possible to go forward.\n\n  I assume the word ``him'' in that quote refers to me. At any rate, he \nobjected. That was disappointing. But I am even more disappointed to \nannounce or to call attention to the fact that we still are not able to \nclear Miss Tompkins for this important position. I think it is unfair \nto her, I think it is unfair to our former colleague, now Secretary of \nthe Interior Salazar, who needs a capable person in this position. We \nshould not be standing in the way of that occurring. I think his \nability to serve the people of the country will be improved by having a \ngood solicitor in that office and we should get on with the job of \nconfirming that nomination.\n  At the time I was urging action on her nomination before, I was \nadvised that there were two Senators who had objections. Senator Coburn \nhad put a hold on the nominee because of concerns of one kind or \nanother--I don't know the specifics--and I believe Senator Bunning had \nconcerns as well. I have now been advised that both of\n\n[[Page S6398]]\n\nthose Senators have withdrawn their holds and are now satisfied.\n  Senator Bunning had written a letter to Secretary Salazar raising \nconcerns about coal mining and mountaintop-removal-related issues. \nSecretary Salazar responded to that letter on June 4. As I understand \nit, Senator Coburn also wrote. His letter was to Miss Tompkins, raising \nquestions about whether she was in fact committed to enforcing the law \nwhen she was the Solicitor. She wrote him back and said she is clearly \ncommitted to enforcing the law, which of course would be part of her \noath of office.\n  Based on those exchanges of letters, I am informed that both Senator \nBunning and Senator Coburn are satisfied that her nomination can go \nforward at this time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe correspondence between those two Senators and Secretary Salazar and \nthe nominee Hillary Tompkins, following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Those concerns have been resolved. I am not clear as to \nwhat the continued problem is, why we cannot get this nomination \ncleared. I raise it at this point. I put people on notice, or the \nSenate on notice, if we are not able to get it cleared I will once \nagain come to the floor and ask unanimous consent later this week for \nus to proceed to executive session and to confirm that nomination.\n  I think this is a highly irregular process to just hold someone \nhostage for some totally unrelated concern which she has no ability to \ncontrol. If there were some problem with this nominee, if there were \nsome objection to her qualifications, clearly that would be a different \nmatter. But as far as I know there is no objection to her \nqualifications. There is no problem with this nominee or any statements \nshe has made or any action she has taken. On that ground, I think we \nneed to move quickly to confirm her nomination. I hope my colleagues \nwill agree and will allow that to happen later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 3, 2009.\n     Hilary Tompkins,\n     Department of the Interior,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Ms. Tompkins, As you know, on May 22, 2009, President \n     Obama signed into law the Protecting Americans from Violent \n     Crime Act. This act was overwhelmingly approved in a \n     bipartisan fashion in both the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives as an amendment to the Credit Card \n     Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, and \n     will take effect in February, 2010.\n       The act states, ``The Secretary of the Interior shall not \n     promulgate or enforce any regulation that prohibits an \n     individual from possessing a firearm including an assembled \n     or functional firearm in any unit of the National Park System \n     or the National Wildlife Refuge System if--\n       (1) the individual is not otherwise prohibited by law from \n     possessing the firearm; and\n       (2) the possession of the firearm is in compliance with the \n     law of the State in which the unit of the National Park \n     System or the National Wildlife Refuge System is located.''\n       Forty-eight states protect the rights of their residents to \n     carry a concealed weapon. Properly implemented, the \n     Protecting Americans from Violent Crime Act should, for the \n     first time, also protect the individual's right to carry and \n     possess firearms in all national parks and wildlife refuges, \n     in accordance with state and federal law.\n       As Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, will you \n     commit to ensuring the law is implemented in a way that \n     robustly protects the rights of law-abiding gun owners, as \n     Congress clearly intended? Will you also commit to vigorously \n     defend this law against hostile litigation?\n       Thank you for your desire to serve our great country. I \n     look forward to receiving your response by Friday, June 5, \n     2009.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Tom Coburn,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 5, 2009.\n     Hon. Tom Coburn, M.D.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Coburn: Thank you for your letter of June 3, \n     2009, containing questions to me that relate to the \n     Protecting Americans from Violent Crime Act, which was \n     included in Public Law 111-24 and will take effect in \n     February 2010.\n       Following the enactment of Public Law 111-24, the Secretary \n     announced that the Department would follow Congress's \n     directive and implement the new law when it takes effect. If \n     confirmed as Solicitor, I will be duty-bound to uphold and \n     defend the Constitution and laws of the United States, \n     including this particular law.\n       With regard to defending this law against legal challenges, \n     the Attorney General of the United States is charged by \n     statute with representing the United States in all legal \n     matters. If confirmed, I will commit to working closely with \n     the Department of Justice in connection with any defense of \n     this Act and all other federal laws.\n           Sincerely,\n     Hilary C.

Coal mining is a \n     top energy issue to the Commonwealth of Kentucky and \n     consequently I have an extreme interest in the stream buffer \n     zone rule.\n       Aside from striking a balance between environmental \n     protections, the now abandoned rule clarified a long standing \n     dispute over how the Surface Mining law should be applied. \n     Issuance of the rule represented the culmination of a seven \n     year process that was thorough and well vetted. While I \n     appreciate the comments that you and other members of the \n     Department of the Interior have made regarding the importance \n     of the role of our coal mining communities in our national \n     energy landscape, I also believe that nearly a decade of \n     examination of this issue should not be overturned lightly.\n       I respectfully ask for your full commitment to work with me \n     as DOI determines how it will resolve the stream buffer zone \n     matter. I further ask for a prompt written reply to this \n     request. I appreciate your consideration and look forward to \n     hearing from you.

We have asked the \n     Court to take action that will allow the 1983 Reagan \n     Administration rule to continue in force in all of the states \n     that have delegated authority under the Surface Mining \n     Control and Reclamation Act. Kentucky. along with most \n     states, currently follows the 1983 rule.\n       I will ensure that there is an opportunity for public input \n     on the potential development of a comprehensive new stream \n     buffer zone rule that would update and clarify the 1983 rule. \n     We will keep you informed of our progress in this matter and \n     welcome your suggestions.\n       As I have said many times, we must responsibly develop \n     cOnventional energy sources, including coal. in order to \n     achieve greater energy independence. I look forward to \n     working together to achieve these goals.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Ken Salazar.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

It is an \nunspoken trust that certain things in our lives and communities are \ntaken care of, that we don't have to think much about because we trust \nour government to keep us safe.\n  I think most Americans turn on the tap each day and expect the water \nthey drink to be safe, and they probably do not think a lot about it. \nWe expect if there is an emergency we will be able to pick up the phone \nand dial 9-1-1 and someone will answer and send help to us.\n  That is exactly what the people who lived in Bellingham, WA, used to \nthink about oil and gas pipelines, if they thought about them at all. \nBut all of our senses of safety and innocence were shattered 10 years \nago today when tragedy struck for three families, and an entire \ncommunity came together to\n\n[[Page S6399]]\n\ngrieve and to learn and eventually stand up and say: Never again.\n  June 10, 1999, was a quiet sunny day in Bellingham, WA. For a lot of \nthe students there it was the last day of school for the year. That \nshould have been how it remained--as a day when kids played and \ncelebrated about the coming of summer. Unfortunately, due to a series \nof mistakes and neglectful actions, it is now remembered as a day of \nfear and loss that the community still grieves.\n  Ten years ago today, around 3:30 in the afternoon on the west coast, \na gasoline pipeline that ran through Bellingham, underground and near \nWhatcom Falls Park, ruptured, releasing more than a quarter of a \nmillion gallons of gasoline into Whatcom Creek. That gas ignited, \nsending a huge fireball racing down the entire creek, destroying \neverything in its path for more than a mile. It created this huge plume \nof smoke that rose more than 20,000 feet into the air.\n  The photo behind me was taken just moments after that explosion. \nMinutes before this, it was just a quiet creek, and this is what it \nlooked like. That dramatic explosion took the lives, tragically, of \nthree young people. Stephen Tsiorvas and Wade King were playing along \nthe banks of the creek when this tremendous fireball ran across the \nwater and set everything around them ablaze. They were both badly \ninjured, and Stephen threw Wade into the creek and jumped in himself to \ntry to soothe their burns. The boys were burned over 90 percent of \ntheir bodies and both died the next day. They were both just 10 years \nold.\n  The same afternoon, the same time, 18-year-old Liam Wood, who had \njust graduated from high school 5 days earlier, was fly fishing along \nthis creek. He was overcome by the fumes, lost consciousness, and \ndrowned. Stephen, Wade, and Liam were innocent victims of a horrific \naccident. But it was an accident that could have been and should have \nbeen prevented.\n  Pipeline networks stretch across the entire country. They run under \nour homes, they run by our schools, and our offices. Most people do not \neven know they are there. In fact, former Bellingham Police Chief Don \nPierce, who was on this scene that day back in 1999, was recently \nquoted as he said:\n\n       As I was standing there none of it made any sense because \n     creeks don't catch on fire. I don't think I knew that there \n     was a gas pipeline that ran under there.\n\n  The chief of police didn't know there was a gas pipeline underneath.\n  Nationwide, the Office of Pipeline Safety oversees more than 2.3 \nmillion miles of pipeline that transports hazardous liquids and natural \ngas under communities across the country. They perform a very important \nservice, bringing oil and essential products to our homes and \nbusinesses.\n  Prior to this accident in Bellingham, WA, I rarely heard about them \nmyself and, like most Americans, I just assumed they were safe. At \nfirst I thought the Bellingham explosion was a fluke, something that \nnever happens. Then, when I started to investigate this issue, I was \nastonished by what I learned. It turned out that what happened in \nBellingham that day was not an isolated occurrence. In fact, it was not \neven rare.\n  According to the Office of Pipeline Safety, from 1986 until the time \nof this accident in 1999, there had been more than 5,500 incidents \nresulting in 310 deaths and 1,500 injuries.\n  Not only had these accidents destroyed families, they had destroyed \nthe environment. At that time, 6 million gallons of hazardous liquid \nwere being released by these incidents every year--6 million gallons. \nThat is like having an oil spill the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster \nevery 2 years. The environmental damage was estimated to cost $1 \nbillion.\n  In addition to this horrific loss that was sustained by these three \nBellingham families, this explosion caused massive environmental \ndamage. In fact, I had been scheduled to be at this exact site just a \nfew weeks later to dedicate a great, newly restored, salmon spawning \nground. When I went there and saw the damage after the explosion, I was \nshocked. That blast had destroyed all the plant and animal life in the \ncreek, and a once very lush and diverse habitat had been burned to \nashes.\n  Again, our community was not unique. At that time, on average, our \nNation was suffering one pipeline accident every single day. While \nBellingham may not have been unique in our tragedy, we were one of a \nkind in our response. Today, 10 years after the unthinkable happened, \nthe story of the Bellingham natural gas explosion is also a story of \nhow a community came together to tackle a nationwide problem and \nprotect other Americans from coast to coast. As we together learned \nabout the problems with inspection and oversight of our national \npipeline system, the community channeled their grief into action.\n  Through research, I found out there were inadequate laws, \ninsufficient oversight, too few inspections, and not enough trained \ninspectors, as well as a lack of awareness about these pipeline \ndangers. I learned one of the most important public safety offices, the \nOffice of Pipeline Safety, was underfunded and neglected.\n  I asked the inspector general of the Department of Transportation to \ninvestigate the Office of Pipeline Safety and provide recommendations \nfor how we could make this system work better, and I got to work \nwriting a bill to improve pipeline safety in America.\n  It turned out to be a very long, hard fight to convince Congress this \nwas something we had to do something about. The people of Bellingham \nstood with me every single step of the way. The parents of the young \nvictims who were tragically lost on this date came to Washington, DC, \nto testify. So did Bellingham Mayor Mark Asmundson, and Carl Weimer, \nwho is now head of the Pipeline Safety Trust.\n  That trust came into being thanks to the efforts of families and a \ngroup called SAFE Bellingham, that had organized to fight for the \nbetter pipeline safety and accident prevention measures.\n  So together with them and the great support of colleagues here in the \nSenate--Senator John McCain took a tremendous lead as chair of the \ncommittee, and I thank him for that; former Senators Slade Gorton and \nFritz Hollings came together; Senator Cantwell; Congress Members Jack \nMetcalf, Rick Larsen; many others--together we worked very hard and \npassed and President Bush finally signed into law our legislation in \n2002 to give the Office of Pipeline Safety the resources and the muscle \nit needed to keep Americans safe. That law improved the training of \npipeline personnel. It raised the penalty for safety violations. It \ninvested in new technology that was badly needed so we could improve \npipeline safety. It improved the inspection practices and, importantly, \nexpanded authority to our States to conduct their own safety \nactivities.\n  So children today in every corner of our State are safer because the \npeople of Bellingham stood up and said: We do not want this to happen \never again.\n  But I am here today to remind us, 10 years later, that the work is \nnot done. While our law has greatly reduced the number of pipeline \ntragedies, there still are accidents every year. That is why I am on \nthe floor today to introduce a Senate resolution designating June 10 as \nNational Pipeline Safety Day. I am introducing this resolution to \nremind all of our communities to remain vigilant and to encourage their \nState and local governments to continue to promote pipeline safety and \nto create public awareness of the pipelines that run under and through \nevery one of our communities.\n  For me, this 10-year anniversary is a reminder of a day of terrible \npain we must never forget. But it is also a reminder that we cannot \njust assume someone else is taking care of things. We cannot slip back \nto where we were before. We have to stay vigilant and continue to work \nto improve the safety of our pipeline system. That is the best way we \ncan continue to celebrate and honor Steven, Wade, and Liam.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of S. Res. 181 which was submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 181) designating June 10, 2009, as \n     ``National Pipeline Safety Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed \nto,\n\n[[Page S6400]]\n\nthe preamble be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 181) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 181\n\n       Whereas there are more than 2,000,000 miles of gas and \n     hazardous liquid pipelines in the United States that are \n     operated by more than 3,000 companies;\n       Whereas gas and hazardous liquid pipelines play a vital \n     role in the lives of people in the United States by \n     delivering the energy needed to heat homes, drive cars, cook \n     food and operate businesses;\n       Whereas, during the last decade, significant new pipelines \n     have been built to help move North American sources of oil \n     and gas to refineries and markets;\n       Whereas, on June 10, 1999, a hazardous liquid pipeline \n     ruptured and exploded in a park in Bellingham, Washington, \n     killing 2 10-year-old boys and a young man, destroying a \n     salmon stream, and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     damage and economic disruption;\n       Whereas, in response to the pipeline tragedy on June 10, \n     1999, Congress enacted significant new pipeline safety \n     regulations, including in the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act \n     of 2002 (Public Law 107-355; 116 Stat. 2985) and the Pipeline \n     Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-468; 120 Stat. 3486);\n       Whereas, during the last decade, the Pipelines and \n     Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the Department \n     of Transportation, with support from a diverse group of \n     stakeholders, has instituted a variety of important new rules \n     and pipeline safety initiatives, such as the Common Ground \n     Alliance, pipeline emergency training with the National \n     Association of State Fire Marshals, and the Pipelines and \n     Informed Planning Alliance;\n       Whereas, even with pipeline safety improvements, in 2008 \n     there were 274 significant pipeline incidents that caused \n     more than $395,000,000 of damage to property and disrupted \n     the economy;\n       Whereas, even though pipelines are the safest method to \n     transport huge quantities of fuel, pipeline incidents are \n     still occurring, including the pipeline explosion in Edison, \n     New Jersey, in 1994 that left 100 people homeless, the butane \n     pipeline explosion in Texas in 1996 that left 2 teenagers \n     dead, the pipeline explosion near Carlsbad, New Mexico, in \n     2000 that killed 12 people in an extended family, the \n     pipeline explosion in Walnut Creek, California, in 2004 that \n     killed 5 workers, and the propane pipeline explosion in \n     Mississippi in 2007 that killed a teenager and her \n     grandmother;\n       Whereas the millions of miles of pipelines are still ``out \n     of sight'', and therefore ``out of mind'' for the majority of \n     people, local governments, and businesses in the United \n     States, a situation that can lead to pipeline damage and a \n     general lack of oversight of pipelines;\n       Whereas greater awareness of pipelines and pipeline safety \n     can improve public safety;\n       Whereas a ``National Pipeline Safety Day'' can provide a \n     focal point for creating greater pipeline safety awareness; \n     and\n       Whereas June 10, 2009, is the 10th anniversary of the \n     Bellingham, Washington, pipeline tragedy that was the impetus \n     for many of the safety improvements described in this \n     resolution and is an appropriate day to designate as \n     ``National Pipeline Safety Day'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 10, 2009, as ``National Pipeline Safety \n     Day'';\n       (2) encourages State and local governments to observe the \n     day with appropriate activities that promote pipeline safety;\n       (3) encourages all pipeline safety stakeholders to use the \n     day to create greater public awareness of all the \n     advancements that can lead to greater pipeline safety; and\n       (4) encourages individuals throughout the United States to \n     become more aware of the pipelines that run through \n     communities in the United States and to encourage safe \n     practices and damage prevention relating to gas and hazardous \n     liquid pipelines.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank my Senate colleagues.\n  I remind all of us as Americans that we have to be vigilant about \nwhat is around us, and when we are, we can make a difference in the \nlives of many people. The tragedy that occurred in Bellingham, WA, 10 \nyears ago today will remain with me always and with the families of \nBellingham and everyone else. But if we do our work and we remain \nvigilant and we fund the Office of Pipeline Safety and we insist on \nstrong protections, we can protect families in the future. That is what \nis important about today.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6400-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6400-S6403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Earlier this morning and, in fact, for the past several \ndays, I have been interested to hear the comments from several of our \nRepublican counterparts on the issue of health care. They are talking \nabout Canada. Now, that is interesting. I appreciate that. Coming from \na State close to Canada, we are very interested in what Canada does. \nBut the discussion about what Canada does with its health care system \nhas no bearing on what we are trying to do here in the Senate and \nCongress to reform the American health care system.\n  I guess, and I am only guessing, they want to talk about Canada \nbecause they do not want to talk about their real priority. Their real \npriority in coming out and inflating a discussion that should not even \nexist because it is not what we are talking about is simply because \nthey want to protect the status quo. They want to protect the status \nquo in our health care system today. So they are out here talking about \nCanada. Well, that is not an option.\n  Let me tell you what we are doing because this is a very important \ndiscussion and a very important piece of legislation we are beginning \nour work on in the Senate. The status quo is not acceptable. This is an \nextraordinary moment of opportunity for real reform in health care. We \nhere in the Senate are working very hard to come up with legislation \nthat will reduce the cost for our families, for our businesses, and for \nour government.\n  Like all of my colleagues, I go home every weekend and I hear from \nindividual families and people, from community leaders and businesses \nthat the status quo is not acceptable. They will not tolerate a debate \nhere in the Senate that goes for the status quo.\n  We here in the Senate are working on legislation that will protect \npeople's choice of doctors, will protect their choice of hospitals, \nwill protect their choice of insurance plan. If you like what you have \ntoday, that will be what you have when this legislation is passed. And \nthat is very important. We are also working as a goal to assure that \naffordable, high-quality health care is available for every American. \nThat is not the case today. Our work really builds on the existing \nemployer-based system we have. We strengthen it. Again, if you like \nwhat you have, you will be able to keep it. Let me say this again: If \nyou like what you have, when our legislation is passed and signed by \nthe President, you will be able to keep it. But if you do not like what \nyou have today in terms of your health care or if you do not have any \nhealth care insurance at all, we are going to provide new options for \nyou so you have better health care.\n  Health care reform is not a luxury, it is an imperative today. Our \nhealth care system puts far too many Americans into crisis, and \nreforming it is an urgent necessity that demands our immediate \nattention. If we are going to restore the economy and secure our \nNation's fiscal future, now is the time to make health care more \naffordable for American families and business and government at every \nlevel. Doing nothing is not an option.\n  As we move forward on this debate, I remind all of us, do not be \ndistracted by superfluous arguments that do not apply to the bills we \nare discussing.\n  The bill on which we are going to move forward in the Senate makes \nsure that if you like what you have today, you are going to be able to \nkeep it. But as you and I both know, Mr. President, too many people \ncannot afford their health care today or they are unable to get health \ninsurance because their insurance company says: You have too many \nproblems, we are not going to insure you, or they do not have insurance \nat all. We want to make sure health care is available to every \nAmerican.\n  I am very proud of the effort that is going on as we speak. The \nhealth care committee is meeting today with our Republican colleagues \nto walk through our ideas we have now been putting together and get \ntheir input and ask for their options. We hope to work with\n\n[[Page S6401]]\n\nthem side by side, and we are giving them every opportunity to do so, \nbecause health care has to work for all Americans.\n  So despite the rhetoric we heard on the floor this morning about \nCanada, which I love--Canada is a great country--that is not what we \nare doing here. We are moving forward on health care reform that is \ndrastically needed. The status quo is not an option. Doing nothing is \nnot an option. Stopping us from moving forward is not an option. This \nis an issue we are having the courage to take up and move forward on \nbecause America needs us to do that.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we are considering a bill that would allow \nthe Food and Drug Administration to regulate one of the most deadly \nsubstances for sale in America, tobacco, a substance responsible for \n400,000 deaths, more than HIV/AIDs, for example, each year, more deaths \nthan illegal drug use, alcohol use, motor vehicle accidents, suicides \nand murders combined, a substance responsible for $100 billion in \nhealth care costs every single year. I am glad we have finally reached \nthis point. I hope we can pass this bill with a strong bipartisan vote. \nThis moment has been coming for 20 years. There are Senators who \ndeserve credit for where we are today in coming to this moment in \nhistory, none more than Senator Ted Kennedy. Senator Kennedy has been \nour leader on this issue. Unfortunately, his personal health struggle \nprevents him from joining us regularly, and he may not be here for the \nvote today, but we wouldn't have reached this point without him. His \ndogged determination to reduce the number of tobacco-related deaths and \nillnesses in America has brought us to this moment in history. We will \nbe voting with him in mind, as we should.\n  I thank Senator Chris Dodd, who once again has stepped in, in an \nextraordinary way, as he did with credit card reform, passing a bill \nthat had been decades in the making. Senator Dodd, at the last moment, \nhas been called in by Senator Kennedy and has done a spectacular job to \nmove this bill forward. I am hoping we can pass it and get it enacted \ninto law. It will save lives. But we can't blame tobacco for all the \nfaults in our health care system. There are many parts that need to be \naddressed.\n  The United States spends about 17 percent of its GDP, gross domestic \nproduct, on health care. This amounts to $7,400 per person on health \ncare each year. We spend more than twice as much as any other country \non Earth when it comes to health care. As of 2006, health spending in \nthe United States was 90 percent higher than any other industrialized \ncountry. Health insurance premium increases consistently outpace \ninflation and the growth in family earnings. About 30 percent of \nAmerica's poor people spend more than 10 percent of their income on \nhealth care. Since the beginning of this decade, health insurance \npremiums have gone up by 78 percent. Everybody knows this. No matter \nwho one works for--private business, public entity--we know the cost of \nhealth insurance keeps skyrocketing. Wages have only gone up 15 percent \nin that period. People and families cannot keep up. Overall, 46 million \nAmericans have lost their insurance. Many lose their insurance for \nperiods during the course of a year because of changing jobs and losing \njobs.\n  With the amount of money our country dedicates to health, the facts \ndon't line up. Yesterday my colleague from Arizona, the Senate \nRepublican whip, Jon Kyl, spoke about the problems with our health care \nsystem. I am glad he agreed there are problems to address. I need to \nclarify at least my view as to some of the things he said. Democrats in \nCongress are committed to working with President Obama to ensure that \nAmericans can keep the health care they have, if that is their choice. \nYesterday, Senator Kyl said:\n\n       If you are an employee of a small business, for example, \n     when your insurance contract runs out--and those contracts \n     are usually 1 year or 2 years--the bottom line is, even \n     though you may like it, at the end of the next year, when the \n     contract runs out, you don't get to keep it.\n\n  That is not accurate. I have to say Senator Kyl is saying something \nthat doesn't reflect the position of the President, nor any Democrat I \nknow in Congress. We believe--and we stand by this--if you like your \ncurrent health insurance plan, you will be able to keep it, plain and \nsimple, straightforward.\n  Senator Kyl alluded to specific frustrations felt by small business \nowners across the country. Believe me, I understand that issue better \nthan some. I have been working with Senator Blanche Lincoln of \nArkansas, Senator Snowe of Maine, and Senator Klobuchar of Minnesota to \ncome up with a plan so small business owners will be able to afford \nhealth insurance. I am happy to say that, at least at this moment, \nthere is an indication the Finance Committee is considering our bill as \npart of their overall work product. As important as keeping your health \nplan, if you like it, if you are a small business owner, you find \nhealth premiums have increased 200 percent because you had one sick \nemployee or one sick baby born to a family of one of your employees, we \nwant to make sure you are no longer subject to the unfair practice of \nraising premiums for that situation. In today's system, at the end of \nthe contract, small businesses are at the mercy of insurance companies \nthat are in it for profit.\n  Earlier this week, I talked about a small businessman in Springfield, \nmy hometown, who, in a span of just a few years, has seen his insurance \npremiums increase by 500 percent, though he has never turned in a \nclaim. He has been forced to change his health care plan repeatedly. \nBecause he is a small business owner, he has no bargaining power. What \nwe are trying to do is ensure Americans are protected from this kind of \nprice increase and that promised services are there when they need \nthem.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to raise \ntactics of fear and concern to steer us away from the real issues at \nhand. Yesterday the Senator from Arizona talked about ``a new regime of \nregulation for the insurance companies.'' He expressed concern that \nDemocrats in Congress are trying to control what health insurance \ncompanies are doing. If the Senator is talking about trying to take \nunder control some of the practices of health insurance companies \ntoday, I would say it is long overdue. People know what happens when \ntheir health insurance premiums go up dramatically, even though they \nhaven't turned in a claim. Folks know when health insurance companies \nsay they are going to exclude preexisting conditions and your health \ninsurance policy is virtually worthless because the problems you face \nin life can't then be covered. Folks know what it is to call that \nhealth insurance company and bargain or argue with some clerk over \ncoverage. Changing those things, if that is what regulation is all \nabout, is long overdue. It is time that customers, consumers, families, \nand businesses had a fighting chance when it came to health insurance \ncompanies.\n  We will hear plenty of speeches in the Congress in opposition to \nhealth care reform from a lot of people who are speaking for the health \ninsurance companies. Why don't they come up and say it. If they want to \ncome to the floor and say: We like the current system; we don't believe \nit needs to be changed; we don't believe there is a crisis facing us in \nterms of cost; we believe that health insurance companies are doing a \ngreat job and shouldn't have to change their ways, let that be their \nposition. But it is a position that is indefensible with the vast \nmajority of the American people. They understand we should be focusing \non the best interests of patients and families, not the best interests \nof health insurance companies, nor the best interest of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The bottom line is, we have to come up with health care reform which \nstarts to reduce the cost of health care, making it more affordable, \npreserving quality, creating incentives for good health care outcomes, \nand focusing on\n\n[[Page S6402]]\n\nthe family and the patient, not on the government agency.\n  I am encouraged my colleague from Arizona raised the issue of \ninsurance contracts, given his concern with small businesses and access \nto health care. I think he would want attention paid to what insurance \ncompanies are doing to these small businesses. Earlier this year, the \nGAO released a report showing how little competition there is and what \na tough time small businesses have to find health insurance. The medium \nmarket share of the largest carrier of the small group market was about \n47 percent, ranging from 21 percent in Arizona to about 96 percent in \nAlabama. This leaves American small businesses with few choices. We \nwant to change that. Those who come to the floor of the Senate \ndefending the health insurance companies and saying they want no change \nin the health care system have to defend the indefensible. How do they \nexplain what small businesses and families are facing now when they are \ntrying to find affordable, quality health insurance?\n  If my colleague from Arizona wants to help small businesses, let him \njoin us in the bipartisan bill Senators Lincoln, Snowe, Klobuchar, and \nI are offering, the SHOP Act. By doing so, he will be working with us \nin committees to make a positive change.\n  I also wish to clarify one thing. Time and again, Senator McConnell, \non the Republican side, and Senator Kyl have come to argue against \ngovernment health care. They talk about it in the most general terms. \nWhat they are actually arguing against is a public option. What we hope \nto see come from all this debate about health care reform is lots of \nopportunities for America's families and businesses to shop for health \ninsurance from private insurance companies but to have, in some \ncircumstances, the option of a government-run plan they can choose, if \nthey wish--voluntary choice. Of all the criticism heard on the floor \nabout government health insurance, I have yet to hear Senator McConnell \nor Senator Kyl criticize Medicare. Why? Because 40 million Americans \ncount on it. They know that were it not for Medicare, they couldn't \nafford health insurance. People live a whole lifetime without health \ninsurance protection. Finally, when they hit age 65, they have \nMedicare, and they thank the Lord for that day.\n  Medicare does a great job. Medicare is a proven success. For over 40 \nyears, Medicare has provided quality care to America's seniors and \ndisabled, and we have seen the longevity, the life expectancy of \nseniors increase every year and their independence increase because \nthey don't end up with a mountain of health debt to pass on to their \nchildren or have to exhaust their savings. If the Senator from Kentucky \nand the Senator from Arizona want to come to the floor and argue \nagainst Medicare, I welcome the debate. I wish to be here when they say \nthat government health insurance program has failed us. It has not. It \nhas worked. To create a public option for those across the country as \npart of health care reform is long overdue. We need to build on and \nimprove Medicare, and we can do that.\n  We also have to make sure our health care system is based on science \nand the best outcomes, that we encourage preventive care, that we see \nthose elements in our society where people can do things to make their \nown health care better.\n  Time and again you will hear the Republicans come to the floor as if \nthey are part of the Travel Channel. They do not want to talk about \nAmerica and the problems we face. They want to talk about England, New \nZealand, Australia, Canada. They do not want to talk about the United \nStates of America.\n  Well, it is time for them to come home and recognize that we can \nimprove our health care system, letting Americans keep the health \ninsurance they have if they want to keep it, making sure we start to \nbring costs down, making quality health insurance available, giving \nfamilies the peace of mind that the cost of health insurance is not \ngoing to go through the roof and beyond their means. That is part of \nthis debate.\n  Democrats are working to ensure Americans have real choice when it \ncomes to their health care.\n  My colleague from the other side of the aisle referred to the public \noption as government-run insurance. He believes that the insurance \nindustry is already regulated enough and that a public option is \nunnecessary.\n  I can tell the Senator that when I am receiving hundreds of letters \nand phone calls from constituents who cannot afford health insurance \nand who are seeing their premiums increase at alarming rates then I \nknow our current health care insurance industry is not working for \neverybody.\n  In fact, according to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, two-\nthirds of Americans support a public health insurance option similar to \nMedicare to compete with private health insurance plans.\n  Republicans want to preserve a broken system--one with escalating \ncosts and no guarantee that policies won't be cancelled.\n  Rather than help insurance companies, Democrats want to put American \nfamilies first and help those struggling with high health care costs.\n  A public option for health insurance offers the American people the \nsecurity that the government is looking out for their best interests--\njust like Medicare does for our seniors.\n  My colleague is correct in that the Medicare Program needs some \nchanges. I hope he will be supportive of the changes we will include in \nthe health reform package.\n  Yes, we need to streamline the Medicare Program, restructure the \ndelivery of care, and emphasize quality. We will do it and save costs. \nBut we should build on what works, and despite what my colleague says, \nMedicare works.\n  According to a study by the Commonwealth Fund, 61 percent of elderly \nMedicare beneficiaries said they had received excellent or very good \ncare, compared to only half of those with employer-sponsored \nhealthcare.\n  This health care debate is Congress's opportunity to improve what we \nhave and cut costs for the future.\n  Comparative effectiveness research will help us do just that. Senator \nKyl claims that the government may misuse comparative effectiveness \nresearch as a tool to ration or deny health care. His use of the word \n``rationing'' is only a veiled attempt to defend the status quo no \nmatter how ineffective.\n  Comparative effectiveness is a tool to expand Americans' access to \nhigh-quality health care, not restrict it. When we know which \ntreatments are more effective than other treatments, people will want \nthe best and avoid what is ineffective. But we need this research in \norder to distinguish the best from the not so good.\n  Our health care system rations care today based on ability to pay. If \nwe reform our health system and identify which treatments are most \neffective, we can reduce that hidden rationing by making health care \nmore affordable for everyone.\n  We need to learn what works and empower providers and patients to use \nthat information. That is rationing-- is a sensible component of the \neffort to build a high-quality, value-based, results-oriented health \nsystem.\n  We have serious problems in our health care system. This is America, \nand America needs a uniquely American solution to our Nation's health \ncare problems. This is what Senate Democrats are committed to enacting.\n  Mr. Kyl told some tragic stories of individuals in Canada and Britain \nwhose experience with their country's health care system was not what \nwe would define as quality health care.\n  I am sure we would like to think my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle are sincerely concerned with the quality of health care \naround the globe, but I am more inclined to believe that this is their \nscare tactics trying to cloud the important issues once again.\n  In fact, Mr. Kyl is following the specific instructions of Republican \npolitical consultant Frank Luntz.\n  Here it is, on page 2, talking point No. 5 from a memo given to my \nRepublican colleagues to guide their way of framing the health care \ndebate:\n\n       (5) The healthcare denial horror stories from Canada & Co. \n     do resonate, but you have to humanize them. You'll notice we \n     recommend the phrase ``government takeover'' rather than \n     ``government run'' or ``government controlled.'' It's because \n     too many politicians say ``we don't want a government run \n     healthcare system like Canada or Great Britain'' without \n     explaining those consequences. There is a better approach. \n     ``In countries with government run healthcare,\n\n[[Page S6403]]\n\n     politicians make your healthcare decisions. They decide if \n     you'll get the procedure you need, or if you are disqualified \n     because the treatment is too expensive or because you are too \n     old. We can't have that in America.''\n\n  This debate is not about talking points or messaging or even other \ncountries. Countries such as Canada and Britain have government-run \nhealthcare and each has their unique set of good and bad aspects to the \nsystem. But, what we need to focus on is the people in our country. In \nour system today, insurance companies make the decisions and decide for \npeople if they can get the procedure they need, or if they are \ndisqualified because the treatment is too expensive. We can do better \nthan that in America.\n  Patients and their doctors make the best decisions for a patient's \nhealth and wellbeing.\n  Every Senator in this Chamber can agree: Our health care reform \nefforts should be patient-centered.\n  I hope my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will work with \nDemocrats to ensure a strong health care package for the American \npeople.\n  Mr. President, I see two of my colleagues are on the floor. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague and \nfriend from Illinois for his outstanding words once again on health \ncare, and on the fact that we need some kind of check on the insurance \ncompanies. Our colleagues offer none. They just point to Canada and \nEngland, as he mentioned, which is a totally different system than we \nare focusing on.\n  Second, I wish to thank my colleague from Oregon, who is doing a \ngreat job in his first year in the Senate, for his generosity so I \ncould speak for a brief moment and share with my colleagues some words \nabout an act of bravery that occurred in my State yesterday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6403-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6403]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEN MITCHELL\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, as the Senate right now debates some of \nthe biggest national issues of our time, it is important to sometimes \ntake a step back and look to some of the great acts that are happening \nevery day in our towns, cities, and States. So I wish to call attention \nto an act of personal heroism--and that is the appropriate word; this \nman is a true hero--that took place in my home State of New York.\n  Yesterday morning, at the South Orangetown Middle School in Blauvelt, \nNY--a town in Rockland County about 45 minutes from New York City--a \ndisgruntled man with a gun stormed into the office of the school \nsuperintendent. He grabbed the superintendent, Ken Mitchell, by the \nnecktie and started threatening him and making demands. At least three \ngunshots were fired.\n  This is the kind of situation that would have scared most everyone. \nBut, as we have learned now, Ken Mitchell is no ordinary person.\n  With his safety and the safety of his students on the line, he showed \nremarkable courage and wrestled the gunman down to the ground. He was \nable to grab the gun, kick it out of the way, and get the gunman pinned \non the ground.\n  Usually when a SWAT team arrives at the scene of a crime, they are \nthe ones to do the serious crime fighting. But this time, by the time \nthey got there, they walked in on the school superintendent, who had \nalready disarmed and pinned to the ground the dangerous criminal. To \ntop it all off, Superintendent Mitchell even recognized one of the SWAT \nteam members he had once coached as a kid on the local hockey team.\n  According to people on the scene, Mr. Mitchell was ready to get back \nto his office. As his brother-in-law said: ``his tie wasn't even messed \nup''--just another day on the job for another great New Yorker.\n  It should be no secret to anyone that this incident could very \nquickly have turned into something unspeakable. While the headlines \ntoday are ones of praise, they could have easily been ones of grief. \nAnd praise God they were not.\n  But as one of New York's Senators, I want to rise publicly and \ncongratulate Ken Mitchell for his act of bravery and heroism. As a \nparent myself, I know what it is like to send kids off to school in the \nmorning and hope and pray they will come back home safely.\n  It is people such as Ken Mitchell who make it easy for parents to \nknow their kids are in good hands when they wave goodbye on the \nschoolbus and send Johnny or Jill off to school.\n  Ken Mitchell is a reminder that every minute of every day Americans \nare engaging in personal, quiet acts of heroism and bravery about which \nwe should all be grateful. I am proud he is from my State. And I am \nproud that, if even for one moment, I can give him some of the \nrecognition he deserves.\n  I am sure Superintendent Mitchell is back at work right now as if \nnothing happened. However, Superintendent Ken Mitchell, on behalf of \nall New Yorkers, all Americans, and parents everywhere, we say thank \nyou. It is Americans like you that make us proud.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and once again thank my colleague \nfrom Oregon for yielding.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6403-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6403-S6405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in the coming weeks we are going to be \ntaking up what is probably one of the most vexing policy challenges of \nthe last 50 years: how to reform our health care system and provide \naffordable, accessible health care to every single American. The goal \ncould not be more straightforward: to guarantee access for every \nAmerican--and the stakes could not be higher.\n  Our small businesses are collapsing under the weight of health \ninsurance premiums. Last month, Oregon's largest insurer announced that \nthe small business premium was going up 14.7 percent. That is on top of \na 26-percent increase the previous year.\n  Large employers have the challenge as well. In a global economy, our \nbroken health care system is a major competitive disadvantage. A \ngreater share of the price of each car in the United States goes to \nhealth care than goes to steel. Mr. President, $1,500 of the cost of a \ncar goes to health care, while across the border in Canada that price \nis zero. If we are going to compete in the world, we need a \ncompetitive, cost-effective health care system.\n  Of course, the biggest impact of our expensive, ineffective health \ncare is most acutely felt around the kitchen table by our working \nfamilies. With unemployment skyrocketing, virtually every family is \nreminded of how tenuous its connection is to health care--just one pink \nslip away from losing health care for their family.\n  Even those with insurance find health costs out of reach. Nearly half \nof the personal bankruptcies are by folks who have health insurance but \nwho still could not manage all the health care costs because of when \nthey became ill.\n  So this is what it boils down to: Working families in America, if \nthey have health care, are concerned about the copays, they are \nconcerned about being underinsured, and they are concerned about losing \ntheir insurance with the loss of a job. Those working families without \nhealth care are worried about getting sick and how they are going to \nget well if they are already sick.\n  This does not have to be the case. Health care is already devouring a \nlarge portion of our economy--18 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct--driving long-term Federal deficits and crowding out important \nState investments in education, in infrastructure, in social services, \nand pretty much everything else, and it is only projected to get worse \nas our population ages and health care inflation runs rampant year \nafter year.\n  Put simply, if we do not reform our health care system, our economy \nwill not thrive. That is a stark choice. Our economy and health care \nare tied together.\n  I know none of this is news to the Presiding Officer or to any \nMembers of this esteemed Chamber. In fact, since President Truman, 60 \nyears ago, called for health care for every working American as a \nnational priority, we have been struggling to achieve that goal, and we \nhave not yet gotten there. We have been periodically trying to fix up a \nfragmented, expensive, unfair system. But the fear of change has always \novertaken the sense of possibility.\n\n[[Page S6404]]\n\n  Those stakes and that history make it all the more critical that we \nseize this moment to meet the challenge President Obama has laid out \nfor us and that we deliver on health care reform. This is the year--\n2009 is the year. This is the year to deliver on the promise to give \nevery American access to affordable health coverage, to ensure that our \neconomy has the same potential to be the engine of prosperity and \nopportunity and employment in this century that it was in the last \ncentury.\n\n  To make this happen, we have to find ways to make our health care \nsystem more affordable. We need to spend our health care dollar in \nsmarter ways so we can put money back in the pockets of Americans and \nmake our businesses more competitive.\n  The good news is we have lots of examples of how to do this right \nnow. Extensive research has documented that the regions of our country \nwhich spend the most per person on Medicare, that is, 60 percent more \nthan the regions with the lowest expenditures on health care, do not \nend up with better health care. The lowest spending regions actually \nhave the same or better health care outcomes after adjusting for health \nhistories, ages, and occupations. Plus, the beneficiaries are more \nsatisfied.\n  So if we could take the practices and change them in the high-cost \nregions to match the low-cost regions, we would save, in Medicare \nalone, hundreds of billions of dollars.\n  Our job in this health care reform effort is to change some of the \nrules of the road so they encourage and enable all providers to act \nmore like the high performers, those providing and delivering high \nquality, lower cost health care.\n  That is why this legislation needs to get us to start spending our \nhealth care dollars more wisely, investing more in prevention, \ninvesting in chronic disease management, building a research base about \nwhat works and what financial incentives are necessary to utilize those \npractices, rewarding care delivery built around coordination and \nefficiency rather than fragmentation and volume. We know these things \nwork, and we need to make them the norm, not the exception.\n  We cannot stop the bleeding in our health care system costs without \nalso doing something about the convoluted and broken health insurance \nmarketplace. The first thing we need to do is to end the insurance \ncompany practices that penalize you if you are old or you are sick or \nyou have ever been sick.\n  I am outraged when I hear stories from Oregonians about being turned \naway because of their preexisting conditions or their potential \npropensity toward certain diseases. The folks who need health care the \nmost are being turned away the most, and that is not a health care \nsystem.\n  We have 50 million Americans without health care. That is what this \nconversation is about: taking that 18 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct we spend currently and finding a way to provide good quality \ncoverage to every single American--not leaving out 50 million \nAmericans.\n  Those are reforms that anyone can get behind. But I understand as we \ntalk about other changes to how people get insurance, folks can get \nnervous. They can worry about the system changing in ways that are not \nbeneficial to them. That is why I keep coming back to this point: We \nare going to provide the health care system we have for the people who \nhave it, but we are going to improve it, we are going to improve it by \nmaking it more cost effective, so we can also provide health care to \nthe 50 million who do not have coverage.\n  With these reforms, our citizens will have more choices. And choice \nin health care options is good. Instead of leaving individuals and \nsmall groups at the mercy of insurance companies providing expensive \nplans with very high administrative costs, those individuals and those \nsmall businesses will be able to participate in a marketplace that \ngroups them together with millions of other Americans so they can \nbenefit from the larger pool of health care participants.\n  This marketplace will resemble something very close to the list of \noptions Federal employees have. When you become a Federal employee, you \nhave an option of this plan or this plan or this plan. Well, that is \nwhat we are going to do. We are going to provide a list of plans \ncitizens can choose from, being part of a larger pool. We are going to \nprovide a list of plans small businesses can choose from and benefit \nfrom, being a part of a larger pool of the insured.\n  This is a structure we are familiar with as Members of Congress. What \nworks for Members of Congress, what works for Senators will work for \nworking Americans. These plans give apples-to-apples comparisons so \ncitizens can pick the plan that fits their family the best. It will \nensure minimum standards so our workers are not ripped off, and the \naccess to the marketplace will come with premium assistance so strapped \nconsumers can get help affording the premiums to obtain health care.\n  Given the track record of inefficiencies and cherry-picking by \nprivate insurers, I think it is imperative that consumers have multiple \nchoices, including a public option. Public option is simply a way to \ndescribe what we are already providing to our seniors throughout this \nNation: A public, organized plan, a very efficient plan.\n  Administrative costs of Medicare are around 2 percent, while the \nadministrative costs for the individual applicants to the health care \nsystem for our small businesses is 30 percent. Why not let our \nindividuals, why not let our small businesses benefit from a 30-percent \nimprovement in the use of the health care dollar? This public option \nwould compete on a level playing field with private plans, it would \nfurther expand choices for consumers, it would be a tool for keeping \ncosts low, and it should be a part of any package we put forward.\n  One would think all of us in this room, hearing from our constituents \nin every corner of our States, would understand this whole conversation \nis about addressing one of the highest stress factors for working \nfamilies in every part of this Nation, but there are opponents of this \nreform. My colleagues across the aisle hired a consultant, Frank Luntz, \nto prepare a plan to torpedo health care. This plan came out in April. \nThis 25-page document is about how to kill any plan that is put \nforward. This goes on to say it doesn't matter what the specifics of \nthe plan are, adopt language that attacks it and present it as the \nopposite of what it is. Because what this document says is that \nAmericans want this health care reform, so you can't fight it head-on, \nyou have to recharacterize it, reframe it.\n  What does this plan that has been put out to kill health care say? It \nsays: Time is on our side. If we can slow the process down, we can kill \nit. Well, all windows of opportunity are open for a certain period of \ntime and then they close, so I suppose that is smart advice if you want \nto kill health care, but if you want to do something for the 50 million \nAmericans without health care, then we need to move forward quickly \nwith health care reform.\n  This Republican document about how to kill health care says: Say the \nplan is centered around politicians. Say it is about bureaucrats. Say \nit is about Washington, DC.\n  Well, I am not sure what there is about providing health care options \nto 50 million working Americans who struggle every day to address the \ncost of health care, and often end up in personal bankruptcy, and forgo \nall kinds of other opportunities so their child can go to the doctor. \nThat has nothing to do with bureaucrats. That has nothing to do with \nWashington. That has everything to do with family values and \nstrengthening the foundation of our families.\n  This document about how to kill health care says: Bring in denial and \nhorror stories from Canada or other parts of the world to suggest to \npeople they will lose their relationship with their doctor; that \nsomehow they will be jerked out of the arrangement they have found to \nbe so satisfactory. Scare them. Scare the citizens of the United \nStates.\n  Well, I can tell my colleagues that what is scaring the citizens of \nthe United States is they can't afford their health care, and they want \nus to do something about it. Bringing up false horror stories that have \nno bearing on the plan before us to scare our citizens and make them \nworry even more is not responsible. What is responsible is to do \nsomething about a broken health care system.\n\n[[Page S6405]]\n\n  This document has lots more about how to kill health care. It says: \nTake this and say this will destroy the personalized doctor-patient \nrelationship. Take this and say this will create waste, fraud and \nabuse, and so on and so forth; every poll-tested set of words designed \nto decrease support and scare people into forgoing this once-in-a-\ndecade opportunity or pass this once-in-a-generation opportunity we \nhave to change the health care system.\n  One may think I am raising this document before my colleagues--this \nplan for how to kill health care--and that maybe it doesn't have any \nbearing on the real debate, but it absolutely does. These talking \npoints are being echoed in this very Chamber--in this very Chamber--in \norder to kill health care.\n  Let's see. Here we go: Frank Luntz's memo--that is this memo on how \nto kill health care that came out in April--it says: Talking point No. \n5: Health care denial horror stories from Canada and other countries do \nresonate, but you have to humanize them. You will notice we recommend \nthe phrase ``government takeover'' rather than ``government-run'' or \n``government-controlled.'' Why? Because government takeover sounds even \nscarier.\n  So what do we hear on the floor of this Chamber from our minority \nleader recently? I quote: ``Americans are concerned about a government \ntakeover of health care, and for good reason.'' It goes on.\n  So recognize that is a point that is coming from a document about how \nto kill health care, not a responsible debate about the plan we have in \nfront of us.\n  Let's take a look at another example in Frank Luntz's memo. His memo, \ntalking points Nos. 3 and 4: Time is a government health care killer. \nNothing else turns people against a government takeover of health care \nthan the expectation that this plan will result in delayed and denied \ntreatment. The arguments against the plan--now, note that this is about \na plan that wasn't written; it is about any plan put forward. The \narguments against this plan must also center around politicians, \nbureaucrats, and Washington. Note the emphasis on saying the plan will \nresult in delays and denied treatment.\n  What have we heard on the floor of this Chamber from the minority \nleader? We have heard recently:\n\n       Americans don't want to be forced by bureaucrats--\n\n  That comes right out of these talking points--\n\n     to give up their private health care plan to be pushed into a \n     Washington-run government plan.\n\n  Right out of those talking points. They don't want to wait 2 years \nfor surgery, and they don't want to be told they are too old for \nsurgery.\n  All of this straight out of this roadmap.\n  My friends, in the face of 50 million Americans without health care \nand with working Americans in every one of our States going bankrupt as \nthey struggle with health care expenses, it is irresponsible to utilize \na roadmap of rhetoric that comes from polling about how to scare \npeople. That is irresponsible. What we need to do is lay out a plan on \nhow we can create affordable, accessible health care for every single \nAmerican, addressing one of the biggest factors that degrades the \nquality of life for our citizens across this Nation.\n  We have a unique opportunity. We have an opportunity because small \nbusiness wants help with those 26-percent increases and those 14.7-\npercent increases in premiums they are having to pay and they are not \nable to continue paying them. Large businesses are asking for help to \nbecome cost competitive so we can restore manufacturing in our Nation \nand put people to work and rebuild the middle class and have successful \ninternational corporations operating out of America. Families around \nthe kitchen table are asking for help today. They know how they have \nstruggled. They know if they have health care they might lose it next \nweek when they lose their job. They know if they have health care, they \nmight not be able to make the copays if they have something serious \nhappen with their child. They know if they don't have health care, they \nare going to have to forgo virtually everything else or perhaps forgo \nthe treatment itself because they won't be able to afford to make those \npayments to the doctor or to the hospital.\n  This is the moment when families and small businesses and large \nbusinesses are coming together to paint a new vision to improve the \nquality of life and to strengthen the foundation of our families. Let \nus seize this moment.\n  I thank the Chair.

Madam President, after the close of morning business, we \nwill return to the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. \nThis is a piece of legislation which has been in the making for two \ndecades or more which would finally say that tobacco is going to be \nregulated, as it should have been a long time ago.\n  For the longest time, the tobacco lobbyists were the most powerful \nlobby on Capitol Hill, and they managed to create an exemption in \nvirtually every law so that no Federal agency could take a look at them \nand regulate them and basically know what we know about every product \nand service offered in America. They said: Well, the Food and Drug \nAdministration shouldn't have any authority. The tobacco lobby argued: \nWe are not really food and we are not really a drug. So they managed to \nwiggle their way through the Federal statute book and at the end of the \nday have virtually no regulation or oversight. Unfortunately, while \nthey have been doing that, 400,000 Americans have been dying every year \nof tobacco-related disease. It is the No. 1 preventable cause of death \nin America today. It is a product which is sold legally and a product \nwhich kills with lethality. That is a fact.\n  We know from experience that the tobacco industry has a tough \nassignment. What kind of business can survive that loses 400,000 of its \ncustomers every year, customers who die because of addiction to \ntobacco-related products? They needed a marketing campaign. The problem \nwas, if you tried to market tobacco products to adults, most of them \nhad the good sense to say: That is not a smart thing to do; I am going \nto stay away from tobacco. So they had to change their marketing \nstrategy. If you couldn't market to adults, you know the kids may be \nvulnerable, and that is where they went, with a vengeance, with the \nidea of addicting children to tobacco early in life, because, of \ncourse, tobacco products, with nicotine, are addictive. To some, it is \na very strong addiction. They fight for a lifetime, with patches and a \ndoctor's care and hypnosis and anything they can think of. Some people \ncan shake it and move away from it; others spend a lifetime addicted. \nSo the tobacco companies went after the kids. They knew if they could \nget their products in the hands of children, and children would try \nthem, they would become the next generation of smokers and ultimately a \nfuture generation of victims of tobacco. So this deadly cycle began by \nthe tobacco companies, and the Federal Government took a hands-off \nattitude.\n  Back in the 1960s, we created a little warning label on tobacco \ncigarettes. You see it on billboards. It is so small,\n\n[[Page S6406]]\n\npeople don't notice it. It has become so commonplace, nobody even \nregisters with the message it delivers.\n  For the longest time, we have argued that tobacco should be \nregulated, that the products that are sold in America should have an \nagency with oversight keeping an eye on them. The tobacco companies \nfought it off year after year.\n  Finally, with this new President, with this new Congress, we have \nreached the moment where we have a chance to pass this important \nlegislation. This is a bill that will protect children and will protect \nAmerica, and it will reduce tobacco use. The House passed their version \nlast month with a wide majority, and now it is time for the Senate to \nact. Every day that we don't act, 3,500 American kids--children--will \nlight up for the first time. That is enough to fill 70 schoolbuses of \nkids who will try cigarettes every single day for the first time. A \nthousand of those 3,500 will then become regular smokers. The addiction \nwill begin.\n  Tobacco companies spend nearly $40 million every day to lure this new \ngeneration of customers with blatant deceptive advertising--promotions \nof candy-flavored cigarettes and advertising that is aimed directly at \nkids--all the while they are loading their products not just with \ntobacco leaf but with chemicals. They put in extra nicotine, \nincidentally. If there isn't enough nicotine naturally occurring in \ntobacco, they load it up so that your addiction becomes stronger, your \ncraving grows, and your body demands more and more tobacco. It is time \nwe put a stop to this marketing and give the Food and Drug \nAdministration the authority to regulate this industry.\n  There are 43 million Americans who smoke today. People often say to \nme: Well, why don't we just ban this product? If I thought that would \nend smoking in America, I might consider it. But we know better. With \n43 million Americans currently addicted, they are not going to quit \ncold turkey tomorrow. A black market would emerge, and then the next \nthing you know the underground economy would be sustaining tobacco. \nThat would not be the result we are looking for.\n  In my home State of Illinois, about one out of five kids smokes. That \nmeans that every year 65,000 kids in Illinois try a cigarette for the \nfirst time, and almost 20,000 become regular daily smokers. These kids \nconsume 34 million packs of cigarettes a year. There are 8.6 million \npeople in the United States who currently suffer from tobacco-related \ndisease. It is responsible for 90 percent of lung cancer deaths, one-\nthird of all cancer deaths, and one in five deaths from cardiovascular \ndisease. Approximately half of all continuing smokers will die \nprematurely as a result of the disease. Sadly, in Illinois, 317,000 \nkids alive today will eventually die from the smoking addiction which \nthey started as kids.\n  Here is what the bill does. We put teeth in the law to restrict the \nmarketing and sale of tobacco products to kids. We require tobacco \ncompanies to disclose the ingredients on their products. We require the \nFood and Drug Administration to evaluate any health claims for \nscientific accuracy and public health impact. We give the FDA the power \nto require companies to make changes to tobacco products to protect \npublic health. And we require larger, stronger warning health notices \non tobacco products. These are commonsense reforms that will start to \nreduce the terrible toll tobacco has taken on families all across this \nNation. The FDA is the right agency to do this. It is the only agency \nthat can bring together science, regulatory expertise, and the public \nhealth mission to do the job. Through a user fee on tobacco companies, \nthe bill gives the agency the money it needs to conduct its new \nresponsibilities.\n  This is a strong public health bill, and it is a bipartisan bill. \nAfter more than 10 years of effort, we have never been so close to \ngiving the FDA the authority it needs to regulate tobacco. I urge my \ncolleagues to resist any amendments that will weaken this bill or add \nprovisions that might stop it from becoming a law. FDA regulation of \ntobacco products is long overdue.\n  I can recall arriving on Capitol Hill as a new Congressman years and \nyears ago. In the first orientation meeting we had as new Democratic \nCongressmen, one of the older Members of the House came in, closed the \ndoor, and said: I want to tell you something. When tobacco issues come \nup, we vote with the tobacco companies. That is for your friends in \ntobacco-producing States. You give them a helping hand, and someday \nthey may give you a helping hand. That is the way it works.\n  Well, that was one of the first things we were told about being a \nMember of Congress; tobacco was that important on the political agenda. \nCertainly for some Members from tobacco-producing States, it may have \nbeen the most important thing that brought them to Capitol Hill. \nHowever, over the years, some of us wandered off of this agenda. I \noffered an amendment to ban smoking on airplanes and had the opposition \nof all of the leaders in the House of Representatives, Democrat and \nRepublican. But it turned out that so many Members of the House flew in \nairplanes and couldn't stand this fiction of smoking section and \nnonsmoking section that they supported my amendment. So over 20 years \nago we banned smoking on airplanes.\n\n  Frank Lautenberg was my champion over here in the Senate and together \nwe started a Federal policy that I might say kind of tipped one domino \nover and people started saying if secondhand smoke is dangerous on \nairplanes it is dangerous in other places.\n  That movement has grown in intensity. We have seen the kind of \nleadership at local and State levels that has continued to make it a \npotent force. But today is our chance. As I mentioned earlier, I am \nsure Senator Dodd will join me saying we wish one of our colleagues \nwere with us here today, and that is Ted Kennedy, who is home \nrecuperating. Ted Kennedy was our champion and inspiration for years on \nthis issue. He hung in there and fought for this when a lot of people \ngave up. Ted never gave up. When it came to the issues in his heart and \nsoul, he fought as long as he possibly could.\n  We continue that fight today and he handed the banner to Senator \nDodd, who has done an extraordinarily good job on this bill. He has \nbeen called into action in the Senate repeatedly. Just a few weeks ago \nwe passed the Credit Card Reform Act after more than 20 years of \ntrying. We finally got it done. It was a dramatic change in the law to \nprotect consumers and families across America.\n  Today, with the passage of this--at least the movement of this bill \nforward toward passage this week--we are going to be able to protect \nmillions of children and Americans from deadly tobacco-related disease.\n  I thank Senator Dodd for his leadership. I commend this bill to our \ncolleagues. This is our moment in history. Let's not miss it. Let's \nseize this opportunity to create protection for a lot of young people \nwho will otherwise find you are compromised by this deadly tobacco \nproduct.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6406-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1256, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1256) to protect the public health by \n     providing the Food and Drug Administration with certain \n     authority to regulate tobacco products, and to amend title 5, \n     United States Code, to make certain modifications in the \n     Thrift Savings Plan, the Civil Service Retirement System, and \n     the Federal Employees' Retirement System, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Dodd amendment No. 1247, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Schumer (for Lieberman) amendment No. 1256 (to amendment \n     No. 1247), to modify provisions relating to Federal employees \n     retirement.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, as I understand it, we are going to have a \nvote at 12:30. I ask unanimous consent the time between now and 12:30 \nbe equally divided between the minority and majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S6407]]\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Dodd, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, later today, the Senate will \nvote to approve legislation that should have been enacted years ago--\nauthority for the FDA to regulate tobacco products, the most lethal of \nall consumer products.\n  It has been a long and arduous path with many political obstacles. \nFortunately, the legislative journey is nearing a successful \nconclusion. The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed a nearly \nidentical bill earlier this spring. In May, the Senate HELP Committee \napproved the FDA Tobacco bill with the support of a strong bipartisan \nmajority. On Monday, 61 Senators voted to invoke cloture on the \ncommittee-passed bill. President Obama is anxiously waiting to sign it \ninto law. Passage of the legislation is much more than a victory for \nthose of us who have long championed this cause. It is a life saving \nact for the millions of children who will be spared a lifetime of \naddiction and premature death.\n  The need to regulate tobacco products can no longer be ignored. Used \nas intended by the companies that manufacture and market them, \ncigarettes will kill one out of every three smokers. Yet the Federal \nagency most responsible for protecting the public health is currently \npowerless to deal with the enormous risks of tobacco use. Public health \nexperts overwhelmingly believe that passage of H.R. 1256 is the most \nimportant action Congress can take to protect children from this deadly \naddiction. Without this strong congressional action, smoking will \ncontinue at its current rate, and more than 6 million of today's \nchildren will ultimately die from tobacco-induced disease.\n  Smoking is the number one preventable cause of death in America. \nNationally, cigarettes kill well over 400,000 people each year. That is \nmore lives lost than from automobile accidents, alcohol abuse, illegal \ndrugs, AIDS, murder, and suicide combined.\n  The American Cancer Society, the American Heart Association, the \nAmerican Lung Association, the American Medical Association, the \nCampaign for Tobacco-Free Kids and eighty-six other national public \nhealth organizations speak with one voice on this issue. They are all \nsupporting H.R. 1256 because they know it will give FDA the tools it \nneeds to reduce youth smoking and help addicted smokers quit.\n  A landmark report by the Institute of Medicine, released 2 years ago, \nstrongly urged Congress to ``confer upon the FDA broad regulatory \nauthority over the manufacture, distribution, marketing and use of \ntobacco products.''\n  Opponents of this legislation argue that FDA should not be regulating \nsuch a dangerous product. I could not disagree more. It is precisely \nbecause tobacco products are so deadly that we must empower America's \npremier public health protector--the FDA--to combat tobacco use. For \ndecades the Federal Government has stayed on the sidelines and done \nnext to nothing to deal with this enormous health problem. The tobacco \nindustry has been allowed to mislead consumers, to make false health \nclaims, to conceal the lethal contents of their products, to make their \nproducts even more addictive, and worst of all--to deliberately addict \ngenerations of children. The alternative to FDA regulation is more of \nthe same. Allowing this abusive conduct by the tobacco industry to go \nunchecked would be terribly wrong.\n  Under this legislation, FDA will for the first time have the needed \npower and resources to take on this challenge. The cost will be funded \nentirely by a new user fee paid by the tobacco companies in proportion \nto their market share. Not a single dollar will be diverted from FDA's \nexisting responsibilities.\n  Giving FDA authority over tobacco products will not make the tragic \ntoll of tobacco use disappear overnight. More than 40 million people \nare hooked on this highly addictive product and many of them have been \nunable to quit despite repeated attempts. However, FDA action can play \na major role in breaking the gruesome cycle that seduces millions of \nteenagers into a lifetime of addiction and premature death.\n\n  What can FDA regulation accomplish?\n  It can reduce youth smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which \ntargets children. It can help prevent the sale of tobacco products to \nminors. It can stop the tobacco industry from continuing to mislead the \npublic about the dangers of smoking. It can help smokers overcome their \naddiction. It can make tobacco products less toxic and less addictive \nfor those who continue to use them. And it can prohibit unsubstantiated \nhealth claims about supposedly ``reduced risk'' products, and encourage \nthe development of genuinely less harmful alternative products.\n  Regulating the conduct of the tobacco companies is as necessary today \nas it has been in years past. The facts presented in the Federal \nGovernment's landmark lawsuit against the tobacco industry conclusively \ndemonstrate that the misconduct is substantial and ongoing. The \ndecision of the Court states: ``The evidence in this case clearly \nestablishes that Defendants have not ceased engaging in unlawful \nactivity . . . Defendants continue to engage in conduct that is \nmaterially indistinguishable from their previous actions, activity that \ncontinues to this day.'' Only strong FDA regulation can force the \nnecessary change in their corporate behavior.\n  We must deal firmly with tobacco company marketing practices that \ntarget children and mislead the public. The Food and Drug \nAdministration needs broad authority to regulate the sale, \ndistribution, and advertising of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco.\n  The tobacco industry currently spends over thirteen billion dollars \neach year to promote its products. Much of that money is spent in ways \ndesigned to tempt children to start smoking, before they are mature \nenough to appreciate the enormity of the health risk. Four thousand \nchildren have their first cigarette every day, and 1,000 of them become \ndaily smokers. The industry knows that nearly 90 percent of smokers \nbegin as children and are addicted by the time they reach adulthood.\n  Documents obtained from tobacco companies prove, in the companies' \nown words, the magnitude of the industry's efforts to trap children \ninto dependency on their deadly product. Studies by the Institute of \nMedicine and the Centers for Disease Control show the substantial role \nof industry advertising in decisions by young people to use tobacco \nproducts.\n  If we are serious about reducing youth smoking, FDA must have the \npower to prevent industry advertising designed to appeal to children \nwherever it will be seen by children. This legislation will give FDA \nthe authority to stop tobacco advertising that glamorizes smoking to \nkids. It grants FDA full authority to regulate tobacco advertising \n``consistent with and to the full extent permitted by the First \nAmendment.''\n  FDA authority must also extend to the sale of tobacco products. \nNearly every State makes it illegal to sell cigarettes to children \nunder 18, but surveys show that many of those laws are rarely enforced \nand frequently violated. FDA must have the power to limit the sale of \ncigarettes to face-to-face transactions in which the age of the \npurchaser can be verified by identification. This means an end to self-\nservice displays and vending machine sales. There must also be serious \nenforcement efforts with real penalties for those caught selling \ntobacco products to children. This is the only way to ensure that \nchildren under 18 are not able to buy cigarettes.\n  The FDA conducted the longest rulemaking proceeding in its history, \nstudying which regulations would most effectively reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke. Seven hundred thousand public comments were \nreceived in the course of that rulemaking. At the conclusion of its \nproceeding, the Agency promulgated rules on the manner in which \ncigarettes are advertised and sold. Due to litigation, most of those \nregulations were never implemented. If we are serious about curbing \nyouth smoking as much as possible, as soon as possible; it makes no \nsense to require FDA to reinvent the wheel by conducting a new \nmultiyear rulemaking process on the same issues. This legislation will \ngive the youth access and advertising restrictions already developed by \nFDA the force of\n\n[[Page S6408]]\n\nlaw, as if they had been issued under the new statute. Once they are in \nplace, FDA will have the authority to modify these rules as changing \ncircumstances warrant.\n  The legislation also provides for stronger warnings on all cigarette \nand smokeless tobacco packages, and in all print advertisements. These \nwarnings will be larger and more explicit in their description of the \nmedical problems which can result from tobacco use. Each cigarette pack \nwill carry a graphic depiction of the consequences of smoking. The FDA \nis given the authority to change the warning labels periodically, to \nkeep their impact strong.\n  The nicotine in cigarettes is highly addictive. Medical experts say \nthat it is as addictive as heroin or cocaine. Yet for decades, tobacco \ncompanies vehemently denied the addictiveness of their products. No one \ncan forget the parade of tobacco executives who testified under oath \nbefore Congress that smoking cigarettes is not addictive. Overwhelming \nevidence in industry documents obtained through the discovery process \nproves that the companies not only knew of this addictiveness for \ndecades, but actually relied on it as the basis for their marketing \nstrategy. As we now know, cigarette manufacturers chemically \nmanipulated the nicotine in their products to make it even more \naddictive.\n\n  An analysis by the Harvard School of Public Health demonstrates that \ncigarette manufacturers are still manipulating nicotine levels. Between \n1998 and 2005, they significantly increased the nicotine yield from \nmajor brand-name cigarettes. The average increase in nicotine yield \nover the period was 11 percent.\n  The tobacco industry has a long dishonorable history of providing \nmisleading information about the health consequences of smoking. These \ncompanies have repeatedly sought to characterize their products as far \nless hazardous than they are. They made minor innovations in product \ndesign seem far more significant for the health of the user than they \nactually were. It is essential that FDA have clear and unambiguous \nauthority to prevent such misrepresentations in the future. The largest \ndisinformation campaign in the history of the corporate world must end.\n  Given the addictiveness of tobacco products, it is essential that the \nFDA regulate them for the protection of the public. Over 40 million \nAmericans are currently addicted to cigarettes. No responsible public \nhealth official believes that cigarettes should be banned. A ban would \nleave 40 million people without a way to satisfy their drug dependency. \nFDA should be able to take the necessary steps to help addicted smokers \novercome their addiction, and to make the product less toxic for \nsmokers who are unable or unwilling to stop. To do so, FDA must have \nthe authority to reduce or remove hazardous and addictive ingredients \nfrom cigarettes, to the extent that it is scientifically feasible. The \ninherent risk in smoking should not be unnecessarily compounded.\n  Recent statements by several tobacco companies make clear that they \nplan to develop what they characterize as ``reduced risk'' cigarettes. \nSome are already on the market making unsubstantiated claims. This \nlegislation will require manufacturers to submit such ``reduced risk'' \nproducts to the FDA for analysis before they can be marketed. No \nhealth-related claims will be permitted until they have been verified \nto the FDA's satisfaction. These safeguards are essential to prevent \ndeceptive industry marketing campaigns, which could lull the public \ninto a false sense of health safety. Only by preventing bogus claims \nwill there be a real financial incentive for companies to develop new \ntechnologies that can lead to genuinely and verifiably safer products.\n  This legislation will vest FDA not only with the responsibility for \nregulating tobacco products, but with full authority to do the job \neffectively. It is long overdue.\n  Voting for this legislation today is the right thing to do for \nAmerica's children. They are depending on us. By passing this \nlegislation, we can help them live longer, healthier lives. I know that \nthe Senate will not let them down.\n  Mr. DODD. There are over 1,000 organizations that support H.R. 1256. \nI ask unanimous consent that some of these letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 26, 2009.\n     Hon. Henry Waxman\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Waxman: We are writing to endorse the \n     ``Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act,'' which \n     you introduced on March 3, 2009. If enacted, this legislation \n     will make a significant contribution in our national campaign \n     to reduce the harm caused by tobacco and to protect our \n     children and public health.\n       As you are aware, in the next 365 days, more than 400,000 \n     Americans will die prematurely from tobacco use and more than \n     450,000 children, 12 to 17 years old, will become regular, \n     daily smokers and part of the next generation of grim \n     statistics. This year, under your leadership, the United \n     States Congress has an opportunity to bring about fundamental \n     change by enacting your legislation to regulate tobacco \n     products and their marketing.\n       The ``Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act'' \n     is the kind of tobacco regulation that makes sense and that \n     is long overdue. It would prevent the tobacco companies from \n     marketing to children. It would require disclosure of the \n     contents of tobacco products, would authorize FDA to require \n     the reduction or removal of harmful ingredients, and would \n     require FDA to promptly address the complex issues raised by \n     menthol tobacco products. It would prohibit terms like \n     ``light'' and ``low tar'' which have been used to mislead \n     smokers into thinking that those tobacco products are less \n     harmful. And it would force the tobacco companies to \n     scientifically prove any claims about ``reduced risk'' \n     products.\n       Some have questioned whether FDA can take on this important \n     new task and whether it will have sufficient resources. \n     Having thoroughly studied this issue, we believe that the \n     bill gives the FDA the resources it needs to do the job \n     properly; and, without question, the FDA is the right agency \n     to implement this new regulation because it has a public \n     health mandate and the necessary scientific and regulatory \n     experience.\n       The Congress can change the course of this public health \n     crisis by voting to enact your legislation to provide FDA \n     with authority over tobacco products. This is a strong bill \n     and would significantly advance the public health.\n       Sincerely,\n     Donna E. Shalala,\n       Former Secretary of Health and Human Services.\n     David Kessler,\n       Former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.\n     David Satcher,\n       Former Surgeon General.\n     Tommy G.

Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: On behalf of the volunteers and \n     supporters of the American Cancer Society Cancer Action \n     Network (ACS CAN), the advocacy affiliate organization of the \n     American Cancer Society, we thank you for your leadership on \n     The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, S. \n     982. We fully support this legislation to give the U.S. Food \n     and Drug Administration long-needed authority to regulate the \n     production, marketing and sale of tobacco products.\n       Every year, more than 400,000 Americans die from causes \n     related to the use of tobacco products. The annual direct \n     health care cost from tobacco use is $96 billion. Every day \n     3,500 kids smoke their first cigarette and each day 1,000 \n     young people become regular smokers, one-third of whom will \n     die prematurely as a result.\n       More than 1.4 million Americans will be diagnosed with \n     cancer this year and more than 550,000 will lose their battle \n     with the disease. There will be 159,000 lung cancer deaths \n     this year. Smoking is responsible for 87 percent of the \n     deaths from lung cancer.\n       Despite the overwhelming evidence of harm to public health \n     and costs to the health care system, tobacco products remain \n     virtually unregulated. In the absence of government \n     intervention, the tobacco industry continues to market its \n     deadly products to children, deceive the general public about \n     the harm they cause, and fail to take any meaningful action \n     to make their products less harmful or less addictive.\n\n[[Page S6409]]\n\n       Your legislation would begin commonsense oversight of the \n     industry by giving FDA the necessary authority and resources \n     to regulate the manufacturing, marketing, labeling, \n     distribution and sale of tobacco products. The bill will give \n     FDA authority to prevent tobacco advertising that targets \n     children, prevent the sale of tobacco products to minors, \n     identify and reduce the toxic constituents of tobacco \n     products and tobacco smoke, and regulate industry health \n     claims about the risks of tobacco products.\n       This is strong and effective legislation broadly supported \n     by the public health community. We assure you that ACS CAN \n     will work vigorously to protect the approach you have taken \n     and to see it enacted into law this year.\n       Thank you again for your commitment to this critically \n     important and long overdue legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Daniel E. Smith,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2009.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: The American Lung Association \n     commends the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and \n     Pensions for considering S. 982, the Family Smoking \n     Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. Your legislation would \n     finally give the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     authority over tobacco products.\n       This legislation will provide the FDA with the authority to \n     stop the tobacco companies from advertising to children, \n     making misleading health claims about their deadly products \n     and from manipulating their products to make them \n     increasingly more addictive. FDA authority over manufactured \n     tobacco products will finally allow our nation to begin to \n     take significant steps to reduce the tobacco-caused death \n     toll that claims more than 392,000 American lives each year \n     and results in $193 billion annually in health care costs and \n     lost productivity.\n       The American Lung Association is grateful to you for your \n     leadership and we look forward to working with you to ensure \n     its passage by the Senate in June.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles D. Connor,\n     President and CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, May 11, 2009.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \n         U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the physician and \n     medical student members of the American Medical Association \n     (AMA), I am writing to express our strong support for S. 982, \n     the ``Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act,'' \n     and to urge the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \n     (HELP) Committee to approve S. 982 during its mark up of the \n     bill. This legislation would give the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate the \n     manufacture, sale, distribution, and marketing of tobacco \n     products. The AMA firmly believes that Congress must act this \n     year to protect the public's health by passing the Family \n     Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.\n       Cigarette smoking remains the leading preventable cause of \n     death and disease in the United States. Each year, tobacco \n     use kills more than 400,000 Americans and costs the nation \n     nearly $100 billion in health care bills. As physicians, we \n     see daily the devastating consequences of tobacco use on our \n     patients' health. Patients suffer from preventable diseases \n     including cancer, heart disease, and emphysema that develop \n     as a result of the use of a single product--tobacco. The \n     evidence is overwhelming concerning the health risks of using \n     tobacco products, particularly when used over decades.\n       Ninety percent of all adult smokers begin while in their \n     teens, or earlier, and two-thirds become regular, daily \n     smokers before they reach the age of 19. Each day, \n     approximately 4,000 kids will try a cigarette for the first \n     time, and another 1,000 will become new, regular, daily \n     smokers. As a result, one-third of these kids will die \n     prematurely. Despite their assertions to the contrary, the \n     tobacco companies continue to market their products \n     aggressively and effectively to reach kids, who are more \n     susceptible to cigarette advertising and marketing than \n     adults. Congressional action to provide the FDA with strong \n     and effective regulatory authority over tobacco products is \n     long overdue.\n       We applaud you for your leadership on strong FDA regulation \n     of tobacco and other critical public health issues. The AMA \n     looks forward to working with you and your colleagues to \n     enact S. 982 and its companion in the House, H.R. 1256, into \n     law.\n           Sincerely,\n     Michael D. Maves.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Public Health Association,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Edward Kennedy,\n     Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         Senate Dirksen Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: On behalf of the American Public \n     Health Association (APHA), the oldest and most diverse \n     organization of public health professionals and advocates in \n     the world dedicated to promoting and protecting the health of \n     the public and our communities, I write in strong support of \n     S. 982, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control \n     Act, legislation that would give the Food and Drug \n     Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco \n     products. In April, the House of Representatives passed this \n     legislation by an overwhelming bipartisan majority and we are \n     hopeful the Senate will move quickly to pass the bill.\n       According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \n     (CDC), tobacco use is responsible for about 438,000 deaths \n     each year in the United States. In addition to this \n     staggering statistic, tobacco use costs more than $96 billion \n     each year in health care expenditures, and an additional $97 \n     billion per year in lost productivity. Furthermore, 3,600 \n     kids between the ages of 12 and 17 years initiate cigarette \n     smoking every day. In spite of this, tobacco products remain \n     virtually unregulated. For decades, the tobacco companies \n     have marketed their deadly products to our children, deceived \n     consumers about the harm their products cause, and failed to \n     take any meaningful action to make their products less \n     harmful or less addictive. Your bill would finally end the \n     special protection enjoyed by the tobacco industry and \n     protect our children and the nation's health instead.\n       This legislation meets the high standard established by the \n     public health community for FDA tobacco regulation. \n     Importantly, the bill would create FDA authority to \n     effectively regulate the manufacturing, marketing, labeling, \n     distribution and sale of tobacco products, including the \n     authority to:\n       Stop illegal sales of tobacco products to children and \n     adolescents\n       Require changes in tobacco products, such as the reduction \n     or elimination of harmful chemicals, to make them less \n     harmful and less addictive\n       Restrict advertising and promotions that appeal to children \n     and adolescents\n       Prohibit unsubstantiated health claims about so-called \n     ``reduced risk'' tobacco products that discourage current \n     tobacco users from quitting or encourage new users to start\n       Require the disclosure of tobacco product content and \n     tobacco industry research about the health effects of their \n     products\n       Require larger and more informative health warnings on \n     tobacco products.\n       Study and address issues associated with menthol tobacco \n     products\n       We thank you for your continued leadership on this and \n     other important public health issues. We look forward to \n     working with you to ensure the legislation is passed by the \n     Senate and signed by the president this year.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Georges C. Benjamin,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2009.\n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy,\n     Chairman, Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Kennedy: We are very pleased that the Senate \n     Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions will next \n     week undertake consideration of S. 982, the Family Smoking \n     Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, your legislation to give \n     the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) authority over \n     tobacco products. On April 2nd, the House passed this \n     legislation with a solid bipartisan vote of 298-112. We look \n     forward to its passage by the Senate in the near future.\n       Tobacco use remains the leading cause of preventable death \n     in the U.S., killing more than 400,000 Americans each year \n     and costing our health care system an estimated $96 billion \n     annually. More than 1,000 kids become regular, daily smokers \n     each day--and one-third of them will ultimately die from \n     their addiction. Amazingly, tobacco products are virtually \n     unregulated by the federal government. Tobacco products are \n     exempt from basic health regulations that apply to other \n     consumer products such as drugs, medical devices and foods. \n     This special protection allows tobacco companies to market \n     their deadly and addictive products to children, mislead \n     consumers about the dangers of their products, and continue \n     to manipulate ingredients in order to make them more \n     addictive and attractive to children.\n       There are more than 1,000 national, state and local \n     organizations that support this legislation (the full list of \n     supporting organizations can be seen at: http://www\n.tobaccofreekids.org/reports/fda/organiza\n     tions.pdf) and both the President's Cancer Panel and the \n     Institute of Medicine support Congress giving the FDA the \n     authority to regulate the manufacture and marketing of \n     tobacco products.\n       We applaud your leadership on this important public health \n     legislation and look forward to working with you to ensure \n     its passage by the full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Matthew L. Myers,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Academy of Pediatrics,\n\n                            Elk Grove Village, IL, April 29, 2009.\n     Hon. Edward M. Kennedy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kennedy: On behalf of the 60,000 \n     pediatricians, pediatric medical subspecialists and pediatric \n     surgical specialists of the American Academy of Pediatrics\n\n[[Page S6410]]\n\n     (AAP), I would like to express our support for the Family \n     Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act (H.R. 1256), \n     legislation to protect child health by providing the Food and \n     Drug Administration (FDA) with strong authority to regulate \n     tobacco products. The bill made historic progress this year, \n     passing in the House early in the session by an overwhelming \n     bipartisan majority of 292-112. We urge the Senate to take up \n     and approve FDA tobacco legislation as soon as possible and \n     oppose the alternative offered by Senators Burr and Hagan.\n       It is estimated that more than 3 million US adolescents are \n     cigarette smokers and more than 2,000 children under the age \n     of 18 start smoking each day. If current tobacco use patterns \n     persist, an estimated 6.4 million children will die \n     prematurely from a smoking-related disease. Smoking and \n     exposure to second-hand smoke among pregnant women cause low-\n     birth weight babies, preterm delivery, perinatal deaths and \n     sudden infant death syndrome. Other effects may include \n     childhood cancer, childhood leukemia, childhood lymphomas and \n     childhood brain tumors. Well over 30,000 births per year in \n     the United States are affected by one or more of these \n     problems.\n       The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act will \n     provide the FDA with broad new authority and resources to \n     regulate the manufacture, marketing, labeling, distribution \n     and sale of tobacco products, including advertising. The \n     marketing provisions include banning advertising near schools \n     and tobacco sponsorship of sporting events. The bill would \n     require tobacco company disclosure of cigarette constituents \n     as well as larger and stronger health warnings on cigarette \n     packs. It would also give the FDA the authority to regulate \n     the amount of nicotine in cigarettes, ban flavored \n     cigarettes, and prevent the marketing of products labeled as \n     ``reduced harm.'' This enhanced power can reduce tobacco use \n     by adolescents and young adults, thus limiting the number of \n     people exposed to tobacco's health-compromising and life-\n     threatening risks.\n       The Academy opposes the alternative tobacco regulation \n     legislation offered by Senators Burr and Hagan titled the \n     Federal Tobacco Act of 2009 (S. 579). It does not provide the \n     protections necessary to protect children from the harms of \n     tobacco. Rather than place tobacco regulatory authority in \n     the FDA, S. 579 would create a new and untested bureaucracy \n     to do the job. The bill does not contain the strong marketing \n     or labeling provisions necessary to prevent our nation's \n     youth from starting a lifelong addiction to tobacco. The \n     Federal Tobacco Act would also mistakenly assure tobacco \n     users of the safety of so-called ``reduced-risk'' tobacco \n     products, give the tobacco industry a voice in scientific \n     decision making, and prevent mandating meaningful changes in \n     tobacco product ingredients. We urge the Senate to oppose \n     this alternative and swiftly pass FDA tobacco legislation.\n       Thank you for your dedication to the health and well-being \n     of children. We look forward to working with you to pass this \n     important legislation.\n       Sincerely,\n                                             David T. Tayloe, Jr.,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Let me take a couple of minutes. I know my colleague and \nfriend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, is coming to the floor as well. I \nthink Senator Coburn is going to be here to make a point of order. I \nwill keep an eye out so I do not exceed the time.\n  I want to point out to my colleagues that this is now down to the \nlast few votes on this matter. I had hoped we would have been able to \nconsider some of the other amendments that were being offered. But as \nmy colleagues, I think, are probably aware, one of the amendments to be \nconsidered was an amendment offered by my colleague Senator Lieberman. \nThere was objection to that amendment coming up. As a result, we could \nnot reach an agreement on allowing time for the other amendments to be \nconsidered, amendments offered by Senator Enzi, Senator Bunning, \nSenator Coburn, and Senator Hagan.\n  In fact, an amendment offered by Senator Enzi--he and I reached an \nagreement on that. It is regrettable that we weren't able to get to it. \nI hope we can fix it at another time. That is an example of what \nhappened when we couldn't get unanimous consent to go forward. \nNonetheless, I hope the substitute will be adopted, cloture will be \ninvoked, and we can schedule a vote for final passage, as I believe we \nwill, in the next day.\n  This is important. A lot of work has been done on this bill. As \nSenator Durbin, our friend from Illinois, pointed out, this is work \nthat has gone on for decades between Republicans and Democrats. It is a \nbipartisan bill. We spent 2 days on markup, considering amendments, \nadopting some, accepting some. That brought us to the position we are \nin today with this legislation.\n  As I have said over and over again over the last number of weeks as \nwe have considered this bill, this is an unprecedented action we will \nbe taking, an historic moment in many ways. For the first time ever in \nthe history of our country, the 100-year-old regulatory agency, the \nFood and Drug Administration, which regulates all the food and products \nwe ingest and consume as Americans, will now for the first time be \nallowed to regulate tobacco products.\n  The FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, as I pointed out, not only \nregulates the food we humans consume but also pets--cat food, dog food, \nbird feed, hamsters--all those products have to be approved by the FDA. \nOne product we have not been able to legislate because of opposition \nfrom the tobacco industry is tobacco products. We are about to change \nthat. My hope is with a vote today and tomorrow, and then agreement \nwith the House, the President will be in a position to sign the \nlegislation that will, first, give the Food and Drug Administration the \nopportunity to regulate these products and, as important, to determine \nand set guidelines and regulations dealing with the sale and marketing \nto young people.\n  It has been said, I know, over and over again, maybe not often \nenough, 3,000 to 4,000 children begin smoking every day in America. \nEvery day we delay having the FDA take on this responsibility and begin \ncontrolling the marketing and sale of these products, we run the risk \nof more and more children starting the habit. We know that of that \n3,000 to 4,000 who start smoking every day, 1,000 of them end up \nbecoming addicted to the products. One in five high school students in \nmy State of Connecticut today smoke. I suspect those numbers are \nprobably fairly uniform across the country. Of that number I have \nmentioned, the thousand who become addicted, about one-third that \nnumber will die from smoking-related illnesses. Four hundred thousand \npeople every year lose their lives as a result of tobacco-related \nillnesses.\n  Again, this is a self-inflicted wound. Obviously we have known this \nfor a long time. The Surgeon General has warned for years, every \nscientific study that has been done has cautioned about what happens if \npeople develop the habit of smoking and the dangers associated with it. \nWe talk about loss of life but there are also those who become \ndebilitated through the contraction of various diseases associated with \nsmoking.\n  I apologize for making this case with numbers, but it is so important \nmy colleagues understand where we are and how important this vote is, \nto be able to do this. We are now already beginning the debate about \nhealth care in the country. That debate is going to go on for the next \nnumber of months. A major feature of the health care debate is \nprevention, to try to prevent people from getting the diseases that \ncost them and their families and our country so much. What better way \nto take a step toward prevention than to deal with an issue like \nsmoking and tobacco products, which causes so many deaths in our \ncountry, so many illnesses.\n  In fact, if you take suicides, murders, AIDS, alcohol-related deaths, \nautomobile accidents, drug-related deaths, and combine all of them, \nthey do not equal the number of fatalities that occur every year as a \nresult of the use of tobacco products.\n  If we are truly interested in making real headway on prevention, what \nbetter way than to begin to deal with the issue of marketing and sale \nof tobacco products to young people. That is what a major part of this \nbill does.\n  We also provide help to the producing States because we recognize \nthat for farmers in these States, this will be a major adjustment for \nthem economically. This bill accommodates that as well.\n  I say to my friends on the other side, particularly, those who have \noffered--want to offer some of these amendments, we didn't have a \nchance to consider some of them, but I want them to know it was not \nobjection on this side to that at all. There were objections to the \nLieberman amendment going forward that created this problem. But, \nnonetheless, the work that has been done on this bill I think is \ndeserving of our support. It is worthy of our unanimous adoption.\n  As I said over and over again, if you were to collect all of the \nadult smokers in the country--and 90 percent of adult\n\n[[Page S6411]]\n\nsmokers began as children, by the way--but if you asked all of them \ntheir opinion on whether we ought to do something about marketing these \nproducts to children, I would be willing to venture a guess that 98 \npercent of adult smokers, if they could speak with one voice today, \nwould tell us to pass this bill. The last thing a parent who smokes \nwants is their children to start smoking. They know the hazards, they \nknow the damage, they know the heartache that comes with the illnesses \nassociated with these products.\n  On behalf of all parents in the country, smokers and nonsmokers, let \nus adopt this legislation and take a major step in dealing with the \ndreaded health problems associated with tobacco products.\n  I see my colleague from Wyoming so let me stop here and give him the \nremainder of the time he needs to comment on this. I thank him and his \nstaff who have been working on this. I am a late arrival. He worked \nwith Senator Kennedy on this problem long before I was directly \ninvolved with it. I thank him for his work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, who is \nworking as chairman on this committee, for his passion, enthusiasm, and \nfor listening to us. We do have a few things that are in the bill, but \nthere are several other things that ought to be considered. We want the \nbill to be as good as possible. When we do cloture, we cut off that \npossibility.\n  I have a couple amendments that I think, if they were addressed--I \nknow one is kind of accepted on both sides, but we cannot get them in. \nThat is a frustration. We should not be having frustrations on \nsomething as important as this bill. It is important that we stop kids \nfrom starting smoking and that we get people already smoking to stop \nsmoking. It is adding to the health care bills of all of us. It is a \ncost shift we are experiencing. It is not good for their health. Then \nthere are family members who are having secondary smoke. People do not \nrealize the problems they are giving to their family members by doing \nthat.\n  I do oppose cloture today. There are several amendments I would like \nto offer. They are all germane amendments. I am glad they were germane \namendments. We have been trying to reach an agreement on offering these \namendments but it has been without any success, and if we invoke \ncloture we will not have a chance to consider any of these amendments.\n  I hope we have a way to give these amendments serious consideration. \nIf we cannot, I have to oppose cloture and I ask my colleagues to do \nthe same. I think we can get it worked out in a relative hurry but not \nunless the train stops for a moment, a little hesitation here.\n  I want to get this bill done. I am hoping we can complete it. But I \nthink there are some important points that have to be made on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                         characterizing flavor\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Madam President, recent attempts by the tobacco \nindustry to sell and market candy-flavored cigarettes are a real threat \nto our Nation's children. With flavors such as cherry, grape, and \nstrawberry, these cigarettes are intended to get our children addicted \nto a deadly product that kills more than 400,000 people a year. The \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act section 907 prohibits \nthe use in cigarettes of flavors, herbs, spices, such as strawberry \ngrape, orange, clove and cinnamon, when used as a ``characterizing \nflavor'' of the tobacco product or smoke. I applaud you along with \nSenator Kennedy for prohibiting these products.\n  Mr. DODD. As you know, most new smokers start as children. Every day, \napproximately 3,500 kids will try a cigarette for the first time, and \nanother 1,000 will become new, regular daily smokers. We should do \neverything possible to protect our children from the dangers of \nsmoking.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. However, it is my understanding that the language in \nsection 907 is not meant to prohibit the use of any specific ingredient \nthat does not produce a ``characterizing flavor'' in a cigarette or its \nsmoke; is that correct?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from New Jersey is correct. While the term \n``characterizing flavor'' is undefined in the legislation, it is \nintended to capture those additives that produce a distinguishing \nflavor, taste, or aroma imparted by the product. Nothing in this \nsection is intended to expressly prohibit the use of any specific \ningredient that does not fall into this category.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I thank the Senator for this clarification.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I am pleased the Senate is taking up the \nFamily Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Act which will save hundreds of \nthousands of lives and more than $155 billion in health care costs \nevery year. Currently, there are more than 44 million smokers, of which \n90 percent began smoking before the age of 18. Tobacco is a product \nthat is responsible for 440,000 deaths each year, is the leading cause \nof preventable death, and yet, is not regulated.\n  The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act will go a long \nway in regulating tobacco products, and will make it less likely that a \nchild will establish a dependence on tobacco products. In the United \nStates alone, every day approximately 3,000 minors take up smoking. \nSimply reducing the use of tobacco by these minors by even 50 percent \nwill prevent more than 10 million children from becoming habitual \nsmokers, saving over 3 million of them from premature death due to \ntobacco related disease.\n  It is critical that the FDA gain regulatory authority over tobacco \nrelated products, in order to ensure that consumers are better informed \nof the possible risks, addictive qualities, and adverse health effects \nof these products. In addition, this legislation will create more \ntransparency and, as in many other consumable goods, tobacco \nmanufactures will be required to list all ingredients included in their \ntobacco products. This bill also gives the FDA the ability to set \nquality criteria for tobacco products, prohibit cigarettes containing \nany flavoring other than tobacco or menthol, as well as require the FDA \napproval for all labels before being put on the market.\n  In 2005, cigarette manufactures spent more than $13 billion to \nattract new users, retain current users, and increase consumption. \nChildren especially are exposed to tobacco advertising, seeing tobacco \nuse glorified in movies, and advertisements and sponsorship of sporting \nevents. This advertising misleads users, children and adults, to \nbelieve products are healthy, for example, ``light'' or ``low-tar'' \ndesignations. Our Nation stands to benefit greatly from this \nlegislation, both in quality of life and revenue saved. The diseases \nand deaths caused by smoking are preventable, and every person has a \nstake in the issue, whether they smoke or not.\n  I was disappointed in 1998 when the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of \nAppeals decided in Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corporation v. Food and \nDrug Administration, FDA, that the FDA did not have the authority under \nexisting law to regulate tobacco as an addictive drug, and I am pleased \nthe Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act will take steps \nto address this lack of regulation. This bill has the support of over \n1,000 organizations and deserves our support.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I regret that the Senate was unable to \nreach an agreement with regard to consideration of the amendment which \nSenators Lieberman, Akaka, Collins, and Voinovich offered to H.R. 1256. \nThe amendment, which was ruled nongermane, reformed several Federal \nemployee retirement provisions. It made changes to benefit computation \nrules for certain Federal employees, including the ability to count \nsick leave and part-time service, and it authorized Federal agencies to \nreemploy Federal pensioners on a part-time basis.\n  I cosponsored this amendment. Its importance particularly resonates \nwith me as a large number of Federal employees work and reside in my \nhome State of Maryland. But that is not why I cosponsored it. I \ncosponsored the amendment because it was the right thing to do for all \nof America's Federal employees.\n  The Lieberman amendment would have extended to employees under the \nFederal Employees' Retirement System certain benefits which already \napply to employees under the older Civil Service Retirement System. \nThis bipartisan amendment had the potential to affect the lives of \nhundreds of\n\n[[Page S6412]]\n\nthousands of Federal employees who work hard every day, many at modest \npay grades, only to find that their benefits do not mirror those of \ntheir colleagues in the same positions.\n  We had an opportunity to send an important message to America's \nFederal workers by bringing up this amendment. We had an opportunity to \ngive them additional incentives to continue the missions they pursue on \nbehalf of all of us, to demonstrate that Congress still cares about \ndoing what is right and fair. I regret we were unable to consider this \namendment because of the objections of a minority of Senators.\n  I commend Senator Lieberman and the other Senators who worked so \ndiligently on this amendment. We will have other opportunities. I \npledge my continued support for America's Federal employees, just as \nthey continue to work for America each and every day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Lieberman I ask \nunanimous consent, notwithstanding rule XXII, that I be permitted to \ncall up amendment No. 1290 and that the amendment be modified with the \nchanges at the desk; that once this modification is made, amendment No. \n1256 be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object. I make a point of order that the pending \nLieberman amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The point of order is well \ntaken. The amendment falls.\n  Under the previous order, the substitute amendment is adopted.\n  The amendment (No. 1247) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. The pending matter will be a vote at 12:30, in a few \nminutes, on the cloture motion, is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. We will go to the vote right away. I appreciate the \ncomments of my friend from Wyoming. I wish the Record to note there \nwere no objections on this side to any of the amendments being offered, \nthe germane amendments. My friend from Wyoming is absolutely correct. I \nregret that, that we didn't have an opportunity to debate those, but \nlet me say there may be a time and opportunity for us to deal with \nthese on other vehicles as well, but my hope is we can invoke cloture \nand move forward.\n  I am prepared to yield back the time and proceed to the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before \nthe Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on Calendar No. 47, \n     H.R. 1256, Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act.\n         Harry Reid, Christopher J.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall is waived. The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that \ndebate on H.R. 1256, Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act, \nshall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule. The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 67, the nays are \n30. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues. This is, \nagain, a strong bipartisan vote on this issue, and it allows us now to \nget to the final passage. We have had about, I think, three cloture \nvotes on this bill. If we followed the regular order, the vote would \noccur at 6:05 a.m. tomorrow morning. I am sure the leader will not make \nus do that, but that may be the price you pay for all the cloture votes \nwe have had to go through. But sometime tomorrow the vote will occur, \nand the leadership will obviously decide when.\n  Let me again thank Senator Enzi and his staff and Senator Kennedy and \nhis staff. They have gone back many years. I am a place-holder on this. \nI hope our friend from Massachusetts is watching this because he \nbattled 10 years to get us to this point.\n  If we can make a dent in those 3,000 to 4,000 kids who start smoking \nevery day--the estimates are 11 percent will not start smoking because \nof what we are about to do on this bill. If we can make a difference in \nthose 400,000 who lose their lives every year and those who contract \nemphysema and related illnesses, this may be the most important \nprevention step we take in the short term on our health care efforts.\n  So for my colleagues on both sides of the aisle who have made this \npossible, this is a moment they can take great satisfaction in having \nmade a significant contribution to the well-being of Americans. I thank \nall of them for that and urge a strong vote tomorrow for the passage of \nthe legislation. Then we will work out--and we may not have to work out \ndifferences with the House--but if we do, we will then send this bill \nto the President for his signature, hopefully in the next few days. For \nthe first time in the history of our country, the Food and Drug \nAdministration will be able to regulate tobacco products, and that is a \nmajor achievement for our country's children.\n  With that, Madam President, I thank my colleagues again and suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I withhold that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be able to \nspeak as in morning business for 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          SAFE Commission Act\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to again call attention \nto the irresponsible and reckless fiscal path we find ourselves on as a \nnation and to urge my colleagues to act now to take the first step \ntoward meaningful, comprehensive tax and entitlement reform through the \nenactment of the Securing America's Future Economy Commission Act, \nwhich I introduced with Senator Joe Lieberman.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the time to read a recent letter from \nSenator\n\n[[Page S6413]]\n\nLieberman and I urging their support of this legislation.\n  The SAFE Commission has broad bipartisan support outside of Congress, \nincluding the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, the Business Roundtable, \nthe Concord Coalition, the National Federation of Independent Business, \nthe Brookings Institution and the Heritage Foundation--I think if you \nget the Concord Coalition and the Heritage Foundation to support a \npiece of legislation, it has to be pretty bipartisan and fair--and also \nthe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. All of these \norganizations back the SAFE Commission concept as the way to tackle tax \nreform and our entitlement crisis.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, as you may know, recently Chinese \nPrime Minister Wen Jiabao publicly voiced his concern about the \nsecurity of the ``huge amount of money'' China has invested in the \nUnited States, saying, ``To be honest, I am definitely a little \nworried.'' He then went on to call on the United States to ``maintain \nits good credit, to honor its promises and to guarantee the safety of \nChina's assets.'' I hope this frightens you as much as it frightens me. \nChina is the largest foreign creditor of the United States, holding an \nestimated $1 trillion in U.S. Government debt. Though it may be \nunlikely due to the complex interdependent relationship we have with \nChina, if China were to call in that debt, sell off its holdings, or \ndirect its foreign investments away from the United States, the impact \non our economy and our national security would be devastating. I have \nbeen saying for years that we cannot allow countries that control our \ndebt to control our future.\n  The fact is foreign creditors have provided 70 percent of the funds \nthe United States has borrowed since 2001. As a result, 51 percent of \nthe privately owned national debt is held by foreign creditors--mostly \nforeign central banks. That is going to be increased significantly \nbecause of all the borrowing we are doing. These lenders are starting \nto express significant concerns about the status of our fiscal \nsituation. To be frank, they should be concerned.\n  Our spending is out of control. As a result, our debt is \nskyrocketing. When I arrived in the Senate in 1999, gross national debt \nstood at $5.6 trillion, or 61 percent of our GDP. The Obama \nadministration recently projected the national debt to more than double \nto $12.7 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2009. From 2008 to 2009 \nalone, the Federal debt will increase 27 percent, boosting the \ncountry's debt-to-income ratio--or national debt as a percentage of \nGDP--from 70 percent last year to 89 percent this year.\n  As shown on this chart, here is where we were back when I came to the \nSenate in 1999. In 2008, last year, the national debt as a percentage \nof GDP was 70 percent. Today, it is at 89 percent. You can see we are \ngoing to be very close to 100 percent of our GDP on our national debt. \nI call this the Pac Man that is eating up our revenue--particularly the \ninterest. We are going to pay money that could be used for other \nthings.\n  Alarmingly, the figures I just mentioned do not count our \naccumulated, long-term financial obligations. The Peterson Foundation \nrecently pointed out that the Federal Government has accumulated $56.4 \ntrillion in total liabilities and unfunded promises for Medicare and \nSocial Security as of September 30, 2008. That works out--listen to \nthis--to $483,000 per American household or $184,000 for every man, \nwoman, and child in the country to pay for these unfunded obligations. \nIn other words, we have $56.4 trillion in total liabilities and \nunfunded promises for Medicare and Social Security. It is an unfunded \nliability. If you look at it per household, it is $483,000 per \nhousehold, and if you look at it per individual, for every man, woman, \nand child in the United States, it is $184,000.\n  To be completely fair to President Obama, our annual deficit and \ngrowing national debt have been problems for some time now. And, folks, \nI have come to the floor of the Senate time and time again to talk \nabout paying down debt, balancing our budget, and so forth.\n  To my knowledge, President Bush never once mentioned the debt in any \none of his State of the Union Addresses to Congress. But under the \nObama administration, we have exacerbated the problem with an Omnibus \nappropriations bill that includes $408 billion in nonemergency funding, \na $787 billion stimulus bill, and a 10-year proposed budget where the \nlowest deficit for a single year is larger than any annual deficit from \nthe end of World War II to President Obama's inauguration.\n  I know we are going through some tough times. Over the past year, we \nhave been hit by an economic avalanche that started in housing, spread \nto the financial and credit markets, and then continued onward to every \ncorner of our economy. I know it well. I am a Senator from Ohio. We are \nspending money to get out of this economic mess, but we cannot allow \nthat to be an excuse to continue our reckless fiscal path. We have to \nstart finding ways to work harder and smarter to do more with less. It \ndoes not take an economist to realize our course is unsustainable. I \nknow it, the Obama administration knows it, the American people know \nit.\n  The Obama administration knows we can no longer ignore this crisis. \nPeter Orszag, whom I consider a friend, the Obama administration's OMB \nDirector, has even said:\n\n       I don't want to sound like the boy crying wolf, but it is a \n     fact that, given the path that we are on, two things: One is \n     we will ultimately wind up with a financial crisis that is \n     substantially more severe than even what we are facing today \n     if we don't alter the path of Federal spending; and secondly, \n     that if we were on that path in the future and something like \n     we are experiencing today occurred, we would have much less \n     maneuvering room to fight those fires, because we will have \n     already depleted the fire truck.\n\n  And I am disappointed that as OMB Director he has forgotten his \ncommitment to entitlement and tax reform he so boldly and loudly called \nfor when he was CBO Director. You would think a change in title would \nnot cause such a memory loss on as important an issue as the financial \nhealth of our country. To me, it can only mean one thing: that Peter \nOrszag's boss, President Obama, must not be serious about addressing \nthe growing national debt or, worse, does not understand our fiscal \ncrisis or, even worse than that, that he just does not care.\n  Just last Friday, the Washington Post ran an opinion piece taking the \nadministration to task for lacking a plan on just how we start to dig \nour country out of this financial crisis. The article details Treasury \nSecretary Geithner's trip to Beijing 2 weeks ago, where he went to \nreassure China--the world's largest holder of our Treasury debt, as I \nmentioned--that lending money to the U.S. Government is still a wise \nthing to do.\n  Mr. Geithner insisted that:\n\n       In the United States, we are putting in place the \n     foundations for restoring fiscal sustainability.\n\n  In a moment that all Americans should consider a wake-up call, Mr. \nGeithner was met with laughter--laughter--when he told a group of \nChinese students that their country's assets were very safe in \nWashington.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord this Washington Post article. The title of it is ``No Laughing \nMatter, Why the U.S. needs to get serious now about long-term budget \ndeficits.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, June 5, 2009]\n\n                           No Laughing Matter\n\n       The Obama administration inherited from its predecessor \n     both a tanking economy and a huge federal budget deficit. \n     Under the circumstances, it cannot be faulted for increasing \n     the deficit in the short run, because a mammoth recession \n     called for fiscal stimulus. Thus, it is neither surprising \n     nor irreversibly dangerous that the total federal debt held \n     by the public looks as if it will reach 57 percent of gross \n     domestic product by the end of fiscal 2009 on Sept. 30--well \n     above the previous four decades' average of about 40 percent. \n     What is more alarming is that, barring major spending cuts or \n     tax increases, President Obama's budget could drive that \n     figure to 82 percent by 2019, according to the Congressional \n     Budget Office.\n       We are already getting a taste of the problems that could \n     develop if the president and Congress do not address this \n     soon. Since the end of last year, the interest rate on 10-\n     year Treasury notes has gone up from 2 percent to over 3.5 \n     percent. That number is within historical norms; indeed, \n     Treasury rates probably had been artificially depressed \n     during the financial panic of the fall. But the spike, which \n     will cost the government tens of billions of dollars, also \n     reflects mounting investor concern--at home and, especially,\n\n[[Page S6414]]\n\n     abroad--about the U.S. fiscal situation. If government \n     borrowing costs continue to accelerate, they could kill \n     economic growth for years to come.\n       It was a sign of the times that Treasury Secretary Timothy \n     F. Geithner had to travel to Beijing this week to reassure \n     China, the world's largest holder of Treasury debt, that \n     lending money to the U.S. government is still a wise thing to \n     do. Mr. Geithner insisted that, ``in the United States, we \n     are putting in place the foundations for restoring fiscal \n     sustainability.'' To be sure, China doesn't have many good \n     alternatives to parking its massive trade surpluses in \n     dollars. But it does have some, including commodities and the \n     debt of more fiscally prudent European governments. In a \n     moment that all Americans should consider a wake-up call, Mr. \n     Geithner was met with laughter when he told a group of \n     Chinese students that their country's assets were ``very \n     safe'' in Washington.\n       The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, was \n     considerably more decorous than the Chinese students in \n     testimony before Congress on Wednesday but, in essence, only \n     slightly less skeptical. ``Even as we take steps to address \n     the recession and threats to financial stability,'' he said, \n     ``maintaining the confidence of the financial markets \n     requires that we, as a nation, begin planning now for the \n     restoration of fiscal balance.''\n       Mr. Bernanke did not say explicitly that there is no such \n     plan in Mr. Obama's budget--at least not according to the \n     CBO, whose estimates of the president's budget show annual \n     deficits lingering indefinitely above 4 percent of GDP. Nor \n     did he point out that Congress has yet to come up with \n     credible financing for the president's desirable but \n     expensive health care proposal. He did not say that Mr. Obama \n     and Congress have done nothing so far to deliver on the \n     president's pledge of entitlement reform. But if the Fed \n     chairman had said those things, he would have been absolutely \n     right.\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, this week, as you know, President \nObama announced a plan to reenact statutory pay-as-you-go, pay-go. Now, \nwhat is ``pay-go''? Pay-go basically is this: If you want to spend more \nmoney, you either have to find other spending you are going to reduce \nor, in the alternative, you are going to have to raise taxes to pay for \nit.\n  Unfortunately, the President's plan exempts things like the 2001-2003 \ntax cuts, patching the alternative minimum tax, updating physicians' \npayments in Medicare--and last but not least, modifying the estate tax. \nThese expenses would be exempt from pay-go.\n  Folks, I believe this is intellectually dishonest. This does not \nreflect the high standards the President has set for his \nadministration. In my opinion, it is more like the smoke and mirrors of \nthe past that got us into the mess we find ourselves in today.\n  Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal \nBudget, puts it like this:\n\n       It is like quitting drinking--\n\n  She was referring to the President's pay-go announcement. Here is \nwhat she says--\n\n       It is like quitting drinking, but making an exception for \n     beer and hard liquor. Exempting these measures from pay-go \n     would increase the 10-year deficit by over $2.5 trillion. \n     That's not fiscal responsibility.\n\n  Today, I am reiterating my call for President Obama and Congress to \nenact the first pillar of meaningful tax and entitlement reform through \nthe enactment of the SAFE Commission Act. I am asking my colleagues and \ntheir staffs to step up and look at this legislation and read the \n``Dear Colleague'' letter Senator Lieberman and I sent this last week \nwith materials from the Peterson Foundation. Those materials, for a \nSenator or for staff members, lay out what I am talking about today. In \naddition, there is a DVD that is called IOUSA that was put together by \nthe Peterson Foundation. I think it takes about an hour to look at it, \nbut I don't know of anything that is out there today that depicts our \nfinancial crisis as well as that DVD does.\n  The SAFE Commission we are talking about would create a vehicle, much \nlike we do for the BRAC process, to take on the tough issues of Social \nSecurity, tax reform, and creating, by a vote of 13 out of 20 members--\nthere would be 20 members on the Commission; 2 of them would be from \nthe administration, but it would take 13 out of 20--and if you have 13 \nout of 20, the recommendations would be fast-tracked through a special \nprocess and brought to the floor of both Chambers.\n  In other words, we would give it expedited procedure and then we \nwould have to either vote up or down, just as we do on the BRAC \nprocess. It would break the logjam in Washington and show the American \npeople and the world that we are serious about getting this Nation back \non track.\n  For the life of me, I cannot understand why President Obama doesn't \nsupport this concept. I know he is getting a hard time from Speaker \nPelosi and from several other Members in the House of Representatives, \nalthough Steny Hoyer is in favor of the commission approach to solving \nour entitlement and tax reform crisis. We all know we can't get this \ndone through the regular order of business. We know it. We would not be \nable to get it done. The proof of it is we haven't been able to do it \nthus far, so we are going to need the Commission. Everybody understands \nwe are going to need it.\n  I know the President wants to move on climate change. But he has to \nknow that from a substantive point of view and a political point of \nview, he is going to have to do something about this long-term \nfinancial crisis in which we found ourselves. It would seem to me he \ncould go forward with climate change, he could go forward with health \ncare reform, and get the Commission formed. It will take the Commission \nat least a year to finish its business.\n  Think of this: If the Commission is able to get 13 out of 20 members \nto come back with a bipartisan solution to dealing with tax reform and \nentitlement reform, that would be wonderful. It would take that issue \noff the President's plate. In other words, sooner or later, our \nPresident and his party are going to have to face up to the fact that \nthe people of America are really worried--and so are the people of the \nworld--about us doing something about tax reform and entitlement \nreform.\n  Wouldn't it be great--I mean, if I were the Governor, as I was for 8 \nyears in Ohio, and somebody said: Governor, you know what. You have a \nreal problem. And what we are going to do is, we are going to put a \ncommission together on a bipartisan basis, and we are going to come \nback with recommendations to get the job done--I would kiss them and \nsay: Wonderful. I could kind of forget about it, except for the two \npeople in the administration who were working on it. If they came back \nwith a bipartisan solution, wow. Get it through Congress and we deal \nwith the substantive problem and we get a big political problem off our \nplate just before going into the next Presidential election. So I just \nhope there is some more thought being given by the administration, more \nthought given by the Congress.\n  We all say: Oh, yes, we are concerned about the national debt. We \nhave to do something about it. But when you go home, what are you going \nto point to for the people, your constituents? What are you going to \npoint to and say: I am sincere about this; I want to do something about \nit. Then they are going to ask you: Well, what did you do? One of the \nthings you can do is say: I supported a bipartisan commission. They are \ngoing to go to work during the next year. They are going to come back \nwith recommendations, and this is the way we can deal with the problem \nthat is going to be such a burden on the future of our country.\n  I came here in 1999, and one of the reasons I came here was to deal \nwith our deficits and with reducing our national debt. I am going to be \nleaving this place at the end of next year. I have three children, and \nI have seven grandchildren. I happen to believe that just like the \npages who are here today in this room, they are going to have to work a \nlot harder, work a lot harder than I do in order to maintain the \nstandard of living that I have been able to have because the \ncompetition in the world today is a lot keener than it was 15 or 20 \nyears ago. They are just going to have to work harder than they have \never had to work before to maintain the kind of standard of living that \nwe would like to have for them and for my children and grandchildren. \nBut if you think about it, if we don't deal with this problem I am \ntalking about today, we are going to lay on their backs taxes that will \nbreak the bank.\n  So we put them in a position where they are going to have to work \nharder to maintain a decent standard of living. Then, what we are \nsaying to them is, we are going to let you pay for those things that we \nweren't willing to do without or pay for on our own. To me, that is \nabsolutely immoral. It is absolutely immoral.\n  One of the things I would hope is--and I feel like a broken record, \nbut I\n\n[[Page S6415]]\n\nwould hope that the Holy Spirit would somehow enlighten us to face up \nto this very serious responsibility, one that if we don't face up to, \nwill have a devastating impact on the future of our country and our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes, I will.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Drug Reimportation And Reform\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, today I rise to speak on two crucial \nissues which I had hoped we would not only be debating in the context \nof this FDA bill currently before the Senate, but actually acting on in \nthat context. So I have to say as I speak about these two issues I am \ndisappointed we are not taking this obvious, major opportunity of \nacting on a major FDA bill to again not only have me speak, but all of \nus act together on the crucial issues of, No. 1, the reimportation of \nprescription drugs; and, No. 2, meaningful generic drug reform so that \nwe get generics to market sooner as a lower cost alternative for \nAmerican consumers. I wish to touch on each of these in turn.\n  I was glad to support my friend, the distinguished Senator from North \nDakota, and many Democratic and Republican colleagues, in introducing \nan amendment to the FDA tobacco bill to enact comprehensive \nreimportation of prescription drugs. This has long been an issue that \nhas truly united, in a sincere bipartisan way, Democrats and \nRepublicans. Many Democrats and many Republicans have agreed. I think \nat a time when, unfortunately, the partisan divide and sometimes \ndivisive and bitter partisan rhetoric is at an all-time high, it is \nimportant to find areas where we can bridge that divide in a meaningful \nand sincere way.\n  It is important to work on real issues and real solutions together \nand bridge that divide. Reimportation is a great example of that.\n  Now, we have on record a clear majority in the Senate and well over \n60 votes for reimportation. We have a clear majority in the U.S. House \nfor reimportation, and we have an administration and a President who \nare for reimportation, and he is on record in that regard in his \nservice in the U.S. Senate. In addition, we have an important issue \nthat can save all of us and can save our health care system billions of \ndollars as we go into health care reform. Surely, we need to be talking \nand acting in ways that can cut costs in health care without \nendangering the public, without hurting patient care, and this is a \ngreat opportunity.\n  The CBO has estimated that Americans would save about $50 billion--\n$50 billion with a ``b''--over the next 10 years if reimportation were \nenacted. So we have a true bipartisan issue which has true consensus \nsupport in the Senate, in the House, and in the administration, which \ncan save all of us and our health care system $50 billion. Let's act. \nSurely, this is a recipe for something we can act strongly on and \nproduce positive results.\n  So what is going on? Well, I am afraid what is going on is exactly \nwhat my colleague, the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, suggested on \nthe Senate floor last week. He stood bravely on the Senate floor and \nread directly from a lobbyist e-mail, a lobbyist of big PhRMA, the \nassociation which represents the biggest pharmaceutical companies, and \nread a detailed e-mail about how they were going to block and derail \nthis effort of mine and Senator McCain's and Senator Dorgan's and \nothers.\n  I think seeing that come to pass, seeing this effort successfully \nblocked from the FDA bill--something that is clearly a major \nopportunity on which to pass reimportation, a big FDA bill--that has to \ngrow the cynicism of the American public. Americans all across our \ncountry have to be out there thinking: OK, what is wrong with this \npicture? Reimportation unites Democrats and Republicans, a big majority \nin the Senate, a big majority in the House, the support of the \nPresident, saves the system $50 billion, obvious opportunity to pass it \non an FDA bill, but, once again, it is cut off. It is blocked from \nconsideration, from moving forward. That has to increase everybody's \ncynicism, and we have to work beyond that to pass this important \nlegislation for the American people.\n  I am happy the majority leader has generally said he would find time \non the Senate floor for consideration of a reimportation bill. We need \nto move. We would like a date certain, Mr. Leader, a date certain for \nthat important consideration. After so many years of waiting, after so \nmany years of the big PhRMA lobbyists and others blocking us from that \nconsideration, we would like that debate and that action as soon as \npossible. It is certainly appropriate as we go into a major debate on \nhealth care reform.\n  I would underscore the same message with regard to the second crucial \ntopic: reform with regard to generic drugs. For many months now, I have \nbeen working with several Members, most notably Senator Shaheen of New \nHampshire, on bipartisan consensus generic drug reform.\n  Once again, I was very hopeful that this FDA bill on the floor of the \nSenate now would be a prime opportunity, an obvious opportunity, to \npass that consensus bipartisan reform. Once again, that door was closed \nto us. We are not going to have that opportunity, and I express real \ndisappointment.\n  But we need to act in that area. I look forward to continuing to work \nwith Senator Shaheen, Senator Brown, and others in that important area. \nWe have been focused on two things, in particular, that can make a huge \ndifference.\n  First, we need to clear up certain loopholes, quite frankly, in the \nlaw that allowed drug companies to make labeling changes when their \npatent protection is about to run out, when generic was about to be \nopen to go on the market. They were able to make slight labeling \nchanges to extend that protection longer, in my opinion, in a somewhat \nartificial way. We need to reform the law and clear up those loopholes \nso that generic can come to market and provide Americans with a lower \ncost alternative.\n  Surely the drug companies need a period of protection so they can \nrecoup their enormous investment in research and development. But what \nthey don't need, and what we should not allow, in my opinion, is \ntweaking the labels at the eleventh hour and extending that protection \nin an artificial and, in my opinion, unreasonable way. That is a big \narea of reform I have been working on with Senator Shaheen and others.\n  A second area of needed reform is to elevate the Office of Generic \nDrugs and its importance within the FDA. We need to give it more \nstature. We need to have the head of that office report directly to the \nhead of the FDA, the Administrator. We need to fund it properly so \nthat, again, we put the proper emphasis on generic drugs. Generics are \na good, safe, lower cost alternative to millions of American seniors \nand other Americans. They provide that today. But they can provide that \nlower cost alternative to an even greater extent if we take these \ncommonsense, consensus, bipartisan measures--if we do away with these \nloopholes that allow last-minute labeling changes to artificially and \nunreasonably extend a company's patent, and if we elevate the stature \nof the Office of Generic Drugs within the FDA.\n  Again, it was an obvious opportunity to do just that in a bipartisan \nconsensus way as we debate and act on this major FDA bill on the floor \nof the Senate now. I am sorry that door has been closed to us. I am \nsorry we have lost that opportunity. It is a shame. But we need to move \non that issue, just as we need to move on reimportation now in the next \nfew months this year in this body and in the House of Representatives.\n  We desperately need important health care reform. We need savings in \nthe system to make costs of the overall health care system more \nreasonable, without sacrificing patient care, without telling seniors \nthey cannot get this treatment or they cannot get that operation. These \nare commonsense, achievable ways to do that, by stabilizing the cost of \nprescription drugs. That is one of the most significant costs in our \nhealth care system with one of the most significant growth patterns. So \nlet's act on reimportation, let's act on generics reform, let's act in\n\n[[Page S6416]]\n\na bipartisan way, let's act for the best interests of American seniors \nand all the American people.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Sanders pertaining to the introduction of S. 1225 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SANDERS. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Credit Card Fair Fee Act\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday I reintroduced the Credit Card \nFair Fee Act. This legislation will provide fairness and transparency \nin the setting of credit card interchange fees.\n  Several weeks ago, the Senate passed legislation that will crack down \non abusive fees and practices that credit card providers impose on \nconsumers and cardholders. It is landmark legislation. It was 20 years \nin the making. I was pleased to support it and glad it passed.\n  We also need to take a hard look at the fees and the restrictions \ncredit card providers impose on retailers. Retailers such as the \nrestaurant down on the corner, the grocery store, the shop, these have \nto be looked at as well.\n  Currently, banks and credit card companies impose a system of fees \nand restrictions on retailers that accept their cards as a form of \npayment. There is a growing recognition that many of these fees and \nrestrictions are anticompetitive and unfair to businesses and \nconsumers.\n  Many people assume credit cards make their money off the customers \nwho use them in direct payment, interest charges, and penalties. It \nturns out there is a whole level of fees that is imposed on retailers \nwhich, obviously, is passed on to consumers but have a direct impact on \nsales in America. If we do not address flaws in the system, many \nbusinesses will find it hard to make a profit, and the credit card fees \ncause consumer prices to go up as well. The most flawed element of the \ncurrent system of merchant fees is the interchange fee. It is a fee \nmerchants pay to card issuing banks on each debit or credit card \ntransaction.\n\n  Under the current system, card networks, such as Visa and MasterCard, \nunilaterally set the rates for these interchange fees. These fees vary \nfrom card to card, but they average about 2 percent of the transaction \nthey cover. Card companies don't let their member banks negotiate with \nmerchants over the fee rates, and they prevent merchants from \nencouraging customers to use cards that carry lower fees.\n  Yesterday, the Secretary of the Treasury was in before my \nappropriations subcommittee. It turns out, we accept credit cards for \nsome 200 different agencies in the Federal Government. I asked the \nSecretary how much we pay in interchange fees to these credit card \ncompanies--as we accept credit card payments for everything from taxes \nto purchases at the Government Printing Office. It turns out it is well \nover $200 million a year. The GAO did a study in which it was asked \nwhether, in fact, the Federal Government bargains for lower interchange \nfees because of the volume of business we do. It turns out there is \nvirtually no bargaining allowed, not even with the Federal Government.\n  If merchants want to accept credit cards, those merchants simply have \nto abide by the rates, just like the Federal Government, that the card \nnetworks set, even when the rates are increased.\n  In fact, card companies regularly increase their interchange rates. A \nreport by the Federal Reserve Bank in Kansas City found that between \n1996 and 2006 Visa and MasterCard interchange rates increased from \napproximately $1.30 per $100 transaction to $1.80. That is about a 40-\npercent increase over that 10-year period of time. The rates have gone \nup even further for cards that have rewards programs. The total amount \nof interchange fees collected last year was $48 billion, according to \nestimates of the National Retail Federation. It is a huge increase from \n2001, when the figure was $16.6 billion.\n  Despite these rising fees, many merchants have no real choice but to \naccept these cards as a form of payment. Consumers use their credit and \ndebt cards for over 40 percent of all transactions. Interchange fees \ncut into retailer profits and force many merchants to raise consumer \nprices or go out of business.\n  As you think about it, what does it mean for the profitability of a \ncompany if the business is required to pay the credit card company 2 \npercent of the sale price on every sale? Well, for some companies that \noperate on a very tight margin, it can be significant. Best Buy, the \nlarge and successful electronics retailer, has a net profit margin of \nonly 2.2 percent. Whole Foods, a well-known grocery store, has a profit \nmargin of 1.4 percent. The food and drugstore retail sector has a \nprofit margin of only 1.5 percent, according to Fortune magazine.\n  How can these companies continue to be profitable if rising \ninterchange fees paid to credit card companies cut into their already \nsmall operating margins? In 2007, the National Association of \nConvenience Stores reported the entire convenience store industry had \nprofits of $3.4 billion dollars; however, they paid credit card \ninterchange fees of $7.6 billion. Over twice the amount of industry \nprofit was paid to credit card providers.\n  Of course, it has an impact on smaller businesses. Rich Niemann, a \nfriend of mine, who is coming by my office this afternoon in \nWashington, runs Niemann Foods, a chain of 65 grocery stores based in \nQuincy, IL. Every year I meet with him, and every year he asks me for \nhelp with interchange fees. Last year, Niemann Foods made $6 million in \nprofits but paid $3 million in interchange fees. Those fee payments are \ngoing up every year. He has no ability to negotiate any change in those \nfee amounts. It is a growing expense he can't control.\n  Rising interchange fees cause many merchants to raise the price of \ntheir goods to cover these interchange fees. I don't want to drive \nsmall grocery stores out of business or small convenience stores. We \ndon't want prices to go up for consumers across the board because of \nnonnegotiable credit card fees. The Credit Card Fair Fee Act will help \nrestore fairness. The goal is simple. It incentivizes companies that \nprovide credit cards and the merchants that accept them to sit down \ntogether and negotiate fees and terms both sides can live with.\n  The bill establishes a framework for negotiations and gives both \nsides a legitimate voice at the table. Under the bill, merchants would \nreceive limited antitrust immunity to negotiate collectively with the \nproviders of card systems over the fees and terms for access to the \nsystem. The bill then motivates the merchants and card providers to \nwork out voluntary agreements. It establishes a mandatory period for \nnegotiations.\n  If they fail to reach a voluntary agreement, the matter would then go \nto an arbitration-style proceeding before a panel of judges appointed \nby the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission. The judges \nwould collect and disclose full information about credit card fees and \ncosts and then order a mandatory settlement conference to attempt to \nfacilitate a deal. If that fails, the judges would conduct a hearing \nwhere the merchants and card providers would each propose what they \nthink is a fair set of fees and terms. The judges then would select the \nproposal that most closely represents what would be fairly negotiated \nin a competitive market. This set of fees and terms would govern access \nto the card system by merchants for a period of 3 years.\n  The bill contains safeguards to ensure the judges can only select a \nset of proposed fees and terms that is fair and pro-consumer. But the \nultimate goal is to reach a deal before the process gets to the point \nwhere the judges would need to issue a ruling.\n  This is an archaic element of commerce in America that has a direct \nimpact on consumers, the money we pay\n\n[[Page S6417]]\n\nfor goods and services, as well as the profit margins of a lot of \nbusinesses that are struggling. The credit card companies have been \nunable to justify their interchange fees in terms of the actual cost of \nprocessing credit card payments. It is a profit margin on their side \nfor which they are not accountable.\n  My legislation is supported by the Merchants Payments Coalition, a \ncoalition of retailers, supermarkets, convenience stores, drugstores, \nfuel stations, online merchants and other businesses. The coalition's \nmember associations collectively represent about 2.7 million stores \nnationwide, with approximately 50 million employees.\n  I ask my fellow colleagues in the Senate to take a look at the \nlegislation. I warn them in advance, if they are interested in looking \nat this issue of credit cards and interchange fees, be prepared. You \nare going to hear from every bank that issues a credit card, and they \nare going to tell you the Durbin legislation is the end of the world. \nBut I hope you will also listen to the merchants and retailers in the \nStates you represent. They will tell you this system is unconscionable \nand unsustainable.\n  To have the credit card companies dictate these fees to their \nretailers all across America is fundamentally unfair. We should have \narm's length negotiation. We should also have at the Federal Government \nlevel a negotiation to determine what is the best arrangement for \ntaxpayers when it comes to paying these credit card fees to the \ncompanies that provide credit cards for transactions with the Federal \nGovernment. It is not an unreasonable approach.\n  I hope my colleagues will take a look at this issue, and I hope they \nwill listen to their merchants and retailers back in their States.\n\n\n                               Guantanamo\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to commend the Obama administration for the \nprogress they have made to date on closing the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay. According to media reports today, the Obama \nadministration has reached a historic agreement with the Government of \nPalau to transfer 17 Guantanamo detainees to this Pacific island. These \n17 detainees are Uighurs from China.\n  The Bush administration determined that all 17 are not enemy \ncombatants and do not pose any risk to U.S. national security. The Bush \nadministration had determined the Uighurs couldn't be legally returned \nto China, for fear they would be imprisoned and tortured. A Federal \nCourt looked at all the classified evidence against these 17 Uighurs \nand found there was no legitimate reason to hold them and ordered them \nreleased. The President, this administration, is going to follow that \ncourt and follow the law.\n  I commend President Obama and those working with him for finding a \nsolution to what has been a vexing problem by convincing the Government \nof Palau to accept Uighur detainees. This is the kind of diplomacy we \nneed to achieve a better standing in the world and a more peaceful and \nsecure situation for the United States.\n  Something else happened yesterday as well. There was an important \ndevelopment. The administration transferred Ahmed Ghailani to the \nUnited States to be prosecuted for his involvement in the 1998 bombings \nof our Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Those bombings killed 224 \npeople, including 12 Americans. I have been to Kenya. I saw the bombed \nbuilding. It was devastating. It is hard to imagine what happened \ninside that building and nearby when those bombs were detonated. We \nknow 224 people died, including 12 of our own.\n  I wish to commend President Obama for his determination to hold Ahmed \nGhailani accountable for his alleged crimes. For 7 long years, the Bush \nadministration had failed to convict any of the terrorists who planned \nthe 9/11 terrorist attacks. For 7 long years, only three individuals \nwere convicted by military commissions at Guantanamo. Two of those \nindividuals, incidentally, have been released. President Obama has been \nclear, it is a priority for his administration to bring to justice the \nplanners of 9/11 and other terrorists who have attacked our country, \nsuch as Ahmed Ghailani.\n  Unfortunately, this issue has become very political and very \ncomplicated over the last several months. Some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle have expressed some things on the Senate floor \nwhich I don't think are consistent with the security of the United \nStates. Senator McConnell, the distinguished minority leader, and \nSenator Kyl, the distinguished assistant minority leader, have argued \nwe should not transfer suspected terrorists from Guantanamo to the \nUnited States in order to bring them to justice. They have argued we \ncannot safely hold any of these detainees in prison in the United \nStates, even--one of their arguments--during the course of the trial.\n  When you look at the failed track record of prosecuting terrorists at \nGuantanamo, it is pretty clear if Ahmed Ghailani isn't prosecuted in \nthe U.S. courts, there is a good chance he will never be punished for \nhis crimes. President Obama made it clear when he said:\n\n       Preventing this detainee from coming to our shores would \n     prevent his trial and conviction. And after over a decade, it \n     is time to finally see that justice is served, and that is \n     what we intend to do.\n\n  Even Senator Kyl appears to have softened his position. On the floor \nof the Senate yesterday, he spoke about Ahmed Ghailani and said:\n\n       Everybody acknowledges that there are some people who need \n     to be tried for serious crimes, in effect, like war crimes, \n     and they should be tried in the United States.\n\n  I commend Senator Kyl for this statement. I think it is a sensible, \nreasonable position. But let us acknowledge the obvious: If we are \ngoing to try these Guantanamo detainees in the United States, we are \ngoing to incarcerate them while we try them. There is no other \nreasonable alternative. If they are found guilty and face imprisonment, \nwhat will we do with them? I am glad Senator Kyl acknowledged the \nobvious. Of course, we have to bring these terrorists to justice, and \nan American court is the best place to do it.\n  The U.S. Government frequently brings extremely dangerous individuals \nto the United States for prosecution. Ramzi Yousef--the mastermind of \nthe 1993 World Trade Center bombings, captured in Pakistan--was brought \nto trial in the United States, convicted, and is now being held in a \nFederal supermaximum security prison, a convicted terrorist.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle continue to \nargue we should not prosecute Guantanamo detainees in U.S. courts \nbecause no prison in America is safe to hold them. Ramzi Yousef was \nheld in the Metropolitan Corrections Center in New York during the \ncourse of his trial for over 2 years--safely. My colleagues seem to \nthink American corrections officers are not capable of safely holding \nterrorists. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is a military \nlawyer, said:\n\n       The idea that we cannot find a place to securely house 250-\n     plus detainees within the United States is not rational.\n\n  What is the record? Today, our Federal prisons--and this is the most \nupdated number from the Justice Department--hold 355 convicted \nterrorists, including al-Qaida leaders such as Ramzi Yousef, who \nmasterminded the World Trade Center bombing in 1993. No prisoner has \never escaped from a Federal supermaximum security facility. Clearly, we \nknow how to hold these terrorists safely and securely so no one in \nAmerica is at risk.\n  Unfortunately, some on the other side of the aisle continue to argue \nthat we should keep Guantanamo open at all costs. I disagree. I \nbelieve, President Obama believes, and I think many Americans believe \nthat closing Guantanamo is an important national security priority. But \nit isn't just the President--and President Bush, for example--who want \nto close Guantanamo. Among those military and security leaders calling \nfor the closing of Guantanamo are: GEN Colin Powell, the former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State; \nRepublican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham; former Republican \nSecretaries of State James Baker and Henry Kissinger and Condoleezza \nRice; Defense Secretary Robert Gates, first appointed by President \nBush; ADM Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; and \nGEN David Petraeus.\n  Yesterday, Senator Kyl made a statement taking issue with some of\n\n[[Page S6418]]\n\nmy earlier comments about Guantanamo.\n  Senator Kyl asked: ``What is wrong with the prison at Guantanamo?''\n  Let me respond to Senator Kyl's question. What is wrong with \nGuantanamo is that it is a recruiting tool for al-Qaeda and other \nterrorists.\n  That is not just my opinion. That is the opinion of our military \nleaders, based on their experiences fighting the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike Mullen said:\n\n       The concern I've had about Guantanamo is it has been a \n     recruiting symbol for those extremists and jihadists who \n     would fight us. That's the heart of the concern for \n     Guantanamo's continued existence.\n\n  General David Petraeus said Guantanamo is, ``a symbol that is used by \nour enemies to our disadvantage. We're beat around the head and \nshoulders with it.''\n  And Defense Secretary Robert Gates said:\n\n       Closing Guantanamo is essential to national security. It \n     has become a rallying cry and recruitment tool for our \n     enemies--endangering the lives of our soldiers in the field, \n     diminishing the willingness of American allies to help wage \n     the fight against al-Qaida and undermining the moral \n     authority of the country.\n\n  Of course, Senator Kyl is entitled to his point of view and I respect \nhim and count him as a friend. But he offers no evidence to support his \nview, certainly no evidence that compares with those I have quoted \nhere, starting with Gen. Colin Powell.\n  Not only is Guantanamo a recruiting tool for terrorists in the Middle \nEast. There is evidence that al-Qaida is actually recruiting terrorists \nin Guantanamo itself. McClatchy Newspapers conducted an extensive \ninvestigation and concluded:\n\n       Instead of confining terorists, Guantanamo often produced \n     more of them by rounding up common criminals, conscripts, \n     low-level foot soldiers and men with no allegiance to radical \n     Islam . . . and then housing them in cells next to radical \n     Islamists.\n\n  McClatchy found that, ``Guantanamo became a school for jihad'' and \n``an American madrassa.''\n  Rear Admiral Mark Buzby, the former commander of Guantanamo's \ndetention facility, said, ``I must make the assumption that there's a \nfully functioning Al-Qaeda cell here at Guantanamo.''\n  Senator Kyl also continues to claim that no one was abused at \nGuantanamo and that there is no connection between the abuses at Abu \nGhraib and Guantanamo. I commend him for his reading of the Senate \nArmed Services Committee Report.\n  But the Senate Armed Services Committee issued a bipartisan report \nthat reached a different conclusion. Senator Levin, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, and Senator McCain, the ranking member of the \ncommittee, found, ``Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's \nauthorization of aggressive interrogation techniques for use at \nGuantanamo Bay was a direct cause of detainee abuse there.''\n  Senators Levin and McCain also concluded, on a bipartisan basis, that \nthere was a connection between the abuses at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo. \nThey said:\n\n       The abuse of detainees at Abu Ghraib in late 2003 was not \n     simply the result of a few soldiers acting on their own. \n     Interrogation techniques such as stripping detainees of their \n     clothes, placing them in stress positions, and using military \n     working dogs to intimidate them appeared in Iraq only after \n     they had been approved for use in Afghanistan and at GITMO.\n\n  And, as I said yesterday, Susan Crawford, a top Bush administration \nofficial, concluded that Mohammad Al-Qahtani, the so-called 20th \nhijacker, could not be prosecuted for his role in the 9/11 attacks \nbecause he was tortured at Guantanamo Bay.\n  For many years, President Bush said that he wanted to close the \nGuantanamo detention facility, and there were few, if no complaints \nfrom the Republican side. But the President never followed through on \nhis commitment.\n  Now that President Obama has made that same call, we hear this chorus \nof opposition. I think President Obama has accepted the challenge--the \nchallenge to make certain that these detainees are treated in a \nresponsible way; that those who should stand trial will stand trial for \ntheir crimes and war crimes; that those who cannot be brought to \narticle 3 courts in America should be tried before reformed military \ntribunals that have rules of evidence and procedure more consistent \nwith our values and laws; that some will be returned, like the Uighurs, \nif they pose no threat, to places where they cannot threaten the United \nStates and that some will be kept in detention because they continue to \nbe a threat to our Nation. That is a responsible course of conduct. It \ndeserves bipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                     THE SECOND ``CAR CZAR'' AWARD\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, this is the ``Car Czar'' award for \nWednesday, June 10, 2009. It is a service to taxpayers from America's \nnew automotive headquarters: Washington DC.\n  It is the second in a series of ``Car Czar'' awards to be conferred \nupon Washington meddlers who distinguish themselves by making it harder \nfor the auto companies your government owns to compete in the world \nmarketplace.\n  On Monday, I presented the very first ``Car Czar'' award to the \nHonorable Barney Frank of Massachusetts for interfering in the \noperation of General Motors. Congressman Frank, who is chairman of the \nHouse Financial Services Committee, intervened last week to save a GM \ndistribution center in his Massachusetts congressional district. The \nwarehouse, which employs some 90 people, was slated for closing under \nGM's restructuring plan. But Mr. Frank put in a call to GM CEO Fritz \nHenderson and, lo and behold, the facility has a new lease on life \naccording to the Wall Street Journal. Mr. Frank, of course, is chairman \nof the House committee that recently orchestrated paying $62 billion in \ntaxpayer dollars to give the U.S. Treasury 60 percent ownership of \nGeneral Motors and 8 percent ownership of Chrysler.\n  Now, for this second ``Car Czar'' award, there are many deserving \ncontenders.\n  For example, this afternoon the Honorable Chris Dodd, Mr. Frank's \nSenate counterpart, is chairing a Banking Committee hearing featuring \ntwo of the administration's chief meddlers in Washington-owned car \ncompanies: Mr. Ron Bloom, a senior advisor on the auto industry at \nTreasury and Mr. Ed Montgomery, White House Director of Recovery for \nAuto Communities and Workers.\n  Tomorrow, over in the House, the Financial Services Committee will \nhold a hearing on salaries of workers in companies the government owns.\n  Another obvious contender for the award is the administration's new \nChief-Price-Fixer for the cost of labor, Mr. Kenneth Feinberg who will \nreview and approve how managers of car companies are paid. According to \nthe New York Times article on June 8, Mr. Feinberg is likely not just \nto tell Government-owned car companies and banks how much to pay \npeople, it is likely ``everyone else's compensation will be monitored, \ntoo.''\n  But there is time next week to honor all these worthy contenders. \nToday's ``Car Czar'' award clearly should go to the Members of the \nWisconsin and Michigan and Tennessee congressional delegations, each of \nwhom met today in Washington with GM executives, imploring them to \nbuild small cars in our home States. In Tennessee's case, of course, we \nwere talking about the Saturn plant in Spring Hill, recently placed on \nstandby.\n  In other words, I am giving the ``Car Czar'' award today to, among \nothers, myself--the senior Senator from Tennessee.\n  Now, in my own defense, as Mr. Frank's spokesman said when Mr. Frank \nwas caught calling GM about the warehouse in Massachusetts--I was \n``just doing what any other Congressman would do'' in looking out for \nthe interests of his constituency. But that is precisely the reason for \nthese ``Car Czar'' awards. As the Wall Street Journal put it, ``. . . \nthat's the problem with industrial policy and government control of \nAmerican business. In Washington, every Member of Congress now thinks \nhe's a czar who can call ol' Fritz and tell him how to make cars.''\n  But consider for a moment the implications of all 535 of us in \nCongress regularly participating in such incestuous behavior. It is one \nthing, as I did in 1985 as Governor, to argue to General Motors to put \nthe Saturn plant in Tennessee right next to the Nissan plant. That was \nan arm's length transaction.\n\n[[Page S6419]]\n\n  It is quite another thing for me as U.S. Senator and a member of the \ngovernment that owns 60 percent of the company, to urge GM executives \nto build cars in my State. I can pretend I am making my case on the \nmerits: central location, right to work laws, four-lane highways, \nhundreds of suppliers, low taxes, a successful Japanese competitor 40 \nmiles away. But my incestuous relationship as owner taints the entire \naffair.\n  So I will continue to confer ``Car Czar'' awards--seeking to end the \nincestuous nature of these meetings and time-wasting hearings--until \nCongress and the President enact my ``Auto Stock for Every Taxpayer'' \nlegislation which would distribute the Government's stock in GM and \nChrysler to the 120 million Americans who paid taxes on April 15. Such \na stock distribution is the fastest way to get ownership of the auto \ncompanies out of the hands of meddling Washington politicians and back \ninto the hands of Americans in the marketplace. It is also the fastest \nway to allow the car company managers to design, build and sell cars \nrather than scurry around Washington--under oath--answering questions \nand being instructed by their political owners how to build cars and \ntrucks.\n  Distributing the stock to the taxpayers also may be the fastest way \nfor Congressmen to get themselves re-elected. According to the \nNashville Tennessean, an AutoPacific survey reports that 81 of \nAmericans polled agree ``that the faster the government gets out of the \nautomotive business, the better.''\n  Now, here is an invitation for those who may be listening: if you \nknow of a Washington ``Car Czar'' who deserves to be honored, please \nemail me at CarAward@Alexander.Senate.gov, and I will give you full \ncredit in my regular ``Car Czar'' reports here on the floor of the \nUnited States Senate.\n  And after you write to me, I hope you will write or call your \nCongressman and Senators and remind them to enact the ``Auto Stock for \nEvery Taxpayer Act'' just as soon as General Motors emerges from \nbankruptcy. All you need to say when you write or call are these eight \nmagic words, ``I paid for it. I should own it.''\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am glad we are now engaged in the health \ncare debate, but this debate is long overdue. I congratulate the Obama \nadministration for taking on the tough issues. This is not an easy \nsubject in order to reach the type of consensus necessary in order to \npass major legislation. There are a lot of special interests that are \ngoing to make it difficult for us to move forward.\n  I am proud this administration is taking up this issue because we are \nin a health care crisis in America. I say that because the cost of \nhealth care is not sustainable. We spend twice as much as the next most \nexpensive nation in the world per capita on health care--$2.4 trillion \na year, 15 percent of our gross domestic product. Those numbers are \nincreasing dramatically each and every year. The cost of health care is \nnot sustainable.\n  We had a great deal of discussion here about fiscal responsibility \nand bringing our budget into balance. President Obama is correct. If we \ndo not deal with the escalating cost of health care, it is going to \nmake it virtually impossible for us to bring our budgets into balance \nin the future--whether it is a Medicare budget or Medicaid budget or a \nhousehold's budget. We have to do a better job in reining in the cost \nof health care. America needs to be competitive internationally. We \ncannot be competitive internationally unless we find a way to bring \ndown the cost of health care.\n  Family insurance premiums have gone up threefold in the last 8 years \nalone--much faster than earnings, three times as fast as earnings. The \nconsequences for Marylanders is that they are going into bankruptcy. \nYou have heard it said that we are only one health incident away from \nfiling bankruptcy in America for many families. They have to make \ndifficult choices: Should I really go see a doctor? Is it really that \nimportant, because do I really have the money to lay out? It is not \ncovered by my insurance, or I don't have insurance, what do I do?\n  We have 46 million Americans today who have no health insurance, and \nit is very costly in the way they enter the system. They use the \nemergency rooms. They don't get preventive health care. They spend a \nlot of money. It increased 20 percent over the last 8 years.\n  In my State of Maryland, we have 760,000 Marylanders, 15.4 percent of \nour nonelderly population, without health insurance.\n  We need to reform our health care system. We need to build on what is \nright in our health care system and correct what is wrong.\n  What is right is that we have some of the highest quality health care \nin the world. I am proud that people from all over the world travel to \nmy own State of Maryland to visit Johns Hopkins University or the \nUniversity of Maryland Medical Center or NIH in order to get their \nhealth care needs met or to train their health care professionals. We \nwant to maintain that edge in America, of leading-edge technology to \nkeep people healthy. We have choice in our health care system. I \nbelieve that is good. You can choose the health plan in many cases. You \ncertainly can choose your provider in many cases. That adds competition \nto quality of care in our system.\n  We have to correct what is wrong. The first thing we have to correct \nis the cost. We have to bring the cost down.\n  The first way to bring down the costs is for everyone to be in the \nsystem to deal with the uninsured. I congratulate our committee for \ncoming forward with proposals that will include every American in our \nhealth care system. I think that is the prerequisite to health care \nreform.\n  Second, the proposals that are coming forward that recognize the \nadvantage of preventive health care. In 1997 we amended the Medicare \nbill to include preventive health care services. Well, that has kept \nour seniors healthier, living better lives, and being less costly to \nthe system itself by detecting diseases at an earlier stage. In some \ncases we can even prevent diseases by preventive health care.\n  That is what we need to do. It saves money. Preventive health care \nservices cost in the hundreds of dollars. Surgery related to diseases \nnot caught in the early stages are in the tens of thousands of dollars. \nIt makes sense economically.\n  President Obama is right to invest in health information technology. \nThat will save money. It also manages an individual's care in a much \nmore effective way. So there are a lot of ways we can bring down the \ncost of health care. But let me talk about one issue that has gotten a \nlot of attention on this floor by some of my colleagues who seem to be \nopposing health care reform before we even have a bill before us, and \nthat is the conversation about a public insurance option. I am somewhat \nbewildered by this discussion because I do not hear too many of my \ncolleagues suggesting that the Medicare system should be done away \nwith.\n  Now, the last time I checked, Medicare was a public insurance \nprogram. So let me differentiate because I think this point has been \nmisleading on this floor.\n  When there is a government option, it does not mean the government \nprovides the health care; it means it pays for the health care, as it \ndoes in Medicare. The doctors our seniors and disabled population go to \nare private doctors and private hospitals, as it should be. They have \nchoice, as they should. The public insurance option just provides the \npredictability of a plan that will always be there.\n  My constituents in Maryland remember all too well the private \ninsurance companies within Medicare who were here one day and gone the \nnext day. Thank goodness they had the public option available to them \nin order to make sure they had coverage. Well, that is not true in Part \nD today. We do not have a public insurance option.\n  That was a mistake. We need a public insurance option, first and \nforemost, to deal with cost. We have to bring down the cost of health \ncare. We have 46 million people without health insurance today. Are we \ngoing to let them try to\n\n[[Page S6420]]\n\nfigure out what private insurance to go to without the controls on \ncost? That is going to add to the cost in this country, not bring it \ndown.\n  We have to at least have a comparison on a fair competition between \npublic insurance and private insurance. I favor private insurance. But \nI want to have a public insurance option because I want the people of \nMaryland and around the Nation to have choice, to be able to choose the \nplan that is best for them.\n  They can stay in the plan they have now if they are satisfied with \nit. We want them to, and we encourage them to. But we want them to have \na choice. We want the market to work. That is why the public insurance \noption has become more and more important.\n  Let me point out the two programs that we recently changed. Medicare \nAdvantage. Well, Medicare Advantage is the private insurance option \nwithin Medicare that our seniors have the option, voluntarily, to join.\n  Well, when Medicare Advantage started, Medicare Plus Choice, it was a \nsavings to the taxpayers because we paid the private insurance company \n95 percent of what we paid the fee-for-service companies within the \npublic option, saving money for the system. It made sense.\n  Well, guess what. Today we are paying the Medicare Advantage plans, \nthe private plans, 112 to 117 percent of what we pay those who are in \nthe traditional public option in Medicare. In other words, every person \nwho picks private insurance costs the system money.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, which is a nonpartisan objective \nscorekeeper, says the Medicare Advantage premium we pay over what we \nwould pay if they were in fee for service costs the system $150 billion \nover 10 years. So the public option is not only to offer choice to the \npeople of our country between a plan that they want and it is available \nto them, whether it is a private plan or a public plan--remember, the \nproviders are going to be private. This is not who provides the \nbenefits; it is who pays for it, who puts together the plan. It will \nsave the system money.\n  Part D: There is no public option in Part D. Many of us raised that \nissue back then, that we could have saved taxpayer money and saved \nMedicare money if we at least tried to keep the private insurance \ncompanies honest by having a public plan where we know what is being \ncharged and paid for prescription drugs. Most of it is the cost of \nmedicine. Why can we not have transparency? Why do we have to pay the \nhigh overhead costs of private insurance without the competition of a \nmodel that could save the taxpayers money and save our system money?\n  This is not a government takeover, as some of my colleagues have \nsaid. Medicare was not a government takeover. Medicare pays for the \nprivate doctors and hospitals so the disabled and seniors can get \naccess to health care in America. I think those who make the arguments, \nwhich are basically scare tactics, are not adding to the debate \nanything that is worthy of this issue. This is a very important issue \nto the people of our Nation. This is our opportunity to fix our system \nby improving what is right, building on it, and correcting what is \nwrong.\n  But let's strengthen the good parts of our system. Let's strengthen \nthose coverages that people are happy about, the employers who are \nproviding health benefits to their employees, where it is working. But \nlet's correct the runaway costs in our system, and let's provide a \nreasonable way that those who do not have health insurance can get \nhealth insurance.\n  If we can work together, Democrats and Republicans, this is an \nAmerican problem. This is about America's competitiveness. This is \nabout American families being able to afford their health care. This is \nabout balancing our budgets in the future so America can continue to \ngrow as the strongest economy in the world. But it starts today in this \ndebate about fixing one of the underpinnings of our economy that is out \nof whack.\n  We need universal coverage. We need to have options available that \nwill keep health care affordable for all people in this country and \nprovide quality care for each American. That is what this debate is \nabout.\n  I applaud our committees that are working on this issue. I applaud \nall of the Members of this body and the House who are seriously \nengaging in this discussion.\n  I think we can all learn from each other. If we work in good faith, \nwe can develop a health care reform proposal that will maintain quality \nbut provide access and affordability to every family in America. That \nshould be our objective. I hope we will all work toward that end.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  asme\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate the American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers on the 125th anniversary of their codes \nand standards.\n  As the only serving Senator who has worked as an engineer--indeed, I \nhave a degree in engineering and worked as a mechanical engineer--I was \nproud to sponsor a resolution acknowledging the lasting impact ASME \ncodes and standards have had on our Nation and on other parts of the \nworld.\n  Now to non-engineers, codes and standards developed by and for \nmechanical engineers may sound like a lot of jargon and, candidly, like \npretty boring stuff.\n  But as an engineer, I am proud to say that I believe that the nuts \nand bolts of how to build things, how to create, how to standardize and \ngrow equipment and industries have been at the very heart of the \nAmerican economic growth-engine for more than a century.\n  That kind of nuts and bolts thinking and creativity will be what \nleads America out of this recession and toward sustained economic \ngrowth once again.\n  So I'm pleased that the Senate has joined me in celebrating a success \nstory of American engineering.\n  This story begins when ASME was founded in 1880. ASME currently \nincludes more than 127,000 members worldwide.\n  It is a professional organization which promotes the art, science, \nand practice of mechanical and multidisciplinary engineering and allied \nsciences.\n  One of its chief functions since its founding has been the \ndevelopment of tool and machine part standards, along with uniform work \npractices to ensure mechanical reliability.\n  This week, ASME will celebrate its 125th anniversary of codes and \nstandards development.\n  This is a tribute to the dedicated service of technical experts and \nengineers, whose efforts resulted in internationally accepted \nstandards--standards that not only enhance public safety but also \npromote global trade.\n  Its first published performance test code was entitled ``Code for the \nConduct of Trials of Steam Boilers.''\n  Since then, ASME has developed more than 500 technical standards for \npressure vessel technology, electric and nuclear power facilities, \nelevators and escalators, gas pipelines, engineering drawing practices, \nand numerous other technical and engineered products and processes.\n  At present, ASME codes and standards, as well as conformity \nassessment programs, are used in more than one hundred countries.\n  Does engineering sound boring to you? Let's hope America's youth \ndon't think so. We need to excite the young minds of thousands and \nthousands of young Americans about the possibilities of being an \nengineer, because engineers have always been the world's problem \nsolvers. It is impossible to ignore the effect ASME's codes and \nstandards have had on global development.\n  During the period of rising industrialization, as machines were \nexpanding in use and complexity on farms and in factories, ASME \nstandards helped to ensure the safety of engineers and workers using \nthese machines.\n  Today, in our global economy, these codes and standards are \ncontinually revised and updated to reflect changes in\n\n[[Page S6421]]\n\ntechnology. As a result, ASME's codes and standards are accepted across \nthe globe and help to advance international commerce. The American \nSociety of Mechanical Engineers has adapted to meet the changes and \nchallenges in the engineering profession. I commend their \naccomplishments and contributions to the health, safety, and economic \nwell-being of our Nation.\n  I am pleased that the Senate yesterday approved S. Res. 179.\n  When I went to college I wanted to be a mechanical engineer, in part \nbecause 52 years ago, after Sputnik, the United States was supporting \nscience and engineering on an unprecedented level. America's \ncompetitive spirit helped us meet the challenges of those times. \nThousands of innovations created myriad new opportunities for growth \nand development. We can do this again.\n  The financial crisis should lead to a cultural shift back to the \nstrong foundations of innovation and know-how that have always been the \nAmerican way. I am glad that the federal government is again investing \nstrongly in supporting the basic scientific, medical, and engineering \nresearch that will spur the discovery and innovations to create \nmillions of new jobs and shape a bright American future.\n  I thank my fellow Senators for joining with me in celebrating one \nsmall chapter in the American economic success story, with hope that we \ncan inspire similar successes in the coming years.\n\n\n                            Brian J. Persons\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to speak about our excellent Federal workforce.\n  In my years of government service, I have met so many wonderful \npeople who give so much of themselves for the benefit of us all. That \nis why I believe it essential for the American people to have \nconfidence in our Federal employees.\n  Americans need to know that they can place their trust in those \ncharged with carrying out the people's work.\n  Our government is filled with talented individuals performing their \njobs with excellence.\n  I cannot count--I literally cannot count--the Federal employees who \ndeserve to be praised here in this Chamber, because that number is so \ngreat. But I hope to share one story today that is exemplary of our \ncivil servants overall.\n  The ancient philosophers used to compare the government of a state \nwith that of a vessel at sea.\n  In order to keep the ship afloat, to keep it headed in the proper \ndirection, it required a captain and crew who were disciplined and \nresponsible. Moreover, everyone on board--down to the lowest rank--had \na job to do, and every task was critical.\n  So it is with government.\n  Every Federal employee, no matter how large or small one's job, keeps \nour ship of state afloat and sailing ever onward.\n  I have not chosen to reference this analogy by chance. Rather, it \nfits well with the story of a hardworking and accomplished civil \nservant whom I wish to recognize today.\n  I spoke earlier about the effect of engineers on our economy and our \ncommunities. The Federal employee I honor today has spent more than a \nquarter of a century working as a civilian engineer for the Navy \nDepartment.\n  Although today Brian Persons has risen to become executive director \nof the Naval Sea Systems Command, or NAVSEA, he began his public \nservice as a ship architect at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. A \nMichigan native and graduate of Michigan State with a degree in civil \nengineering, Brian went to work in 1981 for the Navy Department, \ndesigning and maintaining the ships of our fleet. Brian distinguished \nhimself in the design division at Long Beach, and he was made a \nsupervisory architect within a few years. While there, he worked on \noverhauls of surface ships, including the great battleships U.S.S. New \nJersey and the U.S.S. Missouri. In 1988, when the U.S.S. Samuel B. \nRoberts struck a mine in the Persian Gulf, the Navy sent Brian to Dubai \nto provide analysis and repair options.\n  Although he was only asked to spend a week in the gulf, Brian \nremained with the stricken vessel for 45 days until it was again \nseaworthy.\n  Describing the experience years later, he said:\n\n       I am still amazed at the authority I was given to execute \n     this project. I was lucky to have such an opportunity at such \n     an early stage in my career.\n\n  I want our Nation's graduates to know that careers in public service \nare full of opportunities like the one given to Brian.\n  Federal employees at all levels get to work on exciting and relevant \nprojects every day.\n  After his superb performance in Dubai, Brian was given a series of \nchallenging jobs in the NAVSEA Commander's Development Program. Just 10 \nyears after he first began his career, the Navy Department promoted \nBrian to be the director for maintenance and modernization under the \nassistant secretary for research, development, and acquisition. In this \nrole, which he held for 5 years, he was responsible for overseeing \npolicy on ship maintenance and modernization as well as the Navy's \nnuclear, biological, and chemical protection programs.\n  Brian returned to NAVSEA in 1996 and has worked in various roles \nthere over the past 12 years. For his dedicated service in government, \nBrian was honored with a Meritorious Presidential Rank Award in 2004 \nand won the prestigious Distinguished Presidential Rank Award last \nyear. This year, he was appointed as executive director of NAVSEA, its \nmost senior civilian executive.\n  In addition to his work as an engineer and a manager, throughout the \nyears Brian has served as a role model for those working with him, \nincluding a number of colleagues from traditionally underrepresented \nminority groups, whom he has mentored as they sought leadership \npositions in the Department.\n  This is truly the kind of service and mentorship we need to promote \namong engineers and other science professionals. Engineers can play an \nimportant role in bettering our communities and promoting education \namong our students.\n  I am glad we were able to include funding for service opportunities \nof this kind in the Serve America Act earlier this year. I call again \non my colleagues and on all Americans to join me in recognizing the \ncontributions of Brian Persons and all of the engineers, scientists, \nand technicians who continue to ensure that our ships of state remain \nseaworthy and on a forward course.\n  I honor their service and that of all our hard-working Federal \nemployees.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, of all the complex issues the United \nStates will deal with in this Congress, none will be more important \nthan health care reform. Of all the momentous decisions we will make \nover the next few months, none will be more consequential or long-\nlasting than the votes we may take regarding the one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy which comprises our health care system. If we get it \nright, we could devise a program that makes health care more accessible \nand affordable, provides health coverage to millions of Americans who \nare currently without health insurance, relieves Americans from worry \nabout the effect changing jobs will have on their health care, saves \nlives through an increased focus on prevention and wellness, saves \nmoney by curbing the out-of-control growth in government health care \nprograms, keeps patients and families in control of their health care \nchoices, and makes doctors the decisionmakers on treatment options.\n  We have a great opportunity before us to improve the American health \ncare system, but we run a perilous risk if we do not act wisely and \ncarefully. We can fix our broken health care system by making it more \naccessible and affordable for Americans, and we can do so without \njeopardizing quality, individual choice, and personalized care.\n  The American people need us to act on this issue, but they do not \nneed or\n\n[[Page S6422]]\n\nwant us to act rashly. We do not need to enact a Washington takeover or \na scheme that would inevitably lead to a government takeover of one-\nsixth of our gross domestic product.\n  I recently spoke with a resident of a country that is a major U.S. \nally. He espoused the benefits of his country's government health care \nprogram, explaining in particular detail how the program works there. \nBut then I posed a question: What happens in your country if you get \ncancer? He smiled and said: If I get cancer, I am going to the United \nStates. He is going to the United States. It was a very telling answer \nthat points up a profound truth: There are many things we need to fix \nabout American health care, but there are a number of things we do \nright. There are a number of things right about our system, and we \ndon't need to risk losing those things that today give Americans the \nhighest quality health care system in the world.\n  Nine out of ten middle-aged American women have had a mammogram--90 \npercent of American women--compared to less than three-fourths of \nCanadian women. More than half of American men have had a prostate test \ncompared to less than one in six Canadians. Nearly one-third of \nAmericans have had a colonoscopy compared to less than 5 percent of \nCanadians. These are statistics we need to be proud of as compared to \nour Western allies.\n  In addition to this focus in America on prevention, we also spend \nless time waiting for care than patients in Canada and the United \nKingdom. Canadian and British patients wait about twice as long--\nsometimes more than a year--to see a specialist. We don't need health \ncare reform that moves us in that direction. Mr. President, 827,429 \npeople today, at this very moment, are waiting for some sort of \nprocedure in Canada, and 1.8 million people in England are waiting for \na hospital admission or outpatient treatment. They are having to wait \nfor that in England.\n  We Americans also have better access to new technologies such as \nmedical imaging than patients in Canada or the United Kingdom. \nAmericans are responsible for the vast majority of all health care \ninnovations. The top five U.S. hospitals--only five top U.S. \nhospitals--conduct more clinical trials than all the hospitals in any \nother single developed country. Only the top five outrank any other \ncountry in the world in clinical trials. We ought to be proud of that. \nWe ought not to enact any program that would jeopardize that type of \ninnovation.\n  Since the mid-1970s, the Nobel Prize in medicine or physiology has \ngone to American residents more often than recipients from all other \ncountries combined. We get results based on our innovation and our \nresearch in the United States of America.\n  All these numbers translate into one very important fact: Americans \nhave a better 5-year survival rate than Europeans for common cancers. \nFor example, in the area of colon cancer, we have a 65-percent, 5-year \nsurvival rate in America, compared to only 50 percent in the United \nKingdom. For prostate cancer, we have a 93-percent survival rate for 5 \nyears in the United States; only 77 percent in the United Kingdom. In \nbreast cancer, 90 percent of Americans who suffer from breast cancer \nhave a 5-year survival rate; only 82 percent in the United Kingdom. For \nthyroid cancer that figure is a 94-percent, 5-year survival rate and \nonly 75 percent in the United Kingdom.\n  Put another way, breast cancer mortality is 52 percent higher in \nGermany with their government-run system than in the United States, and \nbreast cancer mortality is 88 percent higher in the United Kingdom with \ntheir government-run health care system. Prostate cancer mortality is \n604 percent higher in the United Kingdom and 457 percent higher in \nNorway. Is there a genetic predisposition for the people of Norway to \ndie of prostate cancer or of German women to have breast cancer? I \ndon't think so. I think these numbers, these stubborn facts reflect \nthat our American system of innovation and detection and treatment is a \ngood thing, and as we improve and fix our system, we need to be careful \nto maintain that type of quality.\n  There are broken parts of our system, to be sure, but my point today \nis to urge this body to consider the consequences of all the options we \nwill consider. There is no question we need to make health care more \naffordable and we need to expand access. Republicans support providing \naffordable access to coverage for every American, and we can do that \nwithout a Washington, DC, takeover of health care. What we cannot \nafford the risk of doing is eroding the quality of care in pursuit of \nour goals this year. The surest way to destroy quality is to hand the \nreins of health care over to the Federal Government.\n  I recently had the opportunity to discuss health care with a member \nof the British House of Commons. That member of Parliament said: \nWhatever you do, do not do what we did in the United Kingdom.\n  A Washington takeover of health care would result in a stifling of \ninnovation. I am convinced it would result in long waits. As we \nconsider a so-called public option, a public plan, we need to ask \nourselves: Will it lead, as I believe it will, to a one-size-fits-all \nWashington takeover of health care and inevitably mean that our \ncitizens will be denied and delayed the health care we need? We need to \nbe careful as we answer that question. I regret to say the plan I see \ntaking shape on the other side of the aisle would result in either a \npolitician or a bureaucrat making your health care decisions instead of \nyou and your doctor. I urge my colleagues to protect innovation and to \nprotect quality.\n  I am convinced we can protect the doctor-patient relationship and \nmake health care more affordable and accessible for all without \njeopardizing the quality I have spoken about this afternoon. I believe \nall of us in this body want a solution that works for Americans. There \nis common ground to be found that would continue the opportunity for \nthe United States to be that world leader in quality. Congress and the \nAmerican people need to pay close attention as we proceed this summer \nand this fall on one of the most important debates in our time.\n  Thank you. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Obstructionism\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I wanted to say this to the occupant of the \nChair personally, but I will take the opportunity to say it now. The \npresentation the Senator made on the floor regarding health care was \nstupendous, terribly impressive. I am going to take much of what the \nPresiding Officer said today and use it in the information I give \npeople in Nevada and the presentations I am making on the floor. It was \nvery good.\n  As the health care debate has heated up this week, Republicans have \nonce again rolled out one of their standard, stale talking points: They \nquestion the efficiency of our government. When all else fails, all \nthey do is berate the government.\n  But if Republicans want to have an honest debate about how our \ngovernment operates, I think one of the first things I would suggest is \nthat they should start looking in the mirror at themselves.\n  Today, Republicans are wasting more taxpayer time and more dollars \nfor no good reason. The tobacco bill on the floor right now is both \nresponsible and overdue. After making us wait out all the 30 hours of \nprocedural time before even moving to the bill--Mr. President, the 30 \nhours isn't all of it. To get to that point, you have to file cloture, \nwhich takes 2 days, and then we have the 30 hours--a total waste of \ntime. Republicans are now making us wait another 30 hours before we can \nvote on this bill. So it is 30 hours just to move to it, and then 30 \nhours once we are on it.\n  Let me reiterate how important the bill we are wasting time on not \ndoing is to the American people. Every day, 3,500 Americans try a \ncigarette for the first time, and the vast majority of them are \nchildren. Nationwide, 3\\1/2\\ million high schoolers smoke; 3\\1/2\\ \nmillion boys and girls in high school smoke. That is more kids than \nparticipate in athletics in our schools who are smoking. Tobacco \ncompanies make money hand over fist by marketing and selling their \npoisonous products to our kids.\n\n[[Page S6423]]\n\n  The bill before the Senate takes smart steps to keep our children and \nfamilies healthier and keep the tobacco companies honest. It will make \nit harder for those companies to sell tobacco to children; help those \nwho smoke overcome their addictions; it will make tobacco products less \ntoxic for those who cannot or do not want to stop.\n  We have tried in good faith since last week to reach agreement with \nRepublicans on amendments to this bill. Our floor staff has given the \nRepublican floor staff a finite list of both Democratic and Republican \namendments that we wanted to vote on as we consider the bill. With rare \nexception, the amendments were germane. If not germane, they were \narguably germane. But no. These amendments included three from Senator \nHagan, and one each from Senators Coburn, Enzi, Bunning, and Lieberman.\n  Unfortunately, despite repeated efforts to move forward, our \nRepublican colleagues have said no every time.\n  Republicans are also slowing down our government in another way. In \nthe few short months since President Obama took office, Republicans \nheld up many of his nominees for crucial positions. There are 25 being \nheld up right now, as we speak. Let me give you a few of them. We have \nhad to have cloture votes this year on the Secretary of Labor; the \nDeputy Attorney General, the No. 2 person for a massive Justice \nDepartment; the Deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior, \nwhich is like the Chief of Staff for the Department of the Interior; \ntwo members of the Council of Economic Advisers; and, incredibly, \nAmerica's Ambassador to Iraq, Chris Hill. They held him up for a long \ntime. Every time I spoke to Secretary Gates, he wanted to know where \nhis Ambassador was, somebody to run that country--at least American \ninterests in that country.\n  Today, they are holding up 25 or more qualified and noncontroversial \nnominees, including Rand Beers, nominated to be Under Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, a pretty important position; Cass \nSunstein, nominated to head the Office of Management and Budget's \nInformation and Regulatory Affairs division. You could go to any law \nschool in America today and ask them to name the top 10 academics in \nlaw schools, and Cass Sunstein's name will be one of the 10 on \neverybody's list. But he is not good enough for the Republicans to get \nhim cleared; Hilary Chandler Tompkins, nominated to be the Solicitor \nfor the Department of the Interior. That is the lawyer there. They have \n70,000 employees. Secretary Salazar thinks it is a good idea that he \nhas a lawyer there. They are not going to allow that; William Sessions, \nnominated to be Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission. Listen to this \none. We have been told the reason he is not going to be approved is \nbecause he is from Vermont, and Senator Leahy is chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee. They want to embarrass a friend, the chairman of \nthat committee, Chairman Pat Leahy; Harold Koh, nominated to be the \nState Department's legal advisor. Just like the Interior Department, \nthe State Department, Secretary Clinton wants a lawyer there, in that \nhuge, most important office. But no. Robert Grove, nominated to be \nDirector of the Census--no.\n  I have only mentioned five. There are 20 others. The Republicans \nrecklessly refuse to confirm our new Ambassador to Iraq. Listen to what \nthey are doing now. They are holding up LTG Stanley McChrystal, an \neminently qualified soldier, whom President Obama and Secretary Gates \nchose to be our new commander in Afghanistan. I met him in my office \nthe other day. This is a man with the military in his blood. His father \nwas a great general. His father won five Silver Stars fighting for our \ncountry around the world. Stanley McChrystal is an expert in \ncounterinsurgency, which we need so badly in Afghanistan. But, no, we \nare not going to get him approved--at least for now.\n  Republicans are so opposed to everything, they even oppose putting \npeople in some of the most important positions in our government. We \nbelieve--the majority, Democrats--that those who have been chosen to \nserve our country must be able to get to work without delay.\n  Republicans across the country agree with that, also. But we have 40 \nMembers of this body--Republicans--who don't represent Republicans \nacross this country. Republicans, if given a chance, wouldn't they \napprove LTG McChrystal? Of course they would. And the other people I \nmentioned. We believe those who have been chosen to serve our country \nmust be able to get to work without delay. President Obama was elected. \nShouldn't he have the people he wants to work with him? Perhaps those \nlistening think this is how the Senate always operates. The occupant of \nthe chair is a new Senator. This isn't how it used to operate.\n  Let me put these delays into context. In the first 4 months of the \nBush administration--the second Bush administration--I am sure it was \nthe same in the first Bush administration--when the Senate was \ncontrolled by the President's party, and we were in the minority, there \nwasn't a single filibuster of a Bush nominee--not one. But in the first \n4 months of the Obama administration, Republicans have filibustered \neight of his nominees. Those are the ones we had to file cloture on. I \nhave indicated that there are many others. With the constraints we have \nin the rules of the Senate, I cannot file cloture on every one of \nthese. Those filibusters in the first 4 months of Senator Obama's \nadministration are twice as many as President Bush faced in his first 4 \nmonths.\n  I hope people who are listening or watching understand this: We are \nnot berating Republicans in Oregon or in Nevada or across the country. \nWhat I am saying is the Republicans here in the Senate--40 of them--are \nnot being fair to our President and our country.\n  Last year, after Republicans held up the work of the Congress more \nthan any other time in history--remember, we had 100 filibusters last \nyear--the American people rejected the Republican status quo. They said \nno to Republicans' just-say-no strategy. I would hope they would learn \nthat the American people don't like this--Independents, Democrats, and \nRepublicans don't like it. We want to work together.\n  Take health care. They have seats at the negotiating table. We want \nto work with them. Energy, the same thing. There is no question the \nAmerican people are taking notice, and they are fed up with petty \npartisan games. There is no question that these reckless tactics have \nconsequences.\n  Republicans delay and delay and delay to their own peril. The truth \nis that all Americans suffer. It is time that the Republicans let us \nget to work and allow President Obama to have his nominees, and let's \nget this bill off the floor. Every day we wait, 3,500 more people are \nsubject to being addicted to tobacco.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I would like to speak for about 3 or 4 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, for far too long, this Nation's broken \nhealth care system has limped along badly and in need of serious \nreform. Many in Washington have lacked either the foresight or the \npolitical will to take on this issue. For those who have tried, it has \nbeen almost impossible to get anywhere. Even today, the President's \nhealth care proposal is under attack from both the right and the left. \nI think we need to do better. Controversy should not drown out \nconversation.\n  The time has come to cast aside the constraints of partisanship, stop \nbickering, and start talking about real change. The American people \nhave had enough. It is time to get to work.\n  The facts are plain: tens of millions of Americans are uninsured and \nunderinsured. Many of these are children. Even employer-sponsored \ncoverage is in jeopardy. Businesses are being drained by skyrocketing \ncosts, and many have cut benefits. High premiums, rising copayments, \nand expensive prescription drugs are driving American families to the \nbrink.\n  Can we stand by and watch as unreasonable health care costs cripple \nfamilies who are already struggling? No, we cannot.\n\n[[Page S6424]]\n\n  Can we allow this crisis to deepen, leaving more and more hard-\nworking Americans behind? No, we cannot.\n  It is the solemn duty of this Congress to follow President Obama's \nlead and enact swift, responsible reform. We can cut costs and improve \ncoverage. We can make the system smarter and less wasteful. We can \nempower individuals and families to make important decisions, not giant \ncorporations or government bureaucracies. We can and we must make \nquality, affordable health care available to every single American.\n  While I support the role insurance companies play in our health care \nsystem, I strongly believe a public option should also be available. \nThis would restore accountability to the system and increase \ncompetition, driving prices down and making good coverage, private or \npublic, more affordable for everyone.\n  American businesses and families have waited far too long for \nmeaningful health care reform. The time to act is now.\n\n  Some of my colleagues have been working to fix our broken system for \nmany years. Senator Kennedy has been a leader on this issue throughout \nhis career. This is the moment he and many others have been working \ntoward. We must seize this opportunity to reform health care in \nAmerica. I urge my colleagues to work with President Obama, as well as \nSenator Kennedy, to make sure everyone has access to quality, \naffordable coverage.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to assure our Members, the \nAmerican people, and Judge Sotomayor that our committee is going to do \nits best to have a hearing on her confirmation that would be worthy of \nthe serious responsibility we have and that the American people will \nfeel is fair. I hope they will say it is the best hearing we have ever \nhad.\n  I have to tell you, though, things are moving faster than I would \nlike to have seen them move, and it does cause some difficulties for \nus. As I discussed on the floor yesterday, the Republican members of \nthe Judiciary Committee are deeply concerned about this process being \nmoved this rapidly. Yesterday, Chairman Leahy unilaterally announced \nthat the hearings would begin on July 13, some 48 days from the \nannouncement of this nomination. I won't go into a lot of detail, but I \nwould note that in the recent three Supreme Court nominees, Justice \nBreyer's hearing was 60 days after the announcement, Justice Roberts'--\nthe one that has been most cited and was the shortest--was 55, and \nJustice Alito's was 70. And I would note that Justice Roberts had 370 \ncases, whereas Judge Sotomayor has 3,500-plus cases to review. So I \nthink, to quote Senator Schumer and Senator Leahy in remarks they made \npreviously, it is better to do it right than to do it too fast.\n  I would note that late last week, the White House sent her answers to \nthe questionnaire we send to all the nominees, requiring a good deal of \ninformation, and that is done on a bipartisan basis. Those answers were \nsent forward with great fanfare. In a press release from the White \nHouse Counsel's Office, the Obama administration proclaimed that they \nset a record by completing the process in just 9 days. But this is a \nconfirmation process, not a confirmation race. I think the White House \nshould focus more on having thorough and complete answers to the \nquestionnaire, not on entering the ``Guinness Book of World Records'' \nfor the fastest response from a Supreme Court nominee.\n  We know now that Judge Sotomayor omitted or failed to include key \ninformation and has provided incomplete and sometimes contradictory \nresponses to the questionnaire. The responses are not satisfactory. So \ntoday all seven Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, who have \nbeen through this--most of them--for some time and seen these issues \ndevelop before, have written to ask that the nominee fulfill her duty \nto provide clear and complete answers to our questions in order to \nobtain quite a bit of information that is now not available and should \nhave been included.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Sonia Sotomayor,\n     Office of the Counsel to the President,\n     The White House.\n       Dear Judge Sotomayor: Thank you for providing your \n     questionnaire, assembled materials, and June 6, 2009 \n     questionnaire supplement to the Judiciary Committee. \n     Committee staff are reviewing your questionnaire responses \n     and attachments and have noted a number of apparent \n     omissions. In addition, we believe that some of your \n     responses are incomplete. In view of these concerns, we would \n     respectfully ask that you revisit the questionnaire and \n     provide another supplement as soon as possible. If you \n     believe that your questionnaire is fully responsive, we would \n     appreciate an explanation to that effect.\n       To assist you in completing your questionnaire, below are \n     some of the potential omissions detected to date:\n       (1) Question 6 asks for your employment record. Although \n     you indicate that you were a member of the board of directors \n     of the State of New York Mortgage Agency, it appears that you \n     also served on the Administration and Personnel Committee (or \n     the Program Committee) and as a member of the board of \n     Community Planning Board #6. In addition, you indicate that \n     you served as a member and vice president of the board of \n     directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense & Education Fund; \n     however, in response to Question 25, you indicate that you \n     served as First Vice President. Please clarify your response \n     and supplement as necessary.\n       (2) Question 12(a) requires lists and copies of materials \n     written or edited. You have been widely described as an \n     editor of the Yale Law Journal and as Managing Editor of the \n     Yale Studies in World Public Order. However, you have not \n     provided any copies of materials from either publication. \n     Please provide the Committee with copies of any materials you \n     edited during your tenure as an editor of both law reviews.\n       (3) Question 12(b) requires copies and or/descriptions of \n     certain reports, memoranda, or policy statements prepared by \n     specified organizations. You have stated that ``As a member \n     of various court committees, I have prepared and contributed \n     to numerous reports and memoranda on court issues, which \n     relate to internal court deliberations and are not available \n     for public dissemination.'' However, the question is not \n     limited to publicly available reports. Please provide such \n     reports and memoranda.\n       (4) Also with respect to Question 12(b), you initially \n     omitted a report concerning the death penalty that you \n     drafted during your time on the Board of the Puerto Rican \n     Legal Defense & Education Fund. We would appreciate \n     confirmation that a thorough review of those records has been \n     completed, given the initial omission, and that you have \n     provided all relevant documents to the Committee in response \n     to this question.\n       (5) Question 13(g) requires a brief summary of and \n     citations for all opinions where decisions were reversed by a \n     reviewing court or where the judgment was affirmed with \n     significant criticism. For opinions not officially reported, \n     copies are requested. Although you indicate with respect to \n     Bernard v. Las Americas Communications, Inc., that there was \n     no formal opinion, you make no such representation with \n     respect to the United States v. Gottesman opinion or the \n     United States v. Bauers opinion--yet it does not appear that \n     copies of these opinions have been provided. Please clarify \n     your response.\n       (6) Question 16(d) asks about trial experience and requires \n     ``opinions and filings'' for cases going to verdict, \n     judgment, or final decision. For three cases you have \n     indicated that ``The Manhattan District Attorney's Office is \n     searching its records for information on this case.'' Please \n     provide us with this information as a supplement to the \n     questionnaire.\n       (7) Also with respect to Question 16(d), you state: ``I \n     tried an additional 14 cases during my time as an assistant \n     district attorney, from 1979 to 1984. The Manhattan District \n     Attorney's Office is searching its records for further \n     information on these cases.'' Please provide us with this \n     information as a supplement to the questionnaire.\n       (8) Question 16(e) asks about appellate practice. Nominees \n     are asked to provide copies of briefs and (if applicable) \n     oral argument transcripts. You state: ``I have requested the \n     briefs and any available transcripts from these cases from \n     the Clerk of the Court of the Second Circuit on May 30th and \n     will forward to the Committee as soon as I receive them.'' \n     Please provide us with this information as a supplement to \n     the questionnaire.\n       We are also concerned that some of your responses fail to \n     provide the Committee with the information to which it is \n     entitled in reviewing your nomination.\n       (1) In response to Question 11(b), you state that you are a \n     member of an organization,\n\n[[Page S6425]]\n\n     the Belizean Grove, that discriminates on the basis of sex. \n     However, you indicate that you ``do not consider the Belizean \n     Grove to invidiously discriminate on the basis of sex in \n     violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct.'' Please explain \n     the basis for your belief that membership in an organization \n     that discriminates on the basis of sex nonetheless conforms \n     to the Code of Judicial Conduct.\n       (2) Question 12(d) requires a list of speeches, remarks, \n     lectures, etc., given by the nominee or, in the absence of \n     prepared texts/outline/notes, then a summary of the subject \n     matter (not a topic or a description). We believe that \n     numerous entries in your list do not provide a ``summary'' of \n     your remarks; instead, they set forth general topics. For \n     example:\n       ``I spoke on Second Circuit employment discrimination \n     cases'';\n       ``I spoke at a federal court externship class on Access to \n     Justice'';\n       ``I spoke on the United States Judicial System'';\n       ``I participated in a symposium on post-conviction relief. \n     I spoke on the execution of judgments of conviction'';\n       ``I spoke on the implementation of the Hague Convention in \n     the United States and abroad'';\n       ``I participated in an ACS Panel discussion on the \n     sentencing guidelines'';\n       ``I participated in a roundtable discussion and reception \n     on `The Art of Judging' '';\n       ``I contributed to the panel, `The Future of Judicial \n     Review: The View from the Bench' at the 2004 National \n     Convention. The Official theme was `Liberty and Equality in \n     the 21st Century.' ''\n       This list is not exhaustive.\n       In addition, we are concerned about the fact that you have \n     failed to provide a draft, video, or transcript for more than \n     half of your speeches, remarks, lectures, etc. According to \n     your questionnaire, you have identified 191 occasions \n     responsive to the questionnaire. For 98, you stated that you \n     could not locate any record, for one you stated that you gave \n     a standard speech, for two you cross-referenced a different \n     speech, for 81 you provided a draft or video, and for eight \n     you provided news clippings instead of a draft, transcript or \n     remarks. We are particularly troubled because there may well \n     be transcripts available for certain remarks: for example, a \n     transcript of the 2004 panel entitled ``The Future of \n     Judicial Review: The View from the Bench'' was available \n     online.\n       Please advise us of the process you undertook to search for \n     these speeches, and for those that you are unable to provide \n     to the Committee, please provide a more thorough explanation \n     of the content of each speech.\n       Although you have provided a great deal of information to \n     the Committee, and we appreciate your efforts, it is \n     important that your information be complete to permit the \n     Committee to properly evaluate your record in the short time \n     that has been provided.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. We look \n     forward to your receiving your supplemental answers as soon \n     as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jeff Session.\n     Chuck Grassley.\n     John Cornyn.\n     Jon Kyl.\n     Tom Coburn.\n     ------\n     Orrin Hatch.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the judge has provided our committee \nwith a good deal of information. We also appreciate that the judge has \nalready once recognized that her quick questionnaire was incomplete. \nThe issue was raised, and she provided the committee with additional \ninformation on June 6 which really should have been in the first \nresponse. However, we are still concerned with several aspects.\n  As I have already said, the minority leader reiterated this morning \nthat members of the Judiciary Committee and the full Senate need a \ncomplete and thorough record in order to make informed judgments on \nthis nomination.\n  This is a lifetime appointment. It is our one chance in Congress to \nget it right. A Justice on the Supreme Court, if not faithful, has the \npower to actually alter the Constitution in addition to faithfully \nfollow it, and sometimes I think that is what they have done.\n  We need to know what kind of judges we are going to get. Does this \njudge understand that he or she will be under the law, subordinate to \nthe law, one who must faithfully follow the law or do they believe they \nare above the law and have the freedom and the ability to interpret it \nin new and novel ways which might seem to further some agenda he or she \nmight have, if they are on the bench? I think the American people are \nconcerned about that. I think they are right to be concerned about \nthat. Decisions have been rendered, in my opinion, that are not \nfaithful to the Constitution, not required by the Constitution.\n  Those are things we need to talk about and do it in a fair way and do \nit at a high level. There is no need to be personal about it.\n  The oversights and errors in this questionnaire are the product of \ntrying to rush through a nominee with one of the most lengthy records \nin recent history, maybe ever, to the Supreme Court, in one of the \nshortest timeframes in history.\n  I think we should try to get it right. I believe a fair and thorough \nprocess, in the best spirit of this Chamber and in the best interest of \nthis Nation, is what we should look forward to. I want to see we get \nthe complete record and get back on the right track. I believe we can \ndo that and it is important we work at it.\n  I promise, as I said, to do what I can, and I believe we will have a \nvery fair and objective hearing. But it is also important that we are \nfair to the American people. They are depending on us to carefully \nscrutinize anyone who comes up for confirmation. We cannot do that \nwithout a complete questionnaire.\n  There are a number of things I raised the other day, yesterday, about \nthe shortfall. I will briefly make a point or two. The letter sets \nforth in some detail quite a number of areas we set forth. It is eight \ndifferent items and some other comments that we believe are inaccurate \nand we call for additional information. There are some significant \nmatters there.\n  When the judge supplemented her initial questionnaire on June 6 by \nproviding us with a report concerning the death penalty article she \ndrafted during her time on the board of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense \nEducation Fund, she had initially omitted that from the report. We \nwould appreciate confirmation that a thorough review of those records \nhas been completed, given the initial omission, and that she has \nprovided all the relevant documents to the committee in response to \nthis question.\n  There are other questions of writings, reports, and speeches. \nQuestion 12(a) requires the nominee to provide copies of materials \nwritten or edited. Judge Sotomayor has been widely described as one of \nthe editors of the Yale Law Journal and, as managing editor, Yale \nStudies in World Public Order. However, we have not received any copies \nof either publication that she has edited. We need to see copies of \nthose materials.\n  The questionnaire also requires copies of reports, memorandums, and \npolicy statements prepared by specified organizations. The judge \nresponded:\n\n       [a]s a member of various court committees [she has] \n     prepared and contributed to numerous reports and memoranda on \n     court issues, which relate to internal court deliberations \n     and are not available for public dissemination.\n\n  I don't think those are the kind of documents that are secret. I \nthink they can be obtained, and I believe the questionnaire calls for \nall of those.\n  Paragraph 12(d) talks about a list of speeches and lectures providing \nthe text of those speeches or, if that is not available, outlines or \nnotes and, if not that, a summary of the subject matter involved in the \nspeeches. About a third of those speeches have not been prepared and \nthe summaries are inadequate. I will give an example. This was a \nresponse to one of them:\n\n       I spoke on Second Circuit employment discrimination cases.\n\n  There is no summary of what it was about, no outline or other \ninformation on that speech.\n  Another one:\n\n       I spoke at a federal court externship class on Access to \n     Justice.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       I spoke on the United States Judicial System.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       I participated in a symposium on post-conviction relief. I \n     spoke on the execution of judgments of conviction.\n\n  Another one:\n\n       I spoke on the implementation of the Hague Convention in \n     the United States and abroad.\n\n  It goes on. There are several others. But those are inadequate \nresponses, probably as a result of rushing the questionnaire through. I \nhope the nominee will go back and see, first of all, if she can find \nthe written speech she gave and provide us a copy of it. That would be \nhelpful as we review these matters because there have been some \nquestions about speeches that the nominee has made.\n  I will not take any more time. I will let the letter speak for \nitself. I tried to\n\n[[Page S6426]]\n\ncall the judge earlier this afternoon, but she will not be available \nuntil sometime later, to tell her this is coming forward. I believe her \nstaff may have already been notified of it, the White House Counsel's \noffice.\n  These are not little bitty matters. They are important matters. If we \nare going to move forward in a recordbreaking timeframe, the least we \ncan expect is complete and full answers to these questions. It is \nappropriate that we insist this questionnaire be properly and \ncompletely answered. I hope and believe it will be. Certainly that is \nwhat our request is.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I ask unanimous consent that I may proceed for about 12 \nor 13 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about health care \nreform. What else in regard to the interests of the American people and \nwhat we are doing here?\n  As the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, has pointed out in \nseveral floor speeches over the past week or so, the desire for health \ncare reform on both sides of the aisle is one that unites this Chamber \nacross both political and geographic boundaries.\n  Our system of health care produces some of the best care in the world \nand it is the driver of a substantial share of the medical innovations \nthat have wiped out diseases, improved our comfort, and extended our \ntime on this Earth.\n  However, this system is not truly accessible to everybody, and that \nis the problem. That is what this entire debate boils down to: your \nability to have access to a doctor, to go see the doctor of your choice \nwhen you need to see that doctor.\n  Solving this problem of access is exceedingly complicated, partly \nbecause it evidences itself in so many diverse ways all across the \ncountry, so many geographical areas. For example, in our rural areas in \nKansas, we are struggling with attracting and retaining doctors and \nkeeping the doors open to our hospitals, to our pharmacies, and \nclinics. We talk about recruiting athletes. My goodness, the business \nof recruiting doctors and health care professionals is equally as \ncompetitive.\n  In our urban areas such as Kansas City and Wichita, our providers \nface very different challenges which are just as daunting and which \nthreaten a patient's ability to access health care.\n  On top of that, although some 250 million Americans have health \ninsurance, somewhere in the neighborhood of 27 to 47 million, depending \non who you are counting and who is talking, do not. That makes \naccessing health care expensive and very challenging for them.\n  In addition, the government-run Medicare Program, which is on the \nverge of bankruptcy, by the way, does not pay doctors and pharmacists \nand ambulance drivers and nurse clinicians--pardon me, clinical lab \nfolks and home health care providers and almost every health care \nprovider that you can name--they do not pay them enough to cover their \ncost. Unless these providers have a non-Medicare population to recoup \ntheir losses, they cannot stay in business and their patients lose \nout--a de facto rationing of health care.\n  As a member of both the Finance and HELP Committees, and the cochair \nof the Senate Rural Health Care Caucus, I am able to participate and \nhave been participating, along with staff, in this complex and very \ndifficult effort. We must reform our health care system into one that \nguarantees meaningful access for all Americans, and guarantees that \npatient-doctor relationship. However, this effort to date has been a \ntale of rhetoric versus that of reality, the promise of cooperation \ncontrasted with the unfortunate but real fact of partisanship, \nsomething I do not like to say.\n  Let me explain. President Obama, who ran as a ``postpartisan'' \ncandidate, has made many overtures to Republicans indicating a desire \nfor this process to be bipartisan. He just met with some members of our \nleadership and obviously the leadership on the other side of the aisle \nas of today.\n  Others in the Senate have declared their goal to be a bill that \nattracts upward of 70 votes. Is that possible? I would hope so. It \ncould be. That would be a tremendous victory for the Senate of the \nUnited States and the American people.\n  But the reality is something very different. Today in the HELP \nCommittee, the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, we have \njust begun the process of walking through a 615-page bill that we are \nscheduled to mark up next Tuesday.\n  This bill does not have one single Republican contribution, as far as \nI can tell. Moreover, it is incomplete, with many details missing. For \nexample, the small detail of how much it will cost. There is no cost \nestimate to this bill of 615 pages, just going through it as of today, \ngoing to try to mark it up next Tuesday.\n  Come on. That is not the way we should be doing business. The Finance \nCommittee has conducted a parallel and I think, quite frankly, a better \nprocess so far, and I wish to thank Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member \nGrassley and their staffs for their efforts. But we still have not seen \na detailed proposal or cost estimate, and we are being pushed to mark \nsomething up in the next few weeks as well.\n  I want everyone to understand why process is important. Health care \nreform is important, to be sure. Getting things done obviously is \nimportant. But so is process. It is not because I do not want health \ncare reform, nor is any Member in this body in a position to say they \ndo not want health care reform. I want every single Kansan, every \nsingle American, to be able to see the doctor of their choice when they \nwant to, especially when they have to.\n  I speak today because this health care reform bill will likely \ninvolve one of the biggest, most important votes that I or any one of \nmy colleagues will cast during the time we are privileged to serve in \nthe Senate of the United States. This health care reform bill will \naffect the lives of every single American. It will reform a system that \ndrives one-sixth of our economy, over 16 million American jobs. It will \nhave consequences for medical science and innovation that improve the \nlives of not only those of us in this great country but all across the \nworld. When people are really sick, they come to the United States.\n  This bill will spend upwards of $2 trillion--$2 trillion--our \nchildren and grandchildren will have to some day repay. If we are going \nto do this, we cannot afford to get it wrong. For this reason, I \ninitiated a letter about a week ago on behalf of all of my Republican \ncolleagues on the Senate Finance Committee and on the HELP Committee. I \nasked the chairmen of those respective committees, the distinguished \nchairman, Senator Dodd, who is now serving in Senator Kennedy's \nabsence, to give this process the time and the careful consideration it \ndeserves. That was the message of the letter: Give us the time and the \nvery careful consideration this vital issue deserves.\n  It seems to me our requests have been extremely reasonable. First, \nplease provide us with your detailed plan with enough time for us to \nread it, to understand it, and get feedback from our constituents back \nhome, the people the bill will affect.\n  We have done this in the Finance Committee. Goodness knows, I do not \nknow how many panels we have had, how many walk-throughs, how many \nslide presentations. Boy, that is tough in the afternoon to turn the \nlights off as Senators and try to pay attention to fact after fact \nafter fact and suggestion after suggestion after suggestion and policy \nobjective after policy objective on each day as we go through the \nlegislative swamp, to try to get this from here.\n  Our requests, again, I think--I want to say it again. First, you \nshould provide us with your detailed plan with enough time for us to \nread it, understand it, get feedback from our constituents back home, \nthe people the bill will affect. The reason I said that twice is that \nevery day we had one of these slide shows, every day we had a\n\n[[Page S6427]]\n\nPowerPoint, every day we got more information, our office would send it \nback to the providers of health care in Kansas, much in the same \nfashion as members of the committee would send to it their people, and \nsay: Hey, is this going to work? These are the people who actually do \nprovide the health care.\n  I know the arguments that say: Well, now, wait a minute. We need to \ncut out fraud, waste, and abuse, and we need to be much more cost \nconscious. We need better practices in regard to better medical \npractices. We need a lot of things to either suggest or to incentivize \nor to maintain what the health care providers do.\n  But in the end result, if that person is sick, they are going to have \nto see a doctor, and they are going to have to see a nurse or some \nhealth care provider. So in the end result, we better at least be doing \nsomething that the providers say, yes, this makes common sense or you \nare going to see either one of two things: You are going to see a \npolitical revolt when they say, no, we are not going to go down that \nroad or else you are going to see a continuation of rationing where \nproviders say: No, I am not going to take part anymore in the Medicare \nProgram, because I am not getting reimbursed up to cost.\n\n  You can have the best government program in the world, you can have \nthe best government card in the world. But if you cannot find a doctor \nwho provides service or a home health care provider who will provide \nservice, or any provider who will provide that service well, where are \nyou?\n  Second, I would like to see provided the cost estimates from the \nCongressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee. Let us know \nhow much all of this is going to cost. That is extremely important. We \nare hearing anything from $1 to $2 trillion.\n  Then, lastly, how will it be paid for? I know we are into an era now \nwhere basically we have the printing presses rolling, and we have an \nEconomic Recovery Act and we have many facets of that, we have the \nstimulus, the omnibus, we had the President's budget and we had TARP, \nand we had four different other acronyms under TARP, and we did not \nworry too much about the pay-fors and who was going to pay for it. We \nlet the printing presses roll, because nobody wanted to see economic \nArmageddon.\n  Could we have done it better? I think so. But that is yesterday's \ndecision. So we should identify how this will be paid for or are we not \ngoing to pay for it. Are we simply going to go ahead--there has been \nsome discussion about some aspects of it that you would not pay for. \nThere are other aspects that we need to go into, because they involve \nprobable tax increases, and now is not the time to be increasing taxes, \nespecially on the small business community, despite the need for health \ncare reform.\n  I think asking for these details is absolutely fair. I think it is \nnecessary under the circumstances. In fact, I would be ignoring my \nresponsibilities to my constituents in Kansas if I did not demand these \nconditions be met.\n  Every single Republican member of the Finance Committee and HELP \nCommittee signed the letter. Every single one expressed a desire to \nwork with our colleagues to achieve bipartisan health care reform.\n  That brings me back to today's HELP Committee walk-through of 615 \npages of an incomplete draft, the rushed HELP and Finance markup \nschedule, Tuesday, and then in about a week or two, the arbitrary floor \ndebate deadlines that we hear from leadership. I hope our letter will \nslow this hurried dash to an imaginary finish line. Slow it down. Slow \nit down. I know it is extremely important that we pass good health care \nreform legislation. It is also extremely important to prevent bad \nlegislation from passing and get America saddled with it for about 20 \nor 25 years. I wish at the end of every committee room, if in fact the \nbill gets to committee, the committee of jurisdiction, that we can hold \nappropriate hearings, we would have a sign that says, ``Do no harm.'' \nAnd then right below it perhaps we could put ``whoa,'' until everybody \ncan slow down and read it in regard to process, and cost, and specifics \nof the bill, and trying to work together to get a good product.\n  There is no reason why the Senate should rush through a bill that has \nthis much at stake. So time out. Time out. Time. Slow down. Give us the \ndetails. That is all we are asking for. The people of this great Nation \ndeserve nothing less. Let's get health care reform and let's get it \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Pay-Go\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, there is a disturbing pattern emerging in \nWashington, DC, which I don't think is being lost on the American \npeople. We have seen, since the beginning of this year, with the new \nadministration coming into power, the new Congress taking control of \nthe leadership in both the House and Senate, an enormous amount, an \nunprecedented amount of spending, borrowing, and taxing. To bear that \nout--this information has been used before--if you actually look at the \nnumbers, you have to go back a long ways in American history, go back \nto the foundation of our country, go back to 1789, and you take it up \nto today, 2009, 220 years of American history, the total amount of debt \nthat has been accumulated over that period of time, literally since the \nPresidency of George Washington through the Presidency of George Bush \nwill be equaled in the next 5 years.\n  We will double the amount of Federal debt, public debt in this \ncountry in the next 5 years. We will triple it in 10 years. We are \nborrowing and spending money around here on a spree that literally is \nwithout precedent in American history.\n  It should be of concern to all Americans for the obvious reason. They \nhave a share of that debt. In fact, according to USA Today, if you just \ntake the amount of debt that has been accumulated since the beginning \nof this year, with the passage of the stimulus bill, with the new \nappropriations bill that passed, an 8.3-percent increase over the \nprevious year, which was twice the rate of inflation, and all the other \nspending that is going on with the various bailout programs and \nwhatnot, the average family's share of the debt this year alone is \n$55,000. The average family's share of the Federal debt is $55,000 per \nfamily in debt accumulated just since the beginning of this calendar \nyear.\n  The amount of borrowing is without precedent. The amount of spending \nthat is being done is without precedent. All under the guise of this is \nan emergency, and we have to react this way. But I think as more of \nthis spending and more of this debt accumulates, the American people \nhave become more convinced that the spending isn't solving the problem \nit was supposed to solve, which was we were going to create jobs, get \nthe economy growing and expanding again. We haven't seen any of those \neffects.\n  What we have seen, of course, is more debt, more interest, and a bill \nthat we will hand to future generations that is not fair to them \nbecause we should not be penalizing future generations and pushing them \nbecause we haven't been able to live within our means.\n  The most recent response to that by the administration was yesterday. \nThey came out and announced they are going to implement pay-go. So we \nare going to have pay-go regulations or pay-go policies now in place \nwith respect to the Federal budget and the way we operate in Congress. \nIncidentally, even when pay-go was in effect, it was not very effective \nbecause much of the budget, much of the spending that occurs in \nWashington is outside the realm or outside the net of pay-go.\n  In fact, if you look at what pay-go does in terms of its design, it \nexempts all discretionary spending, would allow all current entitlement \nprograms, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, to continue \nto grow on autopilot. It affects only new entitlements or tax cuts that \nmay be created in the future. Pay-go also allows expiring entitlement \nprograms to be extended without offsets but not expiring tax cuts.\n\n[[Page S6428]]\n\n  So it is clearly biased in favor of higher spending and higher taxes. \nIn fact, if it does not apply to discretionary spending and if, in \nfact, it does not in a meaningful way apply to entitlement reform--in \nother words, it simply puts sort of a cap on how much entitlements can \ngrow, but it doesn't get at the fundamental issue that these programs \ncontinue to grow unabated--it is simply one thing: a statutory excuse \nto raise taxes. That is essentially what pay-go is.\n  The new administration came out with the news bulletin yesterday that \nthis is somehow a bold, new step and that they are going to attack and \ntake on this deficit and this debt we have. Of course, what they didn't \ntell us is--sort of the expression we use in my part of the country--it \nis like closing the barn door after the horse is already out of the \nbarn because we have already got all this spending this year that \nwasn't covered by pay-go. The stimulus bill, which was $800 billion in \nnew borrowing, was outside of pay-go. In fact, over the past several \nyears now that the Democrats have been in power in the Congress, they \nhave consistently violated the pay-go standard, about 15 times, to the \ntune of about $882 billion in all this new spending that was done \noutside of pay-go.\n  So now it is like all of a sudden coming to the conclusion and \nrealization that now we are going to get serious about deficits, now we \nare going to get serious about spending, now we are going to somehow \nclamp down on all these new programs that are out there. Somehow, at \nleast rhetorically, subscribing to pay-go as a concept is going to be \nthe solution and the answer to that.\n  I think we all know better than that. As I mentioned, pay-go has been \nroutinely sort of ignored in the past. Even if it were to apply, as I \nmentioned earlier, it does not capture much of the spending that goes \non here in Washington. It is simply nothing more than a statutory \nexcuse to raise taxes.\n  Having said that, I mentioned before much of the spending that has \nalready occurred here in Washington. Yet the big-ticket items are still \nlooming out there on the horizon in the future. By that I mean health \ncare reform, which is a big priority of the administration. We are \nstarting to see more details, get a little bit of a glimpse of what \nthat might entail.\n  We know, for one thing, based upon the statements that have been made \nby the President and by the Democratic leaders in the Congress, they \nwant it to include a government plan, purely and simply. They want a \ngovernment plan, which means one thing; that is, that the government \ntakes over health care in this country. Because you cannot maintain a \nprivate insurance program, you cannot maintain a private-sector \ndelivery system, a market-based health care system in this country if \nyou are going to have a government plan.\n  The government plan is where everybody, according to studies that \nhave been done, eventually would end up going. They would gravitate \nthere. More and more small businesses either would be forced to pay \nfines, if they did not have insurance themselves or offer insurance. \nThe suggestion is--and I think it is a fair one based upon the analysis \nthat has been done by a lot of the independent outside groups--you will \nsee more and more small businesses giving up their health care coverage \nand having their employees move and transition into the government \nplan. The government plan will become the repository for all the \nemployees who are currently covered in employer-provided health care \nplans in this country.\n  So the government component of this will continue to grow, and \neventually you will have a system that very much models or is very \nsimilar to what we see in other places around the world. Some people \ntalk about Canada, some people talk about Europe and all these great \nsystems. But the reality is, a lot of the people in those countries \ncome to the United States. The reason they come here is because we have \nthe highest quality care and because they can get access to it.\n  The one thing that happens when the government runs health care is \nthe government decides what procedures are covered. The government \ndecides what treatments are going to be part of the coverage. The \ngovernment will decide how soon you can get access to those treatments. \nWhat you find in other countries around the world are long lines, long \nwaits, and that is fairly typical of the countries I mentioned.\n  The thing that makes the American system so unique in all the world \nis its dependence upon and its foundation upon a market-based system. \nIt has led to incredible innovation. It has led to incredible research \nand development, new treatments, new therapies, and has provided all \nkinds of opportunities for people of this country to receive health \ncare, and, frankly, as I mentioned before, for people from other \ncountries who come here to get their health care.\n  So why we would want to throw out that part of our health care system \nthat is so good and replace it with a government-run system--which, \nfrankly, again, the government is going to get in the middle of the \ndecision between the consumer of health care or the patient and their \nprovider, the physician, and make those decisions. It seems to me that \nis not a model we want to emulate in the United States.\n  As I said, we have a system that needs reform. We have flaws in the \nway our current system works. But the fact is, it is the very best \nhealth care system in the world, and I think it would be a big mistake \nfor us to go down a path that shifts and moves more and more people \ninto a government-run, government-controlled system, where the \ngovernment decides what procedures are going to be covered and how soon \nyou are going to have access to them.\n  I think it does one thing: It obviously would lead to a rationing of \nhealth care. By that I mean, simply again, that the government would \nhave to try the clamp down on costs, limit the access of people to have \ncertain types of therapies, certain types of treatments, and I think \nyou would find less and less choice available in health care in this \ncountry. That is what I think a government-run system would give you in \nthe end.\n  Most of us on this side have laid out a number of proposals, \nalternatives to a government-run system. Everybody says: Well, come up \nwith a plan of your own. We have a number of them out there. We have a \nCoburn-Burr plan that has been introduced. Senator Gregg from New \nHampshire has a plan that has been introduced. There is a Bennett-Wyden \nbill, which is a bipartisan bill, that has been introduced out there. \nBut there are a number of alternatives that have been put forward by \nRepublicans.\n  To date, we have only seen little sort of generalities about the \nDemocrat plan. All we simply know is they are going to insist upon a \ngovernment-run component to that. Again, it simply is nothing more and \nnothing less than a government takeover of health care, which is going \nto lead to all kinds of outcomes that I do not think most people in \nthis country are prepared for and, frankly, if they had the \nopportunity, would not support.\n  But they have entrusted us with the responsibility to look for ways \nto make health care more affordable in this country. There are lots of \ngood suggestions which, as I said before, Republicans are putting \nforward. But it is going to be very difficult if the bright red line \nthat is put forward by the Democrats in the Senate and in the House of \nRepresentatives is a government-run program, a government-run plan or \nelse. I certainly am not going to subscribe to that sort of a solution \nfor America's health care system. Nor do I think it is going to be in \nthe best interests of patients and consumers around this country or \nproviders, for that matter, to do that.\n  So health care debate is one debate that is out there. The reason I \nraised that issue is because it ties back into my point earlier that \nthe amount of spending and borrowing and taxing that is going on here \nis--if you look back at what has already been done, it is enormous, it \nis enormous by any comparative standard in American history. But the \nbig-ticket items are still out there because the health care plan, as \nwe understand it--again, it has only been conceptual. We have not seen \nthe details emerge from any of the Democrats' ideas. They are starting \nto roll more of it out. But one thing is clear: It is going to have a \nhuge price tag. We are talking about anywhere from $1 trillion to $1.5 \ntrillion to $2 trillion. Of course, if they are going to adhere to the \nnewly announced pay-go standard, that means this new entitlement \nprogram has to be paid for.\n\n[[Page S6429]]\n\n  So where does that $1.5 trillion or $2 trillion come from? Well, \nobviously, it is going to come from some revenues raised from some part \nof our economy. That means a lot of hard-working Americans are going to \nsee their taxes go up to finance this new government takeover of health \ncare, which is going to give them fewer options, and get in the way of \nthe patient-doctor relationship and cost them a lot more in the form of \nhigher taxes.\n  I think even though much of the spending I have already referred to \nis in our rearview mirror--all that is left is to pay the bill for \nthat. We still have to pay the bill. We are borrowing, which means \nsomebody is going to pay the bill. We are going to hand off the bill to \nthe next generation of Americans because, obviously, when you borrow $1 \ntrillion, someday it has to be paid back. In the meantime, when you \ncontinue to rack up that kind of borrowing and when you continue to do \nall the other things we are doing in our economy in terms of \ninterventions, whether it is with regard to financial institutions or \nauto manufacturers--you can kind of go down the list--insurance \ncompanies now that the government actually has an ownership interest in \nthat--we are acquiring enormous amounts of exposure and debt for the \ntaxpayers of this country.\n\n  The health care plan is going to be another $1.5 trillion or $2 \ntrillion on top of that. When you borrow that amount of money, you do \nhave to pay it back. By the way, I should mention, too, the interest on \nthe amount of debt we are going to rack up in the next 10 years alone \nis about $5 trillion. Think about that. That is just to pay the finance \ncharge on the debt we have in this country. Think about the enormous \nburden that places on the American taxpayers and the American economy.\n  What generally happens in a case such as that is, when you borrow \nthat much money, there is a lot more pressure out there, and the people \nwho are buying that debt are, at some point, going to start demanding a \nhigher interest rate. When interest rates go up, with the higher return \non their investment, generally inflation follows with it. So you have \nall kinds of economic problems that are created by the level of \nborrowing we have already incurred. And we are going to add a new \nhealth care entitlement on top of that. It literally is breathtaking \nthe amount of intervention we are seeing in the private marketplace \ntoday.\n  I talked about some of the spending and some of the borrowing that \nhas been done. But in the taxes that are going to be associated with \nhealth care--and I could go down a list. There is a three-page list of \nthe various, what we call pay-fors or ways of raising revenue to help \nfinance health care. But there is also another big tax looming on the \nhorizon, and that is the carbon tax, what we call the national sales \ntax on energy. If this climate change bill, which is currently moving \nthrough the House of Representatives, reaches the Senate, and if it \ndoes, in fact, pass the Congress this year, that, too, will entail an \nincredible amount of taxation, because there is no way in this country \nyou can attach, essentially, a cost to carbon per ton and force \ncompanies that emit to buy the credits that would be associated with \nthat without them passing it on. They are going to pass it on. \nEverybody admits that. The President has admitted that. The leadership \non the other side has admitted that. All the utility companies in the \ncountry will tell you that.\n  A carbon tax, a national sales tax on energy, would hit places such \nas where I am from in the Midwest the hardest because we are, by and \nlarge, proportionately more dependent upon coal-fired power than are \nmany other areas in the country. We have a sparse population, which \nmeans we have a ``higher carbon footprint,'' which means people in the \nMidwest, in States such as mine, are going to pay way more for energy \nunder any kind of a climate change bill or what we call a cap-and-trade \nbill or cap-and-tax bill.\n  However you want to refer to it, there is no way of getting around \nthe fact that it is going to cost an enormous amount every single year \nfor families in this country, for businesses in this country, for \nindustrial users, for school districts. I have seen the statistics from \nschool districts in my State, from commercial users, from residential \nusers about what those costs are going to be. They are stunning.\n  So that is another tax that is still out there. Add that to the \nhealth care tax that will come with whatever health care bill is passed \nthrough here, and the amount of taxation is going to start to rival the \namount of spending and borrowing that is going on in Washington.\n  But it brings me to my final point, and that is what I am concerned \nabout and what I am starting to hear more and more from people in my \nState of South Dakota--in many cases unsolicited--who come up to me and \nraise this issue of the amount of government ownership of our private \neconomy. We are seeing, again, unprecedented levels. If there is one \nbedrock principle in American history, it is the adherence to the \nideals of private enterprise.\n  In recent months, however, the United States has substantially \ndeviated from this historical pattern, and the Federal Government now \nowns substantial shares of major U.S. corporations. We own--the \ntaxpayers; I mean you and I and all of us here--we are now shareholders \nin a lot of major U.S. corporations. The taxpayers--the Federal \nGovernment--own 79 percent of AIG, 75 percent of General Motors, 10 \npercent of Chrysler, 36 percent of Citibank, 80 percent of Freddie Mac \nand Fannie Mae. And it goes on and on and on.\n  So we have all this spending, borrowing and taxing and now, on top of \nthat, increasing the amount of government ownership of America's \nprivate economy. If there is one thing Americans are clear on, it is \nthat the government should not be taking over bigger and bigger shares \nof the American economy.\n  There was a survey recently by Rasmussen that said 75 percent of \nAmericans agree the Federal Government should not take over the U.S. \nbanking system. That was a poll done in February. More recently, 60 \npercent say that the bailout loans given to GM and Chrysler were a bad \nidea. That was an April 21 poll. A new poll, done on May 31, just \nrecently, shows that 67 percent of Americans are opposed to providing \nGeneral Motors with $50 billion and giving the government a 70-percent \nownership interest in GM. Mr. President, 56 percent of voters said it \nwould be better to let GM go out of business. None of us want to see \nthat. But I think none of us, at least most Americans do not want to \nsee the government owning more and more of American companies. The \nFederal Government is inevitably going to use that ownership stake to \npush its own agenda.\n\n  In a moment of extreme candor, former Labor Secretary Robert Reich \ndeclared that if the government is an active shareholder, they should \n``push management to take actions that are not necessarily geared \ntoward higher shareholder return.''\n  Think about that statement. The government owns more and more of \nAmerican businesses. They should ``push management to take actions that \nare not necessarily geared toward higher shareholder return.'' In other \nwords, the government should use its newly acquired power in formerly \nprivate companies to further its own agenda.\n  Both the political process and the free markets are going to be \ndistorted if that happens. In fact, in the New Republic, Noam Scheiber \nrecently wrote that ``government ownership invariably politicizes \nmanagement decisions which could be a fiasco.'' The article notes that \na coalition of unions is lobbying against providing bailout dollars to \nPrincipal Financial Group because of its opposition to ``card check.'' \nYou find more and more of these pressures on now because the government \nhas a bigger and bigger stake in the government dictating day-to-day \nmanagement decisions in American business. That is not a path I would \nargue we want to go down.\n  The Economist commented on the government-forced Chrysler bankruptcy:\n\n       In its haste it has vilified creditors and ridden roughshod \n     over their legitimate claims over the carmaker's assets. At a \n     time when many businesses must raise new borrowing to \n     survive, that is a big mistake. . . . The Treasury has also \n     put a gun to the heads of GM's lenders.\n\n  In a recent Bloomberg article, Bradley Keoun warns of some of the \nproblems that Citigroup--and other banks\n\n[[Page S6430]]\n\nincur in accepting bailout money--may encounter as a result of the \npartial government ownership. Among them he cites government pressure \nfor stricter compensation rules, directives to focus on ``State-\napproved social objectives,'' instead of increasing earnings, scrutiny \nof advising or being forced to ``exit risk-taking businesses that are \nprofitable competitors.''\n  I think there is plenty of thought out there from people who \nunderstand the economy and the importance of the private market, its \ntradition, its contribution to the success of the American economy, and \nthe prosperity we enjoy today, as well as lots of anecdotal and other \nevidence that when the government gets into these particular situations \nwhere it is trying to influence the day-to-day decisions of private \nbusiness in this country, those who are trying to manage our private \nbusinesses in this country, leads to all kinds of fiascos and disaster.\n  I would mention one other point and that is, according to Bloomberg, \nafter demands from lawmakers, Citigroup consented to support cramdown \nlegislation, even though this policy was opposed by others in the \nbanking industry.\n  It is pretty clear these types of interventions into the private \nmarketplace, into the free market economy in this country, lead us down \na path that is not good for the American taxpayer, not good for the \nAmerican economy, and that it stifles innovation and entrepreneurship. \nIn fact, I would argue it kills the entrepreneurial spirit in this \ncountry to have government taking bigger and bigger ownership \ninterests, bigger and bigger ownership stakes in the American economy, \nand further dictating the decisions, the day-to-day decisions which \nAmerican businesses make that are designed to grow their companies, to \nget a better return for their shareholders, to become more profitable, \nto make America more prosperous, to raise our standard of living, and \nto deliver more benefits to their employees--all these things that have \ndriven this economy and made it the envy of the world. I don't think we \nwant to go down a path or stay down a path that gets us deeper and \ndeeper into ownership of the private economy.\n  I am going to be introducing and filing a piece of legislation \ntomorrow which addresses this issue and which provides an exit strategy \nfor the Federal Government and for the taxpayers to begin to get out of \nall these ownership interests they have in the American economy, and I \nwill have the opportunity on the floor to talk more about that at a \nlater time. But this afternoon, I wished to touch on these issues as we \nbegin the debate which has sort of captured this city and the Congress \nand the administration and I think very soon will engage the American \npublic over health care reform and the trillions of dollars of new \ntaxes and revenues that are going to be necessary to finance the \nproposal the new administration has for health care reform and how that \ntakes us even further down the path of government intervention and a \nlevel of nationalization of our private economy--in this case health \ncare--and that pattern that just seems to be continuing and which I \nthink more and more Americans are reacting to and more and more \nAmericans, I believe, are going to become engaged in.\n  Members of Congress on both sides are going to be hearing from their \nconstituents about what they perceive to be a real threat to the long-\nterm viability, the long-term prosperity, and the long-term protection \nof the taxpayers' interests.\n  I hope they will become more engaged. I certainly hope we will be \nable to defeat proposals that come before the Senate that call for \ngreater governmental ownership, greater governmental intervention, \ngreater expansion of governmental powers in Washington that will limit \nthe choices of Americans, limit their access to health care \nopportunities, health care therapies, health care treatments that all \ntoo often are lost, I believe, in a system where the government rations \ncare.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded,\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         McChrystal Nomination\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in my office a few minutes ago, I received a \ncall from Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. I \nwrote down what he asked and what he said. He said: Senator, there is a \nsense of urgency that General McChrystal be able to go to Afghanistan \ntonight.\n  There is no commander in Afghanistan.\n  Admiral Mullen said--and I wrote it down: Admiral McChrystal is \nliterally waiting by an airplane. It is 2 o'clock in the morning \nThursday in Afghanistan. Dawn will soon be breaking and our troops will \nnot have a commander there.\n  Is this what the minority wants? Why can't they come and approve this \nman to go defend us in Afghanistan? I am without words to try to \nexplain my consternation at the fact that General McChrystal, one of \nour most eminent, prominent, outstanding, qualified soldiers, a man \nwhose father won five Silver Stars, a man whose record is one of being \nthe leading person in our military to do counterinsurgency--that is \nwhat he is an expert in doing.\n  Let's get the man approved tonight so he can leave in an airplane and \nget over there and take care of his men and women.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Guantanamo\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, it wasn't that long ago that the Senate \nvoted almost unanimously to oppose bringing any terrorists at \nGuantanamo to the United States. But earlier this week, the \nadministration ignored the will of the American people as expressed \nthrough that Senate vote by transferring a Guantanamo detainee named \nAhmed Ghailani to New York. The purpose of the transfer is to try \nGhailani in a U.S. civilian court for his role in the African embassy \nbombings of 1998. The administration's decision raises a number of \nserious questions.\n  First, Ghailani has already admitted that he attended a terrorist \ntraining camp in Afghanistan and assisted those who planned and carried \nout the embassy attack, but says he did so unintentionally. In a U.S. \ncivilian court, if you're found not guilty, you're allowed to go free. \nSo if we are going to treat this terrorist detainee as a common \ncivilian criminal, what will happen to Ghailani if he's found not \nguilty? And what will happen to other detainees the administration \nwants to try in civilian courts if they are found not guilty? Will they \nbe released? If so, where? In New York? In American communities? Or \nwill they be released overseas, where they could return to terror and \ntarget American soldiers or innocent civilians?\n  Second, if Ghailani isn't allowed to go free, will he be detained by \nthe government? If so, where will he be detained? Would the \nadministration detain him on U.S. soil, despite the objections of \nCongress and the American people?\n  Third, why does the administration think a civilian court is the \nappropriate place to try Ghailani? Congress enacted the military \ncommissions process on a bipartisan basis as a way to bring terrorists \nto justice without disclosing information that could harm national \nsecurity. Some have complained that the previous administration moved \ntoo slowly on military commissions, but a lot of that delay was due to \nthe constant legal challenges that were leveled against the process, \nincluding by some in the current administration. In fact, Ghailani's \ncase was already being handled by the military commissions process--to \nthe point that a judge had established a trial schedule for him. I ask \nunanimous consent that the trial schedule be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6431]]\n\n  United States of America v Ahmed Khalfan Ghailani (a/k/a ``Fupi'', \n       ``Haytham'', ``Abubakar Khaflan Ahmed'', ``Sharif Omar'')\n\n                   Schedule for Trial, Amendment One\n\n                             4 March, 2009\n\n       1.

MacKenzie,\n                                    CAPT, JAGC, USN Military Judge\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. This schedule would be well underway if the \nadministration had not suspended all military commission proceedings \nseveral months ago. Now we will have to start the process for Ghailani \nover again in civilian court.\n  The administration made the right decision by reconsidering its \nposition on military commissions and deciding to resume their use. So \nwhy did the administration decide to stop the military commission \nproceedings against Ghailani that were being conducted in the modern, \nsafe, and secure courtroom at Guantanamo and move him to the U.S. to \ntry him in civilian court? Is it because the Administration doesn't \nthink that by deliberately targeting innocent American civilians \nGhailani violated the law of war? Does it think he should be treated as \njust another domestic civilian defendant?\n  Fourth, how will the administration ensure that trying Ghailani in a \nU.S. court doesn't damage our national security? As we've seen in the \npast, trying terrorists in the U.S. has made it harder for our national \nsecurity professionals to protect the American people.\n  During a previous trial of suspects in the African embassy bombings, \nevidence showed that the National Security Agency had intercepted cell \nphone conservations between terrorists. According to press reports, \nthis revelation caused terrorists to stop using cell phones to discuss \nsensitive operational details.\n  And during the trial of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center attack, testimony given in a public courtroom tipped \noff terrorists that the U.S. was monitoring their communications. As a \nresult, these terrorists shut down that communications link and any \nfurther intelligence we might have obtained was lost.\n  On the question of Guantanamo, it became increasingly clear over time \nthat the administration announced its plan to close the facility before \nit actually had a plan. If the administration has a plan for holding \nGhailani if he is found not guilty, then it needs to share that plan \nwith the Congress. These kinds of questions are not insignificant. They \ninvolve the safety of the American people. And that is precisely why \nCongress demanded a plan before the administration started to move \nterrorists from Guantanamo. The American people don't want these \nterrorists in their communities or back on the battlefield. But that is \nexactly where Ghailani could end up if he is found not guilty in a \ncivilian court. Before it transfers any more detainees from Guantanamo, \nthe administration needs to present a plan that ensures its actions \nwon't jeopardize the safety of the American people.\n  Finally, earlier today, the Senate majority whip came to the floor \nand claimed there is evidence that al-Qaida may be recruiting \nterrorists within Guantanamo. I am glad to see that the majority whip \nappears to be acknowledging the FBI Director's concerns that Guantanamo \nterrorists could radicalize the prison population if they were \ntransferred into the United States. The fact that these terrorists \nmight be able to recruit new members and conduct terrorist activities \nfrom behind bars is an important one. I also find it preposterous that \nthe majority whip would assert that because I and others--including, by \nthe way, members of his own conference--want to keep dangerous \nterrorist detainees away from American communities, we will enable \nterrorists to escape justice. Keeping these terrorists locked up at \nGuantanamo, and trying them using the military commissions process, is \nthe best way to deliver justice while protecting the American people.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n\n[[Page S6432]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I have yielded the floor. The Senator can feel free to \nmake a statement.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I want to make my comments about the \nminority leader's statement on the floor while he is still here. If he \nis willing to stay, we can engage in a dialog on this issue. I think it \nis time we do come to the floor together, along with the Republican \nwhip, and at least make it clear what our positions are on some of \nthese issues related to Guantanamo because it has been a matter of \nconcern and a lot of comment on the floor of the Senate over the last \nseveral weeks.\n  I was going to ask the Senator from Kentucky, the minority leader, \nwhether I understood him correctly when he said he believed that this \nindividual, Ahmed Ghailani, if found not guilty in a court in the \nUnited States, would be released in the United States to stay here in a \nlegal status. I wish to ask the Senator, if that is what he said, what \nis the basis for that statement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I can only repeat what the President's \nspokesman himself said. I am responding to the question propounded to \nme by the Senator from Illinois. It is my understanding the President's \nspokesman yesterday refused to say what would happen to Ghailani if he \nwere found not guilty. So there is some confusion about that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. There is no confusion. This is such a leap to argue that \nif this man, who is not a resident of the United States--if I am not \nmistaken, he is Tanzanian--that somehow if he is found not guilty in \nthe courts of the United States, he is qualified to be released into \nour population. That is a statement--I don't know anyone could draw \nthat conclusion. He would have no legal status to stay in the United \nStates unless we gave him one.\n  By what basis does the Senator from Kentucky suggest that this man, \nwho may have been involved in the killing of 12 Americans among 224 \nother people, is going to be released by President Obama into our \ncommunities and neighborhoods?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Is the Senator asking me a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me say I am only quoting the President's \nspokesman. He says he doesn't know what would happen if Ghailani is \nreleased.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Illinois, let's assume that he is sent \nback to the country from which he came. I ask, in what way is America \nsafer if this terrorist subsequently, under this hypothetical release \nin the United States, goes back to his native country from which he \npotentially could launch another attack on the United States?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response, my colleague from Kentucky is gifted \nat the political craft. He has decided not to answer my question but to \nask a question of me.\n  I say first that his assertion that this man, Ahmed Ghailani, if \nfound not guilty would be released in the communities and neighborhoods \nof America cannot be sustained in law or in fact. He made that \nstatement on the floor. That is the kind of statement that has been \nmade about these Guantanamo detainees.\n  I don't know what will happen to Mr. Ghailani if he is found not \nguilty. It is conceivable that he could be charged with other things. \nIt is conceivable he could face a military tribunal. It is conceivable \nhe may be subject to detention.\n  I will say this with certainty. President Obama will not allow \ndangerous terrorists to be released in the United States in our \ncommunities and neighborhoods. I hope everyone on both sides of the \naisle would agree with that.\n  I also wish to ask, if the Senator from Kentucky is critical of \nPresident Obama for announcing that he was going to close Guantanamo \nbefore he had a plan, why didn't we hear the same complaint when \nPresident George W. Bush announced he was going to close Guantanamo \nbefore he had a plan? Is the difference partisan?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Illinois, he has made this \npoint before, and I answered it before. I will answer it again.\n  I was against it when President Bush was in favor of it. I have been \nconsistently against closing Guantanamo all along the way, no matter \nwho the President was. At least you could say this about President \nBush: He didn't put a date on it before he had an idea what he was \ngoing to do with them. And that is the core issue here.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The core issue is for 7 long years, the Bush \nadministration failed to convict the terrorists who planned the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks--for 7 years. And for 7 long years, only three \nindividuals were convicted by military commissions at Guantanamo, and \ntwo of them have been released. So to argue that the Guantanamo model \nis one that ought to be protected and maintained, notwithstanding all \nof the danger it creates for our servicemen overseas to keep Guantanamo \nopen, is to argue for a plan under the Bush administration that failed \nto convict terrorists, failed with military tribunals and through the \ncourts of this land.\n  I have to say that as I listen to the argument of the Senator from \nKentucky, it is an argument based on fear--fear--fear that if we try \nsomeone in a court in America, while they are incarcerated during \ntrial, we need to be afraid. There was no fear in New York for more \nthan 2 years while Ramzi Yousef was held in preparation for trial and \nduring trial because he was held in a secure facility.\n  Today we are told by the Department of Justice that there are 355 \nconvicted terrorists in American prisons. I ask the Senator from \nKentucky, does he believe we should remove them from our prisons, those \nalready convicted, currently serving, such as Ramzi Yousef?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Illinois, maybe we found an \narea of agreement. He is critical of the Bush administration for not \nconducting military tribunals more rapidly. I agree with him. I think \nthey should have been tried more rapidly. But that\n\n[[Page S6433]]\n\nis the place to try them, right down there in Guantanamo.\n  If my friend is suggesting it is a good idea to bring these \nterrorists into the United States and, if convicted, put them in U.S. \nfacilities, the supermax facility has basically no room. There may be \none bed. As far as I know, there is no room at supermax.\n  Not only do we have, if we bring them into the United States--I don't \nknow why I am smiling. This is not a laughing matter. Say what you will \nabout the previous administration, but we were not attacked again after \n9/11.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, will--\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I don't have the floor, I say to my friend from \nArizona. Maybe he can get the Senator from Illinois to yield for a \nquestion as well.\n  I don't think we want to complain about the fact we haven't been \nattacked again since 9/11, I say to my friend from Illinois. Containing \nterrorists at Guantanamo, going after terrorists in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, clearly something worked. And to argue we would somehow be \nmade more safe in this country by closing down Guantanamo I find \nborders almost on the absurd.\n  Mr. DURBIN. With all due respect, the Senator failed to answer my \nquestion. I asked him this question: If it is a danger to America that \nif we put a convicted terrorist in our country, if that creates a \ndanger, as he said repeatedly, in our communities and neighborhoods \nnear this prison or in other places, then I asked the Senator from \nKentucky, What would you do with the 355 convicted terrorists currently \nin prison, and the Senator didn't answer. He said: We haven't been \nattacked since 9/11. That is unresponsive.\n  We know there are facilities where these convicted terrorists can be \nheld safely and securely. Marion Federal Penitentiary in my home State \nhas 33 convicted terrorists. I just spent a week down there, not far \nfrom the Senator's home State. There was not fear among the people \nliving in that area because 33 terrorists are being held at Marion. You \nknow why? Because our corrections officers there are the best.\n  I went in to see them, and I sat down with them. They are concerned, \nangry, even insulted at the suggestion that they cannot safely hold \ndangerous people. One of the guards said to me: We held John Gotti. He \nwas convicted of being involved in gangland activity. We are holding \nterrorists from Colombia in drug gangs. We are holding them safely. We \nare holding serial murderers safely. We know how to do this, Senator. \nAnd if your colleagues in the Senate don't believe it, have them come \nand visit Marion Federal Penitentiary.\n\n  They are doing their job and doing it well. To come to the floor of \nthe Senate repeatedly and to suggest we are in danger as a nation \nbecause convicted terrorists are being held in our prisons I don't \nthink adequately reflects the reality of what we have today.\n  Let me also say, I respect the Senator from Kentucky for saying he \nhas always been in favor of keeping Guantanamo open. I respect him for \nbeing consistent in his viewpoint. I disagree with that viewpoint. \nAmong those who also disagree with his viewpoint is GEN Colin Powell, \nthe former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary \nof State under President Bush. He believes it should be closed. General \nPetraeus, someone I know the Senator from Kentucky has praised on the \nfloor of the Senate, believes Guantanamo should be closed. They are not \nalone. Robert Gates, Secretary of Defense under President Bush and now \nunder President Obama, believes it should be closed. Senator McCain on \nyour side of the aisle stated publicly that Guantanamo should be \nclosed. Senator Lindsey Graham, on your side of the aisle, has stated \npublicly it should be closed. Former Secretaries of State have made the \nsame statements.\n  He is entitled to his point of view. I respect him for holding that \npoint of view even if he doesn't have the support from the security and \nmilitary leaders I mentioned. But to come to the floor and repeatedly \nsay to the American people that we are in danger because we are trying \nterrorists in the courts of America I think goes too far.\n  I think the President has done the right thing. I think this man \nAhmed Ghailani should stand trial. If 12 innocent Americans died, and \nthey did, among 224 people, this man should be on trial, and I think \nthe President was right to bring him to the court for trial. To suggest \nthat he shouldn't be, that he should be put in a military tribunal \nwhich has had a record, incidentally, over the last 7 years--military \ncommissions at Guantanamo, in 7 years tried three individuals and two \nhave been released--it doesn't tell me that it is a good batting record \nwhen it comes to dealing with war criminals.\n  I trust the courts of our land, the same courts that convicted Ramzi \nYousef. I trust those courts to give Ghailani a fair trial under \nAmerican law. I trust at the end of the day that a jury, if it is a \njury, will reach its decision.\n  I can tell you this for certain. The suggestion by the minority \nleader that at some point after this trial Ghailani is going to be \nturned loose in the communities and neighborhoods of America, I don't \nunderstand where that is coming from. That is the kind of statement \nthat I think goes to the extreme. I wish my colleague would reflect on \nthat. We are not going to turn loose this man who is not a resident of \nthe United States, not a citizen of the United States if he is found \nnot guilty. The President would never allow it. Our judicial system \nwould never allow it.\n  Do you think the Department of Homeland Security is going to clear \nthis man to move to Louisville, KY, if he is found not guilty, or \nSpringfield, IL? I don't think so. In fact, I think it is beyond the \nrealm of possibility.\n  I also want to make it clear that we have before us an important \ndecision to make. Are we going to deal with Guantanamo because it is a \nthreat to the safety of our servicemen or are we going to keep it open \nso that some people who believe in it can have their political bragging \nrights?\n  I would rather side with those who believe closing Guantanamo brings \nsafety to our men and women in uniform. Guantanamo is a recruiting tool \nfor terrorists. That is not my conclusion alone. It is a conclusion \nthat has been reached by many, as I look back and see those who have \nsaid it. For example, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mike \nMullen:\n\n       The concern I've had about Guantanamo . . . is it has been \n     a recruiting symbol for those extremists and jihadists who \n     would fight us. . . . That's the heart of the concern for \n     Guantanamo's continued existence. . . .\n\n  Same statement from General Petraeus, same statement from Defense \nSecretary Gates, same statement from RADM Mark Buzby and others. We \nhave a situation with Guantanamo where it is not making us safer. The \nPresident has made the right decision, hard decision to deal with the \n240 detainees he inherited. I think we should do this in a calm, \nrational, and not fearful way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me say Senator McCain and Senator \nGraham can speak for themselves, but neither of them has ever been in \nfavor of closing Guantanamo without a plan to do something. They want \nto see what the plan is to deal with these terrorists. Beyond that, \nthey can speak for themselves. But they are not in favor of closing \nGuantanamo without a plan.\n  With regard to the suggestion that we should bring these prisoners to \nthe United States and try them, my good friend from Illinois has \nsuggested there is no down side to that. Why not do it? We could. But \nthe question is, Should we? We should not because we passed the \nmilitary commissions for the purpose of trying these very detainees. \nThere are courtrooms and a $200 million state-of-the-art facility at \nGuantanamo to both incarcerate them and to try them. We know no one has \never escaped there, and we know we haven't been attacked again since 9/\n11.\n  But let's assume we did bring them up here for trial. My good friend \nhas suggested no harm done. During the Ramzi Yousef trial, he tipped \noff terrorists to a communications link. During the Zacarias Moussaoui \ntrial, there was inadvertently leaked sensitive material. The east \nAfrica Embassy bombing trials aided Osama bin Laden. The blind Sheikh \nAbdel-Rahman trial provided intel to Osama bin Laden. When you have \nthese kinds of trials in a regular American criminal setting, there are \ndown sides to it.\n  In terms of community disruption, I would cite the mayor of \nAlexandria, VA, right across the river. Ask him\n\n[[Page S6434]]\n\nhow he felt about the impact of the Moussaoui trial on their community.\n  So I think the suggestion that somehow it is a good solution to bring \nthese terrorists to the United States and to mainstream them into the \nU.S. criminal justice system is simply misplaced. If they are \nconvicted, we don't have a good place for them. Everybody cited the \nsupermax facility. Well, there is no room there. It is quite full. We \nhave the perfect place for these detainees, for them to be detained and \nto be tried and ultimate decisions made.\n  I share the view of the Senator from Illinois that the previous \nadministration did not engage in those military tribunals as rapidly as \nwe all would like. They had a lot of disruptions from lawsuits and \nother things, and I expect they would argue that slowed them down. But \nI think they are in the right place--the right place to be incarcerated \nand the right place to have their cases disposed of.\n\n  Mr. President, my friend from Arizona is here and wants to address \nthis, or another issue, and so I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will speak briefly, then yield to the \nSenator from Arizona. I will be happy, if he wants to ask a question or \nmaintain a dialogue, but I will make this very brief.\n  I have confidence in the courts of America. If I had to pick one \nplace on Earth to have a trial and to be assured it would be a fair \ntrial with a fair outcome, it would be right here in the United States \nof America. Maybe I have gone too far. Maybe I am showing my \npatriotism, or whatever it is, but I believe that.\n  If you said to me: We captured a terrorist somewhere in the world, \nwhere would you like to have them tried? It would be right here because \nI believe in our system of justice. I believe in the integrity of our \njudiciary. I believe in our Department of Justice prosecutors. I \nbelieve in our defense system, our jury system. I believe we have the \ncapacity and the resources to try someone fairly better than anyplace \nin the world.\n  The Senator from Kentucky may not agree with that conclusion. He \nobviously thinks there is too much danger to have a trial of a \nterrorist in the United States. How then does he explain 355 convicted \nterrorists now sitting in American prisons, tried in our courts, sent \nto our prisons, safely incarcerated for years? That is proof positive \nthis system works.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, is afraid. He is \nnot only afraid of terrorism--and we all should be because we suffered \ngrievously on 9/11--but he is afraid our Constitution is not strong \nenough to deal with that threat. He is afraid the guarantees and rights \nunder our Constitution may go too far when it comes to keeping America \nsafe. He is afraid of using our court system for fear it will make us \nless safe, that it would be dangerous. He is afraid the values we have \nstood for and the Geneva Conventions and other agreements over the \nyears may not be applicable to this situation.\n  I disagree. I have faith in this country, in its Constitution, its \nlaws, and the people who are sworn to uphold them at every level. I \nbelieve Mr. Ghailani will get a fairer trial in the United States than \nanyplace on Earth, and that if he is found guilty in being complicit in \nthe killing of over 200 innocent people and innocent Americans, he will \npay the price he should pay, and he will be incarcerated safely.\n  This notion that we have run out of supermax beds and that is the end \nof the story--and the State of Colorado is the home State of the \nPresiding Officer, where the Florence facility is located--I would say \nto the Senator from Kentucky that may be true for the supermax facility \nat the Federal level, but there are many other supermax facilities \nacross America that can safely incarcerate convicted terrorists or \nserial murderers or whomever. We can take care of these people.\n  If there is one thing America knows how to do--and some may question \nwhether we should brag about it--we know how to incarcerate people. We \ndo it more than any other place on Earth, and we do it safely. The \nnotion there is only one place--Guantanamo--where these detainees can \nbe safely held defies logic and human experience.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first of all, I was going to interrupt and \nask a question, but I simply conferred with Senator McConnell--and I \nwill state and the Record can reflect the fact--that I believe Senator \nMcConnell asked the question of where he would be released if he were \nacquitted. I don't believe he asserted that he would be released in the \nUnited States. I just wanted to clear that up. Obviously, we can check \nthe transcript and determine it. I think that was his intent because of \nthe question that Robert Gibbs had posed. At least that is my \nunderstanding of it. We can resolve that.\n  But I would like to say a couple of other things. First of all, it is \nimportant to have this debate. The Senate had a debate some weeks ago, \nand it is true 90 Senators voted against funding a program to close the \nprison at Guantanamo Bay. Six Senators voted in favor of moving forward \nwith that.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Illinois staunchly defending the lonely \nsix, but they represented also a minority of American public opinion, \nwhich has said, by 2 to 1, according to the USA Gallop poll, that it is \nagainst closing the Guantanamo prison, and by 3 to 1 they do not want \nthe prisoners released in the United States.\n  Both sides have engaged in a little bit of rhetoric. For example, I \nwould respectfully request my colleague from Illinois go back over what \nhe said a moment ago and perhaps come back tomorrow and think about \nrephrasing it. I don't think it is fair to characterize the position of \nthe Senator from Kentucky as being fearful of trying people in the \nUnited States; fearful, for example, that terrorists--or afraid of \ngiving terrorists rights and so on. I don't think that is the issue. I \nthink what is the issue is the question of whether, as a general rule, \nit is better to keep prisoners in Guantanamo prison than to put them \nsomewhere else.\n  I, for one, don't fear trying some of these people who are \nappropriately charged and tried in Federal court in the United States. \nBut I would also say it is loaded with problems and headaches, and I \nthink my colleague from Illinois would have to acknowledge that the \ntrials that have occurred here have produced some real problems. These \nare hard cases to try in the United States. You start with the \nproposition that there are huge security concerns.\n  Now, it can be done. There will be huge security concerns with this \nalleged terrorist from Tanzania, and it will cost a lot of money in the \nplace where he is tried. It will pose very difficult questions for the \njudge, for the people within the courtroom, the parties to the case, \nthe lawyers in the case. There are evidentiary questions and other \nquestions that are illustrated by the case of Zacarias Moussaoui, who \nwas tried in Alexandria. I think we can all acknowledge the government \nwould certainly say that was a huge problem for them because it was \ndifficult to use evidence in the case that had been acquired through \nconfidential or classified methods. The case was ping-ponged back and \nforth several times between the District Court and the court of \nappeals. It was a difficult, hard thing to do.\n  Then there are the situations where cases have been tried in American \ncourts and classified information has inadvertently--and in some cases \nnot inadvertently--been released, gotten into the hands of terrorists. \nLet me just cite a few of these, and not to make the case that it is \nimpossible or a terrible idea but also to refute the notion that it is \na piece of cake. It is not. It is really hard. If you could avoid doing \nthis, I think the better practice would be to try to do so. But on an \noccasional basis, when we have a good Federal charge, we have the \nevidence that can back it up, and we think we can get a conviction, \nthere is nothing wrong in those few selected cases with doing it. But \nwe can't say all 240 of the terrorists at Guantanamo qualify for that. \nVery few of them do, as the President said in his remarks.\n  Let me note some of these cases. The famous trial of Ramzi Yousef. \nHere is a statement by Michael Mukasey, the former Attorney General. \nThis is a quotation from the Wall Street Journal, again, during the \ntrial of Ramzi\n\n[[Page S6435]]\n\nYousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing:\n\n       Apparently, an innocuous bit of testimony . . . about \n     delivery of a cell phone battery was enough to tip off \n     terrorists still at large that one of their communication \n     links had been compromised. That link, which in fact had been \n     monitored by the government and had provided enormously \n     invaluable intelligence, was immediately shut down, and \n     further information lost.\n\n  I am not going to read the entire quotations but just some headlines. \nI mentioned the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui. That was a case also in \nwhich sensitive material was inadvertently leaked. Here is the headline \nfrom a CNBC story:\n\n       The Government Went To The Judge And Said, ``Oops, We Gave \n     Moussaoui Some Documents He Shouldn't Have.'' . . . Documents \n     That The Government Says Should Have Been Classified.\n\n  There is a whole story about how that happened. The East Africa \nEmbassy bombing trials, which occurred after 2001, September 26 is the \nStar-Ledger story.\n\n       The cost of disclosing information unwisely became clear \n     after the New York trials of bin Laden associates for the \n     1998 bombings of U.S. embassies in Africa. Some of the \n     evidence indicated that the National Security Agency, the \n     U.S. foreign eavesdropping organization, had intercepted cell \n     phone conversations. Shortly thereafter, bin Laden's \n     organization stopped using cell phones to discuss sensitive \n     operational details, U.S. intelligence sources said.\n\n  There is another story about the same thing, with a headline in the \nNew York Times. There is another quotation about the trial of the blind \nsheik, a story we are all familiar with, of Michael Mukasey, the former \nAttorney General, saying this in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       In the course of prosecuting Omar Abdel Rahman . . . the \n     government was compelled--as in all cases that charge \n     conspiracy--to turn over a list of unindicted coconspirators \n     to the defendants. Within ten days, a copy of that list \n     reached bin Laden in Khartoum.\n\n  There are other cases. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have \nthese articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From FOX NEWS.com, Feb. 11, 2005]\n\n               N.Y. Lawyer Convicted of Aiding Terrorists\n\n                         (By Associated Press)\n\n       New York.--A veteran civil rights lawyer was convicted \n     Thursday of crossing the line by smuggling messages of \n     violence from one of her jailed clients--a radical Egyptian \n     sheik--to his terrorist disciples on the outside.\n       The jury deliberated 13 days over the past month before \n     convicting Lynne Stewart, 65, a firebrand, left-wing activist \n     known for representing radicals and revolutionaries in her 30 \n     years on the New York legal scene.\n       The trial, which began last June, focused attention on the \n     line between zealous advocacy and criminal behavior by a \n     lawyer. Some defense lawyers saw the case as a government \n     warning to attorneys to tread carefully in terrorism cases.\n       Stewart slumped in her chair as the verdict was read, \n     shaking her head and later wiping tears from her eyes.\n       Her supporters gasped upon hearing the conviction, and \n     about two dozen of them followed her out of court, chanting, \n     ``Hands off Lynne Stewart!''\n       She vowed to appeal and blamed the conviction on evidence \n     that included videotape of Usama bin Laden urging support for \n     her client. The defense protested the bin Laden evidence, and \n     the judge warned jurors that the case did not involve the \n     events of Sept. 11.\n       ``When you put Usama bin Laden in a courtroom and ask the \n     jury to ignore it, you're asking a lot,'' she said. ``I know \n     I committed no crime. I know what I did was right.''\n       Lawyers have said Stewart most likely would face a sentence \n     of about 20 years on charges that include conspiracy, \n     providing material support to terrorists, defrauding the \n     government and making false statements.\n       She will remain free on bail but must stay in New York \n     until her July 15 sentencing.\n       The anonymous jury also convicted a U.S. postal worker, \n     Ahmed Abdel Sattar, of plotting to ``kill and kidnap persons \n     in a foreign country'' by publishing an edict urging the \n     killing of Jews and their supporters.\n       A third defendant, Arabic interpreter Mohamed Yousry, was \n     convicted of providing material support to terrorists. Sattar \n     could face life in prison and Yousry up to 20 years.\n       Attorney General Alberto Gonzales called the verdict ``an \n     important step'' in the war on terrorism.\n       ``The convictions handed down by a federal jury in New York \n     today send a clear, unmistakable message that this department \n     will pursue both those who carry out acts of terrorism and \n     those who assist them with their murderous goals,'' Gonzales \n     said.\n       Stewart was the lawyer for Omar Abdel-Rahman, a blind sheik \n     sentenced to life in prison in 1996 for conspiring to \n     assassinate Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and destroy \n     several New York landmarks, including the U.N. building and \n     the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels. Stewart's co-defendants also \n     had close ties to Abdel-Rahman.\n       Prosecutors said Stewart and the others carried messages \n     between the sheik and senior members of an Egyptian-based \n     terrorist organization, helping spread Abdel-Rahman's \n     venomous call to kill those who did not subscribe to his \n     extremist interpretation of Islamic law.\n       Prosecutor Andrew Dember argued that Stewart and her co-\n     defendants essentially ``broke Abdel-Rahman out of jail, made \n     him available to the worst kind of criminal we find in this \n     world--terrorists.''\n       At the time, the sheik was in solitary confinement in \n     Minnesota under special prison rules to keep him from \n     communicating with anyone except his wife and his lawyers.\n       Michael Ratner, president of the Center for Constitutional \n     Rights, said the purpose of the prosecution of Stewart ``was \n     to send a message to lawyers who represent alleged terrorists \n     that it's dangerous to do so.''\n       But Peter Margulies, a law professor at Roger Williams \n     University in Rhode Island who conducted a panel on lawyers \n     and terrorism recently, called the verdict reasonable.\n       ``I think lawyers need to be advocates, but they don't need \n     to be accomplices,'' he said. ``I think the evidence \n     suggested that Lynne Stewart had crossed the line.''\n       Stewart, who once represented Weather Underground radicals \n     and mob turncoat Sammy ``The Bull'' Gravano, repeatedly \n     declared her innocence, maintaining she was unfairly targeted \n     by overzealous prosecutors.\n       But she also testified that she believed violence was \n     sometimes necessary to achieve justice: ``To rid ourselves of \n     the entrenched, voracious type of capitalism that is in this \n     country that perpetuates sexism and racism, I don't think \n     that can come nonviolently.''\n       A major part of the prosecution's case was Stewart's 2000 \n     release of a statement withdrawing the sheik's support for a \n     cease-fire in Egypt by his militant followers.\n       Prosecutors, though, could point to no violence that \n     resulted from the statement.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From nytimes.com, Dec. 20, 2005]\n\n              Bush Account of a Leak's Impact Has Support\n\n                        (By David E. Rosenbaum)\n\n       Washington.--As an example of the damage caused by \n     unauthorized disclosures to reporters, President Bush said at \n     his news conference on Monday that Osama bin Laden had been \n     tipped by a leak that the United States was tracking his \n     location through his telephone. After this information was \n     published, Mr. Bush said, Mr. bin Laden stopped using the \n     phone.\n       The president was apparently referring to an article in The \n     Washington Times in August 1998.\n       Toward the end of a profile of Mr. bin Laden on the day \n     after American cruise missiles struck targets in Afghanistan \n     and Sudan, that newspaper, without identifying a source, \n     reported that ``he keeps in touch with the world via \n     computers and satellite phones.''\n       The article drew little attention at the time in the United \n     States. But last year, the Sept. 11 commission declared in \n     its final report: ``Al Qaeda's senior leadership had stopped \n     using a particular means of communication almost immediately \n     after a leak to The Washington Times. This made it much more \n     difficult for the National Security Agency to intercept his \n     conversations.'' There was a footnote to the newspaper \n     article.\n       Lee H. Hamilton, the vice chairman of the commission, \n     mentioned the consequences of the article in a speech last \n     month. He said: ``Leaks, for instance, can be terribly \n     damaging. In the late 90's, it leaked out in The Washington \n     Times that the U.S. was using Osama bin Laden's satellite \n     phone to track his whereabouts. Bin Laden stopped using that \n     phone; we lost his trail.''\n       In their 2002 book, ``The Age of Sacred Terror'' (Random \n     House), Steven Simon and Daniel Benjamin, who worked at the \n     National Security Council under President Bill Clinton, also \n     mentioned the incident. They wrote, ``When bin Laden stopped \n     using the phone and let his aides do the calling, the United \n     States lost its best chance to find him.''\n       More details about the use of satellite phones by Mr. bin \n     Laden and his lieutenants were revealed by federal \n     prosecutors in the 2001 trial in Federal District Court in \n     Manhattan of four men charged with conspiring to bomb two \n     American embassies in East Africa in 1998.\n       Asked at the outset of his news conference about \n     unauthorized disclosures like the one last week that the \n     National Security Agency had conducted surveillance of \n     American citizens, Mr. Bush declared: ``Let me give you an \n     example about my concerns about letting the enemy know what \n     may or may not be happening. In the late 1990's, our \n     government was following Osama bin Laden because he was using \n     a certain type of telephone. And the fact that we were \n     following Osama bin Laden because he was using a certain type \n     of telephone made it into the press as the result of a leak. \n     And guess what happened? Osama bin Laden changed his \n     behavior. He began to change how he communicated.''\n\n[[Page S6436]]\n\n       Toward the end of the news conference, Mr. Bush referred \n     again to this incident to illustrate the damage caused by \n     leaks.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 22, 2007]\n\n  Jose Padilla Makes Bad Law--Terror Trials Hurt the Nation Even When \n                        They Lead to Convictions\n\n                        (By Michael B. Mukasey)\n\n       The apparently conventional ending to Jose Padilla's trial \n     last week--conviction on charges of conspiring to commit \n     violence abroad and providing material assistance to a \n     terrorist organization--gives only the coldest of comfort to \n     anyone concerned about how our legal system deals with the \n     threat he and his co-conspirators represent. He will be \n     sentenced--likely to a long if not a life-long term of \n     imprisonment. He will appeal. By the time his appeals run out \n     he will have engaged the attention of three federal district \n     courts, three courts of appeal and on at least one occasion \n     the Supreme Court of the United States.\n       It may be claimed that Padilla's odyssey is a triumph for \n     due process and the rule of law in wartime. Instead, when it \n     is examined closely, this case shows why current institutions \n     and statutes are not well suited to even the limited task of \n     supplementing what became, after Sept. 11, 2001, principally \n     a military effort to combat Islamic terrorism.\n       Padilla's current journey through the legal system began on \n     May 8, 2002, when a federal district court in New York \n     issued, and FBI agents in Chicago executed, a warrant to \n     arrest him when he landed at O'Hare Airport after a trip that \n     started in Pakistan. His prior history included a murder \n     charge in Chicago before his 18th birthday, and a firearms \n     possession offense in Florida shortly after his release on \n     the murder charge.\n       Padilla then journeyed to Egypt, where, as a convert to \n     Islam, he took the name Abdullah al Muhajir, and traveled to \n     Saudi Arabia, Afghanistan and Pakistan. He eventually came to \n     the attention of Abu Zubaydeh, a lieutenant of Osama bin \n     Laden. The information underlying the warrant issued for \n     Padilla indicated that he had returned to America to explore \n     the possibility of locating radioactive material that could \n     be dispersed with a conventional explosive--a device known as \n     a dirty bomb.\n       However, Padilla was not detained on a criminal charge. \n     Rather, he was arrested on a material witness warrant, issued \n     under a statute (more than a century old) that authorizes the \n     arrest of someone who has information likely to be of \n     interest to a grand jury investigating crime, but whose \n     presence to testify cannot be assured. A federal grand jury \n     in New York was then investigating the activities of al \n     Qaeda.\n       The statute was used frequently after 9/11, when the \n     government tried to investigate numerous leads and people to \n     determine whether follow-on attacks were planned--but found \n     itself without a statute that authorized investigative \n     detention on reasonable suspicion, of the sort available to \n     authorities in Britain and France, among other countries. And \n     so, the U.S. government subpoenaed and arrested on a material \n     witness warrant those like Padilla who seemed likely to have \n     information.\n       Next the government took one of several courses: it \n     released the person whose detention appeared on a second look \n     to have been a mistake; or obtained the information he was \n     thought to have, and his cooperation, and released him; or \n     placed him before a grand jury with a grant of immunity under \n     a compulsion to testify truthfully and, if he testified \n     falsely, charge him with perjury; or developed independent \n     evidence of criminality sufficiently reliable and admissible \n     to warrant charging him.\n       Each individual so arrested was brought immediately before \n     a federal judge where he was assigned counsel, had a bail \n     hearing, and was permitted to challenge the basis for his \n     detention, just as a criminal defendant would be.\n       The material witness statute has its perils. Because the \n     law does not authorize investigative detention, the \n     government had only a limited time in which to let Padilla \n     testify, prosecute him or let him go. As that limited time \n     drew to a close, the government changed course. It withdrew \n     the grand jury subpoena that had triggered his designation as \n     a material witness, designated Padilla instead as an unlawful \n     combatant, and transferred him to military custody.\n       The reason? Perhaps it was because the initial claim, that \n     Padilla was involved in a dirty bomb plot, could not be \n     proved with evidence admissible in an ordinary criminal \n     trial. Perhaps it was because to try him in open court \n     potentially would compromise sources and methods of \n     intelligence gathering. Or perhaps it was because Padilla's \n     apparent contact with higher-ups in al Qaeda made him more \n     valuable as a potential intelligence source than as a \n     defendant.\n       The government's quandary here was real. The evidence that \n     brought Padilla to the government's attention may have been \n     compelling, but inadmissible. Hearsay is the most obvious \n     reason why that could be so; or the source may have been such \n     that to disclose it in a criminal trial could harm the \n     government's overall effort.\n       In fact, terrorism prosecutions in this country have \n     unintentionally provided terrorists with a rich source of \n     intelligence. For example, in the course of prosecuting Omar \n     Abdel Rahman (the so-called ``blind sheik'') and others for \n     their role in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing and other \n     crimes, the government was compelled--as it is in all cases \n     that charge conspiracy--to turn over a list of unindicted co-\n     conspirators to the defendants.\n       That list included the name of Osama bin Laden. As was \n     learned later, within 10 days a copy of that list reached bin \n     Laden in Khartoum, letting him know that his connection to \n     that case had been discovered.\n       Again, during the trial of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of \n     the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, an apparently innocuous \n     bit of testimony in a public courtroom about delivery of a \n     cell phone battery was enough to tip off terrorists still at \n     large that one of their communication links had been \n     compromised. That link, which in fact had been monitored by \n     the government and had provided enormously valuable \n     intelligence, was immediately shut down, and further \n     information lost.\n       The unlawful combatant designation affixed to Padilla \n     certainly was not unprecedented. In June 1942, German \n     saboteurs landed from submarines off the coasts of Florida \n     and Long Island and were eventually apprehended. Because they \n     were not acting as ordinary soldiers fighting in uniform \n     and carrying arms openly, they were in violation of the \n     laws of war and not entitled to Geneva Conventions \n     protections.\n       Indeed, at the direction of President Roosevelt they were \n     not only not held as prisoners of war but were tried before a \n     military court in Washington, D.C., convicted, and--except \n     for two who had cooperated--executed, notwithstanding the \n     contention by one of them that he was an American citizen, as \n     is Padilla, and thus entitled to constitutional protections. \n     The Supreme Court dismissed that contention as irrelevant.\n       In any event, Padilla was transferred to a brig in South \n     Carolina, and the Supreme Court eventually held that he had \n     the right to file a habeas corpus petition. His case wound \n     its way back up the appellate chain, and after the government \n     secured a favorable ruling from the Fourth Circuit, it \n     changed course again.\n       Now, Padilla was transferred back to the civilian justice \n     system. Although he reportedly confessed to the dirty bomb \n     plot while in military custody, that statement--made without \n     benefit of legal counsel--could not be used. He was instead \n     indicted on other charges in the Florida case that took three \n     months to try and ended with last week's convictions.\n       The history of Padilla's case helps illustrate in miniature \n     the inadequacy of the current approach to terrorism \n     prosecutions.\n       First, consider the overall record. Despite the growing \n     threat from al Qaeda and its affiliates--beginning with the \n     1993 World Trade Center bombing and continuing through later \n     plots including inter alia the conspiracy to blow up \n     airliners over the Pacific in 1994, the attack on the \n     American barracks at Khobar Towers in 1996, the bombing of \n     U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, the bombing of \n     the Cole in Aden in 2000, and the attack on Sept. 11, 2001--\n     criminal prosecutions have yielded about three dozen \n     convictions, and even those have strained the financial and \n     security resources of the federal courts near to the limit.\n       Second, consider that such prosecutions risk disclosure to \n     our enemies of methods and sources of intelligence that can \n     then be neutralized. Disclosure not only puts our secrets at \n     risk, but also discourages allies abroad from sharing \n     information with us lest it wind up in hostile hands.\n       And third, consider the distortions that arise from \n     applying to national security cases generally the rules that \n     apply to ordinary criminal cases.\n       On one end of the spectrum, the rules that apply to routine \n     criminals who pursue finite goals are skewed, and properly \n     so, to assure that only the highest level of proof will \n     result in a conviction. But those rules do not protect a \n     society that must gather information about, and at least \n     incapacitate, people who have cosmic goals that they are \n     intent on achieving by cataclysmic means.\n       Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the 9/11 attacks, \n     is said to have told his American captors that he wanted a \n     lawyer and would see them in court. If the Supreme Court \n     rules--in a case it has agreed to hear relating to Guantanamo \n     detainees--that foreigners in U.S. custody enjoy the \n     protection of our Constitution regardless of the place or \n     circumstances of their apprehension, this bold joke could \n     become a reality.\n       The director of an organization purporting to protect \n     constitutional rights has announced that his goal is to \n     unleash a flood of lawyers on Guantanamo so as to paralyze \n     interrogation of detainees. Perhaps it bears mention that one \n     unintended outcome of a Supreme Court ruling exercising \n     jurisdiction over Guantanamo detainees may be that, in the \n     future, capture of terrorism suspects will be forgone in \n     favor of killing them. Or they may be put in the custody of \n     other countries like Egypt or Pakistan that are famously not \n     squeamish in their approach to interrogation--a practice, \n     known as rendition, followed during the Clinton \n     administration.\n       At the other end of the spectrum, if conventional legal \n     rules are adapted to deal with a terrorist threat, whether by \n     relaxed standards for conviction, searches, the admissibility \n     of evidence or otherwise, those adaptations will infect and \n     change the standards in ordinary cases with ordinary \n     defendants in ordinary courts of law.\n       What is to be done? The Military Commissions Act of 2006 \n     and the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 appear to address \n     principally the\n\n[[Page S6437]]\n\n     detainees at Guantanamo. In any event, the Supreme Court's \n     recently announced determination to review cases involving \n     the Guantanamo detainees may end up making commissions, which \n     the administration delayed in convening, no longer possible.\n       There have been several proposals for a new adjudicatory \n     framework, notably by Andrew C. McCarthy and Alykhan Velshi \n     of the Center for Law & Counterterrorism, and by former \n     Deputy Attorney General George J. Terwilliger. Messrs. \n     McCarthy and Velshi have urged the creation of a separate \n     national security court staffed by independent, life-tenured \n     judges to deal with the full gamut of national security \n     issues, from intelligence gathering to prosecution. Mr. \n     Terwilliger's more limited proposals address principally the \n     need to incapacitate dangerous people, by using legal \n     standards akin to those developed to handle civil commitment \n     of the mentally ill.\n       These proposals deserve careful scrutiny by the public, and \n     particularly by the U.S. Congress. It is Congress that \n     authorized the use of armed force after Sept. 11--and it is \n     Congress that has the constitutional authority to establish \n     additional inferior courts as the need may be, or even to \n     modify the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.\n       Perhaps the world's greatest deliberative body (the Senate) \n     and the people's house (the House of Representatives) could, \n     while we still have the leisure, turn their considerable \n     talents to deliberating how to fix a strained and mismatched \n     legal system, before another cataclysm calls forth from the \n     people demands for hastier and harsher results.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the only point I am making is that while it \nis possible to try these people in Federal court, it is very difficult. \nIt frequently results in the disclosure of information that we don't \nwant disclosed. I think it would be far better, if we can, to try these \npeople in military commissions. The President has now said he would go \nforward with military commissions--modified to some extent--and I think \nthat is a good thing for the trial of those who are suitable for that \naction.\n  The President also noted, of course, that there are going to be a lot \nof these terrorists who cannot be tried but are dangerous and need to \nbe held, and the U.S. Supreme Court has affirmed the appropriateness of \nholding such people until the end of hostilities. The President has \nindicated that he would, in fact, do that.\n  I think there is no question, therefore, that we will be holding some \nof these people. The question is where best to do it. This is the nub \nof the argument that my colleague and fellow whip, the Senator from \nIllinois, and I have been having long distance. I relish the \nopportunity when we can both get our schedules straight to literally \nhave a debate back and forth. I think it is an important topic.\n  I see now other colleagues are here, and so I will make one final \npoint, and then I hope we can continue in this debate because I think \nit is a better policy to keep Guantanamo open and keep these prisoners \nthere than to try to find some alternative.\n  Let me cite one statistic, and then make my primary point. According \nto the numbers I have--and I would be happy to share these with my \ncolleague from Illinois with respect to the slots available in our \nsupermax facilities, if I can find it--there are about 15 high security \nfacilities which were built to hold 13,448 prisoners. Those facilities \ncurrently house more than 20,000 inmates.\n  The bottom line is that is not necessarily a supersolution either.\n  Did my colleague have a quick comment? I want to make my main point.\n  OK, thank you.\n  Here is my main point. There are those very credible people who say: \nWell, this is a recruitment symbol. Guantanamo prison is a recruitment \nsymbol. I have no doubt they are right, it is a recruitment symbol. \nSeveral questions, however, are raised by that observation.\n  The first question is, even if it is false that there has been \ntorture at Guantanamo prison--obviously, terrorists can believe \nfalsehoods--should we take action based upon that falsehood?\n  The next question I think has to be asked is, does this mean, then, \nthat other terrorist recruiting symbols need to be eliminated by the \nUnited States?\n  The third question is, would that eliminate their terrorism?\n  What is it exactly that animates these terrorists? Gitmo didn't even \nexist before some of the worst--in fact, before all of the worst \nterrorist attacks on the United States or U.S. facilities abroad. There \nwas no Gitmo prior to 9/11. Yet we had all of the various attacks that \noccurred throughout the world leading up to 9/11 and 9/11 itself. They \ndidn't need another reason to hate America. They didn't need another \nreason to be able to recruit people. They have all the reasons they can \ndream up.\n  I think the key reasons are that they fundamentally disagree with our \nway of life, and they believe they have an obligation, through jihad, \nto either get the infidels--that is all of us who don't agree with \nthem--to bend to their will or to do away with us because they don't \nlike our way of life. They do not like the fact that we have the \nculture we have. They do not like the fact that we give equal rights to \nwomen or that we have a democracy. There are a lot of things they hate \nabout the Western World generally and about our society in particular.\n  These are obviously recruiting symbols and recruiting tools. Are we \nto do away with these things in order to please them? And even if we \ndid, what effect would it have on their recruiting? Do you think they \nwould then say: OK, great. You have closed Guantanamo prison, you have \ntaken away women's rights, you are halfway home to us not recruiting \nanybody or terrorizing you anymore. If you will only get rid of the \nvote and institute Sharia law, we can start talking here.\n  I don't think that is the way they are going to act. They are going \nto have grievances against us no matter what. For us to assume we have \nto change our policies, to change what we think is in our best \ninterests, simply to assuage their concerns because maybe they do use \nthis as a recruiting tool, I think is to, in effect, hold our hands up \nand say: In the war against these Islamist terrorists, we have no real \ndefenses because anything we do is going to make them unhappy. It is \ngoing to be a recruiting tool. After all, we wouldn't want to give them \na recruiting tool.\n  I do not think it is too much of an exaggeration to make the point I \nmade. One might say: Obviously, we are not going to give up our way of \nlife. They are going to have to deal with that. Well, then they are \ngoing to keep recruiting. But we could at least get rid of Guantanamo \nprison. That would at least get rid of one thorn. Would it make a \ndifference? Nobody believes it would make a difference.\n  The key point I make is--and this is just a disagreement reasonable \npeople are going to have, I guess--I think Guantanamo is the best place \nto keep these people. My friend from Illinois thinks there are \nalternatives that are better and that, under the circumstances, we \nshould make the change. Again, I observe that the American people seem \nto be on the side of not closing it down, and I do not think it all has \nto do with fear. I think it has to do with the commonsense notion that \nthis is not going to remove terrorist recruiting. If it is better for \nus to keep them there, we might as well do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak in morning business \nfor 5 minutes. I see other Members are on the floor and I will finish \nafter 5 minutes and yield the floor on this issue we have debated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I respect my colleague from Arizona and I respect the \nfact that we are on the floor together. This is a rarity in the Senate, \nwhere people with opposing viewpoints actually arrive at the same \nmoment and have a chance at least to exchange points of view if not \nhave more direct communication. I would say, as follows: I don't know \nwhat motivates the mind of a terrorist. I think I have some ideas and \nmy colleague does as well. I do not know that we will ever be able to \nsave every soul when it comes to those who are inclined toward \nterrorism. Let's face reality, it is like crime in this country. We all \nwould like to see it go away, but we know, intuitively, there are some \npeople who are bad people and do bad things and need to pay the price, \nand I think the same is true for terrorism.\n  But when President Obama goes to Cairo, Egypt, and appears to speak \nto the Islamic world about this new administration and its new approach \nwhen it comes to dealing with Islam and says as part of it that the \nUnited\n\n[[Page S6438]]\n\nStates has forsworn torture in Guantanamo, he has said to the world: We \nare telling you this is a different day. It is a new day. For those who \nare not convinced in terrorism and extremism, at least understand that \nAmerica is now ready to deal with you in an honest way, in a different \nway. What message does it send if the Congress turns around and says to \nthe President: No, you can't say that to the Islamic world. We are \ngoing to keep Guantanamo open. We are going to keep this open, even if \nit is an irritant.\n  Don't take my word for it because I am not an expert in this field \nbut those who are, many of them, believe Guantanamo should be closed. I \nwould never question the sincerity or the resume of GEN Colin Powell, \nwho has said close Guantanamo; GEN David Petraeus: Close Guantanamo; \nthe Secretary of Defense: Close Guantanamo; President George W. Bush: \nClose Guantanamo.\n  All of these people who have seen the intelligence and have the \nbackground believe it is time to close that facility. This President is \ntrying to make good on that promise by President Bush and turn the page \nwhen it comes to Guantanamo and its future. I think that is critical to \nbringing about a more peaceful world and reaching out and saying to \nthis world: Things have changed.\n  I bet the Senator from Arizona joined me when we went upstairs to 407 \nand saw the photographs from Abu Ghraib. It is a moment none of us will \never forget as long as we live. Some of the things we saw there were \ngut-wrenching. I stood there with my colleagues, women and men, \nembarrassed at the things I looked at.\n  Some of those images are going to be with us for a long time, images \nthat the people of the world have seen. We have to overcome them by \nsaying it is a new day, and the clearest way to do that is to close \nGuantanamo in an orderly way, not to release any terrorists in the \nUnited States. On the question about whether we can incarcerate them--\neven if our prison population is as large as it is, there are \nfacilities available. Once this President is given this option to reach \nout to States and this Nation, I am confident he will find \naccommodations in Federal prisons and supermax State prisons to deal \nwith 240 people who are now left at Guantanamo. I think that is \nsomething we can expect to happen, and it will happen.\n  I will close by saying this: I asked the Senator from Kentucky twice \nif he would comment on what I heard to be his statement about whether \nthis gentleman, Ahmed Ghailani, if found not guilty, would be released \ninto the United States. He said Mr. Gibbs, the White House Press \nSecretary, had led him to that conclusion. I think, in fairness, Mr. \nGibbs would say, clearly, he had no intention that this President or \nanyone in this administration would ever release this man, and there is \nno right under the law that he be released, even if he is found not \nguilty, into the U.S. population. It is not going to happen. I think \nraising that specter, raising that question, is raising that level of \nfear.\n  I do not think fear should guide us. America is not a strong nation \ncowering in the shadows in fear. America is a strong nation when we \nrealize our challenge, stand together united, don't abandon our \nprinciples, and use the resources we have around the world to make \ncertain we are safer.\n  The last point I will make is I have the greatest confidence in our \nsystem of justice, more than any in the world. I hope all my colleagues \nwill have that same sense of confidence, that if the President sends a \ncase to our courts of law, it will be handled professionally and fairly \nin the best possible manner.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have enjoyed this debate between these \ntwo great Senators. It is an interesting debate. I come down on the \nfact, if they are moved into any of our facilities in this country--and \nthere are very few that could take them; in fact, I do not know of any \nthat can take them that are not overcrowded right now--there will be \nthe same screaming and shouting because they will not be treated \nanywhere near as well as they are treated down there at Guantanamo. No \nmatter what we do that new day is not going to be a very happy day. It \nis far better to have this $200 million state-of-the-art facility that \nhas been approved by international organizations as being better than \nexpected, better than average facilities that would be acceptable--it \nis better to acknowledge that and keep treating them as decently and \nwith as much dignity as we can, which is more than they will get in a \nsupermax facility in this country or any other facility.\n  The supermax facilities are loaded with prisoners. They have more \nthan they can handle now. Why would we put terrorists in among them, \nand why would we put them in this country where they can influence \nother people who are dissatisfied with life and have been discontented \nand have committed very serious crimes and allow them the recruitment \npossibilities they would have in our country? It doesn't make sense.\n  Why would we blow $200 million on state-of-the-art facilities and \nthen spend another $80 million to shut it down? It seems like it is \ngoing a little bit too far because of the attempt of this \nadministration to please, basically, people who support terrorists and \nthe rest of the world.\n  Admittedly, there have been some outstanding people in our country \nwho have come to the conclusion they should shut Guantanamo down, but \nthey did so without having a real, viable alternative to Guantanamo. \nThat is the issue that bothers me. I don't know of any State in the \nUnion that wants these people within their prison system, assuming they \ncould handle them. It means a lot more expense, a lot more problems. It \nmeans the possibility that they will be recruiting terrorists and \nhelping criminals to become terrorists in our country. I can't begin to \ntell you the cost to this society if we do that. Be that as it may, the \nPresident seems to want to do that in spite of the fact that \noverwhelmingly the American people don't want him to do that.\n\n\n                      state secret protection act\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to express my reservations \nregarding the State Secrets Protection Act. Since one of the purposes \nof government is to provide a strong national defense, there are \nmethods and sources that should never be disclosed for fear of \nirreparable damage to national security. The judicial branch has a \nlong-documented history in addressing the state secrets privilege. \nThrough the years, courts have affirmed time and again the privilege of \nthe government to withhold information that would damage national \nsecurity programs.\n  The modern origin of this doctrine was established in United States \nv. Reynolds. The Supreme Court created the Reynolds compromise, which \nstated that the privilege applies when the court is satisfied ``from \nall circumstances of the case, that there is a reasonable danger that \ncompulsion of the evidence will expose military matters which, in the \ninterest of national security, should not be divulged.'' That is what \nthe Supreme Court has held, and it has continued to affirm this \nposition with the utmost deference to the executive branch. Under \nReynolds, the state secrets privilege cannot--and has not--been lightly \ninvoked. The pending bill before the Judiciary Committee, known as the \nState Secrets Protection Act, would negate the Reynolds compromise and \ncreate a higher standard of proof for the government to assert the \nprivilege.\n  My analysis of the legislation before us leads me to conclude that \nthis bill will bring chaos to the balance struck by Reynolds. This bill \nlowers the deference that courts give to the executive branch in its \nassertion of the state secrets privilege. It raises the burden of proof \nthat the government must meet to protect state secrets. The courts have \nbuilt great flexibility into the state secrets doctrine to allow \nthemselves the latitude to reach an effective compromise between the \nrights of litigants and the needs of national security. This is \nconducted on a case-by-case basis.\n  The writers of this bill want to redefine the standard to only afford \nprotection under the state secrets privilege only when the disclosure \nof evidence is ``reasonably likely to cause significant harm'' to \nnational security. This is a serious departure from the long \nestablished precedent of Reynolds. This has ramifications that would \nseverely impede the protection of national security secrets. It is \npreposterous to abandon a standard that has more than 55\n\n[[Page S6439]]\n\nyears of jurisprudential evolution and case law to support it. The \nReynolds compromise says if there is reasonable danger then we secure \nthe information. S. 417 says if it is reasonably likely, you can \ncompromise the information. \nS. 417 fails to protect state secrets.\n  This state secrets privilege is never lightly used and never used \nwith impunity. The assertion of this right must be made in writing by \nthe head of the executive agency invoking the state secrets privilege. \nIn recent cases this has sometimes been the Director of National \nIntelligence. Courts may conduct their own probe to ensure that the \nprivilege has been invoke correctly. This probe will include an \nexamination as to why the information being sought is needed to prove a \nplaintiff's case. Conversely, courts will examine as to why the \ninformation is critical to national security. After thoughtful review, \na judge makes the determination on the production of evidence alleged \nto have been covered by the privilege. Not a law passed by politicians.\n  There is a myth that the Bush administration invoked the state \nsecrets privilege more than any other previous administration. Rooted \nin this fallacy is the idea that the administration overreached in \nasserting the privilege to protect information not previously thought \nto be within its scope. This erroneous notion was propagated by not \nonly the media, but by Members of this body. Most legal experts in the \nfield of national security law have stated that it is not possible to \ncollect accurate annual statistics for year-to-year comparisons. There \nis no ``batting average'' that can be empirically compared from one \npresidential administration to another.\n  To do so would incorrectly operate under the assumption that the \ngovernment is presented with the same amount of cases each year in \nwhich the privilege can be asserted. It makes absolutely no sense to me \nto compare the administrations and judge them based on the total number \nof times they asserted the privilege.\n  The flow of litigation changes from year to year and varies from each \nadministration, as does the invocation of the privilege. It varies \nbecause of the times and circumstances. We have been living in very \ndifficult times and circumstances where we have to protect this \ncountry; circumstances we have never had to face before. Therefore, it \nis ludicrous that attempts to compare the rate of assertions of this \nprivilege and arrive at the incorrect conclusion that because the Bush \nadministration used this privilege it must be changed.\n  Unfortunately, for the authors of this bill, the data does not \nsupport the hypothesis that the Bush administration ever used the state \nsecrets privilege in an attempt to dismiss complaints. Published \nopinions have revealed in the 1970s the government filed five motions. \nIn the 1980s the government filed motions nine times. In the 1990s the \ngovernment filed motions 13 times. Preliminary data available for the \nBush administration indicate that the privilege was used 14 times.\n  Therefore, the impetus for the State Secrets Protection Act does not \nsupport the conclusion that the Bush administration blazed a new trial \nin national security law. On the contrary, the authors of this bill are \nthe ones attempting to alter national security law. Keep in mind, we \nhave been going through an extended war on terrorism, and, frankly, \nthere is a need to protect national security. That is why we have the \nstate secrets law.\n  In the first 100 days of the Obama administration--get that now--in \nthe first 100 days of the Obama administration, the Department of \nJustice has invoked this privilege three times--in the first 100 days. \nThis is the administration that was complaining about this. Now they \nfound, when they faced reality and how important this privilege is, \nthey changed their tune, and they should. I commend the administration \nand specifically the President for recognizing this.\n  The administration has picked up where the Bush administration left \noff in three pending cases: Al Haramain Islamic Foundation v. Obama, \nMohammed v. Jepperson Data Plan, and Jewell v. NSA. During an interview \nof a widely revered liberal journalist, Attorney General Eric Holder \nstated that in his opinion the Bush administration--get this word--\n``correctly'' applied the state secrets privilege in these cases.\n  If this legislation is passed in its present form, private attorneys \nwould be given access to highly classified declarations before a judge \nrules on whether the state secrets privilege should prevent such a \ndisclosure. Can you imagine the harm that could come to our country? It \nis hard to believe that anybody would be advocating this in the Senate \nwith what we have been going through and the special wars that we have \nbeen going through and the special type of terrorists that we have been \nhaving to put up with.\n  This legislation--lousy legislation--will have the effect of \nincentivizing lawsuits by rewarding attorneys who file lawsuits with a \nsecurity clearance. I remember one case in New York where the attorney \nherself was convicted because she was passing on information.\n  Now this clearance will grant these attorneys access to classified \ninformation that if divulged could reasonably harm our national \nsecurity interests. It is bad enough trying to keep secrets around \nhere, let alone with people who really should not be qualified for that \ntype of classification. Does an attorney need absolute proof of some \nviolation of law to file a lawsuit to learn details about classified \nprograms? No, under this bill, they simply need to make an accusation. \nAny accusation will do.\n  Ensuring national security programs stay classified is critical to \nour citizens' continued safety. Under this legislation, private \nattorneys, regardless of the merits of their lawsuits, will be given \naccess to our Nation's secrets, secrets that are critical to the \nprotection of our country. It is not hard to see how this legislation \ncould seriously harm national security.\n  It is hard for me to see why anybody would be arguing for this \nlegislation. It is a legitimate concern that ideological attorneys \nwould be willing to compromise national security interests and secrets \nand disclose classified information. There are at least two recent \ninstances involving the disclosure of classified information. These are \nrecent. I am just talking about the recent ones, and then only two of \nthem. There may be more.\n  In May 2007, a Navy JAG lawyer leaked classified information \npertaining to Guantanamo detainees to a human rights lawyer. I find it \ndisturbing that a U.S. military officer who is sworn to protect this \nNation would disseminate classified information. But an even more \ntroubling scenario is posed by private attorneys. In 2005, a more \nalarming case came to light when a civilian defense counsel was \nconvicted of providing material support for a terrorist conspiracy by \nsmuggling messages from her client, a Muslim cleric convicted of \nterrorism, to his Islamic fundamentalist followers in Egypt.\n  Do you know how difficult it was to convict an Islamic fundamentalist \nreligious leader? Yet this man was convicted, and rightly so. His \nattorney compromised these matters. In press interviews after the \nattorney was convicted, she said, ``I would do it again--it's the way \nlawyers are supposed to behave.''\n  She also said that ``you can't lock up the lawyers. You cannot tell \nthe lawyers how to do their job.''\n  I am not implying that all lawyers would act so egregiously. What I \nam saying is there is a profound reason why the government has \nclassifications for categorizing the sensitivity of information that is \nvital to national security. Providing top secret clearances to persons \noutside the employment of the United States is a colossal blunder. This \nbill will allow that.\n  The courts recognize the executive branch's superior knowledge on \nmilitary, diplomatic, and national security matters. Judges do not \nrelish the thought of second-guessing decisions made by officials who \nare better versed on matters that may be jeopardized by allowing \nattorneys access to classified materials. Similarly, Congress should \nnot relish the thought of second-guessing the judgment of courts that \nhave given careful consideration regarding the appropriate legal \nstandards to balance the interests of judges and national security \nprograms.\n  The State Securities Protection Act does not protect state secrets. \nThis bill upsets the judicially developed balance between protection of \nnational security and private litigants' access to secret\n\n[[Page S6440]]\n\ndocuments. The judicial branch has crafted a state secrets doctrine to \ngive judges the flexibility to weigh these interests with appropriate \ndeference to the executive branch. This judicially crafted doctrine is \nmore than sufficient and has evolved from the 1912 case of Firth \nSterling to Reynolds to current cases such as Hepting and Al Masri.\n  The State Secrets Protection Act is unnecessary and potentially \nharmful to national security. Unless serious changes are made to this \nlegislation and the amendments offered by myself and my Republican \ncolleagues are adopted, I cannot in good conscience vote this bill out \nof committee. I do not know how any Senator sitting in this body can do \nso.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Guantanamo\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have come to the floor over the past \nseveral years, countless times, talking about a resource we have called \nGuantanamo Bay. People refer to it as Gitmo.\n  I was distressed about some of the statements our President made when \nhe made the comment that we are going to close Gitmo and make sure \nthere is no more torture. I have to say, there has never been one \ndocumented case of torture in Guantanamo Bay. It is ludicrous that \npeople would say this. Every time I talk to someone who says we have to \nclose Guantanamo Bay and you ask them what the reason for that is, they \nturn around and they say: It is because the people in the Middle East \nand some people in Europe think there is torture that has been going \non. It goes back to the Abu Ghraib thing. This had nothing to do with \nAbu Ghraib. There has never been a documented case of torture.\n  Let's look at this resource. We got Gitmo in 1903. It is one of the \nbest bargains we have had in government because we only paid $4,000 a \nyear for this. It is a state-of-the-art prison. We don't have anything \nin the United States that is as secure and as humane as Gitmo. They \nhave a ratio of doctors to detainees of two to one, the same with legal \nhelp. I have been down there several times. If you talk to the ones who \nwon't be throwing something at you, they will tell you they have never \nhad food and treatment as good as they have had down there. I can't \nimagine we would take a resource such as that and close it down and \nbring some 200 or 240 terrorists to the United States. Yet that is \nexactly what the President is talking about doing.\n  I was shocked when I picked up the newspaper on Monday morning and \nsaw that Ahmed Ghailani, who was the terrorist who bombed the embassies \nin Tanzania and Kenya, was actually brought to the United States. He is \nin New York today. I didn't know about it until I read it in the \nnewspaper. He is going to be adjudicated or go to trial in our court \nsystem.\n  Here is the problem we have with that. These people in Guantanamo Bay \nare terrorists, detainees. These are not criminals. These are not \npeople who committed a crime. They are not people to whom the normal \nrules of evidence would apply. In fact, most of the rules of evidence, \nit was assumed, would be in the form of military tribunals. Of course, \nthose rules are different than they are in the court system. What will \nhappen when you have some of the worst terrorists in the world coming \nup and getting tried in our system and we find out they have to be \nacquitted because the rules of evidence are not what they were during \nthe time they were brought into custody?\n  We have this resource we have used since 1903. It is the only place \nin the world we can actually put detainees. The President has said \nthere are some 17 prisons in the United States where we can incarcerate \nthese people. I suggest--and I don't think anyone will refute this--if \nyou did that, you would have 17 magnets for terrorism.\n  One of the places they suggested happened to be Fort Sill in \nOklahoma. I went down to Fort Sill. There is a young lady there who is \na sergeant major in charge of our prison. She said: What is wrong with \nthose people in Washington? What is wrong with the President, thinking \nthat we can incarcerate terrorists here in Oklahoma?\n  This young lady was also a sergeant major at Guantanamo just a few \nmonths ago. She went back and she said: That is the greatest facility. \nThere is no place where we can replicate that thing.\n  She said: On top of that, we have the courtroom that was built.\n  We spent 12 months and $12 million on a courtroom where we could have \nmilitary tribunals, and they were going on. And President Obama ordered \nthem to stop, and he wanted to bring them to the United States to be \nadjudicated here. This is outrageous.\n  I have heard people on the Senate floor talk about how bad Guantanamo \nBay is. They will never be specific. They will never talk about what is \nwrong with Guantanamo Bay. What are they doing? Are they torturing \npeople? No. Are they being mistreated? No. There are six levels of \nsecurity. When you are dealing with terrorist detainees, you have to \nput them in areas where the level of their activity is greater and \nrequires more or less security, and we have that opportunity to do it \nthere. No place else in America, no place else in the world can they do \nthat.\n  By the way, it is not just 245 detainees whom we have to deal with. \nIt is worse than that because in Afghanistan, with the surge taking \nplace right now, there will be more detainees. There are two major \nprisons: Bagram--and I can't remember the other one in Afghanistan. \nThey will say they could be incarcerated there. No, they won't, because \nthey won't accept any detainees who are not from Afghanistan. So if \nthey are from Djibouti or from Saudi Arabia or someplace else, we have \nto have a place to put them or else you turn them loose or else you \nexecute them.\n  A lot of these people who think they should not be incarcerated in \nany prison at all, you have to keep in mind, you can't turn them loose \non society. These are people who are not normal, people like normal \ncriminals. First of all, they have no fear of death. It is just \ningrained in them. These are people who want to kill all of us. So we \nare talking about very dangerous people.\n  I am very much concerned. I did not believe President Obama would go \nthrough with bringing terrorists to the United States. I didn't think \nthat would happen. Yet I picked up the paper Monday morning and there \nit is. Ahmed Ghailani, one of the worst terrorists around, killed 244 \npeople, many Americans, in Tanzania and Kenya. This is something that I \nknow the American people don't want. I would hope many of my good \nDemocratic friends are not going to line up and support President Obama \nin bringing these terrorists to the United States.\n  I guess I am prejudiced. I have 20 kids and grandkids. I don't want a \nbunch of terrorists in this country where they are subjected to that \ntype of thing. The fact is, they would be magnets; there is no doubt in \nmy mind. This Sergeant Major Carter at Fort Sill said that if we put \nthem down there, they would be in a position where it would draw \nterrorist activity to my State of Oklahoma.\n  By the way, I think there are 27 State legislatures that have passed \nresolutions saying they don't want any of the detainees located in \ntheir States. I can assure my colleagues that every one of the 17 \nproposed sites that would house these people is a site where they have \npassed resolutions saying: We don't want them here.\n  The liberal press is always talking about how bad things are and we \nhave to close Gitmo. If you go down there, you find that those people \nhave never been there. Almost without exception--I don't know of one \nexception where if they have gone down there and they have seen how \nhumanely people are treated, they have seen a resource down there that \nwe can't replicate any place in the United States, they come back \nshaking their heads saying: What is wrong with keeping Gitmo open? Even \nAl Jazeera went down there. That is a Middle Eastern network. They went \ndown and had to admit publicly that the treatment was better there\n\n[[Page S6441]]\n\nthan it is in any of the prisons they are familiar with.\n\n  Abu Ghraib was a different situation. Yes, some of our troops were \ninvolved in that. Most people wouldn't call it torture. It is more \nhumiliation than anything else. But nonetheless, they did that. But the \ninteresting thing about Abu Ghraib is, prior to the time that the \npublic was aware that was going on, the Army had already come in and \nstarted their discipline, and it stopped that type of thing from taking \nplace. But even if it weren't, for people to think just because there \nwas something in their minds that was torture that was going on in Abu \nGhraib, to even suggest that was going on in Guantanamo Bay is totally \nfictitious.\n  I have been privileged to take several Members down with me to see \nthis firsthand. I think every Member of the Senate should have to go \ndown and see for himself or herself what is really going on down there.\n  We can't afford to take a chance on turning terrorists loose in the \nUnited States. The polling that came out just this morning showed that \nby a margin of 3 to 1, people do not want to close Guantanamo Bay. We \nhave to keep Gitmo open.\n  I was in a state of shock when I found out that one of the worst \nterrorists incarcerated down there was brought back to face justice in \nour court system in New York.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to Nicky \nHayden, a native of Owensboro, KY., who has followed his passion and is \nan inspiration for all Kentuckians.\n  Hayden is among the world's elite in Grand Prix motorcycle racing. \nDriving at speeds of up to 200 miles per hour, with his knees sometimes \nonly inches off of the ground, Hayden has won countless races all over \nthe world\n  Nicky's racing career has led him to win the Moto Grand Prix \nChampionship in 2006, the AMA Superbike Championship in 2002, and the \nAMA Supersport 600 Championship in 1999.\n  Nicky's parents, Earl and Rose Hayden, could not be more proud of \nwhat their son has already accomplished since he began racing at a very \nyoung age.\n  An article in the June 2009 edition of Kentucky Living magazine \nchronicled Nicky's career, highlighting his exciting and successful \ncareer, his extensive travel schedule, and his love of his home State \nand town. I ask unanimous consent to have the full article printed in \nthe Congressional Record.\n  Mr. President, I further ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nthe achievements of Nicky Hayden and I wish him continued success \nthroughout his career.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   [From Kentucky Living, June 2009]\n\n                     Nicky Hayden, the Kentucky Kid\n\n                           (By Gary P. West)\n\n       When fans call you The Kentucky Kid and you race throughout \n     the world on a motorcycle at speeds in excess of 200 miles \n     per hour, you better believe you have to be good, real good.\n       That's what 28-year-old Nicky Hayden from Owensboro does, \n     and as a professional motorcycle racer, who started out in \n     the sport long before he was big enough for his feet to touch \n     the ground while seated, he has become one of the biggest \n     names in the sport.\n       Nicky was back home in Owensboro, or OWB as he calls it, \n     taking the name from the local airport, on a summer break \n     from an 18-race schedule that begins in March and ends in \n     November.\n       ``I travel 11 months a year,'' he says. ``But I love coming \n     home to my family. Family's important to me. Growing up here \n     with my two brothers and two sisters, I have everything I \n     want. My mom was from a big farm family, 11 brothers and \n     sisters, so my family has always been close. I don't want to \n     live in Monaco or anywhere else like that.''\n       Nicky's parents, Earl and Rose, once upon a time, enjoyed \n     the thrill of going fast on motorcycles themselves. Earl \n     raced often and won on dirt tracks, while Rose competed \n     successfully in ``powder puff' leagues, but when their family \n     began to expand, they turned to introducing their three sons \n     to the sport.\n       While older brother Tommy and younger brother Roger have \n     had successful professional riding stints, it's Nicky who has \n     risen to world-class status winning the MotoGP or Grand Prix, \n     the sport's most elite level of motorcycle racing. As the \n     World Champion in 2006, he has picked up several other \n     accolades that might be expected for a handsome bachelor who \n     hangs out with jetsetters throughout Europe and the United \n     States.\n       Nicky often finds himself far removed from his Owensboro \n     home in order to race against riders from Italy, Spain, \n     Portugal, Australia, and other countries throughout the \n     world. But it's his return visits to Kentucky and his family \n     and friends that help him keep his Daviess County values.\n       Swerving through curves, routinely leaning his motorcycle \n     so far on its sides that the friction from the asphalt eats \n     into his knee pucks, Hayden and his cycle appear to defy the \n     law of gravity. Riding on the edge of traction, the slightest \n     loss of concentration and his race is over.\n       Motorcycle racing, considered by many to be a daredevil \n     sport, has gained its popularity on dirt tracks throughout \n     America over the years. But with the strong influence of his \n     parents, one question begs to be asked. Considering \n     Owensboro's reputation as a hotbed for stock car racing how \n     did the Hayden family stay focused on motorcycles?\n       With Owensboro names like Waltrip, Green, and Mayfield, all \n     established NASCAR stars, it seems like it would have been \n     easier to catch on with automobile racing.\n       But Hayden's star was growing at a much earlier age than it \n     takes to get a ride in a car at Daytona.\n       By the age of 17, and still in high school at Owensboro \n     Catholic, he was racing factory Honda RC45 superbikes and \n     winning. In 2002, at the age of 21, he won the Daytona 200 \n     while becoming the youngest ever to win an AMA Superbike \n     Championship. He was years removed from the days when his \n     parents would hold his bike in place for the start of a race \n     because he was too small to touch the ground.\n       Soon after, Honda tapped The Kentucky Kid to join what many \n     in the business consider the elite team in MotoGP racing, \n     Repsol Honda. Earning rookie-of-the-year honors on the \n     circuit his first year, his racing togs began to take on more \n     sponsors than an Indy car. A jewelry line, clothing, \n     sunglasses, tires, energy drink, watches, and, of course, \n     Repsol, an oil and gas company operating in more than 30 \n     countries, cover almost every inch of his protective racing \n     ware.\n       With his boyish good looks and success as an international \n     motorcycle racer, it was of little surprise when Hayden was \n     listed among People magazine's 50 Hottest Bachelors in 2005.\n       That was followed by appearances on the Today Show, Jay \n     Leno's Tonight Show, and a two-hour documentary on MTV \n     appropriately called The Kentucky Kid, which chronicled his \n     2006 championship season. ``It gave us good exposure in a \n     market we hadn't been in,'' says Nicky.\n       Rubbing elbows and shaking hands with the likes of Michael \n     Jordan, Brad Pitt, and Tom Cruise, and seeing your picture on \n     a full-page Honda ad and in USA Today, further points out the \n     two worlds Nicky lives in.\n       It did not come, however, without some difficulties and \n     second-guessing. Family closeness made Nicky's travels \n     throughout the world difficult at times, especially that \n     first year in MotoGP competition.\n       ``It was another world to me,'' recalls Nicky. ``I was \n     learning the bike, my team, the hectic travel schedule, and \n     everything that went with it. My two brothers and I always \n     trained, practiced, and rode together and then the next year \n     I was out there by myself.''\n       With Nicky and his family growing up on Rose's home-cooked \n     meals, the sudden change in culinary choices as he traveled \n     presented some problems.\n       ``Oh, yeah, food was definitely an issue,'' his voice \n     rising to emphasize the point. ``It's not much fun being on \n     an airplane with food poisoning. There have been several \n     nights I have gone to bed hungry, and when I was in China I \n     lived on watermelon for a while.''  ``At the races I stay in \n     a motor home at the track,'' he says.\n       One of the perks of racing at this level is that a motor \n     home is delivered to each of his European races. It also \n     includes an English-speaking satellite television that he \n     says helped to overcome his loneliness.\n       The entire setting is thousands of miles removed from his \n     Daviess County home, and thousands of thoughts about those \n     days when he couldn't wait to finish high school and race \n     motorcycles. It was his only thought.\n       ``I did just enough in school to get by'' to keep my grades \n     up so my parents would let\n\n[[Page S6442]]\n\n     me race. I'm not proud of it, but I was so involved with \n     racing it's about all I could think of,'' he says.\n       The brothers would fly out to races all over the U.S. and \n     then catch the red-eye flights back in order to get back to \n     school. It was difficult to stay focused on academics. In his \n     junior year of high school, he had signed a six-figure \n     contract and was driving a new truck. It was easy to see why \n     the 17-year-old was not fully committed to school. In his \n     words, the library and any required research were not a \n     priority.\n       Racing motorcycles all over the world, Nicky has lost count \n     of the number of countries he's visited. Not only is MotoGP \n     racing fast on the track, but off as well. Nicky and his \n     Repsol Honda teammate Dani Pedrosa, from Spain, travel with a \n     sizeable entourage, finishing one race and immediately \n     heading to another, much like a circus breaking down the Big \n     Top and moving on to the next gig.\n       ``We have about 75 people that go everywhere with us,'' \n     Nicky says. ``We have our own chef who prepares all of the \n     food for the team. Then there are the mechanics, agents, \n     trainers, engineers, tire, and hospitality people. It's a lot \n     of people.''\n       Make no mistake about it, MotoGP racing is big business. \n     The custom Honda motorcycle, according to Nicky, cost in \n     excess of a million dollars to build. The titanium and carbon \n     racing machine is so aerodynamically designed with the very \n     latest in technology that every piece, including the nuts and \n     bolts, is custom-made. For sure this is not an assembly-line \n     product. Weighing 325 pounds and sporting somewhere around \n     250hp, this mechanized piece of art can blast from 0 to 60 in \n     less than three seconds.\n       Sponsors pay big bucks to have their names associated with \n     The Kentucky Kid. With it comes a certain amount of pressure \n     to excel. Following his world championship 2006 season, Nicky \n     finished eighth in points. And at the end of the 2008 season, \n     the result was the same, eighth.\n       ``After being a world champion, I put pressure on myself,'' \n     he says. ``I hope my best years are ahead of me. This is a \n     good age in this sport for riders.''\n       When listening to Nicky talk about his racing future, it \n     takes awhile before he says what he wants to do when his \n     riding days are over.\n       Somehow, the subject just doesn't easily come up unless \n     someone else asks about it.\n       ``I really don't have a plan B,'' he says. ``I know I want \n     to race well into my 30s.''\n       For sure Nicky doesn't have to look very far to see the \n     personal devastation this daredevil sport can dish out or how \n     quickly it could end. Back home in Owensboro last July, Nicky \n     was enjoying several days of a summer break far from MotoGP. \n     Also there were Tommy and Roger, who both ride on the AMA \n     Superbike Tour. But they were home not because they \n     necessarily wanted to be. They were recovering. Roger, who \n     rides a factory bike for Kawasaki, had crashed several weeks \n     earlier in Alabama, breaking his pelvis and vertebrae. A week \n     later, Tommy, a rider for Suzuki, took a hard tumble in \n     California, breaking bones in his back and puncturing a lung.\n       ``It was crazy,'' says Nicky. ``The next week I went down \n     in Portugal but was not seriously injured.''\n       For the most part Hayden has avoided serious injury. In \n     August 2004, however, while training in Italy near Milan, he \n     broke his right collarbone. Following surgery that involved \n     inserting a plate, he was back racing in a few weeks.\n       Tragedy did strike the Hayden family. In May of 2007, \n     Nicky's second cousin, 10-year-old Ethan Gillim, died as a \n     result of a motorcycle accident in a race in Paducah. Ethan \n     had started racing when he was 4, and in six years attained \n     18 national dirt track titles.\n       The Hayden's all three brothers are professionally \n     represented by a management company, International Racers, \n     out of Irvine, California. At the level Nicky is racing, the \n     company has a full-time agent who accompanies him during the \n     season in order to maximize the promotional opportunities for \n     their star client.\n       A season of MotoGP consists of 18 races held in 16 \n     different countries, and in 2008 two of these races were held \n     in the United States, in Laguna Seca, California, and \n     Indianapolis, Indiana. Throughout Europe, the sport has \n     almost a cult-like following. Televised races attract in \n     excess of 300 million viewers for each event, and another \n     200,000 frequently show up to see the races live.\n       ``For sure the U.S. market hasn't been tapped,'' Nicky \n     says. ``I know there is an effort now being made to do it.''\n       To help promote that market, just before last year's \n     Indianapolis 500, Nicky blasted two laps around the 2\\1/2\\-\n     mile track, giving car race fans a sampling of what was to \n     come later in September with the 14th round of the 2008 \n     MotoGP.\n       What will help increase the visibility in this country, \n     perhaps, is for more American riders to achieve success. \n     Currently there are only four, including Hayden, on a \n     circuit dominated by foreign riders and sponsors.\n       As they should be, all of the Hayden's have been well-\n     compensated for their successes. Many Americans may be \n     surprised to learn that Valentino Rossi, considered to be the \n     best motorcycle racer in the world, earns a reported $30 \n     million a year.\n       At the end of 2008's season, a new twist emerged with some \n     big changes. For some time Nicky and Honda had been at odds, \n     first about the way the manufacturer set his bike up and then \n     it was a tire issue. They wanted Bridgestone tires and Nicky \n     likes Michelin.\n       Soon the split became too much to overcome and now The \n     Kentucky Kid rides for Ducati, an Italian bike company. He \n     and Australian Casey Stoner are Ducati's featured riders, \n     with Nicky kicking off the 2009 season on his 100th GP race \n     with a new bike, a new team, and a new color.\n       As Nicky updates his fans on a video on his Web site, \n     www.NickyHayden.com, ``Honestly, I think red is a good color \n     for me. I think it could be a good look and anything up front \n     looks good. I mean, I could be up there in pink polka dots if \n     you're winning races, I think you could pull it off.''\n       With Nicky now on a Ducati, Tommy a Suzuki, and Roger a \n     Kawasaki, the three have always been there for each other. \n     All have achieved success in one form or another. The goal, \n     of course, is to be good enough and fast enough to get a \n     podium. In motorcycle racing terms that means first, second, \n     or third. All three have had their share, but like any \n     competitive athlete they want more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6442-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6442]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING TAYLOR HENRY CARR, M.D.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to and \nrecognize the passing of a remarkable citizen from my home State of \nIdaho, Dr. Taylor Henry Carr. He served his country as a gunnery \nofficer in the Navy and he served his community as a doctor and \nphilanthropist. He was a prime example of an American father, citizen, \nand patriot. He was also my uncle, and I am proud to be his nephew. As \na doctor, he did much for the families of Idaho Falls, and, as a \nphilanthropist, he did much for the community itself. Idaho Falls will \nmiss him but will continue to benefit from the efforts of all those \nwhom he influenced.\n  Dr. Carr's accomplishments attest to his contribution to his \ncommunity and country. He was a Boy Scout and a gunnery officer in the \nNavy. He was editor of his college newspaper and student body \npresident. He earned an undergraduate degree in pharmacy and a graduate \ndegree in medicine. Over the course of his career, he served in many \ndifferent roles including director of the Idaho Cancer Society, \npresident of staff at Sacred Heart Hospital, and on the Board of \nDirectors of the ISU Alumni Association.\n  Dr. Carr's favorite activities included fishing, golfing, skiing, and \nreading. He was a devoted husband to his wife Betty and a loving father \nto his seven children. In 2003, the Carr family won the Idaho Falls \nArts Council's annual Support of the Arts award for contributions to \nthe Eagle Rock Art Museum, the renovation of the Museum of Idaho, and \nthe Willard Arts Center, the main gallery of which is named after \nTaylor and Betty Carr.\n  I remember, when I was young, spending as much time at my Uncle \nCarr's house as at my own. I learned a lot from him, as did so many \nothers. He always expected you to be and do your best so as to better \nlive up to your potential. Taylor Henry Carr fully lived up to his \npotential before passing away on April 24, 2009. He was an excellent \nexample of the great citizens produced by my home State and his life is \nan excellent example for all Americans to follow.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6442-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6442-S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING JACK HENNING\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of an \nextraordinary labor leader, civil servant, and dear friend of mine, \nJohn F. ``Jack'' Henning. Jack's legendary activism and innovation in \nthe labor movement will serve as a source of inspiration for decades to \ncome. Jack passed away on June 4, 2009. He was 93 years old.\n  Jack Henning was born in San Francisco on October 25, 1915, to hard-\nworking Irish-American parents. After he graduated from St. Mary's \nCollege with a degree in English literature, he began what would become \na lifelong and immensely successful career in the labor movement. In \n1938, Jack began working for the Association of Catholic Unionists in \nSan Francisco, and in 1949 he was hired by the California Labor \nFederation.\n  Recognizing Jack's exemplary leadership, hard work, and compassion \nfor his fellow-man, former California Governor Pat Brown named him \ndirector of the California Department of Industrial Relations in 1959. \nA public servant\n\n[[Page S6443]]\n\nand leader at both state and federal levels, Jack also served as Under \nSecretary of Labor under President Kennedy and was later appointed as \nU.S. Ambassador to New Zealand by President Johnson.\n  With an already impressive and accomplished career behind him, Jack \nreturned to California in 1970 and continued his life-long effort to \nimprove conditions for working Americans. For 26 years Jack served as \nthe executive secretary-treasurer of the California Labor Federation, \nAFL-CIO, representing over 2 million workers.\n  Jack's leadership in the labor movement had a huge impact on workers \nacross California and the Nation. A friend and colleague of Cesar \nChavez, Jack worked alongside the United Farm Workers to pass \nCalifornia's groundbreaking Agricultural Labor Relations Act in 1975, \nwhich established the right to collective bargaining for farm workers. \nJack went on to fight many successful battles for improvements in \nworker safety and compensation laws.\n  Jack's belief in, and dedication to, equal rights was not limited to \nthe labor movement. Jack also fought against ignorance and racial \ndiscrimination. As the Regent for the University of California from \n1977 to 1989, Jack worked to establish affirmative action policies and \nencouraged the University to divest from South Africa in protest of the \ncountry's support of apartheid.\n  Jack stood out as a driven organizer and hard worker who cared for \nhis community deeply. Jack will be remembered by his friends and \npartners in the labor movement as a visionary, a talented orator, and \nstalwart defender of equal rights. He was a champion for workers \neverywhere, and he will be sorely missed. We take comfort in knowing \nthat the future of the labor movement will continue to benefit from \nJack's dedication for generations to come. We will always be grateful \nfor Jack's example of a steadfast commitment to social and economic \njustice.\n  Jack is survived by his five sons, John Jr., Patrick, Brian, Daniel, \nand Thomas; two daughters, Nancy Goulde and Mary Henning; 12 \ngrandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. My thoughts are with Jack's \nfamily at this difficult time. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6443-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING BARKWHEATS DOG BISCUITS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nsuccessful and thriving business of a young and insightful entrepreneur \nfrom my home State of Maine whose line of dog treats is truly one of a \nkind.\n  Barkwheats Dog Biscuits was founded in 2007 by entrepreneur Chris \nRoberts. A native of the Bangor area, Mr. Roberts left Maine to attend \ncollege and pursue a career as a recording engineer in Nashville. Upon \nreturning to Maine, Mr. Roberts found himself baking frequently, a \nskill he developed while a baker at the University of Maine. This \ngradually led Mr. Roberts to begin baking for his two dogs, Baxter and \nSabine, both rescued mixed-breeds. His passion for cooking soon led him \nto open Barkwheats, and he began making two varieties of all-natural \ndog biscuits: sea vegetables and chamomile, as well as ginger and \nparsley, the latter of which provides relief from dogs' bad breath.\n  In November 2007, Mr. Roberts began selling the biscuits at local \nfarmers markets and organic cooperatives in the midcoast Maine region, \nnear his home in Stockton Springs, as well as online. In very short \norder, the product gained immense popularity, due in large part to \ntourists who purchased the biscuits for their dogs. Upon returning \nhome, these people began clamoring for Barkwheats at their local \nstores. He now ships his biscuits to dozens of pet stores across the \ncountry, including as far away as Alaska. Additionally, Barkwheats' \nproducts have been featured in newspapers, blogs, and magazines across \nthe country, including Animal Wellness Magazine and ModernDog. To keep \nup with the demand, Mr. Roberts also purchased a machine that makes \n2,300 biscuits per hour!\n  Barkwheats biscuits are completely organic, and over 95 percent of \nthe ingredients come from local, Maine farmers in neighboring towns and \ncounties. To support the State's economy and ensure that all items are \nfresh, Mr. Roberts purchases buckwheat from farmers in Union, eggs from \nGouldsboro, parsley from Pittsfield, honey from Swanville, and even \nseaweed from off the Machias coast. Unable to find a farmer who \nproduced ginger locally, he collaborated with Sustainable Harvest \nInternational, a Maine company that helps Central American farmers \nimprove their lives while simultaneously restoring tropical forests, to \npurchase ginger from southern Belize. As a result of its efforts, \nBarkwheats Dog Biscuits is expected to be named the first Fair Trade \nCertified pet treat later this summer. Additionally, in an effort to \ncare for the environment, Barkwheats dog biscuits are packed in 100 \npercent compostable recycled boxes, as well as bags made from wood \npulp.\n  Chris Roberts' tasty treats represent a truly innovative way to \ncombine supporting the local economy and giving pet owners a healthy, \ngluten-free option for their dogs. I commend Chris Roberts for his \ninnovation and determination, and wish him continued success with his \nburgeoning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6443-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6443-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6443-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6443]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:54 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 885.

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging the National Collegiate Athletic \n     Association to abandon the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) \n     structure in favor of a college football playoff system; to \n     the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, the University of Utah football team finished the \n     2008 football season as the only undefeated football team in \n     Division I-A, with a perfect 13-0 record;\n       Whereas, the University of Utah football team capped a \n     season-long string of victories at the Sugar Bowl with an \n     impressive 31-17 win over the University of Alabama, which \n     held the number one ranking in the nation for five weeks;\n       Whereas, during the regular season, the Mountain West \n     Conference had three teams in the Top 25 and had a 6-1 record \n     against Pac-10 teams;\n       Whereas. in the 2008 season, the University of Utah \n     football team defeated six bowl teams ranked in the Top 25, \n     and won seven games away from home;\n       Whereas, as the matter currently stands, the University \n     could go undefeated indefinitely and still not compete for a \n     national title;\n       Whereas, the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) began in 1998 \n     with the intent of crowning a definite national champion;\n       Whereas, the BCS relies on a combination of polls and \n     computer rankings to determine which teams play in the BCS \n     national championship game and help set the line-ups for the \n     most prestigious bowl games.\n       Whereas, although the BCS may be an improvement over past \n     championship determinations, the system is still widely \n     acknowledged as falling short of its goal of establishing a \n     definitive college football champion;\n       Whereas, many experts have candidly criticized the flaws in \n     the BCS system and often use the 2008 University of Utah \n     football team as the strongest argument for the failings of \n     the system; and\n       Whereas, a national playoff is the only way to be certain \n     that the team crowned as national champion has earned the \n     designation on the gridiron: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the State of Utah \n     strongly urges the National Collegiate Athletic Association \n     to abandon the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) structure for \n     determining the Division I-A national football champion in \n     favor of a playoff system so that all can be assured that the \n     best college football team is the one crowned as national \n     champion; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     National Collegiate Athletic Association, the BCS, the \n     University of Utah football team, to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation, and to President Barack Obama.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-29. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah expressing support for the current \n     Bureau of Land Management resource management plans and the \n     process used to complete the plans; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       Whereas, because the nation's dependence on foreign sources \n     of energy leaves the economy vulnerable, serious effort must \n     be devoted to decrease the nation's dependency on foreign \n     energy sources;\n       Whereas, oil and natural gas form an essential bridge to \n     attaining a future of energy independence sustained by \n     alternative and renewable energy sources;\n       Whereas, the Federal Land Policy and Management Act (Act) \n     mandates that the Federal Bureau of Land Management (BLM) \n     manage public lands for multiple uses such as outdoor \n     recreation, livestock grazing, energy exploration and \n     production, conservation, and timber production;\n       Whereas, the Act establishes that the BLM sustain the \n     health, diversity, and, productivity of public lands for the \n     use and enjoyment of present and future generations;\n       Whereas, in making decisions about land use, the Act \n     requires the BLM to develop resource management plans and \n     update them periodically;\n       Whereas, these important land use management decision \n     documents require public input and participation;\n       Whereas, managing the nation's cherished public lands for \n     multiple uses is a constant challenge;\n       Whereas, citizens expect the BLM to provide responsible \n     energy and minerals development, recreational opportunities, \n     appropriate access, and healthy landscapes, while still \n     providing an adequate level of resource protection to ensure \n     that future generations will continue to benefit from and \n     enjoy these areas;\n       Whereas, the resource management plan process, developed by \n     the BLM to accomplish these goals, is thorough, deliberative \n     and very public;\n       Whereas, resource management plans provide administrative \n     protections to some lands, including major constraints such \n     as no surface occupancy and disturbance timing stipulations;\n       Whereas, extensive state and community input is invited and \n     submitted both in writing and through the public hearing \n     process;\n       Whereas, resource management plans for the Moab, Richfield, \n     Price, Vernal, Monticello, and Kanab Field Offices recently \n     went into effect after approximately eight years of \n     development and review;\n       Whereas, hundreds of thousands of public comments were \n     considered during the Enrolled Copy planning process;\n       Whereas, new environmental restrictions included in the \n     resource management plans provide multiple layers of \n     safeguards to prevent environmental damage to sensitive \n     natural resources;\n       Whereas, the proposed plans envision maintaining areas open \n     to oil and gas leasing, but also institute protective \n     measures during development like timing limitations, best \n     management practices, and advanced technology to minimize the \n     footprint of developing important resources;\n       Whereas, there was no cutting of corners or abridgment of \n     processes in preparing the resource management plans;\n       Whereas, due to the strong feelings regarding the use of \n     public lands, every private group and government entity \n     involved in the process would like to see some changes in the \n     outcome, but all groups were heard and their concerns given \n     thoughtful and careful consideration;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah and Uintah, Duchesne, Grand, \n     Emery, San Juan, Sevier, Garfield, Kane, Wayne, Piute, and \n     Carbon Counties were cooperating agencies in the BLM's \n     development of the current resource management plans and have \n     interests in preserving the plans;\n       Whereas, upon approval of these management plans, the BLM \n     offered for lease parcels of land which had been set aside \n     for several years pending completion of the resource \n     management plans;\n       Whereas, leases do not convey an unlimited right to explore \n     or an unlimited right to develop oil and gas resources, but \n     are subject to terms designed to minimize and mitigate the \n     impacts of development;\n       Whereas, in addition to proposing an accommodation for the \n     nation's pressing need for energy development, the plans also \n     propose protecting public lands within the six planning areas \n     where there are sensitive natural resources, making these \n     lands off limits to surface disturbing activities and \n     unavailable to oil and gas leasing;\n       Whereas, this type of protection would extend to almost one \n     million acres of public land in addition to nearly two \n     million acres of existing wilderness study areas;\n       Whereas, a lawsuit has been filed challenging the legality \n     of the BLM's December 19, 2008, sale of oil and gas leases;\n       Whereas, the state has been granted permission by the Court \n     to defend its interests in the lawsuit by participating as an \n     intervenor;\n\n[[Page S6445]]\n\n       Whereas, on February 4, 2008, the United States Department \n     of the Interior rejected the bids offered on 77 of the oil \n     and gas leases presented at the December lease sale; and\n       Whereas, the lawsuit and the oil and gas lease rejections \n     strike at the heart of a careful, deliberative, lengthy \n     public process to develop resource management plans that \n     would benefit Utahns and the citizens of the United States: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, express strong support for the \n     Federal Bureau of Land Management's resource management plans \n     developed for the Moab, Richfield, Price, Vernal, Monticello, \n     and Kanab, Utah Field Offices, and most particularly for the \n     lengthy, thoughtful, and public process used to develop the \n     plans; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor oppose \n     current actions taken that may contest and delay \n     implementation of the resource management plans; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor request \n     that the Department of the Interior expedite a review of the \n     77 bid-rejected parcels to determine which may be offered for \n     leasing in the near future; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     United States Department of the Interior, the Federal Bureau \n     of Land Management and its Utah office, the Southern Utah \n     Wilderness Alliance, the Uintah, Duchesne, Grand, Emery, San \n     Juan Sevier, Garfield, Kane, Wayne, Piute, and Carbon County \n     Commissions, the Moab, Richfield, Price, Vernal, Monticello, \n     and Kanab City Councils, the Utah Public Lands Policy \n     Coordination Office, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-30. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah supporting the establishment of an \n     Alternative Energy Training Center in Beaver County, Utah; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 10\n\n       Whereas, the United States relies heavily on foreign \n     sources of energy;\n       Whereas, to sustain economic growth in the state and \n     throughout the nation, it will be necessary to invest \n     resources in all forms of power generation, including \n     traditional sources such as coal, natural gas, and nuclear as \n     well as renewable resources such as geothermal, wind, and \n     solar;\n       Whereas, the Utah Renewable Energy Zones Task Force Phase I \n     Report indicates that theoretical potential resources within \n     Utah include 16,500 fifty megawatt solar renewable energy \n     zones, 51 wind renewable energy zones with a combined \n     generating capacity of approximately 9,145 megawatts, and a \n     total of 2,166 megawatts of geothermal development potential, \n     the bulk of which is located in rural Utah;\n       Whereas, with the Blundell Geothermal Plant, the newly \n     commissioned Thermo Hot Springs Plant, and the more than 200 \n     megawatt First Wind Project which is currently being \n     developed, Beaver County has either under construction or in \n     production close to 300 megawatts of renewable resource \n     generating capacity, and many of the state's most significant \n     undeveloped resources converge in Beaver County;\n       Whereas, as renewable generation becomes more widespread in \n     the region, there will be a need to provide training \n     opportunities to people working in that industry;\n       Whereas, the Milford High School Technology Department has \n     played a key role in attracting investment in renewable \n     energy generation to the Southwest region of the state and \n     has led the way in preparing young people for promising \n     careers in that industry;\n       Whereas, the Southwest Applied Technology College in Cedar \n     City is offering classes related to renewable energy in \n     Milford;\n       Whereas, Milford is an ideal site for a certified renewable \n     energy training center because it has a core of leaders who \n     are willing to make the region the center of renewable energy \n     generation in the state and are prepared to meet any energy \n     goal the state sets;\n       Whereas, as resource development expands, production of the \n     components of solar generation, wind turbines, and similar \n     equipment also provides opportunities for new and expanded \n     manufacturing businesses in rural Utah where economic \n     development is desperately needed and will increase the need \n     for trained workers;\n       Whereas, the construction of utility scale renewable energy \n     projects provides unprecedented economic development \n     opportunities for counties lacking traditional energy \n     producing resources; and\n       Whereas, providing a training center in Utah for renewable \n     energy resource technologies and jobs will enable Utahns to \n     better compete for these new energy resource jobs: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses its support for the development and certification \n     of an Alternative Energy Training Center in Beaver County; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Beaver County Commission, the Milford High School Technology \n     Department, Utah's Energy Advisor, the State Energy Program, \n     the Southwest Applied Technology College, Rocky Mountain \n     Power, First Wind, Raser Technologies, and to the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-31. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah supporting new nuclear power development in \n     Utah; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 16\n\n       Whereas, Utah and the surrounding western states have \n     experienced increased new electricity demands and have \n     forecasted continued increases over the next several decades;\n       Whereas, Utah requires affordable and abundant energy for \n     homes and businesses to maintain and grow its economy;\n       Whereas, Utah and the surrounding areas will likely suffer \n     significant financial difficulties without new reliable and \n     affordable electric generating resources being built, adding \n     to and prolonging the depressed economy;\n       Whereas, Utah enjoys and continues to rely on cost \n     effective coal fired power plants for 85% of its electric \n     generation;\n       Whereas, Utah's ability to build any new significant coal \n     fired power plants is limited;\n       Whereas, new emission controls, carbon capture technology, \n     carbon sequestration, and advance coal combustion \n     technologies should be encouraged, but are not projected to \n     be commercially feasible and cost effective for at least 25 \n     years;\n       Whereas, new natural gas electric generation could increase \n     the volatility of retail electric prices and retail natural \n     gas prices;\n       Whereas, hydro power resources are constrained and not \n     expected to expand in capacity;\n       Whereas, nationwide nuclear power provides low cost, long \n     term, stable retail and wholesale pricing for customers;\n       Whereas, the United States Congress and the United States \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission worked together to improve the \n     old process for licensing new nuclear power plants;\n       Whereas, the new nuclear power plant licensing process \n     presently includes a ``one step'' Combined Operating License \n     (COL) procedure, which combines construction and operating \n     license applications and reviews into a single process;\n       Whereas, the new licensing process is more efficient, \n     predictable, and reliable;\n       Whereas, three Early Site Permits for new nuclear plants, \n     one of the new licensing processes now in place, have been \n     issued with little or no delays from adjudication;\n       Whereas, the estimated time frame to complete a new nuclear \n     COL is five years;\n       Whereas, the development of nuclear power plants will \n     provide significant economic benefits to the local, regional, \n     and state populations in the form of many high paying jobs \n     and additional tax revenues;\n       Whereas, the construction of a new nuclear facility would \n     inject billion of dollars into Utah's economy in the form of \n     3,500 construction jobs during a two unit construction period \n     spanning up to seven years;\n       Whereas, one proposed site in Utah would contribute over $2 \n     million in 2009 to the State Institutional Trust Lands Fund;\n       Whereas, operations of two new generation units would \n     provide approximately 800 jobs for highly skilled workers \n     over the plant's 60 year projected lifetime;\n       Whereas, the needed regulatory and legal framework to \n     deploy safe, secure, and cost competitive nuclear power in \n     Utah is in place;\n       Whereas, Utah already has a nuclear reactor at the \n     University of Utah;\n       Whereas, the University of Utah Training Research and \n     Isotope Production, General Atomics research reactor in Salt \n     Lake City has been operating safely since 1975;\n       Whereas, the United States' nuclear industry has \n     accumulated almost 3,400 reactor years of operation since the \n     first plant started up in 1957 without serious injury or \n     death to a single member of the public;\n       Whereas, the current practice of storing spent fuel in wet \n     or dry storage containers at a nuclear power plant has been \n     proven safe since commercial nuclear power began in 1957;\n       Whereas, 95% of the energy from a nuclear reactor's spent \n     fuel has significant value and can be reprocessed or recycled \n     for use as fuel in the future when this option is \n     commercialized in the United States;\n       Whereas, spent fuel from a nuclear reactor is valuable;\n       Whereas, France, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and \n     Germany currently recycle or reprocess spent fuel \n     successfully; and\n       Whereas, there is no scientific or safety rationale \n     requiring the near term movement of spent fuel from the power \n     plants where it is generated, and fuel can be safely and \n     securely stored on site for up to 100 years without \n     environmental impacts:, Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah urges \n     that new nuclear power development be pursued within the \n     boundaries of the state; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges that commercial \n     development of new nuclear power be pursued in the state due \n     to its beneficial impact on the economy, fuel \n     diversification, and the environment, and its impressive \n     operational safety and security record, in particular the \n     fact that no member of the public has been seriously injured \n     by operation of the 104 nuclear power plants currently \n     operating in the United States; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature declares that nuclear power \n     has been shown to be a\n\n[[Page S6446]]\n\n     viable cost effective option, that current rate payer \n     protection laws and regulations are sufficient, and that no \n     new legislation or special action is needed for the Public \n     Service Commission to recognize nuclear power as a prudent \n     investment; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes that no \n     appropriations are needed for special committees or programs \n     to determine whether a nuclear power plant can be built in \n     Utah because the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission \n     will review and adjudicate the licensing, as needed, and \n     nuclear developers will pay for those costs; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature encourages investor-owned \n     and municipally owned utilities and power marketers and \n     traders to consider participating in a nuclear power project \n     in Utah; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recognizes commercial \n     nuclear power plants as market-based, commercially \n     competitive enterprises due to their safety and security \n     record, the science and performance data, and the economic \n     performance of the present power plants;

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Legislature of the State of Utah urging Congress and the \n     Bureau of Reclamation to support development of the Narrows \n     Water Project in Central Utah; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n       Whereas, water is fundamental to the economic base of \n     Central Utah communities, and reliable water storage is \n     necessary for both agricultural and municipal development;\n       Whereas, agricultural and municipal interests in Central \n     Utah, including Sanpete County, suffer substantial economic \n     hardship because of the lack of water storage facilities;\n       Whereas, in the early 1900s, local, state, and federal \n     government officials acknowledged the need for water storage \n     in Sanpete County and began efforts to develop the Narrows \n     Water Project;\n       Whereas, reliable studies by multiple expert water \n     engineering firms have determined the Narrows Water Project \n     to be the least expensive, most cost-effective, and most \n     environmentally sound means of storing water for Sanpete \n     County;\n       Whereas, various studies, including a recent independent \n     study by Utah State University, show Sanpete County to be \n     among Utah's most effective users of modern conservation \n     methods to conserve the water that is presently available to \n     the county;\n       Whereas, the Bureau of Reclamation recognized the need for \n     water storage in Sanpete County, and as early as the 1930s \n     proposed a plan that would provide water storage for both \n     Sanpete and Carbon Counties;\n       Whereas, the component of the Bureau of Reclamation's plan \n     that would provide water storage for Sanpete County was never \n     implemented, initially due to a disruption caused by World \n     War II, and more recently by various questions regarding \n     ownership of the water;\n       Whereas, numerous judicial decisions have now clearly \n     established and defined the water rights involved in the \n     Narrows Water Project;\n       Whereas, legal agreements between Sanpete County, Carbon \n     County, the state of Utah, and various federal entities have \n     recognized Carbon and Sanpete Counties' water rights from \n     Gooseberry Creek; and\n       Whereas, the residents of Sanpete County, at great \n     financial sacrifice, have waited for almost a century for the \n     Narrows Water Project water storage facility that was \n     promised to them: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the state of Utah expresses \n     support for the Narrows Water Project in Central Utah; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Senate urges Congress and the United \n     States Bureau of Reclamation to support the development of \n     the Narrows Water Project in Central Utah; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Bureau of Reclamation and to Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-33. A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah supporting producing hydrogen from coal \n     with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 12\n\n       Whereas, coal is one of Utah's most abundant resources and \n     contributes substantially to Utah's economy;\n       Whereas, coal is an affordable base load fuel providing \n     reliable electric power;\n       Whereas, demonstration of advanced coal technology for \n     power generation can accelerate the development of the \n     hydrogen energy economy in Utah;\n       Whereas, producing hydrogen from coal with carbon capture \n     and sequestration (CCS) for newly permitted developments is \n     one possible technology, among many, that has the potential \n     to reduce carbon emissions and help protect and grow Utah's \n     economy while continuing a strong commitment to a clean \n     environment;\n       Whereas, advanced hydrogen from coal technology and CCS \n     technology as proposed for potential next generation power \n     plants in Utah would produce fewer carbon emissions than \n     conventionally fueled power plants;\n       Whereas, the new advanced coal technology gasifies coal to \n     produce a mixture of carbon dioxide, hydrogen, and other \n     gases;\n       Whereas, the clean burning hydrogen can be used to fuel a \n     power plant and the carbon dioxide can be captured and stored \n     using geologic sequestration technology;\n       Whereas, CCS technology provides for the removal of carbon \n     dioxide from fuel gases, reducing emission into the \n     atmosphere;\n       Whereas, CCS technology will be crucial to reducing \n     emission of carbon dioxide from newly permitted power plants \n     specifically designed to use CCS technology while still \n     meeting growing energy demand in a responsible manner with \n     domestic fuel;\n       Whereas, CCS technology can be important to maintain Utah's \n     position as a leader in energy technology and production;\n       Whereas, CCS technology will enable Utah to use its \n     abundant coal resources while still meeting potential new \n     regulations limiting carbon emissions and protecting and \n     creating high-paying jobs in Utah;\n       Whereas, Utah's geological characteristics support \n     sequestration technology;\n       Whereas, Utah is uniquely positioned to potentially lead \n     and benefit from hydrogen production from coal and CCS \n     technology;\n       Whereas, Utah's support of producing hydrogen from coal and \n     CCS technology could place Utah businesses at the forefront \n     of the new hydrogen and carbon economies;\n       Whereas, the state welcomes the potential jobs, tax base, \n     economic enhancements and leadership position that could come \n     with supporting advanced coal technology with CCS;\n       Whereas, the Public Service Commission should consider \n     authorizing the recovery of cost-effective and prudently \n     incurred costs that reduce carbon emissions;\n       Whereas, the Public Service Commission should consider \n     hydrogen production from coal and CCS technology to be a \n     reasonable investment for protecting the long-term interests \n     of Utah's utility rate payers;\n       Whereas, the Legislature supports approving cost recovery \n     of cost-effective and prudent investment in these \n     technologies as determined by the Public Service Commission; \n     and\n       Whereas, the Legislature supports resolving liability \n     issues stemming from future adverse effects of sequestered \n     carbon and believes the federal government is in the best \n     position to provide a comprehensive liability solution: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses support for producing hydrogen production from coal \n     with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology as a \n     means of strengthening Utah's economy and helping Utah to \n     stand at the forefront of energy production; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature urges the Public Service \n     Commission to consider authorizing recovery of cost-effective \n     and prudently incurred costs that reduce carbon emissions and \n     increase Utah's and the nation's energy security; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature recommends that the Public \n     Service Commission consider hydrogen production from coal and \n     CCS technology to be a reasonable investment for protecting \n     the long-term interests of Utah's utility rate payers; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature supports approving cost \n     recovery of cost-effective and prudent investment in these \n     technologies as determined by the Public Service Commission;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah urging Congress to preserve the exemption \n     for hydraulic fracturing in the Safe Drinking Water Act and \n     to refrain from passing legislation that would remove the \n     hydraulic fracturing exemption; to the Committee on \n     Environment and Public Works.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 17\n\n       Whereas, the United States Congress passed the Safe \n     Drinking Water Act (Act) to assure the protection of the \n     nation's drinking water sources;\n       Whereas, since the enactment of the Act, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) has never interpreted hydraulic \n     fracturing as constituting ``underground injection'' within \n     the Act;\n       Whereas, in 2004, the EPA published a final report \n     summarizing a study to evaluate the potential threat to \n     underground sources of drinking water from hydraulic \n     fracturing of coal bed methane production wells and the EPA \n     concluded that ``additional or further study is not warranted \n     at this time . . .'' and ``that the injection of hydraulic \n     fracturing fluids into coal bed methane wells poses minimal \n     threat'' to underground sources of drinking water;\n       Whereas, in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, the United \n     States Congress explicitly exempted hydraulic fracturing from \n     the provisions of the Act;\n       Whereas, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission \n     (IOGCC) conducted a survey of oil and gas producing states \n     which found that there were no known cases of groundwater \n     contamination associated with hydraulic fracturing;\n       Whereas, hydraulic fracturing is currently, and has been \n     for decades, a common operation used in exploration and \n     production by the oil and gas industry in all the member \n     states of the IOGCC without groundwater damage;\n       Whereas, approximately 35,000 wells are hydraulically \n     fractured in the United States annually, and close to \n     1,000,000 wells have been hydraulically fractured in the \n     United States since the technique's inception, with no known \n     harm to groundwater;\n       Whereas, the regulation of oil and gas exploration and \n     production activities, including hydraulic fracturing, has \n     traditionally been the province of the states;\n       Whereas, the Act was never intended to grant to the federal \n     government authority to regulate oil and gas drilling and \n     production operations, such as ``hydraulic fracturing,'' \n     under the Underground Injection Control program;\n       Whereas, the member states of the IOGCC have adopted \n     comprehensive laws and regulations to provide safe operations \n     and to protect the nation's drinking water sources, and have \n     trained personnel to effectively regulate oil and gas \n     exploration and production;\n       Whereas, production of coal seam natural gas, natural gas \n     from shale formations, and natural gas from tight \n     conventional reservoirs is increasingly important to our \n     domestic natural gas supply and will be even more important \n     in the future;\n       Whereas, domestic production of natural gas will ensure \n     that the United States continues on the path to energy \n     independence;\n       Whereas, hydraulic fracturing plays a major role in the \n     development of virtually all unconventional oil and gas \n     resources and, in the absence of any evidence that such \n     fracturing has damaged the environment, should not be \n     limited;\n       Whereas, regulation of hydraulic fracturing as underground \n     injection under the Act would impose significant \n     administrative costs on the state and substantially increase \n     the cost of drilling oil and gas wells with no resulting \n     environmental benefits; and\n       Whereas, regulation of hydraulic fracturing as underground \n     injection under the Act would increase energy costs to the \n     consumer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses support for maintaining the exemption of hydraulic \n     fracturing in the Safe Drinking Water Act and urges the \n     United States Congress to refrain from passing legislation \n     that would remove the exemption for hydraulic fracturing; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, and to the members of Utah's \n     congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-36. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Utah urging the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to address the problems associated with its \n     configuration of nonattainment areas relating to Utah; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, on December 23, 2008, the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) published county nonattainment \n     designations for the federal air quality standard (NAAQS) for \n     the fine particulate known as PM2.5;\n       Whereas, the EPA designated a total of three PM2.5 \n     nonattainment areas within the state;\n       Whereas, the first area is Utah County; the second area is \n     Salt Lake, Davis, and Weber Counties and portions of Box \n     Elder and Tooele Counties; and the third area is Cache County \n     and Franklin County, Idaho;\n       Whereas, designating areas two and three as nonattainment \n     areas is contrary to the designations originally recommended \n     by the state;\n       Whereas, the state has made a strong commitment to \n     conservation and protection of the environment, and Utahns \n     place a high value on the state's natural resources, \n     including clean air;\n       Whereas, the state is also growing both in terms of \n     population and businesses that offer jobs to local residents;\n       Whereas, Utahns are concerned not only with being good \n     stewards of their natural environment, but also fostering \n     strong economic development;\n       Whereas, the state recommendation for designation for \n     certain counties as nonattainment for PM2.5 will lead to an \n     accurate, timely, and fair resolution of PM2.5 nonattainment \n     issues;\n       Whereas, the result may create a misperception that Utah \n     has a bigger and more wide-spread air quality problem than is \n     actually true;\n       Whereas, the current nonattainment area designations made \n     by the EPA have created several problems that must be \n     rectified as soon as possible;\n       Whereas, one of the PM2.5 nonattainment areas designated by \n     the EPA includes all or a portion of five counties, and these \n     overly broad designations should be pared back;\n       Whereas, the EPA should not designate areas as \n     nonattainment until it has actual monitoring data justifying \n     such a designation;\n       Whereas, in the case of Box Elder and Tooele Counties, it \n     is clear that the designations include areas that have \n     pristine air quality and do not exceed the NAAQS;\n       Whereas, for example, the portion of Tooele County \n     designated ``nonattainment'' by the EPA includes the Deseret \n     Peak Wilderness Area within the Stansbury Mountain Range;\n       Whereas, air quality in this wilderness area is widely \n     known to be excellent, particularly in and around the \n     pristine areas of the 11,000 foot Deseret Peak;\n       Whereas, there is no reason for the EPA to create a \n     nonattainment area in a national wilderness area;\n       Whereas, one of the PM2.5 nonattainment areas designated by \n     the EPA includes both Cache County in Utah and Franklin \n     County in Idaho, creating a single nonattainment area with \n     jurisdiction under agencies of two different states, and the \n     EPA further creates a nonattainment area under the \n     jurisdiction of two different EPA regions, Region 8 and \n     Region 10; and\n       Whereas, interstate designations should be eliminated and \n     the EPA should either divide the designation into two \n     nonattainment areas or agree that Cache County can be \n     redesignated attainment for PM2.5 on its own, with oversight \n     solely by EPA Region 8, if monitoring data shows that the \n     NAAQS has not been exceeded: Now, therefore be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, urge the EPA to adopt the \n     recommendation for PM2.5 designation as proposed by the state \n     of Utah; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     United States Environmental Protection Agency, the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation, and to the Utah Department \n     of Environmental Quality.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-37.

to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                   House Concurrent Resolution No. 6\n\n       Whereas, over the past 35 years, the federal Clean Water \n     Act, supported by other federal, state, and local laws, has \n     governed the nation's waters and has helped ensure that \n     Americans enjoy the cleanest rivers and lakes in the world;\n\n[[Page S6448]]\n\n       Whereas, this landmark statute, further explained and \n     clarified by subsequent Supreme Court cases, has struck a \n     proper balance between clean water and state, local, and \n     federal regulatory authority and responsibilities, while at \n     the same time recognizing and protecting state primacy over \n     water jurisdiction;\n       Whereas, the proposed Clean Water Restoration Act of 2007, \n     H.R. 2421 and S. 1870, and similar legislation, attempts to \n     make extreme changes to the Clean Water Act and threatens to \n     destroy the careful inter-governmental balance that has been \n     the hallmark of the law throughout its long history;\n       Whereas, the proposed federal legislation would change \n     federal jurisdiction over water by expanding the definition \n     from ``navigable'' to ``waters of the United States'' over \n     which federal jurisdiction extends;\n       Whereas, that language change would allow federal reach to \n     explicitly include ``all interstate and intrastate waters and \n     their tributaries . . .'', essentially establishing under \n     federal law that all wet areas within a state, or areas that \n     have been wet at some time, would fall under federal \n     regulatory authority, including groundwater, ditches, pipes, \n     streets, gutters, desert features, and even pools and \n     puddles;\n       Whereas, this legislation would give the United States \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the United States \n     Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) authority over ``all \n     interstate and intrastate waters,'' including non-navigable \n     waters, thereby granting to Congress authority far beyond the \n     original scope of the Clean Water Act;\n       Whereas, this legislation patently exceeds Congress's \n     constitutional powers, as ``non-navigable'' waters are \n     unlikely to fall under the Commerce Clause, the principle-\n     enumerated power upon which Congress has relied for passage \n     of environmental laws;\n       Whereas, this legislation would dramatically expand the \n     reach of the federal bureaucracy, would fundamentally erode \n     the ability of state and local governments to manage their \n     own water resources, and would cause an avalanche of new \n     unfunded mandates to envelope state and local governments;\n       Whereas, this legislation would essentially grant the EPA \n     and the Corps veto authority over local land use policies, \n     and would grant the EPA and the Corps authority to regulate \n     virtually all activities, private or public, that may affect \n     ``waters of the United States,'' regardless of whether the \n     activity is occurring in, or may impact, water at all;\n       Whereas, this legislation would eliminate existing \n     regulatory limitations that allow common sense uses, \n     including prior converted cropland and waste treatment \n     systems, since the proposed definition does not include any \n     regulatory limitations;\n       Whereas, this omission is particularly important because \n     the existing rules acknowledge two important limitations \n     covering prior converted cropland and waste treatment systems \n     designed to meet Clean Water Act requirements;\n       Whereas, this legislation's expanded definition would \n     burden state and local governments administratively and \n     financially and would thrust unfunded mandates on state and \n     local governments by imposing significant new administrative \n     responsibilities upon them;\n       Whereas, this legislation would require changes at the \n     state level by impacting comprehensive land use plans, \n     floodplain regulations, building and special codes, and \n     watershed and storm water plans;\n       Whereas, local governments will also be impacted because \n     they are responsible for a number of public infrastructure \n     projects, including water supply, solid waste disposal, road \n     and drainage channel maintenance, storm water detention, \n     mosquito control, and construction projects; and\n       Whereas, local government efforts to carry out maintenance \n     of government-owned buildings, including hospitals, schools, \n     and municipal offices, could also be adversely impacted: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah, the \n     Governor concurring therein, express its strong opposition to \n     any federal legislation that would expand the reach and scope \n     of the Clean Water Act, and express their commitment to the \n     goals and objectives of the original Act to keep our waters \n     clean; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor assert that \n     it is not in the nation's interest to regulate ditches, \n     culverts and pipes, desert washes, dry arroyos, farmland, and \n     treatment ponds as ``waters of the United States'' and \n     therefore subjecting these waters to all of the requirements \n     of federal regulation; be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature and the Governor call upon \n     Congress to preserve the traditional power of states over \n     land and water use and avoid unnecessary alterations to the \n     regulatory reach of the Clean Water Act amendments as \n     proposed in the Clean Water Restoration Act of 2007 and \n     similar federal legislation;

A joint resolution adopted by the Legislature of \n     the State of Utah supporting congressional action related to \n     the Navajo Nation's ability to collect and track child \n     support payments; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n\n                      House Joint Resolution No. 5\n\n       Whereas, the Navajo Nation is the largest Native American \n     tribe within the boundaries of the United States and is \n     larger than ten of the 50 states;\n       Whereas, Navajo children under the age of 18 comprise \n     almost half the total population, and some 61% of Navajo \n     grandparents are responsible for grandchildren under the age \n     of 18;\n       Whereas, over half the population of the Navajo Nation \n     lives below the poverty level, an over 40% of persons on the \n     Navajo Nation are unemployed;\n       Whereas, collecting child support for children whose \n     parents are able to pay child support may be critical in the \n     health and education of a good portion of Navajo children;\n       Whereas, the federal government granted the Navajo Nation \n     and 39 other tribes the ability to collect child support, \n     establish paternity, and enforce child and medical support \n     obligations, but did not grant the Navajo Nation access to \n     information essential for investigation and enforcement;\n\n[[Page S6451]]\n\n       Whereas, the federal government has suggested that some \n     states charge the Navajo Nation for access to important \n     personal files of potential payers of child support;\n       Whereas, the Navajo Nation has collected almost $3,000,000 \n     in past-due child support and received more than 10,000 \n     acknowledgments of paternity for Navajo children; and\n       Whereas, the Navajo Nation department of child support \n     enforcement has collected a total of $7,248,237 in child \n     support during fiscal year 2007: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     encourage Utah's congressional delegation to take appropriate \n     steps on behalf of the Navajo Nation to increase its \n     effectiveness in child support collection and enforcement; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That Utah's congressional delegation is urged to \n     encourage the federal government to include the Navajo Nation \n     in a web access pilot program to obtain information critical \n     to collection of child support for Navajo children; be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That copies of this resolution be transmitted to:\n       (1) the members of Utah's congressional delegation;\n       (2) the president of the Navajo Nation;\n       (3) the speaker of the house of the Navajo Nation; and\n       (4) the secretary of human services for the Navajo Nation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-45. A resolution adopted by the Legislature of the \n     State of Utah opposing the REAL ID Act of 2005 and its \n     implementation of a national identification card; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                         House Resolution No. 4\n\n       Whereas, the state of Utah recognizes the Constitution of \n     the United States as the nation's charter of liberty, and \n     that the Bill of Rights enshrines the fundamental and \n     inalienable rights of Americans, including privacy and \n     freedom from unreasonable searches;\n       Whereas, each of Utah's duly elected public servants has \n     sworn to defend and uphold the United States Constitution and \n     the Constitution of the state of Utah;\n       Whereas, the state of Utah denounces and condemns all acts \n     of terrorism by any entity, wherever the acts occur;\n       Whereas, terrorist attacks against Americans, like those on \n     September 11, 2001, have necessitated the crafting of \n     effective laws to protect citizens of the United States and \n     others from terrorist attacks;\n       Whereas, any new security measures of federal, state, or \n     local governments should be carefully designed and employed \n     to enhance public safety without infringing on the civil \n     liberties and rights of innocent citizens of Utah and the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, Title II of the REAL ID Act of 2005 creates a \n     national identification card by requiring that uniform \n     information be placed on every states' driver license, \n     requiring that the information be machine readable in a \n     standard format, and requiring that the card be used for any \n     federal purpose, including air travel;\n       Whereas, REAL ID will be a costly unfunded mandate that the \n     Department of Homeland Security estimates will, over the next \n     ten years, cost states 3.9 billion dollars and individuals \n     5.8 billion dollars;\n       Whereas, regulations made by the Department of Homeland \n     Security do not adequately address fundamental burdens that \n     the statute imposes on states and individuals, or violations \n     of privacy and constitutional rights;\n       Whereas, REAL ID requires the creation of a massive public \n     sector database containing the driver license information on \n     every American with a license, accessible to every state \n     motor vehicle employee and every state and federal law \n     enforcement officer;\n       Whereas, REAL ID enables the creation of an additional \n     massive private sector database of driver license information \n     gained from scanning the machine-readable information \n     contained on every driver license;\n       Whereas, these public and private databases are certain to \n     contain numerous errors and false information, creating \n     significant hardships for Americans attempting to verify \n     their identity in order to fly, open a bank account, or \n     perform any of the numerous functions required to live in the \n     United States today;\n       Whereas, the Federal Trade Commission estimates that 10 \n     million Americans are victims of identity theft annually;\n       Whereas, these identity thieves are increasingly targeting \n     motor vehicle departments;\n       Whereas, REAL ID will facilitate the crime of identity \n     theft by making the personal information of all Americans, \n     including name, date of birth, gender, driver license or \n     identification card number, digital photograph, address, and \n     signature accessible from tens of thousands of locations;\n       Whereas, REAL ID requires driver licenses to contain actual \n     home addresses and makes only limited provisions for securing \n     personal information for individuals in potential danger such \n     as undercover police officers and victims of domestic \n     violence, stalking, or criminal harassment;\n       Whereas, REAL ID contains no exemption for religion, limits \n     religious liberty, and tramples the beliefs of groups like \n     the Amish and certain Evangelical Christians;\n       Whereas, REAL ID contains onerous record verification and \n     retention provisions that place unreasonable burdens on both \n     Utah's Motor Vehicle Division and on third parties required \n     to verify records;\n       Whereas, REAL ID will likely place enormous burdens on \n     individuals seeking a new driver license, including longer \n     lines, higher costs, increased document requests, and a \n     waiting period;\n       Whereas, REAL ID was passed without sufficient deliberation \n     by Congress and never received a hearing by a congressional \n     committee or any vote solely on its merits;\n       Whereas, REAL ID eliminated a process of negotiated \n     rulemaking initiated under the Intelligence Reform and \n     Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004, which had convened federal, \n     state, and local policymakers, privacy advocates, and \n     industry experts to address the misuse of identity documents;\n       Whereas, more than 600 organizations opposed the passage of \n     REAL ID, including the Utah Chapter of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union and the Utah Eagle Forum; and\n       Whereas, REAL ID would provide little security benefit and \n     still leave identifications systems open to insider fraud, \n     counterfeit documentation, and database failures: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives of the state of \n     Utah supports the United States Government's campaign against \n     terrorism and its commitment that the campaign not be waged \n     at the expense of essential civil rights and liberties of the \n     nation's citizens that are protected in the United States \n     Constitution, including the Bill of Rights; be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives opposes any \n     portion of the REAL ID Act that violates the rights and \n     liberties guaranteed under the Utah Constitution or the \n     United States Constitution, including the Bill of Rights; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives expresses its \n     opposition to state legislation, including appropriations, \n     that would further the REAL ID Act in Utah unless the \n     appropriation is used exclusively for the purpose of \n     undertaking a comprehensive analysis of the costs to \n     implement REAL ID, or to mount a constitutional challenge to \n     the Act by the state Attorney General; be it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges Utah's \n     congressional delegation to support measures to repeal Title \n     II of the REAL ID Act of 2005 and restore the negotiated \n     rulemaking process established under Section 7212 of the \n     Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004; be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives urges the \n     Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to not \n     penalize any state or its citizens for failure to comply with \n     the REAL ID Act pending further congressional consideration \n     of whether to repeal the Act and replace it with an act that \n     assists states in strengthening the security of their driver \n     license system without burdening the finances of the states \n     or the rights of the states' drivers; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     President of the United States, the Majority Leader of the \n     United States Senate, the Speaker of the United States House \n     of Representatives, the Secretary of the Department of \n     Homeland Security, Governor Huntsman, and the members of \n     Utah's congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n

A resolution adopted by Legislature of the State of \n     Utah expressing support for the construction of a museum and \n     civil liberties learning center in Delta, Utah, for the \n     purposes of preserving and educating about the Topaz \n     Internment Camp site; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     Senate Joint Resolution No. 2\n\n       Whereas, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed Executive \n     Order 9066 on February 19, 1942, authorizing the evacuation \n     of 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry from their homes in \n     portions of Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, and \n     Arizona to ten remote internment camps in Arkansas, Colorado, \n     Arizona, California, Idaho, Wyoming, and Utah;\n       Whereas, one of those camps, Topaz, located near Delta, \n     Utah, housed over 11,000 men, women, and children from \n     September 11, 1942, until October 31, 1945, and was Utah's \n     fifth largest city;\n       Whereas, over 25,000 Japanese Americans, many from Topaz, \n     served in the United States military during World War II and \n     suffered tremendous casualties while their families were \n     confined in the internment camps;\n       Whereas, President Ronald Reagan signed into law the Civil \n     Liberties Act of 1988, and President George H.W. Bush issued \n     a letter of apology and redress payments to the survivors of \n     these internment camps;\n       Whereas, the Topaz camp site must be preserved and \n     protected as part of the nation's commitment to equal justice \n     for all;\n       Whereas, the Topaz Museum Board, a non-profit agency, has \n     raised money to purchase 626 of the 640 acres of the site, \n     has sponsored pilgrimages and teachers' workshops, has \n     conducted Topaz Day for fourth graders in Millard County, has \n     restored a recreation hall from the camp, and collected \n     artifacts and oral histories, in an effort to preserve the \n     site and educate people about the internment of American \n     citizens;\n       Whereas, the Topaz site was declared a ``Save America's \n     Treasures'' project in 1999;\n       Whereas, the 2006 United States House of Representatives \n     passed HB 1492, which authorized the Secretary of the \n     Interior to create a program within the National Park Service \n     to further protect and provide funding for the ten internment \n     camp sites and other significant related areas;\n\n[[Page S6452]]\n\n       Whereas, Congressman Chris Cannon and Congressman Jim \n     Matheson joined 114 others to co-sponsor HB 1492;\n       Whereas, Senator Daniel Inouye introduced S1719 as a \n     companion bill to HB 1492, along with five co-sponsors, \n     including Senator Bob Bennett and Senator Orrin Hatch; and\n       Whereas, in 2007 the National Park Service declared the \n     Topaz site to be Utah's thirteenth National Historic \n     Landmark: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of the state of Utah \n     expresses support for the Topaz Museum Board's effort to \n     preserve and protect the site of the Topaz Internment Camp, \n     to build a museum and civil liberties learning center in \n     Delta, Utah, and to educate all citizens about Japanese \n     American internment history, especially Topaz, through \n     artifacts, exhibits, and oral histories; be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this resolution be sent to the \n     Topaz Museum Board, former Congressman Chris Cannon, Senator \n     Daniel Inouye, and the members of Utah's Congressional \n     Delegation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6452-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6452]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DODD for the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n       *Herbert M.

A bill to require prior Congressional approval and emergency \nfunding resulting in Government ownership of private entities; to the \nCommittee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to present a piece of legislation \nthat I believe the Senate should consider immediately. I believe this \nlegislation is so important that it can't wait. The legislation I \nintroduce today is the Free Enterprise Act of 2009, and its purpose is \nvery straightforward. The Free Enterprise Act of 2009 requires prior \ncongressional approval of any TARP funding that results in the \ngovernment taking a common or preferred equity interest in any private \nentity.\n  Since the inception of the TARP program, my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle, in a very bipartisan way, have voiced concerns over \nthe management, the oversight, and the purpose of TARP. Yet the program \ncontinues morphing and drifting away from its original purpose: to buy \ntoxic assets and keep credit flowing to consumers. That was the purpose \nof TARP when it was sold to Congress back in October. TARP was never \nintended--never intended--to be a revolving, $700 billion blank check \nfor the administration to use however it sees fit. Unfortunately, that \nis exactly what it has become.\n  First, the checks were used to bail out the banks, then to the \nstruggling insurance giant AIG, then to the floundering housing market, \nand despite a December vote by Congress that rejected--specifically \nrejected--a bailout of the auto industry, TARP funds are now being used \nto bankroll the auto industry.\n  I am quite certain most of my colleagues would have looked at me in \ndisbelief if I would have said a few months ago that TARP funds would \nessentially be used to buy a private auto company--General Motors--and \nthen rush it through bankruptcy. Yet last Monday the Obama \nadministration announced it would provide $30 billion more in TARP \nfunds to buy General Motors, owning a 60-percent interest in the \ncompany.\n  The bottom line is our government is now running or is very deeply \ninvolved in major industrial sectors, including housing, banking, \ninsurance, and now automobiles. There is no longer a clear distinction \nbetween companies owned by investors and entities owned and backed by \nthe government.\n  I am deeply troubled by the change in how business in America is \nconducted, and I am worried we are causing irreparable changes and \ndamage to our private market system. But I am equally troubled and \nworried that all these ownership and management decisions are being \nmade--literally buying a car company--without congressional input or \napproval.\n  Many may completely disagree with me and think the government should \nget in the auto business, that they should own a 60-percent stake in \nGeneral Motors or that the government should be a 34-percent owner of \nCitigroup. But the one thing all my colleagues should be able to agree \non is the fact that Congress needs checks and balances.\n  Right now, disagree or agree with me, none of us in Congress have had \na voice--neither a voice in support nor a voice in opposition. We woke \nup, just like the citizens of America, and found out that we own 60 \npercent of General Motors--a decision made by President Obama literally \nwith no oversight by Congress.\n  What has happened is the legislative branch has effectively given \nPresident Obama a free pass to do as he wishes with $700 billion. But \nwith the passage of this legislation, we can regain some type of \noversight over the disbursement of TARP funds. Let's not continue to \ncriticize the use and management of TARP funds and yet do nothing about \nit. Support for this legislation is an important step in the right \ndirection. It would ensure that Congress provides checks and balances. \nThat is what we were elected to deliver. That is why we are here.\n  At the very minimum, let's at least have a vote before the government \ntakes ownership of private companies. My bill only asks for a simple \nmajority governed by the normal rules of the Senate. But it makes a \nvery significant statement that Congress has not fallen asleep at the \nswitch.\n  I hope my colleagues will not choose to remain silently in their \nseats. We must fulfill our duties to provide oversight over the \nexecutive branch. That is what our Constitution demands. I urge my \ncolleagues, whether you support or oppose funds for private industry, \nto reclaim the role Congress has in this process. Doing anything less \nwould simply be a dereliction of our duty.\n  When I introduced this legislation as an amendment to S. 982, it \nquickly got 30 cosponsors. I am very happy to report that many of these \npeople have joined me as cosponsors, and we are nearing that number \nagain.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support this commonsense \nlegislation and join me as a cosponsor. We can work together to ensure \nthat free enterprise is not relegated to the back burner in this \ncountry, and, most important, we can work together, whether you agree \nor disagree, to make sure Congress is not relegated to the back burner. \nThe Free Enterprise Act is a positive step in that direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WARNER (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Cardin, and Mr. \n        Webb):\n  S. 1224. A bill to reauthorize the Chesapeake Bay Office of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's \nimportant programs to restore the Chesapeake Bay and its aquatic \nresources. This measure is a companion to H.R. 1771, a bill recently \nintroduced in the House by Representatives Sarbanes, Wittman and \nKratovil. Joining me in sponsoring this legislation are my colleagues \nSenator Webb from Virginia and Senators Mikulski and Cardin from \nneighboring Maryland.\n  Throughout my public career, I have been a strong advocate for \nprotecting our natural resources. One of the most important efforts in \nVirginia's environmental history has been preservation of the \nChesapeake Bay, the nation's most important estuary. I am proud that we \nbrought record funding to efforts related to cleaning the Chesapeake \nBay and the toughest regulations for water quality yet. The \nCommonwealth's 3,300 miles of coastal resources provide significant \neconomic\n\n[[Page S6455]]\n\ncontributions to tourism, recreation, commercial and sport fisheries, \nand wildlife enjoyment within our State. Yet the safety of the Bay is \nstill in great jeopardy; pollution, habitat loss and other factors have \ntaken their toll.\n  NOAA has been a principal partner with the Bay region states and \nother Federal agencies in efforts to protect and restore the Chesapeake \nBay ecosystem since 1984. Its mission is focusing NOAA capabilities in \nscience, service, and stewardship to protect and restore the Chesapeake \nBay. Congress formally authorized NOAA's participation in the Bay in \nPublic Law 98-210 enacted in 1992 and reauthorized the program in 2002, \nPublic Law 107-372. That authority expired 3 years ago, in 2006, and \nmust be reauthorized.\n  Over the years, NOAA's work in the Chesapeake Bay has focused on \nthree critical and interrelated areas--ecosystem science, coastal and \nliving resources management, and environmental education--all part of \nan ecosystem approach for Bay restoration and management. The agency's \nscience and research programs, conducted in collaboration with major \nacademic institutions, are helping decision-makers survey and assess \ntrends in living resources, understand and evaluate the responses of \nthese resources to changes in their environment, and establish \nmanagement goals and progress indicators. Through the Chesapeake Bay \nObserving System and the next-generation Chesapeake Bay Integrated Buoy \nSystem, NOAA is providing monitoring data on environmental conditions \nand water quality in the Bay necessary to track Bay restoration \nprogress. The NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office's fish, shellfish and habitat \nrestoration programs are helping to restore native oysters, blue crabs, \nand bay grasses throughout the watershed. And NOAA's pioneering Bay \nWatershed Education and Training program, B-WET, is making hands-on \nwatershed education and training available to students and teachers \nthroughout the watershed, bringing marine and weather sciences into the \nclassroom and helping to foster stewardship of the Bay.\n  NOAA administers its work throughout the 64,000 square mile, 6 State \nwatershed from offices in Maryland and Virginia, which collaborate with \nState and other Federal agencies, academic institutions, and \nnongovernmental organizations to support Bay protection and restoration \ngoals. In Norfolk, Virginia, the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office's science \nand education programs are incorporated into exhibits at Nauticus, our \nState's premier maritime center, which receives more than 350,000 \nvisitors annually, and helps inform the public about NOAA's programs \nand activities. At the College of William and Mary's Virginia Institute \nof Marine Science, VIMS, NOAA is collaborating with a major academic \npartner to improve understanding of Bay fisheries and support improved \noyster restoration. At Stingray Point, Norfolk and Jamestown, NOAA has \ndeployed first-of-its-kind CBIBS interpretive buoys that are not only \nproviding critical real-time data streams for scientists, but \nmultidisciplinary education tools to users of the Captain John Smith \nChesapeake National Historic Water Trail. Throughout the Virginia and \nMaryland waters of the Chesapeake Bay, NOAA is assisting watermen \nimpacted by reductions in blue-crab harvests.\n\n  But NOAA's work and responsibilities to the Chesapeake Bay \nrestoration effort are far from complete. The partners in the Bay \nrestoration need the agency's continued help and support. Throughout \nthe Bay, ecologically important fish species are in decline or at risk \ndue to disease, habitat loss, and other factors. Underwater grasses \nthat once provided habitat to sustain these fisheries are at a fraction \nof their historic levels. As advanced as our science is, Chesapeake Bay \nmanagers still do not have adequate information about the estuary and \nits habitats to manage its living resources or mitigate diseases in \nfish and shellfish.\n  The legislation I am introducing today builds upon previous \nauthorizations of the NOAA Bay Program and addresses several urgent, \ncontinuing or unmet needs in the watershed. The bill seeks to achieve \nfive main objectives.\n  Increasing collaboration between the various programs and activities \nat NOAA to further NOAA's coastal resource stewardship mission.\n  Improving Bay monitoring capabilities and the coordination and \norganization of the substantial amounts of data collected and compiled \nby Federal, State, and local government agencies and academic \ninstitutions through further development of an integrated observations \nsystem and the Chesapeake Bay Interpretative Buoy System.\n  Strengthening the Chesapeake Bay Watershed Education and Training \nProgram, B-WET, the competitively based program which provides students \nwith meaningful Chesapeake Bay or stream outdoor experiences and \nteachers with professional development opportunities for Bay-related \nenvironmental education.\n  Supporting and encouraging public-private partnerships to restore \nfinfish and shellfish populations, submerged aquatic vegetation and \nother critical coastal habitat through aquaculture, stock enhancements, \npropagation and other programs.\n  Ensuring that Federal funds are spent wisely and effectively on \nprojects that have scientific and technical merit and are peer \nreviewed.\n  This legislation enhances NOAA's commitment to further scientific \ndata collection, develops fishery management practices and habitat \nrestoration, and strengthens Chesapeake Bay environmental education \nprograms. Mr. President, the Bay is a national treasure and its \nrestoration should be a national priority.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Chesapeake Bay Commission,\n\n                                                   April 29, 2009.\n     Hon.

Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Dirksen Senate Office Bldg.,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: It has come to my attention that you \n     will be introducing legislation shortly to reauthorize the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA's) \n     Chesapeake Bay Office, similar to H.R. 1771, which was \n     recently introduced in the House of Representatives. I am \n     writing to express our Commission's strong support for this \n     legislation and to commend you for introducing it.\n       As you know, the Chesapeake Bay Commission is a tri-state \n     legislative assembly established in 1980 to assist the states \n     of Maryland, Virginia and Pennsylvania in cooperatively \n     managing the Chesapeake Bay. The Commission has been a \n     signatory to every Chesapeake Bay Agreement and continues to \n     play a leadership role on a full spectrum of Bay issues: from \n     managing living resources and conserving land, to protecting \n     water quality.\n       We believe that reauthorizing and enhancing NOAA's \n     Chesapeake Bay Office and its major programs in fisheries, \n     habitat, integrated coastal observations and education are \n     critical to the joint Federal, State and local efforts to \n     restore Chesapeake Bay and its living resources. Our States \n     rely heavily on NOAA's ecosystem science, coastal and living \n     resources management, and environmental literacy capabilities \n     to meet the commitments of Chesapeake 2000. For example:\n       NOAA-funded trawl surveys and stock assessment work provide \n     information each year to help the states of MD and VA and the \n     Potomac River Fisheries Commission decide how to manage the \n     next season's blue crab fishery.\n       Since 2001 NCBO has provided over $28M to support native \n     oyster restoration and habitat characterization in MD and VA. \n     Current efforts are geared toward large scale ecological \n     restoration projects in rivers like the Wicomico and \n     Piankatank.\n       NOAA provides satellite-based remote sensing data for \n     models that help state fisheries managers develop stock \n     assessments.\n       Bay Watershed Education and Training (B-WET) grants \n     totaling $2M-3.5M annually help provide meaningful watershed \n     experiences for approximately 40,000 students throughout the \n     watershed.\n       Chesapeake NEMO is providing direct assistance to local \n     communities in PA, MD and VA to incorporate natural resources \n     into local decision making.\n       NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS) is \n     providing critical real-time water quality, weather and \n     interpretive information for managers, boaters, students and \n     tourists alike.\n       The legislation you are introducing would reauthorize and \n     strengthen NOAA's Chesapeake Bay Office. It would enhance \n     monitoring capabilities through the further development of an \n     integrated observations system and the Chesapeake Bay \n     Interpretative Buoy System. It would bolster the Chesapeake \n     Bay (B-WET) program which is helping to get students \n     throughout the watershed outdoors and learning about the Bay. \n     And it would help in our efforts to restore finfish and \n     shellfish populations, Bay-grasses and other habitats through \n     aquaculture and propagation programs.\n\n[[Page S6456]]\n\n       In our special report to the Congress of February 2008, the \n     Commission recommended reauthorization of the NOAA Chesapeake \n     Bay Office and its major programs as a high priority. If the \n     Commission can be of assistance to you or the Senate Commerce \n     Committee as this legislation moves through the legislative \n     process, please do not hesitate to let us know.\n           Sincerely,\n                                 Delegate John. A. Cosgrove (Va.),\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Friends of the John Smith\n\n\n                                             Chesapeake Trail,\n\n                                    Annapolis, MD, April 29, 2009.\n     Hon. Mark Warner,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Warner: On behalf of the Friends of the John \n     Smith Chesapeake Trail (``the Friends''), I want to commend \n     and thank you for your leadership in introducing the \n     Chesapeake Bay Science, Education, and Ecosystem Enhancement \n     Act of 2009. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration's (NOAA) Chesapeake Bay Office plays a vital \n     role in the management and restoration of the Chesapeake Bay. \n     We are pleased that your bill will re-authorize this \n     important program.\n       Over the past three years, the Friends have worked closely \n     with the NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office to implement the \n     Chesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System (CBIBS). The system \n     provides real-time water quality data and interpretation to \n     further protect, restore, and manage the Chesapeake Bay and \n     marks the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic \n     Trail. CBIBS is part of the multi-state Chesapeake Bay \n     Observing System (CBOS), and part of the U.S. Integrated \n     Ocean Observing System (IOOS)--systems designed to enhance \n     our ability to collect, deliver, and use estuarine and ocean \n     information. As you may be aware, there are currently three \n     CBIBS buoys in the Virginia waters of the Chesapeake Bay \n     (James River, Elizabeth River, Rappahannock River) and three \n     buoys in Maryland (Potomac River, Patapsco River and \n     Susquehanna River). NOAA has identified a further need for \n     expanded coverage throughout the Bay to include many of the \n     most important areas where water quality information is \n     needed, including Virginia's Eastern Shore and at the mouth \n     of the Bay.\n       CBIBS buoys have been designed to accommodate almost any \n     sensor and transmit the data for real-time display. Presently \n     they measure and report a comprehensive suite of \n     observations, including parameters used by the Chesapeake Bay \n     Program for assessment of impaired waters: Air temperature \n     and relative humidity; barometric pressure; wind speed and \n     direction; near-surface water temperature; salinity; \n     dissolved oxygen; chlorophyll-a concentration; turbidity; and \n     wave height, direction, and period.\n       The NOAA Chesapeake Bay Office has built a partnership with \n     the National Park Service, many non-government organizations \n     and businesses to launch this system that serves the \n     scientific community, John Smith Trail users and citizens \n     interested in the maritime history and culture of the Bay. \n     CBIBS and the Captain John Smith Chesapeake National Historic \n     Trail will function together to enhance public awareness of \n     the natural and cultural history of the Bay. Such awareness \n     creates tremendous motivation in restoration and conservation \n     efforts.\n       The CBIBS program will (1) enhance our understanding of the \n     Bay's biological, physical and chemical processes serve as \n     key tool for Bay restoration; (2) promote water based tourism \n     along the John Smith trail; (3) create an invaluable real \n     time tool for environmental education; (4) provide advanced \n     information tools for coastal decision makers; (5) improve \n     weather and harmful algal bloom forecasts; and (6) support \n     safe maritime commerce. For these reasons, we are delighted \n     that your bill includes language to formally authorize CBIBS.\n       The Chesapeake Bay is a wonderful national resource with a \n     storied history. Your legislation re-authorizing NOAA's work \n     will help ensure the vitality of our natural resources \n     throughout the Bay. Please let us know how we can help you \n     pass this important bill.\n           With warm regards,\n                                                    David O'Neill,\n                                                        President.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SANDERS:\n  S. 1225. A bill to require the Commodity Futures Trading Commission \nto take certain actions to prevent the manipulation of energy markets, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and \nForestry.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise today to introduce the Energy \nMarket Manipulation Prevention Act.\n  Did you know we are in the midst of the worse economic crisis since \nthe Great Depression? Millions of our fellow Americans are losing their \nhomes, losing their jobs, losing their life savings, losing the ability \nto send their kids to college and, in many ways, they are losing the \nhope that their own children will have a brighter future and a better \nlife than they have had. It is a very unusual moment in the history of \nour country.\n  In the midst of all of this concern and decline in the standards of \nliving of millions of Americans, the last thing that our country needs \nright now is to see our people be ripped off at the gas pump this \nsummer because of the speculators on Wall Street. Some of the very same \npeople who caused this recession and have received the largest taxpayer \nbailout in American history are allowed to jack up oil prices through \nprice manipulation and outright fraud.\n  This is obviously not only an issue for the moment for millions and \nmillions of people who drive to work every day, but for truckers and \nfarmers and all people who are dependent upon gas; and it is also an \nissue for many parts of our country, such as Vermont, where a lot of \nour people heat with oil. We are not going to sit around idly and watch \nthe price of oil artificially rise so that elderly people who heat with \noil are unable to adequately heat their homes in the wintertime.\n  Unfortunately, this artificial increase in oil and gas prices is \nexactly what is happening now, as it occurred similarly last summer, \nwhen the price of oil hit $147 a barrel. The price of gas at the pump \nwas over $4 a gallon, and truckers paid more than $5 a gallon for \ndiesel fuel. That is where we were last summer, and we are heading back \nthere right now, unless Congress moves in an aggressive way to say no \nto speculation on oil futures.\n  As you know, the price of oil is supposed to be based on the \nfundamentals of supply and demand, not by excessive speculation. What \nall of us learned in economics 101 is that if there is limited supply \nand a lot of demand, the price of the product goes up. If there is a \nlot of supply and limited demand, the price goes down. That is one of \nthe basic tenets of free market capitalism.\n  But interestingly, last month, crude oil inventories in the United \nStates were at their highest level on record, while demand for oil in \nthe United States dropped to its lowest level in more than a decade. In \nother words, there was a record amount of supply and less demand than \nwe have seen over the last 10 years. Further, the International Energy \nAgency recently predicted that global demand for oil will drop this \nyear to its lowest level since 1981.\n  What is going on? Demand is going down, supply is high, and what the \nfundamentals of economic theory tell us is that gas and oil prices will \ngo down. But as everybody who fills up their gas tank today \nunderstands, that is certainly not the case, because gas and oil prices \nare going up.\n  Despite the record supply of oil and reduced demand, prices are going \nup, not down. In fact, the national average price of gasoline has \njumped from $1.64 a gallon late last year to over $2.60 today. Crude \noil prices recently reached a 7-month high.\n  The American people have a right to ask why is this happening, in \ncontradiction to the basic economic process of supply and demand, and \nwe have a right and the obligation to act to protect those consumers. \nThe increased prices that millions of motorists are currently seeing \nhave caused severe financial hardship for American families, truckers, \nsmall businesses, airlines, and farmers. It is putting enormous strain \non an economy already in the throes of a deep recession.\n  We passed the stimulus package in order to create millions of jobs, \nin order to put money into the hands of working people, many of whom \nhad lost their jobs. And now what we are seeing, as a result of this \nartificial increase in the price of gas and oil, is that those tax \nbreaks we gave to working families are going not into the local \neconomy, they are going right back to Wall Street and speculation, and \nthey are going to the oil companies.\n  All of us have a responsibility to do everything we can to lower oil \nand gas prices immediately, so that they reflect supply and demand \nfundamentals, not excessive speculation. Therefore, the legislation I \nam introducing today will require the Commodities Futures Trading \nCommission to use its emergency powers to prevent the manipulation of \noil prices and empower the CFTC with new authority to prohibit \nexcessive speculation in the oil market.\n  Last July, the House of Representatives passed similar legislation by \na vote of 402 to 19--widely bipartisan.\n\n[[Page S6457]]\n\nBut that legislation, unfortunately, did not become law. In addition, \nthis legislation would also require the CFTC to, No. 1, immediately \nclassify all bank holding companies and hedge funds engaged in energy \nfutures trading as noncommercial participants and subject them to \nstrict position limits.\n  No. 2, this legislation would eliminate the conflict of interest that \narises when a firm, a large Wall Street financial institution, has \nemployees under one umbrella responsible for predicting the future \nprice of oil--the so-called analysts--while the same company controls \nphysical oil assets and trading energy derivatives.\n  No. 3, this legislation would immediately revoke all staff no-action \nletters for foreign boards of trade that have established trading \nterminals in the United States for the purpose of trading U.S. \ncommodities to U.S. investors.\n  I am delighted that Bart Chilton, one of the commissioners at the \nU.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, has supported this \nlegislation.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that his letter to me be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Sanders: Thank you for taking the time out of \n     your busy schedule to meet with me and Elizabeth Ritter \n     regarding energy trading and needed regulatory reforms of our \n     nation's commodities laws, rules and regulations. I \n     appreciate your leadership in this area and look forward to \n     working with you.\n       I did want to make a comment about your specific efforts. I \n     commend you for your leadership in bringing transparency and \n     accountability to U.S. energy markets. As you know, the \n     Commodity Exchange Act provides the CFTC with broad emergency \n     authority to take action, in its discretion, in order to \n     maintain or restore orderly trading. In your proposed \n     legislation, you have identified critically important areas \n     of concern--excessive speculation in energy commodities, \n     classification of bank holding companies and limits on their \n     energy trading, hedge fund registration, classification and \n     trading limits, conflicts of interest by entities that both \n     trade and advise in the energy arena, and foreign market \n     access. I wholeheartedly agree with you that the time to act \n     on these issues is now, and the CFTC should aggressively \n     utilize all available authorities as appropriate, including \n     but not limited to emergency authority as currently defined \n     in the CEA, to address these pressing issues.\n       Thank you again for your efforts on behalf of American \n     consumers and taxpayers, and I look forward to working with \n     you in the future on these important issues.\n\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bart Chilton.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me briefly quote from the letter.\n  He says:\n\n       As you know, the Commodity Exchange Act provides the CFTC \n     with broad emergency authority to take action, in its \n     discretion, in order to maintain or restore orderly trading. \n     In your proposed legislation, you have identified critically \n     important areas of concern--excessive speculation in energy \n     commodities, classification of bank holding companies and \n     limits on their energy trading, hedge fund registration, \n     classification and trading limits, conflicts of interest by \n     entities that both trade and advise in the energy arena, and \n     foreign market access. I wholeheartedly agree with you that \n     the time to act on these issues is now, and the CFTC should \n     aggressively utilize all available authorities as \n     appropriate, including but not limited to emergency authority \n     as currently defined in the CEA, to address these pressing \n     issues.\n\n  Madam President, I thank the Commissioner for his support of this \nlegislation.\n  On May 28, I wrote to Gary Gensler, the new Chairman of the CFTC, \nurging him to undertake many of these initiatives. Last week, in my \noffice, I discussed this issue with Mr. Gensler. He indicated that he \nhas instructed his staff to give him a list of all of the options \navailable to the CFTC to respond to these concerns. While I appreciate \nMr. Gensler's efforts on this issue, I hope this legislation will spur \nthe CFTC to take immediate action to lower oil prices.\n  The bottom line is, right now, at a time when unemployment is \nsoaring, when the middle class is struggling to keep its head above \nwater, the prices at the gas pump are soaring, and we worry about what \noil prices in the northern parts of our country will be in the \nwintertime, there is very strong evidence to suggest that what we are \ntalking about is not supply and demand but excessive speculation on the \npart of Wall Street in terms of pushing up oil futures.\n  This Congress must act to protect the middle class and working people \nof this country, the consumers of this country. It is time for us to \ndemand that the CFTC take the action that is necessary.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. Bennet, and Mr. Specter):\n  S. 1226. A bill to amend the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch \nAct to improve paperless enrollment and efficiency for the national \nschool lunch and school breakfast programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill with \nSenator Bennet of Colorado, called the Paperless Enrollment for School \nMeals Act. Senator Bennet and I wrote this legislation because of our \nmutual interest in increasing the efficiency of the school lunch \nprogram both in terms of getting meals to kids who need them and \nlowering program costs to school districts. Congressman Fattah and \nCongresswoman Schwartz are leading a companion bill on the House side.\n  Our bill creates a national program that is modeled after a pilot \nproject that has been used in Philadelphia for the past 18 years. The \nPhiladelphia program provides free lunch to all kids in schools that \nhave over 75 percent of the students eligible for free lunches. The \nPhiladelphia program also eliminates burdensome paper applications and \nreplaces them with a periodic population survey that allows the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture to determine the reimbursement rate to the \nSchool District of Philadelphia for the meals they serve.\n  Modernization of the school lunch program is one of my top priorities \nwhen the Senate reauthorizes the Child Nutrition Act later this fall. \nThe current system of requiring families to fill out paper applications \nat the beginning of each school year, having the school district \ncollect and certify those applications, and then having USDA use the \napplications combined with the amount of meals served to determine a \nreimbursement rate is inefficient and outdated. Not only are paper \napplications inefficient, they are inaccurate. It is much more accurate \nto compile socio-economic data and survey populations to determine \neligibility. We have anecdotal evidence of this fact in Philadelphia, \nwhere we have dramatically increased participation in school lunch \nthrough the pilot project that eliminates yearly paper applications, \nthereby eliminating stigma for enrollment, language barriers, and other \nfactors that prevent eligible families from completing paper forms.\n  There is another way that our bill removes the stigma associated with \nfree lunches. By providing free lunches for all students in schools \nthat have a very high percentage of eligible children, no one is \nembarrassed to get their free lunch in the lunch line. Every student \ngets the same meal, so no knows who is getting free lunches or reduced \nlunches. This is a very simple policy change that can get more kids \neating school lunches- kids who might otherwise go hungry that day \nbecause they don't have food at home.\n  Senator Bennet and I have been working on this issue for months both \nseparately and now collaboratively with our new legislation. And we \nknow that this is just a starting point. We have introduced this \nlegislation to start a dialogue with Chairman Harkin and the other \nmembers of the Committee on Agriculture Nutrition and Forestry along \nwith our colleagues at USDA. I think that there is a lot of energy \naround the ideas of paperless applications and universal meals included \nin our bill. I encourage all Senators to support this legislation and \nthe principles of the national program Senator Bennet and I have \noutlined and save our schools money while increasing access to quality \nschool meals for the kids who need them the most.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous ocnsent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1226\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S6458]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 63 of title 5, United States Code, \nto modify the rate of accrual of annual leave for administrative law \njudges, contract appeals board members, and immigration judges; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Administrative Judge \nLeave Equity Act, a bill to provide leave equity for Administrative Law \nJudges, ALSs, Contract Board of Appeals Judges, CBAJs, and Immigration \nLaw Judges. I am pleased to be joined in this effort by my friend, \nSenator Mark Pryor.\n  In 2004, Congress passed the Federal Workforce Flexibility Act, which \nchanged the leave accrual rate for mid-\n\n[[Page S6459]]\n\ncareer employees entering the Federal workforce. Under the Act, agency \nheads were given the discretion to allow workers to qualify a period of \nan employee's non-Federal career experience as a period of Federal \nservice. Additionally, the Act stated that all senior executives and \nsenior-level employees accrued annual leave at the maximum rate of \neight hours for each biweekly pay period.\n  Although senior executives were placed under a pay-for-performance \nsystem, administrative law judges accrued leave at the maximum rate, \nthe same as other senior-level employees. Under the last \nadministration, the Office of Personnel Management denied \nadministrative law judges leave equity because they are not under a \npay-for-performance system. I believe it is inappropriate for \nadministrative law judges to be placed under any type of pay-for-\nperformance system because it could compromise their independence. \nIndependent decisionmaking is essential for administrative law judges, \nand is the reason ALJs and CBAJs do not receive bonus awards.\n  Currently, there is a shortage of ALJs to adjudicate benefits claims \nin the Social Security Administration. There are approximately 765,000 \ncases pending and not enough ALJs to process the backlog. I believe \nthis bill will provide the Federal Government with an important tool in \nits efforts to recruit and retain highly-skilled administrative law \njudges.\n  I am pleased that this bill enjoys broad support from employee groups \nthat represent administrative law judges, including the Association of \nAdministrative Law Judges, the Association of Hearing Office Chief \nJudges, the Federal Administrative Law Judges Conference, the Forum of \nU.S. Administrative Law Judges, the International Federation of \nProfessional and Technical Engineers, the National Association of \nImmigration Judges, and the Senior Executives Association.\n  The time has come to give administrative law judges the same benefits \nas other senior-level employees.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1228\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reauthorize and improve the entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs of the Small Business Administration, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, the Small Business Administration has \nprovided critical financial assistance and counseling to America's \nsmall businesses since 1953. The services and assistance provided \nthrough SBAs programs have been pivotal to this country's economic \ngrowth and have helped thousands of American entrepreneurs realize \ntheir dream of starting and growing a successful business. In this time \nof economic uncertainty, reauthorization of these entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs is essential to moving our Nation forward.\n  What helps our entrepreneurs helps our entire economy. According to \nthe U.S. Census Bureau, small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all \nfirms, employ more than half of the workforce and account for half of \nthe Nation's Gross Domestic Product. Small business management and \ntechnical assistance can potentially help millions of small businesses \nby teaching entrepreneurs and small business owners fundamental \nprinciples and practices regarding cash flow, cost management, how to \naccess to capital and effective business planning. The SBA, through its \nresource partners such as Small Business Development Centers, SBDCs, \nWomen's Business Centers, WBCs, Service Corps of Retired Executives, \nSCORE, and others, not only provides technical assistance and \ninformation to potential and current small business owners, but helps \nfocus this Nation's entrepreneurial spirit into concrete economic \ngrowth.\n  As Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nhave heard from small business owners across the country. They have \ntold me that the programs and services currently offered by the Small \nBusiness Administration provide access to important resources that \nenable them to start, grow and expand their businesses. But more can \nand must be done to help these entrepreneurs. Through an extensive \nreauthorization of the entrepreneurial development programs within the \nSmall Business Act, I believe that we can dramatically improve the \ntools available to small business concerns while simultaneously growing \nand strengthening our economy.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Entrepreneurial Development \nAct of 2009. This legislation will provide SBA resource partners with \nthe tools they need to effectively serve small businesses, giving them \nmore opportunities to help lead the nation back toward economic \nprosperity.\n  Before I discuss details of this bill, I first wish to thank Senator \nSnowe for her continued leadership on small business issues and working \nwith me on this bipartisan effort. Over the past three congresses, the \nreauthorization of these programs has continued to receive support on \nboth sides of the aisle, demonstrating the importance of reauthorizing \nessential entrepreneurial development programs.\n  SBA is utilizing resource partners such as SBDCs, SCORE, WBCs and \nothers to ensure that we are growing the Nation's economy through \nentrepreneurial development. In 2007, with a modest Federal investment \nof approximately $97 million in assistance, SBDC clients generated \nnearly $220 million in additional Federal revenues. Many of the small \nbusinesses that received assistance from SBDC's attributed their \nsuccess to assistance offered by the SBDC. Nationally, this economic \nactivity resulted in approximately $2.26 in revenue for every Federal \ndollar expended.\n  This level of return on investment is not unique to SBDCs. According \nto an SBA report to Congress, SCORE helped create more than 19,000 new \nsmall businesses in 2007 at a cost of $29 per business and helped \ncreate more than 25,000 new jobs each year.\n  These programs also provide essential information, training and \nassistance to a broad and diverse cross-section of communities \nthroughout the country, and serve to further grow a variety of \nindustries. Resource partners such as WBCs and initiatives such as the \nProgram for Investment in Microentrepreneurs, PRIME, are dedicated to \nserving clients who are economically and socially disadvantaged, \nproviding tools and resources to small businesses in those communities \nthat are most in need. According to a study sponsored by the \nAssociation of Women's Business Centers, AWBC, 2/3 of WBC clients have \nhousehold incomes of less than $50,000 and 42 percent are women of \ncolor. These programs serve communities with limited access to capital \nand educational opportunities and provide them with the tools and \ninformation they need to start and manage a successful business.\n  The reauthorization of these programs is critical to effectively \nprovide entrepreneurs with essential assistance and resources to start \na successful business. The legislation will also create opportunities \nfor veterans and service disabled small business owners. According to \nthe Department of Veteran Affairs, there are more than 23.8 million \nveterans in the country, with hundreds of new veterans returning home \nfrom service in Iraq and Afghanistan each day. Many of these returning \nsoldiers become entrepreneurs to support\n\n[[Page S6460]]\n\nthemselves and rebuild their lives after long deployments, which also \nserves to create new jobs in their communities.\n  Since the passage of The Veterans Entrepreneurship and Small Business \nDevelopment Act of 1999, the SBA's Office of Veterans Business \nDevelopment has been working to provide technical assistance and \nsupport to those veterans who have served our country and returned to \nstart or grow a small business. This legislation seeks to ease their \ntransition by providing business counseling and technical assistance \nthrough a new network of Veterans Business Centers, modeled after \nWomen's Business Centers and Small Business Development Centers. The \nVeterans Business Center Program will provide services not only to \nreturning veterans and service disabled veterans, but also to the \nfamilies, spouses and surviving spouses of these heroic men and women.\n  The 111th Congress will be the third consecutive Congress during \nwhich comprehensive legislation reauthorizing and improving the SBA's \nEntrepreneurial Programs has been introduced. Ranking Member Snowe \nintroduced S. 3778 in the 109th Congress and former Chairman John Kerry \nintroduced S. 1671 and S. 2920, a bill to which I was a cosponsor, \nduring the 110th Congress. In each previous Congress, this legislation \nwas well received and passed unanimously out of Committee; however, \nthese bills stalled before the full Senate. As Chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee this Congress, it is a top priority of mine to \nfinally get this legislation passed and ensure that during this time of \neconomic uncertainty, we are able to provide small businesses with the \ntools they need to grow and expand their businesses. With this in mind, \nI will work closely with Ranking Member Snowe and the other members of \nthe Committee in the coming months to get this legislation to the \nPresident's desk.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1229\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as Ranking Member of the Senate Committee \non Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I rise today to join with \nSenator Landrieu to introduce the Entrepreneurial Development Act of \n2009, a bill that would reauthorize and improve the U.S. Small Business \nAdministration's, SBA, Entrepreneurial Development programs. I have \nlong fought to expand the power and reach of the SBA's entrepreneurial \ndevelopment tools, which are used by millions of current and aspiring \nentrepreneurs and small businesses across the U.S. These programs \ndemonstrate how Congress can play a positive role in enhancing private-\nsector financing for start-up companies. We must continue to strengthen \nthese core SBA programs because they have proven invaluable in aiding \nthe efforts and dreams of America's entrepreneurs, and in bolstering \nsmall business job creation.\n\n[[Page S6471]]\n\n  The bill that I am cosponsoring today is the product of the type of \nbipartisan, consensus work product for which the Senate Small Business \nCommittee has come to be known. The provisions contained in this \nlegislation are a compilation of ideas and initiatives put forward by \nmyself, Senator Landrieu, and other Committee members. Much of the \nlanguage in the Entrepreneurial Development Act of 2009 was contained \nin S. 2920, the SBA Reauthorization and Improvements Act in the 110th \nCongress, the individual provisions of which were each passed \nunanimously by the Senate Small Business Committee during the 110th \nCongress. Unfortunately, that bipartisan bill never passed the Senate.\n  This act, among other things, builds upon the aforementioned \nsuccesses of SBA's Entrepreneurial Development programs, which \ncollectively created or retained 200,000 jobs in 2008 alone.\n  Since their inception, Small Business Development Centers, SBDCs, \nhave been essential in the delivery of management and technical \ncounseling assistance and educational programs to prospective and \nexisting small business owners. The SBDC program has served over 11 \nmillion clients with new business starts, sustainability programs for \nstruggling firms, and expansion plans for growth firms. For every \ndollar spent on the SBDC program, approximately $2.87 in tax revenue is \ngenerated.\n  According to a recent report conducted at Mississippi State \nUniversity, as a direct result of its counseling programs, SBDC clients \ngenerated approximately $7 billion in sales and created over 73,000 new \njobs in 2006. Therefore, it is imperative that in such troubling \neconomic times we ensure that this program has the resources necessary \nto successfully aid small businesses. Through this legislation, which \nincreases the SBDC program's authorization to $160 million by fiscal \nyear 2012, this program will be in a better position to continue \nhelping entrepreneurs succeed.\n  The Women's Business Center, WBC, program, established by Congress in \n1988, promotes the growth of women-owned businesses through business \ntraining and technical assistance, and provides access to credit and \ncapital, federal contracts, and international trade opportunities. The \nWBC program served more than 159,000 clients across the country last \nyear, providing help with financial management, procurement training, \nmarketing and technical assistance. WBCs also provide specialized \nprograms that include mentoring in various languages, Internet \ntraining, issues facing displaced workers and rural home-based \nentrepreneurs.\n  Our legislation builds on our commitment to providing assistance to \nwomen entrepreneurs. It directs the SBA's Office of Women's Business \nOwnership to develop programs to bolster the growth of women-owned \nsmall businesses by providing support for business operations, \nmanufacturing, technology, finance, Federal Government contracting, and \ninternational trade.\n  The bill also makes substantial improvements to the Women's Business \nCenter program, which created nearly 9,000 jobs in the last fiscal \nyear, including an expansion of the types of entities that are eligible \nto host WBCs to economic development organizations, state-chartered \ndevelopment organizations, and public or private colleges and \nuniversities. Finally, the bill directs the SBA to provide a minimum of \n$150,000 in funding annually to all new WBCs that are in their first 5 \nyears of operation, allowing new centers to become fully established \nbefore they have to compete for federal funding.\n  The bill also reauthorizes SCORE, a non-profit association that \nmatches business-management counselors with small business clients. \nSCORE volunteer counselors share their management and technical \nexpertise with both existing and prospective small business owners. \nWith its 10,500 member volunteer association, sponsored by the SBA, and \nmore than 389 service delivery points and a website, SCORE provides \ncounseling to small businesses nationwide. The national SCORE \norganization delivers its services of business and technical assistance \nthrough a national network of chapters, an Internet counseling site, \npartnerships with SBA, the SBDCs and WBCs, and with the public and \nprivate sectors. In 2008, SCORE created or retained 25,000 jobs, and \nthis act will help improve this program by raising the authorization \nlevel to $13 million in fiscal year 2012.\n  In addition to reauthorizing SBA's ED programs and increasing their \nfunding levels, this bill also addresses the crisis small businesses \nface when it comes to securing quality, affordable health insurance. \nHealth insurance costs have increased by 89 percent since 2000. This \nhas led to a disturbing trend of fewer and fewer small businesses being \nable to offer health insurance to their employees.\n  A key provision in this bill would establish a grant program to \nprovide information, counseling, and educational materials to small \nbusinesses, through the well-established national framework of the \nSBA's technical assistance partners including SBDCs, WBC, Veteran's \nBusiness Centers, and SCORE.\n  Research conducted by the non-partisan Healthcare Leadership Council \nfound that with a short educational and counseling session, small \nbusinesses were up to 33 percent more likely to offer health insurance \nto their employees. It is therefore vital that we provide the SBA's \nresource partners with the resources necessary to give small businesses \nthe critical health care education they need to navigate the complex \ninsurance market.\n  The SBA's entrepreneurial development programs provide tremendous \nvalue for a relatively small investment. I am committed to ensuring \nthat Americans have the necessary resources to start, grow and develop \na business. I believe that it is our duty to do everything possible to \nsustain prosperity and job creation throughout the U.S. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this vital piece of legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 1231. A bill to create or adopt, and implement, rigorous and \nvoluntary American education content standards in mathematics and \nscience covering kindergarten through grade 12, to provide for the \nassessment of student proficiency benchmarked against such standards, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce The Standards to \nProvide Educational Achievement for Kids, SPEAK, Act, a bill designed \nto provide incentives to states to begin holding every child in America \nto the same high standards. At its core, SPEAK will adopt and implement \nvoluntary core American education content standards in math and science \nwhile incentivizing states to adopt them.\n  America's leadership, economic, and national security rest on our \ncommitment to educate and prepare our youth to succeed in a global \neconomy. The key to succeeding in this endeavor is to have high \nexpectations for all American students as they progress through our \nNation's schools.\n  Currently there are 50 different sets of academic standards, 50 State \nassessments, and 50 definitions of proficiency under the No Child Left \nBehind Act. As a result of varied standards, exams and proficiency \nlevels, America's highly mobile student-aged population moves through \nthe Nation's schools gaining widely varying levels of knowledge, skills \nand preparedness. Yet, in order for the U.S. to compete in a global \neconomy, we must strengthen our educational expectations for all \nAmerican children--we must compete as one Nation.\n  Recent international comparisons show that American students have \nsignificant shortcomings in math and science. Many lack the basic \nskills required for college or the workplace. This affects our economic \nand national security; it holds us back in the global marketplace and \nrisks ceding our competitive edge. This is unacceptable.\n  America was founded on the notion of ensuring equity and opportunity \nfor all. And yet, we risk both when we allow different students in \ndifferent states to graduate from high school with very different \neducations. We live in a nation with an unacceptably high high school \ndropout rate. We live in a nation where 8th graders in some states \nscore more than 30 points higher on tests of basic science knowledge \nthan students in other states. I ask my colleagues today what equality \nof opportunity we have under such circumstances.\n\n[[Page S6472]]\n\n  This is where American standards come in. Voluntary, core American \nstandards in math and science are an important step in ensuring that \nall American students are given the same opportunity to learn to a high \nstandard no matter where they reside. They will allow for meaningful \ncomparisons of student academic achievement across states, help ensure \nthat American students are academically qualified to enter college or \ntraining for the civilian or military workforce, and help ensure that \nstudents are better prepared to compete in the global marketplace. \nUniform standards are a first step in maintaining America's competitive \nand national security edge.\n  While I understand that education is, after all, a state endeavor, we \ncannot ignore that at the end of the day America competes as one \ncountry on the global marketplace. This does not mean that I am asking \nstates to cede their authority in education. What the bill simply \nproposes is that we use the convening power of the Federal Government \nto incentivize efforts to create a core set of common standards.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize the recent remarkable \nachievement of the National Governors Association and the Council of \nChief State School Officers in partnership with Achieve, Inc, ACT, and \nthe College Board. Just last week they announced that 49 States and \nterritories have joined the Common Core State Standards Initiative and \nhave committed to a process to develop common standards in English \nlanguage arts and mathematics. They have made a commitment to evidence-\nbased and internationally benchmarked standards, which are scheduled to \nbe developed later this year. This effort is outstanding. Just 2 years \nago, when I introduced one of the first bills in the Senate on \nstandards, this type of effort would have been unthinkable. Now, there \nis strong momentum behind providing all students across the country \nwith competitive and consistent standards.\n  The SPEAK Act, provides flexibility in the creation or adoption of \nAmerican standards, understanding that there are effective efforts \nunderway that could be integrated into the program of Federal \nincentives that this bill would provide.\n  The SPEAK Act will task the National Assessment Governing Board with \ncreating or adopting rigorous and voluntary core American education \ncontent standards in math and science for grades K-12. It will require \nthat the standards be anchored in the National Assessment of \nEducational Progress' math and science frameworks. It will also ensure \nthat such standards are internationally competitive and comparable to \nthe best standards in the world, similar to the outline created for the \nstandards being developed through the Common Core State Standards \nInitiative.\n  States that do participate, while required to adopt the American \nstandards, will be given the flexibility to make them their own. They \nwill have the option to add additional content requirements, they will \nhave final say in how coursework is sequenced, and, ultimately, States, \nand districts will still be the ones developing the curriculum, \nchoosing the textbooks and administering the tests. The standards \nprovided for under this legislation will simply serve as a common core.\n  The SPEAK Act will develop rigorous achievement levels. It will \nensure that varying developmental levels of students are taken into \naccount in the development of such standards. It will provide for \nperiodic review and update of such standards. It establishes an \nAmerican Standards Incentive Fund to incentivize states to adopt the \nstandards. Among the benefits of participating is a significant \ninfusion of funds for states to bolster their K-12 data systems.\n  No one will deny that our Nation is facing difficult economic times. \nHowever, there remains a steadfast commitment to improving education \nfor our students, a commitment that includes working to develop \nvoluntary American standards. I applaud states that realize that \ndespite facing difficult budget realities, holding all students to the \nsame, high standards will be what is best for the future of our nation. \nThese States need and deserve incentives and resources to complete this \nimportant work.\n  I should also note that the SPEAK Act has garnered endorsements from \nbusinesses, math/science organizations, foundations, and the education \ncommunity. Through the leadership of Congressman Vernon Ehlers in the \nHouse of Representatives it shares not only bicameral, but bipartisan \nsupport. Together we have all come together to affect meaningful change \nin our public schools.\n  We live in an economy where you can no longer lift, dig or assemble \nyour way to success. Today, you have got to think your way to success \nso that when public education doesn't work, when we fail to compete as \none nation, our entire country gets left behind. Low expectations \ntranslate to an America that is less competitive on the world stage. If \nthat happens, we are going to wonder why we didn't do anything about it \nwhile we still had time.\n  Core American standards will set high goals for all students, allow \nfor meaningful comparisons of achievement across states, and help \nensure that all of our students are qualified to enter college. At the \nend of the day, we all want what is best for our country and parents \nwant what is best for their kids. With core standards, America will \nbegin the work of regaining its competitive edge in the global economy. \nIn the life of every student, equality will be made a little more real \nwith reintroduction of this bill, as the skills and knowledge we expect \nof them are no longer made contingent on where they reside.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me in supporting the SPEAK Act. \nAs we start holding our students to the same high standards, I expect \nthat we will be amazed at the excellence that follows.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1231\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Throughout the years, educators and policymakers have \n     consistently embraced standards as the mechanism to ensure \n     that every student, no matter what school the student \n     attends, masters the skills and develops the knowledge needed \n     to participate in a global economy.\n       (2) Recent international comparisons make clear that \n     students in the United States have significant shortcomings \n     in mathematics and science, yet a high level of scientific \n     and mathematics literacy is essential to societal innovations \n     and advancements.\n       (3) With more than 50 different sets of academic content \n     standards, 50 State academic assessments, and 50 definitions \n     of proficiency under section 1111(b) of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311(b)), there is \n     great variability in the measures, standards, and benchmarks \n     for academic achievement in mathematics and science.\n       (4) Variation in State standards and the accompanying \n     measures of proficiency make it difficult for parents and \n     teachers to meaningfully gauge how well their children are \n     learning mathematics and science in comparison to their peers \n     internationally or here at home.\n       (5) The disparity in the rigor of standards across States \n     yield test results that tell the public little about how \n     schools are performing and progressing, as States with low \n     standards or low proficiency requirements may appear to be \n     doing much better than States with more rigorous standards or \n     higher requirements for proficiency.\n       (6) As a result, the United States' highly mobile student-\n     aged population moves through the Nation's schools gaining \n     widely varying levels of knowledge, skills, and preparedness.\n       (7) In order for the United States to compete in a global \n     economy, the country needs to strengthen its educational \n     expectations for all children.\n       (8) To compete, the people of the United States must \n     compare themselves against international benchmarks.\n       (9) Grounded in a real world analysis and international \n     comparisons of what students\n\n[[Page S6473]]\n\n     need to succeed in work and college, rigorous and voluntary \n     core American education content standards will keep the \n     United States economically competitive and ensure that the \n     children of the United States are given the same opportunity \n     to learn to a high standard no matter where they reside.\n       (10) Rigorous and voluntary core American education content \n     standards in mathematics and science will enable students to \n     succeed in academic settings across States while ensuring an \n     American edge in the global marketplace.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 181\n\n       Whereas there are more than 2,000,000 miles of gas and \n     hazardous liquid pipelines in the United States that are \n     operated by more than 3,000 companies;\n       Whereas gas and hazardous liquid pipelines play a vital \n     role in the lives of people in the United States by \n     delivering the energy needed to heat homes, drive cars, cook \n     food and operate businesses;\n       Whereas, during the last decade, significant new pipelines \n     have been built to help move North American sources of oil \n     and gas to refineries and markets;\n       Whereas, on June 10, 1999, a hazardous liquid pipeline \n     ruptured and exploded in a park in Bellingham, Washington, \n     killing 2 10-year-old boys and a young man, destroying a \n     salmon stream, and causing hundreds of millions of dollars in \n     damage and economic disruption;\n       Whereas, in response to the pipeline tragedy on June 10, \n     1999, Congress enacted significant new pipeline safety \n     regulations, including in the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act \n     of 2002 (Public Law 107-355; 116 Stat. 2985) and the Pipeline \n     Inspection, Protection, Enforcement, and Safety Act of 2006 \n     (Public Law 109-468; 120 Stat. 3486);\n       Whereas, during the last decade, the Pipelines and \n     Hazardous Materials Safety Administration of the Department \n     of Transportation, with support from a diverse group of \n     stakeholders, has instituted a variety of important new rules \n     and pipeline safety initiatives, such as the Common Ground \n     Alliance, pipeline emergency training with the National \n     Association of State Fire Marshals, and the Pipelines and \n     Informed Planning Alliance;\n       Whereas, even with pipeline safety improvements, in 2008 \n     there were 274 significant pipeline incidents that caused \n     more than $395,000,000 of damage to property and disrupted \n     the economy;\n       Whereas, even though pipelines are the safest method to \n     transport huge quantities of fuel, pipeline incidents are \n     still occurring, including the pipeline explosion in Edison, \n     New Jersey, in 1994 that left 100 people homeless, the butane \n     pipeline explosion in Texas in 1996 that left 2 teenagers \n     dead, the pipeline explosion near Carlsbad, New Mexico, in \n     2000 that killed 12 people in an extended family, the \n     pipeline explosion in Walnut Creek, California, in 2004 that \n     killed 5 workers, and the propane pipeline explosion in \n     Mississippi in 2007 that killed a teenager and her \n     grandmother;\n       Whereas the millions of miles of pipelines are still ``out \n     of sight'', and therefore ``out of mind'' for the majority of \n     people, local governments, and businesses in the United \n     States, a situation that can lead to pipeline damage and a \n     general lack of oversight of pipelines;\n       Whereas greater awareness of pipelines and pipeline safety \n     can improve public safety;\n       Whereas a ``National Pipeline Safety Day'' can provide a \n     focal point for creating greater pipeline safety awareness; \n     and\n       Whereas June 10, 2009, is the 10th anniversary of the \n     Bellingham, Washington, pipeline tragedy that was the impetus \n     for many of the safety improvements described in this \n     resolution and is an appropriate day to designate as \n     ``National Pipeline Safety Day'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 10, 2009, as ``National Pipeline Safety \n     Day'';\n       (2) encourages State and local governments to observe the \n     day with appropriate activities that promote pipeline safety;\n       (3) encourages all pipeline safety stakeholders to use the \n     day to create greater public awareness of all the \n     advancements that can lead to greater pipeline safety; and\n       (4) encourages individuals throughout the United States to \n     become more aware of the pipelines that run through \n     communities in the United States and to encourage safe \n     practices and damage prevention relating to gas and hazardous \n     liquid pipelines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6475-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6475]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 182--RECOGNIZING THE DEMOCRATIC ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF \n THE PEOPLE OF ALBANIA AND EXPRESSING THE HOPE THAT THE PARLIAMENTARY \n ELECTIONS ON JUNE 28, 2009, MAINTAIN AND IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY AND \n                    FAIRNESS OF DEMOCRACY IN ALBANIA\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \nLieberman, and Mr. DeMint) submitted the following resolution;

Mr. President, I rise tonight to recognize a very \nspecial Georgian. Suzanne Yoculan just retired as the coach of the \nwomen's gymnastic program at the University of Georgia.\n  Coach Yoculan is a graduate of Penn State University, and she was \nnamed head coach of the University of Georgia gymnastics team in 1983. \nThe team, under her leadership, has been nothing short of spectacular. \nDuring her 26 years at the helm, Georgia's gymnastics team, or the Gym \nDogs, as they are affectionately referred to, have posted a meet record \nof 831 wins, 117 losses, and 7 ties, for a winning percentage of .870--\npretty spectacular.\n  Let me list the accomplishments the Gym Dogs have achieved under the \nleadership of Coach Yoculan: Four undefeated seasons: 1993, 1998, 1999, \nand 2006. Her teams have finished in the top three in the Nation 19 out \nof the last 21 years. They have also been a part of the Super Six, the \nfinal six NCAA teams every year since the format was introduced in \n1993, and have never missed the NCAA women's gymnastics competition. \nShe was Southeastern Conference Women's Gymnastics Coach of the Year in \n1986, 1987, 1999, 2001, 2002, 2004, 2008, and 2009. She was the NCAA \nWomen's Gymnastics Coach of the Year in 1987, 1993, 1998, 2006, and \n2008. Under her leadership, the Gym Dogs won 21 regional NCAA titles, \nand they won 16 Southeastern Conference championships and 10 NCAA \nwomen's championships, including in the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, \nand 2009. Yes, that is right--the last 5 years in a row, under Coach \nYoculan's leadership, our Gym Dogs have won the national championship \neach and every year.\n  This year, in April, the team competed in the NCAA match at the Bob \nDevaney Center in Lincoln, NE. After a slow start, Coach Yoculan \ngathered the team in the locker room, gave them a pep talk, and \ndemanded, as she always does, an awful lot from her lady athletes. And \ndid they ever respond in a very positive way. They came down the \nstretch with several different 10s on various platforms and won the \nnational championship for the fifth consecutive time.\n  Coach Yoculan made this statement after the meet:\n\n       It is really a magical team that has so much fortitude and \n     just love for the sport and passion, and they never quit. I \n     feel blessed, and I actually lived it every day being around \n     them, and that is the thing I am going to miss the most.\n\n  Well, those of us who are Bulldogs feel blessed to have had Suzanne \nYoculan as our gymnastics coach for the last 26 years. We congratulate \nher on a very successful career, and certainly we wish her the best in \nwherever life may take her from here.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6478-6", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6478-S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, next I rise to speak about the \nterrorists being held at Guantanamo Bay naval facility, or Gitmo. There \nare over 240 terrorists in U.S. custody at the military detention \nfacility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, today. Let me describe some of the \nindividuals who reside at Guantanamo.\n  First, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, or KSM, is the self-proclaimed and \nquite unapologetic mastermind of the 9/11 attacks. KSM admitted he was \nthe planner of 9/11 and other planned, but foiled, attacks against the \nUnited States. In his combatant status review board, he admitted that \nhe swore allegiance to Osama bin Laden, was a member of al-Qaida, was \nthe military operational commander for all foreign al-Qaida operations, \nand much more. KSM and four other detainees who are charged with \nconspiring to commit terrible 9/11 attacks remain at Guantanamo today. \nIn addition, Gitmo houses Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri, who was responsible \nfor the October 2000 USS Cole bombing which murdered 17 U.S. sailors \nand injured 37 others. Also residing at Gitmo are Osama bin Laden's \npersonal bodyguards, al-Qaida's terrorist camp trainers, al-Qaida bomb \nmakers, and individuals picked up on the battlefield with weapons \ntrying to kill American soldiers--our young men and women who \npatriotically serve their country. The detainees at Guantanamo are some \nof the most senior, hardened, and dangerous al-Qaida figures we have \ncaptured.\n  In May, just 3 weeks ago, the Senate voted 90 to 6 to prohibit any of \nthese hardened terrorists from being brought to the United States. \nDespite this clear objection, the administration transferred one \ndetainee, Ahmed Ghailani, to New York City yesterday. He is facing \ncharges in the Southern District of New York for his role in the August \n7, 1998, bombings of two U.S. Embassies in Africa.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate have touted this as an example of \nhow we can bring criminal charges against the Gitmo detainees and try \nthem in our courts. However, no one has pointed out that Ghailani was \nindicted on\n\n[[Page S6479]]\n\nMarch 12, 2001, a full 6 months prior to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 \nand after a full investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. \nThe case against Ghailani was built long before he was transferred to \nGitmo in 2006. To imply that other detainees, many of whom the FBI has \nnever investigated or collected evidence against, may similarly be \nprosecuted in U.S. courts is naive.\n  The President, in announcing the closing of Guantanamo Bay in January \nof this year, failed to come forward with a plan to tell the American \npeople what he intended to do with the rest of the remaining prisoners \nbeing held in that facility. Americans are outraged about the fact that \nthere is now the potential for those individuals to be transferred to \nthe United States and the possibility that some of them may be released \ninto American society.\n  The reaction of the administration to the outcry from the American \npeople and to the outcry from Members of this body has been: Well, we \nare going to work this out. We are going to get people to take these \nindividuals.\n  Well, needless to say, the previous administration had been trying to \nget folks to allow the return of their countrymen who are housed at \nGuantanamo for years, and they were not successful. That is why we \nstill have 241 detainees at Guantanamo.\n\n  Yesterday, there was an announcement that 17 Uighurs, or Chinese \nterrorists, are going to be sent to the country of Palau. I doubt there \nare many Americans who can even tell you where Palau is. It turns out \nit is a country containing many islands somewhere out in the Pacific, \nnot far from the Philippines.\n  In order to get Palau to take these 17 Uighurs, the Obama \nadministration has committed to paying that country $200 million or, if \nmy calculation is correct, about $11,764,705 per individual. A pretty \ngood payment for taking these prisoners.\n  If that is the standard we are going to be using and the precedent we \nare now setting, you can figure the numbers to look at how much money \nit is going to cost us to transfer these remaining prisoners to other \ncountries.\n  Guantanamo is a symbolic issue for many people around the world. I am \nnot one who is going to stand here and say we should not close it. \nObviously, there should be some long-range plan to get us out of \nGuantanamo and to ultimately close it. But without the administration \ncoming forward with a plan, the American people are deservedly outraged \nat the fact that these individuals may be transferred to criminal \nfacilities in the United States. They, thus, become eligible for all \nrights of individuals who are housed on U.S. domestic soil, including \nthe right of habeas corpus, and, thus, because not in every case have \nour soldiers been able to look a guy in the eye who has a rifle in his \nhand and who is shooting at him, but they are able to disarm him and \ntake the weapon away from him, they don't have the opportunity to \ngather evidence on the battlefield and to bag up all that evidence and \ntake the time to write down names of witnesses who saw the activity on \nthe battlefield. So there is the potential that some of these \nindividuals might ultimately be successful in a habeas corpus action, \nbe set free by some judge in a U.S. court and, thus, be eligible to be \ningratiated into U.S. society.\n  A couple weeks ago, I filed a bill in the Senate which prohibits, No. \n1, any detainee at Guantanamo from being transferred to the United \nStates. The administration has already breached that, and that is why \nit is more important than ever we consider this bill.\n  But more importantly, if the President exercises other powers that he \nhas outside of what may be even enacted into law, constitutional powers \nhe may have, and brings these individuals into the United States, my \nbill will prohibit any opportunity for any of these individuals who are \nnow housed at Guantanamo from ever being released into the society of \nthe United States.\n  I sought to get this bill up as an amendment to the supplemental, \nbut, unfortunately, my friends on the other side of the aisle saw it in \na different way and would not let my amendment come up. We are going to \nbe back. We are going to have this bill up either as a standalone bill \nor as an amendment at the next opportunity to make sure we do \neverything we can as Members of the Senate who voted 90 to 6 to not \nbring these individuals from Guantanamo to the United States, to again \nhave the opportunity to vote on this issue and to make sure that not \nonly do we not bring them here, but that if by some quirk the President \ndecides we ought to bring them here and does so, then there is never \nthe opportunity for those individuals to be released into the United \nStates, into any of our communities, irrespective of where they may \nreside.\n  I simply will close tonight and say this is a very serious issue \nthat, in fact, is being considered by the conferees tonight, I \nunderstand, on the supplemental that we voted on a couple weeks ago. \nThe language that was agreed to by that 90-to-6 vote may be in \njeopardy. Democrats may be trying to pull that particular provision out \nof the supplemental and to, thereby, not have language in there that \nwould prohibit these individuals from coming into our country.\n  I think that is certainly against the will of the American people, it \nis certainly against the will of the Senate in a big way, and I think \nwould be a huge mistake.\n  I look forward to continuing the debate on this issue. I look forward \nto our bill coming up, either in the form of a standalone bill or in \nthe form of an amendment because this is an issue that is not going \naway until we figure out a way to deal with these individuals who are \nincarcerated at Guantanamo in a lawful manner as enemy combatants and \nthat we figure out a way to deal with them on a long-term basis that \nultimately will allow us to leave Guantanamo and close that facility.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/10/senate-section/article/S6479-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6479]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ADJOURNMENT UNTIL 10 A.M.
