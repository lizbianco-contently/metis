Madam President, over the past several weeks, my \ncolleagues and I have raised a number of serious questions about the \njudicial record and public statements of Judge Sonia Sotomayor in \nconnection with her nomination and upcoming confirmation hearings to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. These questions are driven by a growing sense, \nbased strictly on the record, that Judge Sotomayor has allowed her \npersonal and political views to cloud her judgment in the courtroom, \nleading her to favor some groups over others.\n  All of us are impressed by Judge Sotomayor's remarkable life story. \nIt reaffirms not only to Americans but to people around the world that \nours is a country in which one's willingness to dream and to work hard \nremain the only requirements for success.\n  And yet it is precisely this truth about America that makes it so \nimportant that our judges apply the law the same way to one individual \nor group as to every other.\n  This is why we have raised the questions we have. And this is why we \nwill continue to raise them as the confirmation hearings for Judge \nSotomayor proceed. This morning I would like to discuss an area of \nJudge Sotomayor's record that hasn't been touched upon yet, and that is \nher record on the fundamental right of free speech.\n\n[[Page S7278]]\n\n  This right to free speech was considered so important by our Founders \nthat they included it as the first amendment in the Bill of Rights, \nalong with the freedom of the press and religion, and the right to \nassemble and petition the government. It is one of the bedrocks of our \ngovernment and our culture. And it is one of the primary defenses the \nFounders established against the perennial threat of government \nintrusion.\n  So it is essential that we know what someone who has been nominated \nfor a life-tenure on the Nation's highest court thinks about this \nissue. And when it comes to Judge Sotomayor, her record raises serious \nquestions about her views on free speech.\n  Let's start with a law review article that Judge Sotomayor co-wrote \nin 1996 on one particular kind of speech, political speech. In the \narticle, Judge Sotomayor makes a number of startling assertions which \noffer us a glimpse of her thoughts on the issue.\n  First, and perhaps most concerning, she equates campaign \ncontributions to bribery, going so far as to assume that a ``quid pro \nquo'' relationship is at play every time anyone makes a contribution to \na political campaign. She goes on to say that:\n\n       We would never condone private gifts to judges about to \n     decide a case implicating the gift-givers' interests. Yet our \n     system of election financing permits extensive private, \n     including corporate, financing of candidates' campaigns, \n     raising again and again the question of what the difference \n     is between contributions and bribes and how legislators or \n     other officials can operate objectively on behalf of the \n     electorate.\n\n  In the same law review article, Judge Sotomayor calls into question \nthe integrity of every elected official, Democrat and Republican alike, \nbased solely on the fact that they collect contributions to run their \npolitical campaigns. She writes:\n\n       Can elected officials say with credibility that they are \n     carrying out the mandate of a ``democratic'' society, \n     representing only the general public good, when private money \n     plays such a large role in their campaigns?\n\n  In my view, the suggestion that such contributions are tantamount to \nbribery should offend anyone who has ever contributed to a political \ncampaign--including the millions of Americans who donated money in \nsmall and large amounts to the Presidential campaign of the man who \nnominated Judge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor's views on free speech would be important in any \ncase. They are particularly important at the moment, however, since \nseveral related cases are now working their way through the judicial \nsystem--cases that could ultimately end up in front of the Supreme \nCourt. One particularly important case on the issue, Citizens United v. \nFEC, will be reargued before the Supreme Court at the end of September.\n  Coincidentally, the most recent Supreme Court decision on the topic \nactually passed through the court on which Judge Sotomayor currently \nsits, presenting us with yet another avenue for evaluating her approach \nto questions of free speech--with one important difference: in the Law \nReview article I have already discussed, we got Judge Sotomayor's \nopinion about campaign contributions. In the court case in question, \nRandall v. Sorrell, we get a glimpse of her actual application of the \nlaw.\n  Here is the background on the case. In 1997, the State of Vermont \nenacted a law which brought about stringent restrictions on the amount \nof money candidates could raise and spend. The law also limited party \nexpenditures. Viewing these limits as violating their first amendment \nrights, a group of candidates, voters, and political action committees \nbrought suit. The district court agreed with the plaintiffs in the case \non two of the three points, finding only the contribution limits \nconstitutional.\n  The case was then appealed to the Second Circuit, where a three-judge \npanel reversed the lower court and reinstated all limits in direct \ncontradiction of nearly 20 years of precedents dating all the way back \nto the case of Buckley v. Valeo. It was in Buckley that the Supreme \nCourt held that Congress overstepped its bounds in trying to restrict \nthe amount of money that could be spent--so-called expenditure limits--\nbut upheld the amount that could be raised--so-called contribution \nlimits.\n  At that point, the petitioners in the Vermont case sought a rehearing \nby the entire Second Circuit, arguing that the blatant disregard of a \nprecedent as well-settled as Buckley was grounds for review. Oddly \nenough, the judges on the Second Circuit, including Judge Sotomayor, \ntook a pass. They decided to let the Supreme Court clean up the \nconfusion created when the three-judge panel decided to ignore Buckley.\n  Traditionally, errors like these are precisely the reason that \nmotions for a rehearing of an entire circuit are designed. In fact, \naccording to the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure, a review by the \nfull court, what is commonly referred to as an en banc rehearing, is \nspecifically called for in cases where ``the proceeding involves a \nquestion of exceptional importance.'' And what could be more important \nfor a lower court judge than following Supreme Court precedent and \nprotecting and preserving the first amendment? But the Second Circuit \ndeclined.\n  In the end, the Supreme Court corrected the errors of the Second \nCircuit in a 6-3 opinion drafted by none other than Justice Breyer. \nHere is what Breyer wrote:\n\n       We hold that both sets of limitations [on contributions and \n     expenditures] are inconsistent with the First Amendment. \n     Well-established precedent--and here Justice Breyer was \n     citing Buckley--makes clear that the expenditure limits \n     violate the First Amendment.\n\n  One of the principal requirements for a nominee to the courts is a \nrespect for the rule of law. In this instance, according to Justice \nBreyer, that respect for the law was sorely lacking.\n  More than two centuries ago, the States ratified the first amendment \nto the U.S. Constitution to protect the right of every American from \nthat moment and for all time to express themselves freely. ``Congress \nshall make no law,'' it said, ``respecting an establishment of \nreligion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the \nfreedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of the people \npeaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for redress of \ngrievances.''\n  You could say, as I have said many times, that with the first \namendment, our forefathers adopted the ultimate campaign finance \nregulation. And yet this issue continues to come before the courts, and \nwill continue to come up before the courts. It is an issue of \nfundamental importance, touching on one of our most basic rights. And \nbased on the writings and decisions of Judge Sotomayor, I have strong \nreservations about whether this nominee will choose to follow the first \namendment or attempt to steer the Court to a result grounded in the \nkind of personal ideology that she so clearly and troublingly expressed \nin the law review article I have described.\n  It is not just this issue about which those concerns arise. Over the \npast several weeks, we have heard about a number of instances in which \nJudge Sotomayor's personal views seem to call into question her \nevenhanded application of the law.\n  Just last week, the Supreme Court reversed her decision to throw out \na discrimination suit filed by a group of mostly White firefighters who \nhad clearly earned a promotion. Notably, this was the ninth time out of \nten that the high court has rejected her handling of a case.\n  We have heard her call into question, repeatedly over the years, \nwhether judges could even be impartial in most cases. And she has even \nsaid that her experience ``will affect the facts that [she] chooses to \nsee as a judge''.\n  Americans have a right to expect that judges will apply the law \nevenhandedly--that everyone in this country will get a fair shake, \nwhether they are in small claims court or the Supreme Court, and \nwhether the matter at hand is the right to be treated equally or the \nright to speak freely. Americans have a right to expect that the men \nand women who sit on our courts will respect the rule of law above \ntheir own personal or political views--and nowhere more so than on the \nNation's highest court.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7278-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7278-S7279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, it was a politician from Kentucky who \nintroduced the expression ``self-made man'' into the lexicon. But even \nHenry Clay didn't follow as unlikely a path as Norm Coleman did to the \nU.S. Senate.\n\n[[Page S7279]]\n\nAs Norm puts it, he never even knew a Republican or a Lutheran before \nhe left home for college.\n  Yet this middle-class son of Brooklyn became one of the best senators \nthe people of Minnesota have ever known. And he has always made sure to \ngive them all the credit, even when the voters would have excused him \nfor taking a little credit of his own.\n  Another great American politician said the U.S. Constitution was \n``the work of many heads and many hands.'' Norm's always had the same \nattitude about his own career. He is grateful for the opportunities he \nhas had. He gives it everything he has. Then he is grateful when his \nefforts on behalf of others succeed, which is more often than not.\n  The day he got here he was asked how it felt. He had a simple \nresponse. He said he was humbled by the opportunity. ``I believe that \nwhat I can do well, my gift,'' he said, ``is to serve people, and now I \nhave this incredible opportunity to serve as a United States Senator.'' \nSix years later, on the day he conceded defeat, his first impulse was \nagain to thank others. He thanked his staff for the long hours and hard \nwork they had put in on his behalf. And he said he would always be \ngrateful to and humbled by the people had of Minnesota who had given \nhim the honor to serve, and even more grateful for the patience and \nunderstanding they showed over these last several months.\n  It wasn't the outcome he wanted. It wasn't the outcome that his \nRepublican friends and colleagues in the Senate wanted. But we couldn't \nhave expected anything less from Norm Coleman than the class and \ngraciousness he showed in the closing act of this phase in his career \nas a public servant.\n  As I said, Norm came to be a Republican Senator from Minnesota by a \nrather unusual route. He was a campus activist in the 1960s, and a \nrather prominent one at that. After college, Norm earned a scholarship \nto the University of Iowa Law School and came to love the people and \nthe place.\n  From there, he went on to Minnesota to serve in the Minnesota \nAttorney General's Office. Later, he would use his talents as chief \nprosecutor for the state of Minnesota, and then as mayor of St. Paul, \nfirst as a Democrat and then as a Republican. In what has to go down as \none of the more remarkable feats of bipartisanship in American \npolitics, Norm has the distinction of serving as the 1996 cochairman of \nthe committee to reelect Bill Clinton and 2000 State chairman for \nGeorge W. Bush's campaign.\n  As a big-city mayor, Norm didn't disappoint. He showed a real knack \nfor bringing business and government together. He led a downtown \nrevitalization effort, created thousands of jobs, brought the National \nHockey League to St. Paul and fought to keep taxes low. He left office \nwith a 74 percent approval rating, after two terms that a local \nmagazine called ``by almost any measure . . . an unqualified success.''\n  In 2002, Norm was still thinking about how he could serve on the \nState level when he got a call from the President asking him if he \nwould run for the Senate. He accepted the challenge and then he fought \na tough and principled campaign against our late beloved colleague Paul \nWellstone before Paul's tragic death shortly before the end of that \ntumultuous campaign. Norm grieved with the rest of Minnesota at Paul's \npassing, defeated his replacement in the race, and was sworn in 2 \nmonths later as Laurie, their children, Jake and Sarah, and Norm's \nparents, Beverly and Norman, looked on. Laurie summed up the day like \nthis: ``It's incredible to think that he has this opportunity.''\n  Norm didn't waste a day. An instant hit at Republican events across \nthe country, he kept up the same torrid pace in the Senate he had set \nin his come-from-behind win the previous November. He pushed \nlegislation that benefited Minnesotans and all Americans, and he never \nlet up.\n  Norm spoke the other day about some of his accomplishments here. He \nmentioned a few areas in particular, including U.N. oversight, working \nwith Minnesota farmers, and his work on energy independence. But he \nsaid his best ideas came from the people of Minnesota.\n  He was being humble. In a single term, Norm put together a remarkable \nrecord of results. On energy and conservation, he played a key role in \nestablishing the renewable fuels standard. He helped pass an extension \nof the tax credits for wind, biomass, and other renewable fuels. He \nsecured loan guarantees and tax incentives for clean coal power; \nprotected fish populations; and supported conservation programs to \nprotect Minnesota's lakes, rivers, and woodlands.\n  He led major anticorruption efforts, including a groundbreaking \nexposure of fraud at the U.N. He exposed more than a billion dollars in \nwasteful Medicare spending and uncovered serial tax evasion by defense \ncontractors. Norm was also instrumental in passing the Conquer \nChildhood Cancer Act which increased funding for childhood cancer \nresearch.\n  The proud son of a World War II veteran, Norm has been a true friend \nto all veterans. The first piece of legislation he introduced was a \nbill requiring the Pentagon to cover the travel expenses of troops \nheading home from service abroad. Norm worked on a bipartisan basis to \nestablish the first-ever national reintegration program for returning \ntroops. And he worked hard, in the early years after 9/11, to \nstrengthen homeland security.\n  Norm Coleman's service in the Senate has been marked by the same high \nlevel of distinction that has marked everything else he has done in \nthree decades of public service. Today we honor our colleague and \nfriend for that long career that we hope is far from over. And we \npunctuate an incredibly hard fought campaign that some people thought \nmight never end.\n  In the end, it didn't turn out the way many of us had hoped it would. \nBut none of us were surprised by the graciousness with which Norm \nColeman accepted the verdict, and all of us can celebrate the 6 years \nof dedicated service he gave to the people of Minnesota.\n  After another setback some years back, Norm Coleman said that real \ndefeat isn't getting knocked down. It is not getting back up. And I \nhave no doubt that this is not the last we will hear from Norm Coleman. \nHe already has a legacy to be proud of. But it is a legacy that is \nstill very much in the works. More chapters will be written. And they \nwill bear the same strong hand and commitment to people and principle \nthat he has shown in every other endeavor of a long and distinguished \ncareer.\n  In private conversation Senator Coleman often talks about resting on \nthe truths of his faith. It is an untold Washington story--the glue of \nfaith that holds this city together. So as I say goodbye to Senator \nColeman, I would like to do so with words from the Torah that he knows \nwell:\n\n       The Lord bless you. and keep you; The Lord make His face \n     shine on you, And be gracious to you; The Lord lift up His \n     countenance upon you, And give you peace.\n\n  And on behalf of the entire Senate family, I want to thank Norm for \nhis service. We will miss him.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7279-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I thought, as \nSenator McConnell noted, that Senator Coleman showed extraordinary \ngrace in conceding after the latest Minnesota Supreme Court decision. \nIt was a relief to all involved and to the people of\n\n[[Page S7280]]\n\nMinnesota to have two Senators representing them here in this Chamber. \nI wish Senator Coleman the very best in his future endeavors and again \nthank Senator McConnell for his remarks which I know speak on behalf of \nall Senators from both sides of the aisle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7280-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SOTOMAYOR NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, Senator McConnell spoke previously about \nthe nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. This is a rare, \nhistoric opportunity for the Senate to consider a nomination sent to us \nby the President. It doesn't happen very often. In my career, my 13th \nyear in the Senate, this will be my third opportunity in the Judiciary \nCommittee to actually ask questions of someone who aspires to serve on \nthe highest Court of the land, a lifetime appointment and a very \nimportant appointment in terms of our Nation's history.\n  The question raised by Senator McConnell is entirely appropriate. I \ncommend him because his statement really goes to the heart of what this \nprocess should be about. It wasn't about the personality of the judge \nor any personal trait, it was about her beliefs and whether they are \nthe kinds of beliefs we would like to see enshrined in her service as a \nSupreme Court Justice.\n  Particularly, Senator McConnell raised an issue which is very \nimportant to him. It is the issue of free speech in relation to \npolitical campaigns. I know this is important because Senator McConnell \ntook an exceptional position in being in opposition to McCain-Feingold \ncampaign finance reform. This was a reform which these two Senators--\none Republican and the other Democrat--brought to the Senate in an \neffort to reduce the impact of corporate contributions and large \ncontributions in our political campaigns. It was their belief that the \nso-called soft money which avoided some of the restrictions that are \napplied to other contributions had gone too far in the extreme. Senator \nMcConnell was not alone, but he really was in the minority in opposing \nthe McCain-Feingold position. He even went so far as to file documents \nbefore the courts arguing that this was a violation of free speech. The \ncourts did not find in his favor and ruled that McCain-Feingold was, in \nfact, permissible and constitutional.\n  Now Senator McConnell comes to the floor and argues that Judge \nSotomayor apparently doesn't agree with his point of view either. That \nis certainly Senator McConnell's right to do. But to question whether \nshe should be allowed to serve on the Supreme Court because she \ndisagrees with Senator McConnell's minority views on McCain-Feingold \nand the use of money in political campaigns is an unfair \ncharacterization of her position. Keep in mind that Judge Sotomayor \ncomes to this nomination with an extraordinary background. She brings \nmore Federal judicial experience to the Supreme Court, if approved, \nthan any Justice nominated in over 100 years and more overall judicial \nexperience than anyone confirmed to the Court in the past 70 years.\n  She was first nominated by a Republican President to serve on the \nFederal court, President George Herbert Walker Bush. Then she was \npromoted to the next level court, the circuit court, by President \nClinton, a Democratic President--bipartisan support, approval of the \nSenate both times, and no one suggested her views were radical or not \nin the mainstream of judicial thinking in America.\n  So when Senator McConnell raises this point, it reflects the fact \nthat his view of campaign finance, his view of restrictions on \ncontributions is, in fact, a minority position, one that the court has \nnot approved of and most Americans may not agree with. Most Americans \nbelieve we should keep a close eye on political contributions to make \nsure they don't corrupt our political process. We want to honor free \nspeech. Some of us believe the Court decision in Buckley v. Valeo went \nto an extreme and basically argued that the expenditure of money in a \npolitical campaign was an exercise of free speech. That argument leads \nto the conclusion that a millionaire is entitled to more free speech \nthan the common person who couldn't spend that kind of money on a \npolitical campaign.\n  I might also add, we have been trying to move forward a piece of \nlegislation that will give even more disclosure on political campaign \nfinancing. It would require the electronic filing of campaign finance \nreports. We have been trying to move this forward. There has been \nresistance on the other side of the aisle.\n  I think it is bipartisan and consistent with the goals of this \nCongress for us to have this kind of disclosure, for us to recognize \nthat freedom of speech brings with it certain obligations, and that \nJudge Sotomayor's rulings in cases relating to free speech have been \nentirely consistent with the values of our country and in the \nmainstream of this Nation.\n  Next Monday, her nomination comes before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used his 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it will go on for several days, and I \nwill have a chance to speak then. I will yield the floor now. Thank \nyou.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Madam President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7280-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7280-S7284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COMMENDING COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, in 1998, Norm Coleman ran for \nGovernor of Minnesota against the son of one of the most revered \nMembers of this body, Hubert Humphrey, who was also a former Vice \nPresident of the United States, and a noted wrestler, Jesse Ventura, \nwho was elected Governor.\n  In 2002, Norm Coleman ran a campaign against Paul Wellstone, a \nbeloved Member of this body who was tragically killed in an airplane \ncrash a week or so before the election, bringing into the race a former \nVice President of the United States, a former U.S. Senator and \nAmbassador, Walter Mondale. The whole country watched and was riveted \nby that race during that last week. Norm Coleman won that race.\n  This past year, Norm Coleman was a participant in a race that also \nriveted the Nation. He was opposed by a well-known television \npersonality, Al Franken, now a Member of this body. The race went on \nfor 2 years, with much publicity. Then it went on for another 8 months \nafter election day.\n  If Norm Coleman could have found some way to make the 2000 \nPresidential election Bush v. Gore v. Coleman, Norm would have been a \nparticipant in every single one of the most spectacular political races \nof the last decade.\n  Norm and I arrived in the Senate on the same day in 2003. We not only \nwere Members of the Senate family, which we often talk about here and \nwhich extends to both sides of the aisle, we were Members of the same \nclass, and are good friends.\n  My wife, Honey, and I got to know Norm and his wife, Laurie, the \nmother of their two children. We know of his love for his family and of \nhis deep religious faith. Each of us in the Senate has enjoyed the good \nhumor and cheer and civil relationship that Norm has had with his \ncolleagues, both Democrats and Republicans.\n  But most memorable--and the Republican leader spoke of some of this--\nis Norm Coleman's record of service to our country: Chief prosecutor \nfor the State of Minnesota, mayor of St. Paul, Senator.\n  He has been a strong, eloquent, effective voice for the center of \nthis country--an independent voice of the kind our country and the \nRepublican Party needs to attract and represent and continue to bring \ninto our party and into our political process the center.\n  The political campaigns of Norm Coleman have been more spectacular \nthan those of any of us in the Senate. But the public service chapters \nof his life have been equally impressive. As this door closes, I am \nconfident new ones will open.\n  When I was Governor of Tennessee, my chief of staff, a former Marine, \ncame in and said to me during my last years: Governor, I would like to \nsay to you that people remember the last thing you do. And I had no \nidea why he said that to me, but I never could get it out of my mind, \nand I think it is pretty good advice.\n\n[[Page S7281]]\n\n  People will remember the last thing Norm Coleman did in this \ncampaign. He proved to be determined and courageous and, in the \nMinnesota tradition, a happy warrior in attempting to make sure that \nevery Minnesota vote counted in the race, which was decided by just a \nfew votes.\n  But then, when the Minnesota Supreme Court made its decision, he \nimmediately was gracious about accepting the rule of law and the \ncourt's decision and stepping aside and congratulating Al Franken.\n  That is the picture of Norm Coleman that most Minnesotans and most \nAmericans will remember. That may have been the last thing that Norm \ndid in this race, but I am sure it is far from the last thing he is \nlikely to do in public life.\n  Norm Coleman, after those three spectacular races, deserves an easy, \nhumdrum, conventional political race someday. And Minnesota and the \nNation can hope we will deserve and have many more years of Norm \nColeman's public service.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I see my colleague from Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Madam President, I am here this morning to speak about my good friend \nand former colleague, Norm Coleman.\n  Norm and I first met when I was Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment and Norm had been the mayor of St. Paul--I had been the \nmayor of Orange County, FL--and immediately we established a bond. We \nkind of spoke the same language, if you will. We understood each other. \nWe had both been involved in the milieu of urban politics as well as \nthe challenges and responsibilities of being a big city urban center \nmayor.\n  I remember our discussions about the problems of the cities and about \nthe opportunities. Norm had been very successful in creating a new \narena for the hockey team in St. Paul, and this was, I know, a \ntremendously proud thing for him, an accomplishment he had.\n  Little did I know our paths would again cross here in the Senate. I \nremember being in Miami at a radio station and there was a TV monitor \non the screen during the election of 2002, and I remember it was a \ndebate between Norm Coleman and former Vice President and Senator \nWalter Mondale. I remember being detained there watching him and \nthinking what a tough spot he landed in, what a complicated race it had \nbeen through the tragic death of Senator Wellstone, and how proud I was \nof him, of this fellow whom I did not know that well but whom I had met \non a couple of occasions, and he was handling himself quite well. It \nturned out he was successful in that race.\n  Then, only a couple years later, we were reunited here in the Senate \nas colleagues. We both immediately found one another on the Foreign \nRelations Committee of the Senate. Norm, at that time, was the chair of \nthe Western Hemisphere Subcommittee. I found in Norm someone who was \nuncommonly knowledgeable about the Western Hemisphere and carried out \nthose responsibilities with a great sense of urgency.\n  Norm and I traveled in Latin America together. We traveled to Chile \nand to Colombia and perhaps a couple of other places where we conducted \nmeetings trying to advance the United States agenda, promoting the rule \nof law, fighting against narcotrafficking that is such a blight upon \nour cities and our communities, and trying to improve the conditions of \ndemocratic rule in the region.\n  I have no doubt that if Norm Coleman were in the Senate this week, he \nwould have been side by side with us as we have watched closely the \nevents in Honduras and have tried to promote a reasonable, fair, and \ndemocratic outcome to that country's troubled current moments of their \nliving.\n  He was the original sponsor of efforts to build stronger relations \nwith our neighbors to the south. I had the opportunity, as I said, to \ntravel with him. Part of our traveling took us to Colombia where a \ntremendous challenge lies ahead for the people of Colombia as they \nfight for the rule of law and against the narcoterrorists in that \ncountry. I remember our meeting with President Uribe that he and I had.\n  Norm was also very committed and concerned about a stable Middle \nEast, about advancing the peace process in the Middle East, but also \nabout the security of Israel. He was a very strong voice for a strong \nUnited States-Israel relationship. He was a clear voice on the need for \nus to stop and not allow Iran to develop a capability that is nuclear \nand that would invite the opportunity for Iran to carry out the stated \nwishes of destroying the state of Israel. He was a friend of Israel.\n\n  He was also a friend of Cuban freedom. I remember when Norm was first \nin the Senate. He came to the Senate 2 years before I did. During that \ntime, I was still Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. I heard \nthat Norm Coleman was traveling to Cuba. I said to Norm: As you travel \nto Cuba, as a now sitting Senator, I hope you will remember there is a \nlarge and growing dissident movement on that island and they deserve \nthe same recognition you would have given to Lech Walesa or Vaclav \nHavel had you been traveling to Eastern Europe in the 1980s.\n  Norm heard my voice and sought the opportunity to meet with the Cuban \ndissidents while he was on the island. This came as a great surprise to \nhis host because the Cuban Government frowns upon visiting dignitaries \nmeeting with anyone who would present the potential for a democratic \nopposition to a country that has not known democracy now for half a \ncentury.\n  But, in any event, Norm Coleman met with them, and not only met with \nthem but while in Cuba made some very strong statements about the need \nfor a democratic solution to the Cuban situation, about the need for \nthe people of Cuba to have an opportunity to live in freedom, and he \nspoke highly about the dissidents. Needless to say, that is the last \ntime Norm Coleman has been invited to visit Cuba by the Cuban \nGovernment. But I knew then I had found a friend who clearly understood \nthe difference between freedom and oppression and who would clearly \nstand on the side of freedom.\n  Norm, as has been expressed here this morning, with great grace and \ncourage, fought through a very difficult election, and that is in \naddition to the ups and downs of all that went on in the recount and \nthe legal challenges that followed.\n  Norm, with great grace, moved aside. When the time was right, and \nwhen the legal challenges had been exhausted, he did so with the grace \nand dignity that is the hallmark of Norm Coleman.\n  Norm and Laurie are my friends. I wish them the very best as they go \nforward in their lives. I know they will find other opportunities to be \nof service to the people of Minnesota and to the people of the United \nStates, and I might daresay also to the people of Florida because Norm \nhas a great affection for my State, where he has spent a lot of his \ntime--I would daresay particularly in the cold and bitter months when \nmaybe it is a little more pleasant around my neck of the woods than it \nwould be in Minnesota.\n  But we always welcome Norm to Florida. We hope he will continue to \nvisit us frequently, where he has a multitude of friends and a \nmultitude of people who love him, who appreciate him, and who thank him \nfor his great service to our Nation and our State, and who thank him \nfor the great concern he has demonstrated about people who are \noppressed, as well as those who seek to live in freedom and peace \nwithout threat from their neighbors.\n  Madam President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nin making some comments about our former colleague, Norm Coleman. I \nwelcome Senator Franken to the Senate. I welcome him to his service \nhere and congratulate him on his victory. But it would come as no \nsurprise that Senator Coleman will be sadly missed.\n  I had the experience of serving with him on the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee where he served as the chairman of the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigation. This is a subcommittee that \nhas an interesting history. It has the history of some demagoguery if \nyou go back into the past. It also has a history of some accomplishment \nof the various Senators who have served there. I\n\n[[Page S7282]]\n\nthink it unusual that a freshman Senator would serve in that capacity \nand serve as if he were not a freshman but a seasoned veteran. He took \nover that assignment and went after a number of areas of controversy, \nand with a persistence that served him and the Senate very well, \npursued a number of difficulties.\n  So with all of the things we have heard about Norm Coleman--his \nintelligence, his grace, his willingness to work hard and at the same \ntime do so with a sense of class about him--I add my tribute to his \nability to take on a difficult assignment and follow it through.\n  I wish him and his wife and his family well in their activities now. \nI will not go through the resume the Republican leader has established \nfor us. I simply add my voice of gratitude for the opportunity of \nserving with Norm Coleman and my best wishes for him in his future \nactivities. He is a young and vigorous enough man that I think we will \nhear far more from him in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to speak this morning for a \nfew minutes about my dear friend, now former Senator, Norm Coleman, \nfrom the great State of Minnesota. Norm was a very unique individual in \nthe Senate. He grew up in New York, was educated in Iowa, and wound up \nliving in Minnesota. He was a student leader in undergraduate school as \nwell as in law school, so his leadership qualities were certainly \nrecognized early on.\n  Norm grew up in an era right behind me, which was the era of big rock \nbands, and Norm was right in with the majority of the crowd of young \nfolks back then and, in fact, was a roadie with a rock band for a \nwhile. He spent his 20th birthday at Woodstock. We used to joke about \nthat a lot in some of our conversations.\n  After law school, Norm obviously settled down in the State of \nMinnesota where he joined the Office of the Attorney General and \neventually became the State solicitor general. He prosecuted any number \nof cases in both of those offices. He became the mayor of St. Paul, MN, \nin 1993, and, boy, did he ever take over a town that was headed south \nand bring it back to be a totally revitalized community in a way in \nwhich, frankly, I have never seen.\n  When you talk to the people of St. Paul today and you ask them about \nwhat Norm Coleman did for the downtown area of St. Paul, a smile \nimmediately comes to the faces of those residents of St. Paul. He \ncreated thousands of new jobs and brought in more than $3 billion of \nnew development to the city. The one thing St. Paul residents, as well \nas Minneapolis residents, will tell you today about Norm Coleman from \nthe standpoint of his legacy as mayor is that he brought the hockey \nteam back to Minneapolis-St. Paul, and that has had a tremendous \neconomic influence on that community.\n  I think it is a real tribute to Norm and his leadership that after \nbeing elected as a Democrat in 1993, he became a Republican in 1996, \nand then ran for reelection as mayor in 1997 as a Republican, and was \nagain elected mayor of St. Paul. Norm ran for Governor of Minnesota in \n1998, and as a testament to the character, the integrity, and the \ndedication as a public servant of Norm Coleman, when he lost that race \nfor Governor, he was still mayor of St. Paul, and the day after that \nelection, he was back in his mayoral office at 8 o'clock in the morning \ntaking care of the business of the people of St. Paul.\n  I was very privileged to know Norm in a way other than just being a \ncolleague. We were very close personal friends. Having been elected \ntogether, individuals within classes tend to hang together from time to \ntime, and Norm and I enjoyed many social moments outside of this \nChamber, as well as many strong professional moments inside this \nChamber. I will have to say that as chairman of the Committee on \nAgriculture, of which Norm was a member, there was no harder working \nmember of that committee for his constituents, no more dedicated \nindividual to agricultural interests in his State than was Norm \nColeman. In fact, during the farm bill debate last year, Norm pounded \non me every single day during the course of that farm bill debate about \nsome issue that was of particular interest to his State. It may have \nbeen talking about some issue relative to ethanol, some issue relative \nto the issues surrounding corn, wheat, or sugar beets, but whatever it \nwas, Norm was just a hard-working, dedicated man when it came to making \nsure his constituents' interests were protected in that piece of \nlegislation which was so vitally important to the State he represented.\n  I had the opportunity to travel with Norm many times in the State of \nMinnesota, and he likewise traveled in my State. I remember very well \ngoing to the Minnesota State fair with Norm. While we were there, we \nvisited with some of his corn growers whom I have gotten to know on a \npersonal basis as a result of my relationship with Norm.\n  I will never forget that because coming from a cotton-growing State \nwhere we produce a fiber that is used in the manufacture of clothing, \nthe folks in Minnesota have developed a way to produce a piece of cloth \nfrom by-products of corn and ethanol production. They gave me a shirt \nthat day. It was a red shirt. They hadn't quite perfected this \nprocedure at that point in time. I had a T-shirt on underneath the \nshirt I had on, and I immediately took my shirt off and put that red \nshirt on. It was hot as it could be that day. When we got back to the \nhotel that night, I took that shirt off, and I had this pink undershirt \non as a result of having that shirt on. The corn growers have reminded \nme of that. We have had a good laugh about that ever since.\n  Norm is just one of those guys who not only was a dedicated \nprofessional Member of this body, but he is a good guy. He is one of \nthose individuals who folks on both sides of the aisle had, first of \nall, respect for as a Member of this body, but also from a personal \nstandpoint Norm was easy to get along with, easy to work with, and he \nwanted to do what was in the best interests of Americans.\n  I think his work on the Foreign Relations Committee, particularly \nwith respect to his investigation of the fraudulent activities ongoing \nat the United Nations, is unparalleled with respect to any \ninvestigation I have seen take place during my years in the Senate. He \nuncovered an awful lot of fraud and abuse.\n  As a result of Norm's dedicated work and his dogged determination, \nsome changes have been made. Were Norm to have come back to the Senate, \nthere is no question he would have continued to pursue that issue, and \nwe will continue to receive benefits from Norm's investigative measures \nthat were undertaken at the United Nations.\n  I think Norm's reputation as a fighter and as a strong advocate for \nMinnesotans is reflective in the way he handled his election. He fought \nhard in his election. It was very much an uphill battle. A lot of us \nhad tough elections last year, but nobody had a tougher one than Norm \non a day-to-day basis. But he wanted to make sure the people who voted \nfor him, the people who supported him and worked hard in his election \nall across the State of Minnesota had their just due, and he wanted to \nmake sure he could look every Minnesotan in the eye and say: I did \neverything I could do to make sure this election was fairly conducted \nand to make sure that every single vote I could possibly get was \ncounted.\n  At the end of the day, when the election was finally decided, once \nagain, in his very professional way, he conceded and decided, as some \nof us have to do in politics from time to time, that it is time to move \non.\n  We are going to miss Norm Coleman in this body. We are going to miss \nhis family. Laurie and my wife are very dear friends. They communicated \nfrom time to time both while the two of them were in Washington as well \nas being in communication back and forth while they were in their \nrespective States. We will miss that personal relationship. His \ndaughter Sarah and his son Jacob are two very fine young people and \ncertainly are reflective of the\n\n[[Page S7283]]\n\nfact that they have been raised by two very good parents.\n  So to Norm Coleman I simply say we will miss you in the Senate. We \nare not going to let him go away, though. I still talk to him on a \nregular basis and will continue to do so and will seek his advice, his \ncounsel on any number of issues because this is a man who has served \nthe public just about all of his adult life. He has done so in a \nprofessional way and in a way that all of us wish to emulate.\n  Congratulations to Norm, and good luck on whatever road life now \ntakes him.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maine is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I enjoyed hearing my colleague's \ncomments about our friend Senator Norm Coleman because I share the same \nsentiments. I rise today to speak about the extraordinary service of \nthis extraordinary individual.\n  When I became the chairman of the Governmental Affairs Committee in \n2003, a freshman Senator took over the position that I had held as the \nchairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. During the \nnext 6 years, I came to know Senator Norm Coleman as an energetic, \nfarsighted, and committed public servant, but most of all I came to \nknow Norm as a dear friend.\n  As chairman, and later ranking member, of PSI, Norm demonstrated \nunfailing leadership and extraordinary dedication. Working with his \ncolleague from across the aisle, Senator Carl Levin, Norm enhanced \nPSI's reputation as the Senate's premier investigative subcommittee. He \nundertook many complex and important investigations.\n  Under this team's leadership, the subcommittee was successful in \nferreting out waste, fraud, and abuse to the tune of $14 billion. I \nremember particularly well an investigation that exposed tax cheats in \nMedicare and in defense contracting.\n  Another success resulting from Norm's leadership was his highly \nsuccessful and courageous ``oil for food'' investigation. Norm's \ninvestigation uncovered billions of dollars of fraud in this program \noperated by the United Nations. Norm was focused, determined, and \nundeterred in his pursuit of the facts, in his pursuit of the truth.\n  Norm's abiding concern for upholding the public trust is rooted in \nhis background. As a former prosecutor, he is a champion of the rule of \nlaw. As a former mayor, he understands the concerns of State and local \ngovernment. As a Senator, he always worked hard for the people he \nrepresented and for the people of this entire country.\n  These traits were evident in his service as a member of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee. Norm's hard work ensured \nthat the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction had the \nresources and the authority necessary to do his work effectively. \nNorm's keen insight into local government was invaluable during our \nextensive investigation into the failed response to Hurricane Katrina. \nHis insight--critical insight--helped to shape reform in so many areas, \nranging from our intelligence agencies, the postal service, and \ngovernment contracting.\n  Norm was also a passionate advocate for educational opportunity. His \nsupport for strengthening the Pell Grant Program demonstrated his \nbelief that the benefits of higher education should be available to \neveryone with the determination and the desire to pursue more \neducation.\n  In fact, the only quibble I have with Norm's public service dates \nback to his tenure as mayor of St. Paul. His success in bringing \nprofessional hockey back to Minnesota was certainly commendable, but it \nwas based, as I understand it, on the flawed premise that Minnesota is \nthe hockey capital of the United States. The people of Maine know \nbetter, of course, but this was typical of Norm's pride in his State.\n  The past election brought great disappointment, but it also revealed \ncharacter. Norm ran a vigorous, honorable campaign, under very \ndifficult circumstances. He never betrayed his constituents, nor \ncompromised his principles. When the final court decision went against \nhim, he graciously conceded defeat. In fact, I had the opportunity to \ntalk with Norm right after the supreme court in Minnesota ruled against \nhim. I was struck, once again, by his determination to do what he felt \nwas best for his State, even though it was not best for him. I was also \ntouched by his commitment, once again, to his constituents and to \nmoving on and ensuring that they had two Senators representing them. He \nwas not bitter. He was not hurt. He was at peace. He was at peace \nbecause he knew he had served the people of his State to the best of \nhis ability and with all his heart and tremendous intellect.\n  It has been a true honor to serve with Norm Coleman in the Senate, \nand the American people--not just the people of Minnesota--are better \noff for his service. It has been a joy to develop our friendship--a \nfriendship I will always cherish and always continue. I will miss \nserving with Norm day to day, but I know I will see him many times.\n  I wish Norm and his wonderful family all the best in the years to \ncome.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I join my Republican colleagues in thanking \nSenator Norm Coleman for his service in the Senate.\n  As a valued member of my whip team, Senator Coleman was devoted to \nsolving problems in a practical and nonpartisan way. I could always \nexpect from him a serious and interesting view of an issue and could \ncount on him for good advice. His thoughtful and unique perspective, as \nwell as his talent and high energy, will be missed.\n  Senator Coleman ran a fine campaign and was a consummate gentleman \nthroughout the long process of determining the winner of his seat.\n  I join my colleagues in wishing him all the best in his future \nendeavors, and know that he will remain an important voice in our \nparty.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, the Senate will continue to benefit in \nthe years ahead from the service and example of Norm Coleman as a U.S. \nSenator.\n  He brought to the Senate a seriousness of purpose and a high level of \nenergy which he used to help shape national policies and successfully \naddress many important challenges faced by our country.\n  I enjoyed working with him and playing tennis with him. He brought to \nhis service in the Senate a strong and determined commitment to solve \nthe problems facing our country, especially as they affected farmers \nand workers in his State of Minnesota.\n  Norm Coleman's leadership will be missed in the Senate, but we will \ncontinue to benefit from his example and his contributions to this body \nfor many years to come.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I am pleased to join with other Senate \ncolleagues in honoring a loyal and talented friend, Norm Coleman. For \nthe past 6 years, it has been my privilege to serve with him in the \nSenate. During that time, we have worked together on many issues, and I \nhave witnessed with admiration his character and his dedication to the \nUnited States and to the people of Minnesota.\n  As a former mayor of Indianapolis, I was very pleased to welcome \nanother former mayor to the Senate in 2003 when Norm took his seat \nafter an election that was decided by fewer than 50,000 votes. We \ntalked frequently about our experiences in Indianapolis and St. Paul, \nand we shared many perspectives on domestic policy because of this \ncommon bond. He was devoted to principles of good government that \ndeeply informed his service in the Senate. It also was clear to me that \nSenator Coleman had an extremely strong commitment to constituent \nservice that was stimulated by his service as a mayor. He understood \nthat serving his constituents was a 24 hour-a-day job, and he threw \nhimself into the task of serving all Minnesotans.\n  I am especially sad to see Norm leave the Senate because he has been \nan outstanding partner in the work of the Foreign Relations Committee. \nI encouraged him to join our committee in 2003, and he played a \nprominent role in our work from the day he arrived. For 6 years, I sat \nwith Norm through hundreds of Foreign Relations Committee hearings and \nmeetings. He was one of the most active members of the committee, and \nhe could be counted on to bolster our debates and our efforts to \nachieve quorums. I greatly benefitted from the opportunity to exchange \nideas with him, to compare perspectives on\n\n[[Page S7284]]\n\nour witnesses, and to develop common approaches to problems.\n  His impact was especially profound as chairman of the Western \nHemisphere Subcommittee from 2003 until 2006. He traveled frequently to \nLatin America and quickly developed an expertise in the region. He was \nan effective advocate for Plan Colombia, and he was one of our first \nleaders to recognize how important it was to ensure that Colombians had \nalternatives to economic and energy dependence on Venezuela. He \nperformed important oversight of the Western Hemisphere Travel \nInitiative, the Peace Corps, and U.S. policy toward Haiti. Senator \nColeman was the lead organizer of the U.S. -Chile Caucus, a group that \nallowed Senators to engage with Chileans to discuss issues of mutual \ninterest.\n  Senator Coleman developed expertise that went well beyond Latin \nAmerica. In April 2004, I chaired the Senate's first hearing that \nlooked into the troubled Iraq Oil for Food Program. Senator Coleman \ntook the lead from there, and as chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations, he conducted an extensive, 2-year investigation into \ncorruption and mismanagement related to the Oil for Food Program. Many \nof his conclusions were the basis of legislation that he and I \nintroduced in 2005--the United Nations Management, Personnel, and \nPolicy Reform Act. Senator Coleman also was a passionate and informed \nadvocate for U.S. programs to combat HIV/AIDS and a careful student of \nMiddle East politics.\n  I know how much Norm was stimulated by the daily opportunities of the \nSenate Foreign Relation Committee, and he made the most of them. Had he \nprevailed in his 2008 reelection bid, he would have been the second \nranking Republican on the committee.\n  Senator Coleman leaves the Senate after 6 years, having established \nlifetime friendships. It was a special pleasure for Char and me to \nspend time with Norm and his wife Laurie at Aspen Institute events, \ngiving us the opportunity to know much more about their family and life \noutside the Senate.\n  I will miss his good humor, his hard work, and his personal \nfriendship. I have no doubts that he will continue to serve the United \nStates and his fellow Americans in new ways, and I look forward to \nwitnessing all that he will achieve in the future. I join the Senate in \nwishing him the best as he and his family move on to new adventures.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I don't know much about the State of New \nYork or the city of New York. I do know there is a high school there \ncalled James Madison High School, which has some pretty prominent \ngraduates: Senator Bernie Sanders from Vermont, Senator Chuck Schumer \nof New York, and Senator Norm Coleman from Minnesota was a graduate of \nthat school. I believe Ruth Bader Ginsburg, a member of the Supreme \nCourt, also graduated from that high school. I am sure there are \nothers.\n  My message to Norm Coleman is that I have been involved in close \nelections. I lost an election for the Senate many years ago by 524 \nvotes. I won one not too many years ago by 428 votes. So I have some \nappreciation for what Norm Coleman and his opponent, Al Franken, went \nthrough.\n  My thoughts during the past 8 months have been directly toward the \ndifficulty they have had in their lives as a result of that close \nelection. One of my elections--the one I won by 428 votes--took 6 \nweeks. I cannot imagine one taking 8 months. It was a hard-fought \ncampaign. Almost 3 million people voted, and it was decided by 312 \nvotes.\n  I appreciate, as I think do the people of Minnesota, the Senate, and \nthe country, Norm Coleman not taking this to the Supreme Court or a \nhigher court. He could have done that. That speaks well of him.\n  Norm has a lot of fans, of course, in the State of Minnesota, but he \nis also a friend of a close personal friend of mine from the State of \nNevada, Sig Rogich. Sig Rogich and I have been very close personal \nfriends for a long time. He is a man of accomplishment. Having been \nborn in Iceland, he came to America and was raised in Henderson, where \nI was raised. Actually, he is a wealthy man now, a very prominent \nbusinessman. One of Norm's biggest supporters around the country is Sig \nRogich; he has a great pedigree. He was part of the Tuesday team of \nfamous media developed for Ronald Reagan. He worked in the White House \nfor the first President Bush. He is a very personal friend of the first \nPresident Bush and also is well known and was part of the second Bush \nteam and knows him very well. My understanding of Sig Rogich's \nrelationship with Norm Coleman is that they are friends. That speaks \nwell of both of them, that they have such high-quality friends.\n  Norm Coleman's relationship with me--myself being a Democrat and he \nbeing a Republican--was always very good. We spoke to each other often. \nHe was always very courteous and always a gentleman with me. I never \nheard him say a negative word about me. I cannot ever recall saying \nanything negative about him. To show that he did do some legislation \nthat I watched very closely, one piece of legislation he did was one \nthat would allow people, when filing their income tax return, to \ndesignate part of their return to go to the National Guardsmen or \nReservists, those who lose their jobs as a result of going into combat \nand their families are having trouble making the grade. The few dollars \nthey get from the military doesn't make up for what their house payment \nis and everything. This would allow money to be put into a fund to be \nadministered and allow this money to go toward the families of these \npeople fighting overseas. I thought so much of that legislation that I \nhave sponsored it. It is working its way through the Senate, and it is \na fine piece of legislation. I acknowledge that I plagiarized this from \nNorm Coleman. It came from his friend and my friend, Sig Rogich.\n  I wish Norm and his family the very best. Recognizing that these \ncampaigns come to an end, he is a relatively young man, and I am sure \nwith his educational background and his notoriety in Minnesota, he will \nhave a bright future.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7284-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7284-S7285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am here today to speak about \nSenator Coleman, who was my colleague for my first 2 years in the \nSenate. As everyone knows, last week the Minnesota Supreme Court issued \nits ruling on the outcome of last November's Senate election. As I did \nthis week, I congratulate Al Franken for his hard-earned and long-\nawaited election victory. He has had a good first week in the Senate, \nand we all welcome him. But I do wish to take this time to talk about \nNorm Coleman.\n  First of all, after 6 months without having a second Senator, Senator \nColeman made a very difficult decision, and he did it with such grace. \nHe could have appealed that decision. He could have gone to Federal \ncourt. It was his right. But he made a decision which he felt was best \nfor the State of Minnesota, and the State.\n  I wish to talk a little bit about what Norm Coleman meant to me to \nhave him as a colleague in the Senate.\n  When I first came to the Senate, Norm had been a Senator for many \nyears, and he was very gracious to me. He reached out with his staff. \nWe basically got along from the moment I started to the end of his term \nas a Senator. We worked very hard at that. When we had disagreements, \nwe talked them out and our staffs would talk them out because we felt \nthe most important thing was that we represent the State of Minnesota.\n  Each one of us knows Norm in our own way, but I think all of us agree \nthis is someone who cares so much\n\n[[Page S7285]]\n\nabout his family, his wife Laurie, and their two children, Jacob and \nSarah. Theirs is a family that has known tremendous tragedy. Two of \ntheir children died in early infancy from a rare genetic disease. While \nNorm doesn't talk about this much, his reverence to life and his \ndevotion to family are very clear.\n  Second only to his family has been his dedication to public service. \nIt has literally defined his adult life. Maybe it was sheer destiny \nthat he found his way to the Senate. After all, he is a graduate of \nJames Madison High School in Brooklyn, which is also the alma mater of \ntwo of our Senate colleagues--Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders.\n  Norm hit the ground running in politics, and he has not stopped. In \ncollege, he was a student activist, and in law school, he served as the \npresident of his class. Immediately after getting his law degree, he \njoined the Minnesota Attorney General's Office, recruited by my good \nfriend, legendary attorney general Warren Spannaus. Norm was in the \nAttorney General's Office 17 years, most of that time doing criminal \nprosecutions, ultimately rising to the position of solicitor general \nfor the State of Minnesota.\n  In 1993, Norm was elected the mayor of St. Paul at a time when the \ncity, especially its downtown, was suffering economically. During his 8 \nyears as mayor, he worked to turn St. Paul around. Building public-\nprivate partnerships, he redeveloped the industrial riverfront into a \nrecreational greenspace. A new Minnesota science museum was built \noverlooking the Mississippi River. Most famously, he brought hockey \nback to Minnesota, securing a new National Hockey League franchise that \nmoved into the new arena. Hockey is very important in Minnesota.\n  In 1998, Norm was narrowly defeated in a three-way race for Minnesota \nGovernor. The winner, of course, was Jesse Ventura--something not many \npeople across the United States expected to happen. I think Norm once \nsaid that not everyone can say they lost to a candidate whose previous \ncareer highlight was being killed by an alien creature in the movie \n``Predator.'' But he took it in stride.\n  In 2002, Norm was elected to the Senate under tragic circumstances. \nJust days before the election, my good friends Paul Wellstone and his \nwife Sheila and their daughter Marcia and members of their staff were \nkilled in a tragic plane crash in northern Minnesota. Norm became the \nSenator. Like Paul, Norm took his duties very seriously, and I could \nsee that in my 2 years in the Senate. He cared deeply about the work he \ndid in foreign relations, some of which people never really talked \nabout, never made the front page of the newspaper, but it was something \nhe cared deeply about.\n  Together, we worked on several issues in our State which were of key \nimportance, legislation to benefit our State. The most dramatic example \nof this spirit of cooperation was our response to the sudden collapse \nof the Interstate 35W bridge into the Mississippi River on August 1, \n2007. Thirteen people were killed and 150 were injured, many with \nsevere and permanent injuries. Literally our cities came to a stop. For \nour State, out of this unprecedented disaster, this public trauma was \nsomething to which they immediately responded.\n  I still remember when Senator Coleman and I came in the very next \nmorning--we flew in with the Secretary of Transportation, Mary Peters--\nand there were already billboards up, literally 12 hours later, \ndirecting people where to go with the traffic and how to get buses to \nget to where they had to go. As I said that day, a bridge in America \nshould not just fall down, but when one does fall down, we rebuild it. \nIn the 72 hours immediately following the bridge collapse, Norm and I \nworked together to secure $250 million in emergency bridge construction \nfunding. Representative Jim Oberstar led the way in the House. Approval \nof this funding came with remarkable speed and bipartisanship. Capitol \nHill veterans tell me it was a rare feat, aided by unity among \nMinnesota's elected leaders across the aisle, across the political \nspectrum. I am pleased to report that just 13 months after that \ncollapse, Minnesota drivers were able to drive over a safe new 35W \nbridge and eight-lane highway. That is just 13 months after the \ncollapse.\n  While the bridge is the most visible example, Norm and I had many \nother opportunities to work together on issues that mattered to the \npeople in our State.\n  There was another Minnesota disaster in August 2007 when severe \nflooding hit the southeastern corner of our State. We worked on this \ntogether, along with Congressman Walz, to ensure a rapid, effective \nresponse by Federal agencies to help communities, businesses, and \nfamilies in need.\n  We worked together on the Agriculture Committee. We both served on \nthat committee. We succeeded in passing a new farm bill that was very \nimportant to our State.\n  We worked together with a bipartisan group of Senators on energy \nlegislation, to move forward in unity.\n  We worked together in securing Federal funds for the security costs \nof the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, along with our \ncolleagues in Colorado. I still remember standing before this Chamber \nsaying that I stood tall to obtain the funding to protect the security \nof the Republican leadership from across this country. We did that \ntogether.\n  We joined to secure educational benefits owed to our National Guard \nand Reserve troops returning from Active Duty overseas. We are so proud \nof our National Guard in Minnesota. The Red Bulls have served longer in \nIraq than any other National Guard unit in the country. And Norm and I \nworked together to make sure we expanded the Beyond the Yellow Ribbon \nProgram to help those Guard and Reserve who really have no base to go \nhome to but go home to little towns across our State. We worked on that \ntogether.\n  Our State has a proud tradition of electing both Democrats and \nRepublicans to office. They expect us to work together. From the very \nbeginning, Norm and I knew that was part of our duty to the people of \nour State, that was part of our obligation, no matter if we disagreed \non issues, that we were going to work together.\n  So today I acknowledge my former colleague, Norm Coleman, for the \nstrength he has shown during this long campaign, for the grace he \nshowed last week when he made that difficult decision, and for the fine \nwork he did for the people of Minnesota.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7285-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7285-S7286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FOOD SAFETY SYSTEM REFORM\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I am here to talk briefly today about \nfood safety, something about which I care deeply. As you probably know, \nthe last few food epidemics, from the jalapeno peppers to peanut \nbutter, would not have been solved except for the hard work of the \nUniversity of Minnesota and the Minnesota Department of Health, which \nis a model for how we can solve these epidemics. Thirteen people died \nwith the last peanut butter one. It was only when someone died and was \nsick in Minnesota that it got solved.\n  Clearly, while we are proud of the work we do, we have to bring out \nthis model nationally. I am proud to be doing a bill with Senator \nChambliss to try to bring out this model for the rest of the country.\n  I do note today that the Washington Post has a strong editorial \nrecommending we do something to improve the food safety of this Nation. \nI think it is worth reading that editorial. They are talking about the \nneed to get something done. Just this week, the White House came out \nwith its food safety recommendations which include, as I said, building \na new national trace-back and response system, including clear industry \nguidance, a new unified incidence command system, and improved use of \ntechnology to deliver individual food safety alerts to consumers. We \ncan truly do better.\n  There is also a bill--the bill Senator Chambliss and I have sponsored \nfocuses on the end of this problem when\n\n[[Page S7286]]\n\na foodborne illness is out there--there is also a bill to prevent it in \nthe first place, a bipartisan bill in the Senate. Senator Dick Durbin \nis heading up that bill, along with Judd Gregg, Ted Kennedy, Richard \nBurr, Chris Dodd, and Lamar Alexander, and Senator Chambliss and I are \nalso sponsors of that legislation. The idea of that legislation is to \nbeef up the FDA to improve our capacity to prevent food safety \nproblems.\n  As we all know, the tragedy that happened in Georgia where the \ninformation did not get to the right people, where inspectors had come \nin or not enough inspections had come in--the information did not get \nup the food chain, so to say. No one knew what was going on, that there \nwere violations at this plant, and 13 people died. That has to change.\n  We also have to improve our capacity to detect and respond with \ninspections, surveillance, and traceability. We also have in this bill \nways to enhance U.S. food defense capabilities and to increase FDA \nresources. We have seen just recently the problem with the refrigerator \ncookie dough manufactured by Nestle. So we know this problem has not \nended and it continues.\n  I am urging the Senate to take action, first of all, on the Food \nSafety Modernization Act of 2009, the bipartisan bill, to give the FDA \nmore tools to do what it does. We have already seen the good work the \nAgriculture Department does with certain fields, and we need to build \non this work and make sure we are able to catch these things before \nthey get out into the food stream and the people of our country. \nSecondly, when it does happen, when salmonella or something does get \nout there, we have to respond quickly.\n  I also urge the Senate, as part of these FDA measures, to pass the \nFood Safety Rapid Response Act, a bill I have with Senator Chambliss. \nThis is a smart bill. It uses these models of epidemiology tools that \nshould be used all over the country.\n  It should not have to be the case that people have to get sick in \nMinnesota before we solve this problem. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control, foodborne disease causes about 76 million illnesses, \n325,000 hospitalizations, and 5,000 deaths in the United States every \nyear.\n  We should not wait. We should be acting on these two bills. We have a \nfull agenda, but we have before us two bills that have bipartisan \nsupport. We have not heard people attacking them. They are the way to \ngo. We have food industry people involved in both of these bills who \nalso want to get them passed. Obviously, they do not want to keep \nlosing profits because of food scares across this country. Let's get \nthese bills done and improve our food safety system in the United \nStates of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7286-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7286-S7288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I would like to join some of my \ncolleagues today who have spoken previously in reflecting upon the \nservice of our colleague, Norm Coleman. As we all know, the election \nprocess in Minnesota has come to a conclusion. We have welcomed his \nsuccessor to the U.S. Senate. But I also want to just make some remarks \nabout Senator Coleman's service in the Senate and sort of my \nrecollections of that.\n  Obviously, all of us come here motivated to do different things. We \nall have reasons we want to be in public service, things we want to \naccomplish. Senator Coleman, obviously, came from the State of \nMinnesota, having been in an executive position where he served as \nmayor of St. Paul. He accomplished some wonderful things for the State, \nnot the least of which was bringing hockey to Minnesota. That is \nsomething that any of us from that region of the country know was \ngreatly appreciated by the citizens of his city and his State.\n  Norm and I came to the Senate under different circumstances. I recall \nhaving traveled around the country with Senator Coleman as we were \ncampaigning together in 2002 trying to come to the Senate and having \nthat opportunity to get to know him. When you travel with somebody on \nan ongoing basis, you get to know them not on a superficial basis--the \nway many of us here get to know people, sort of on a thin level--but \nyou get a chance to really get a glimpse into the soul of people when \nyou are in certain circumstances, when you are in tough campaigns. \nCertainly, Norm was no stranger to tough campaigns.\n  As it turned out, that 2002 election Norm was elected to the Senate. \nI lost my election in 2002 and didn't come here until a couple of years \nlater. But during the course of the campaigns, and then having served \nwith Norm Coleman--representing a neighbor State in South Dakota--we \nshared a lot of common interests. Whether it was agriculture or \nrenewable energy or the economy in our States and trying to create jobs \nin the upper Midwest of this country, Norm Coleman was somebody who, \nmore than anything else, cared about results.\n  There are so many instances here where we get drawn into debates in \nthe Senate and the partisan lines get drawn and a lot of ideology comes \ninto play. Obviously, that is part of the process as well. But the \nbottom line was that Norm Coleman cared about getting things done for \nthe people of Minnesota. I think that was the kind of can-do attitude \nhe brought to his job as mayor and to all the other areas of public \nservice in which he was engaged during the course of his career in \npublic life.\n  But coming to the Senate, I am sure, had to have been frustrating \nbecause this is a place where sometimes it is very difficult to see the \nresult and the outcome of your efforts. Norm was someone who was \nfocused. He was intent upon getting things done, getting things \naccomplished, and I think during his service here he did some great \nthings for the people of Minnesota and for the people of this country.\n  If he were here, I think he would tell you that in coming to the \nSenate--and I would tell you the same thing--he can now look back on \nsome of the things he was involved in getting done, such as being \ninvolved in the big debates over the confirmation of Chief Justice John \nRoberts or Justice Sam Alito--these were big debates in which we were \nall involved in seeing good people put on the Supreme Court of this \ncountry. We worked in areas that were specific to our States--again, \nagriculture, renewable energy, putting energy policies in place that I \nthink will drive America's future in terms of trying to lessen our \ndependence upon foreign sources of energy and, obviously, trying to \nbring more economic opportunity to this country by promoting the energy \nsources we have right here, particularly in places such as the Midwest \nwhere we can produce biofuels and wind and all those sorts of things.\n  Those are the kinds of issues Norm Coleman was committed to because \nhe understood the profound impact they had on the citizens of his State \nof Minnesota. I also think sometimes around here people tend to--as we \nall do because we all are elected to represent constituencies--\nsometimes feel pressured to make votes that might be more political. \nBut I have seen Norm Coleman time and again come in here and make \nvotes--sometimes tough votes--that he thought were the right ones for \nthe future of this country. That, too, is a quality that sometimes is \nlacking and can be rare in public life.\n  So I just wanted to express my appreciation for having had the \nopportunity to serve with Norm Coleman in the Senate. He is someone who \nI think was a tremendous reflection upon the State of Minnesota, the \npeople of his State; someone who was intent upon doing the right thing \nfor the future of this country; and, frankly, someone who, in my view, \nbrought an authenticity and a genuineness to this body and to this \nworld of politics in Washington, DC, which sometimes is lacking in \nthose qualities. He was sincere, he was genuine, and you knew exactly \nwhere he was coming from. With Norm Coleman, what you saw was what you \ngot.\n  I was pleased to have had the opportunity not only to serve with him \nin the Senate and to call him a colleague, but more importantly than \nthat to call he and Laurie and their family friends because that is \nsomething that is also rare in Washington, DC. Sometimes the Senate can \nbe a lonely place, and when you develop a friendship of the type and \ndepth that I have with Norm Coleman, I find that to be very rare around \nhere and something I will treasure and remember for some time to come.\n\n[[Page S7287]]\n\n  I also know Norm Coleman will continue in whatever he chooses to do \nnext to serve the people of Minnesota and the people of his country \nbecause for him it wasn't about the position or the title, it was about \nthe difference he made, and he is making, and I know he will continue \nto do great things for this country. Whatever he chooses to do next, it \nwill be with an eye toward how he can make a difference and contribute \nin a positive way to furthering and improving the quality of life for \nthe people of the State and the people of this country.\n  If he were here today, Madam President, I think he would probably \nalso enter into some of the great debates that we are having. Norm \nColeman was someone who cared about fiscal responsibility, he cared \nabout future generations, and he cared about making sure we secured a \nbetter and brighter future for those who will come after us. I think he \nwould be very troubled by many of the things we see happening in the \ncountry, and certainly things we see happening with legislation that is \nmoving in the Senate.\n  As we look at the big debates, whether it is dealing with the issue \nof the reform of health care in this country--which is one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy--or whether it deals with the new national energy tax, \nrecently passed in the House of Representatives--which is going to \nimpose a crushing burden on all families across this country and \nfamilies in Minnesota and families in South Dakota--those are issues \nwhere I think we need to be careful. We need to be thoughtful and we \nneed to scrutinize them as they come through the Congress.\n  We saw the House move very quickly the week before last on a 1,200-\npage bill that imposes a brandnew national energy tax on the American \npeople. We can all debate about how much that tax is going to be, but \none thing we know is that everybody in this country is going to pay \nhigher energy taxes. Whether that is electricity, whether that is \nfuels, whether it is natural gas, or whether that is home heating oil, \nevery American consumer--every American family, every American small \nbusiness--is going to see their energy costs go up because of the \nlegislation that was passed in the House last week, and if it is \nsuccessful in passing in the Senate.\n  It is my hope we can put the brakes on that because it is not fair to \nthe American people. At a time when many of them are losing their jobs, \nat a time when many of them are struggling to make ends meet, we should \nnot be imposing a brandnew, top-down, bureaucratic, heavy-handed \nmandate that will have a crushing effect and crushing impact on the \neconomy of this country and increase the bills and the taxes that \nAmerican consumers are going to pay.\n  So I hope we will bring some reason to this debate; that the Senate \nwill not act in the hasty way the House of Representatives did in \nthrowing a 1,200-page bill on the floor, and then adopting a 309-page \namendment in a minimum amount of time. We all know people didn't have \nan opportunity to read that bill. This is something that is a major \nconsequence to this country and to our economy and we ought to do it \nwith great regard for the American people and we should make sure they \nare engaged.\n\n  In travelling around my own State last week, I can tell you that at \nall the public events I attended it was loud and clear, people were \nunanimously opposed to this cap-and-trade--national energy tax--bill \nthat is currently moving through the Congress.\n  I have described that and other things that are happening here. \nWhether it is the government ownership of the automobile industry or \nthe financial system--banks--or insurance companies, that is a trend we \ndon't want to see continued on a long-term basis. That is why I have \nintroduced legislation called the Government Ownership Exit Plan, which \nwould require the government to divest itself and to wind down its \ninterest in these private companies in the next year. It gives an \nadditional year, if necessary, if the Treasury determines that it is in \nthe best interest of the taxpayers to do that. But we should put an end \ndate out there so we don't continue with this indefinite, long-term \npermanent ownership of the American economy by the Federal Government.\n  That, Madam President, is not consistent with the American way of \ndoing things. It is not consistent with free enterprise and free \nmarkets and the freedoms we enjoy in this country and which have served \nas the foundation and made this American economy the strongest in the \nworld. We need to get the Federal Government out of that type of \nownership so it is not controlling the day-to-day decisions made by \nthese businesses and creating all the inherent conflicts of interest \nthat come with government ownership of a private economy.\n  So I hope we will move away from that ownership and that we will not \nuse that as the precursor to a takeover of one-sixth of the American \neconomy by having the government take over the American health care \nsystem. We all know we have issues with our health care system in this \ncountry--that we need to get costs under control, that we need to \nreform our system and make it more affordable to more people in this \ncountry. But the one thing we don't need is to have the government take \nover the American health care system--one-sixth of our entire economy. \nThe cost for that, Madam President, we know, will be at least--at a \nminimum--$1 trillion. Some of the estimates go up to $2.5 trillion as \nthe cost to have the government take over the American health care \nsystem.\n  These are the big debates that are before the Senate, Madam \nPresident, whether it is the cap-and-trade energy tax, whether it is \nthe government takeover of our health care system, whether it is \ngovernment ownership of auto manufacturers and insurance companies and \nbanks, these are things I think make most Americans very uncomfortable. \nI believe it is the role of the Senate to put the brakes on things and \nmake sure we are looking long and hard at what we are doing.\n  Frankly, my view is this is the wrong direction, the wrong path to \npursue for this country. But at a minimum, we need to make sure as this \nlegislation moves through here it is not hastily done, that it is not \nhurried, that it isn't rushed or jammed through here because somebody \nhas a political agenda they want to get accomplished, and they want to \ndo it without allowing the American people to hear about it or have the \nopportunity to read the fine print.\n  I think when the American people start reading the fine print, as \nthey have with the cap-and-trade legislation, they will act in a very \nvigorous way and resist the notion of having the government take over \none-sixth of the American economy by taking over the American health \ncare system.\n  So, yes, we can do things better. We can all improve upon the health \ncare system we have today in terms of affordability. But the one thing \nI don't think the American people want to see is the Federal Government \nimposing itself in the middle of decisions that ought to be made by \ndoctors and patients, by physicians and hospitals and consumers of \nhealth care--not by the Federal Government or that which is being \ntalked about in the Congress and in the Senate.\n  I hope we will be able to put the brakes on, to slow this process \ndown so the American people can engage in this debate in a way that \nwill allow their voices to be heard and make sure that politicians in \nWashington aren't going down a pathway that could lead toward rationed \ncare, that could lead to fewer choices, that could lead to bigger bills \nfor the American taxpayers, and that could lead to more borrowing for \nfuture generations and depriving them and robbing them of a better and \nbrighter future because we have handed them a crushing burden of debt.\n  When you look at trillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see \nand the notion of the government taking over health care and the notion \nof a new energy tax that will drive up the costs of energy for every \nAmerican, I think these are policies that put the future of the \nAmerican people in great peril. They need to be engaged in it, and we \nneed to make sure we are not rushing these things through the Senate.\n  I am going to do everything I can to make sure there is a full and \nfair debate and that we don't go down the path that allows the \ngovernment to take over one-sixth of the American economy and allows \nthe government to make decisions that ought to rightfully be made by \ndoctors and patients\n\n[[Page S7288]]\n\nand we don't allow a new national energy tax to be imposed on the \nAmerican people. These things are all going to cost average Americans \nand families enormous amounts of money at a time when they are trying \nto keep their jobs and trying to make ends meet and trying to balance \ntheir own budgets at home.\n  The American government--their government--ought to be doing what it \ncan to balance its own budget and not spending like drunken sailors and \nborrowing from future generations in a way that will put the future of \nmany Americans--many American families--at risk.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 2892, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2892) making appropriations for the Department \n     of Homeland Security for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2010 and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Byrd/Inouye) amendment No. 1373, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n       Vitter modified amendment No. 1375 (to amendment No. 1373) \n     to prohibit amounts made available under this Act from being \n     used to amend the final rule to hold employers accountable if \n     they hire illegal aliens.\n       Grassley amendment No. 1415 (to amendment No. 1373), to \n     authorize employers to voluntarily verify the immigration \n     status of existing employees.\n       Kyl/McCain amendment No. 1432 (to amendment No. 1373), to \n     strike the earmark for the City of Whitefish Emergency \n     Operations Center.\n       Hatch amendment No. 1428 (to amendment No. 1373), to amend \n     the Immigration and Nationality Act to extend the religious \n     workers and Conrad-30 visa programs, to protect orphans and \n     widows with pending or approved visa petitions.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent the vote in relation to the Kyl \namendment No. 1432 occur at 11:30 a.m., with the provisions of the \nprevious order governing consideration of this amendment remaining in \neffect.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1375, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the Vitter \namendment No. 1375 now be the pending business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to voice my reservations with \nVitter amendment No. 1375.\n  The Vitter amendment would prohibit any funds in the Homeland \nSecurity Appropriations bill from being used to change the Bush \nadministration's ``no-match'' letter regulation. This controversial \nregulation deals with the obligations of employers who receive what are \nknown as no-match letters from the Social Security Administration.\n  The Social Security Administration sends no-match letters to \nemployers when a Social Security number or other information provided \nby an employee does not match the agency's records. This is part of the \nSocial Security Administration's efforts to improve the accuracy of \ntheir records, but the Bush administration wanted to use no-match \nletters to get the Social Security Administration involved with \nenforcing our immigration laws. The theory was that an employee whose \ninformation doesn't match the Social Security Administration's database \nis probably an illegal immigrant. However, the reality is that the vast \nmajority of people whose data does not match the Social Security \nAdministration's information are U.S. citizens who changed their name \nwhen they married or whose information is wrong due to typographical or \nother clerical errors.\n  The Bush administration's no-match rule would make employers liable \nif they fail to take action on a no-match notice, even though no-\nmatches are often caused by database errors. A small business owner \nthat receives a no-match letter would be faced with the choice of \nfiring the employee or following costly and burdensome requirements for \nresolving the no-match. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce estimates that the \ncost of the no-match rule would be at least $1 billion annually. This \nis not a price we can afford, especially given the current condition of \nthe American economy.\n  The no-match rule would also have a dramatic and harmful impact on \nmillions of hard-working U.S. citizens who have done nothing wrong. \nExperts estimate that as many as 3.9 million authorized workers will be \nthe subject of a no-match letter. And the U.S. Chamber of Commerce \nestimates that as many as 165,000 legal workers will be wrongfully \nfired if the no-match rule goes forward.\n  In addition to all these problems, the no-match rule would not \nactually improve the enforcement of our immigration laws. The Social \nSecurity Administration has repeatedly said that a no-match letter \nmakes no statement about a worker's immigration status. And the Social \nSecurity Administration's databases do not have complete or accurate \ninformation about workers' immigration status. In fact, according to \nthe Social Security Administration's inspector general, at least 3.3 \nmillion records in the administration's database have incorrect \ncitizenship information.\n  The no-match regulation is opposed by a broad coalition of business, \nlabor, civil rights, and religious groups, from the Chamber of Commerce \nto the AFL-CIO.\n  The no-match rule would turn the Social Security Administration into \nan immigration enforcement agency. This would detract from its primary \nmission of administering retirement benefits for tens of millions of \nAmericans.\n  The no-match rule was blocked by a court order shortly after it was \nissued and two years later the rule still hasn't taken effect. The \ncourt found that the rule would ``result in irreparable harm to \ninnocent workers and employers.''\n  Yesterday, DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano announced that she plans to \nrescind the no-match rule. She believes that using the Social Security \nAdministration to enforce our immigration laws is ineffective and will \nharm millions of innocent small business owners and employees.\n  Instead, Secretary Napolitano plans to use electronic verification so \nthat employers can determine whether their employees are legally \nauthorized to work. There is work to be done to improve the current \nelectronic verification system but this is a much more efficient \napproach than dragging the Social Security Administration into \nimmigration enforcement.\n  At the same time, Secretary Napolitano is taking a different approach \nfrom the previous administration when it comes to worksite enforcement. \nSecretary Napolitano has launched a new effort to crack down on \nemployers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\n  This is the right approach and I commend Secretary Napolitano for \nseeking to rescind the no-match rule and refocus DHS on unscrupulous \nemployers who knowingly hire illegal immigrants.\n  The Vitter amendment would prevent DHS from going forward with its \nplan to rescind the no-match rule. Congress should not micromanage \nDHS's efforts to enforce our immigration laws.\n  For these reasons, I have serious reservations about the Vitter \namendment and I will urge the conferees not to include it in the \nconference report.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I understand this amendment is \nacceptable to both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there is no further debate, the \nquestion is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1375), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to reconsider the vote and move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n\n[[Page S7289]]\n\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1378 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I call up amendment No. 1378 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1378 to amendment No. 1373 .\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To strike the appropriation for the Advanced Training Center)\n\n       On page 9, lines 15 and 16, strike ``, of which $39,700,000 \n     shall be for the Advanced Training Center''.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 1432\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I believe there is now 5 minutes per side \nto debate the amendment I have offered, which is cosponsored by Senator \nMcCain. I would appreciate it if the Chair will advise me when I have \nconsumed 2 minutes. Senator McCain will talk for about 2 minutes, and I \nwish to reserve the last minute following Senator Tester.\n  The amendment is very simple. It strikes $900,000 for an earmark for \nthe city of Whitefish Emergency Operations Center in Montana. The \nadministration terminated funding for these types of projects in its \n2010 budget submission. This operations center has not been subject to \na congressional hearing nor has it been authorized by Congress. It is a \npure earmark. Not only did the administration not request funding for \nthe project, it specifically zeroed out funding.\n  Senator Feingold had an amendment that would have subsumed this \nproject along with several others. That amendment failed. But he noted \nin regard to his amendment that while we may not all agree on the \nappropriateness of earmarks in general, I certainly hope we can agree \ncertain things ought not be earmarked, including FEMA grant programs \nsuch as those protecting Americans from terrorist attacks. I quote \nSenator Feingold, because this is precisely the view of the 9/11 \nCommission. From page 396 of that report it included this \nrecommendation:\n\n       Homeland security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities . . . Congress should \n     not use this money as a pork barrel.\n\n  The report goes on to state:\n\n       In a free-for-all over money, it is understandable that \n     representatives will work to protect the interests of their \n     home states or districts, but this issue is too important for \n     politics as usual to prevail. Resources must be allocated \n     according to vulnerabilities.\n\n  That is why in its budget submission the administration said this:\n\n       The administration is proposing to eliminate the Emergency \n     Operations Center Grant Program in the 2010 budget because \n     the program's award allocations are not based on a risk \n     assessment. Also, other Department of Homeland Security grant \n     programs can provide funding for the same purposes more \n     effectively.\n\n  So you have the 9/11 Commission saying these programs should be \neliminated; you have the administration saying, in its budget \nsubmission, they should be eliminated from the budget submission, that \nthey should not be subject to earmarks. That is why our amendment is \nbeing offered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed his 2 \nminutes.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nArizona for this amendment.\n  Look, it is all about the fact that there has been no analysis, no \nassessment, no debate on the merits of using Federal funds for a \nmunicipal improvement project. I am sure Whitefish needs municipal \nimprovement. So do cities and towns all over America. Why was Whitefish \npicked?\n  By the way, it might be of interest to taxpayers, Whitefish, \naccording to my information, has a population of 5,849 people. This \nearmark equals $153.87 per inhabitant.\n  Cities all across America are operating out of inadequate facilities, \nincluding those in my own State. All we have asked for is to have these \nprioritized according to competition, assessment, and recommendations \nby agencies of government rather than inserted in the bill as an \nearmark and without any of that.\n  From the previous votes, we will probably lose on this one, but I \nwant to tell my friend from Montana, sooner or later the American \npeople are going to reject this kind of pork-barrel earmarking, $153.87 \nfor every resident in Whitefish, which may be warranted--it may be \nwarranted--but there is no assessment, there is no study, there is no \nrationale besides the fact that this was inserted in this bill without \nany scrutiny or authorization.\n  We should reject this kind of practice. This is an egregious example \nof it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask you inform me when I have 3 \nminutes left.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I thank the two Senators from Arizona \nfor the debate we have been having on this expenditure. This is not an \negregious expenditure. The senior Senator from Arizona talked about \n5,849 people living in Whitefish. In the 2000 census figures it is up \nto 8,500 now, but that is not the issue. The issue is Whitefish is \nhere. This is it up here. We have a Canadian border 60 miles north. We \nhave a park to the east of it. We have millions--millions of acres of \nForest Service land all around it, north, south and to the west.\n  When we have emergencies, it is not necessarily just terrorism. They \nwill tell you on the northern border, terrorism is the biggest threat. \nOn the southern border, next to Arizona, it is illegal immigration. Not \nonly do we have for this emergency operations center the potential--and \nlet's hope it never happens--of terrorist threats coming down, whether \nit is in the park or north, along in Forest Service lands, we also have \na very real threat again of forest fires occurring. They have happened \nwith regularity.\n  The current building is one-third of the size needed. It is 100 years \nold. It is in a seismic zone. The truth of the matter is, we have \nBorder Patrol, Forest Service, DEA--all rely on local law enforcement \nto assist them. We have radio interoperability between Federal, State, \nand county government that this will address. The truth is, this is for \nthe region.\n  This money also leverages almost 9 to 1 in local grants--$8 million, \nthis $900,000 leverages. So the local community is stepping up and they \nare picking up their fair share.\n  We don't want unfunded mandates put on local governments because we \nhave potential national terrorist problems throughout this region.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TESTER. The truth is that you can come up and look at a title and \nyou can talk about it being egregious, but the truth is, millions of \nacres of forests, a national park, a border 60 miles away--we are \ntalking about emergency services. The local community is supposed to \npick up the entire tab for that? I don't think so and I don't think \nthat is fair. That is why we have a $900,000 expenditure in this bill \nto help local governments meet the needs of this country.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? If neither side \nyields time, time will be charged equally on both sides.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it is appropriate for the sponsor of the \namendment to have the final word. I wish to reserve my final minute to \nhave the last response.\n  Mr. TESTER. Can I ask what the sponsor of the amendment has left for \ntime?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The sponsor has 53 seconds and the \nSenator has 2 minutes 29 seconds.\n  Mr. TESTER. We have two Senators for every State in this country. Our \nforefathers drafted that out. The reason was we don't dictate on \npopulation, we don't dictate on landmass, we dictate on need.\n\n[[Page S7290]]\n\n  The fact is, there are millions of acres of Forest Service grounds; a \nnational park--one of the jewels of this country--to the east; a border \nto the north where there are real threats that we need to make secure \nand work with our neighborhoods to the north to make sure we do not \nhave terrorist activity come across the border.\n  The truth is, the sponsor of this amendment talked about the \nPresident zeroing out this program. Why doesn't the amendment zero out \nthe program? It doesn't. The sponsor cherry-picked one expenditure in \nthe bill and said this isn't the way we should be spending money. I \nappreciate that. We are having a debate here on that. But this is much \nneeded for the security of this country and for the security of the \nregion.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Will the Senator from Montana yield?\n  Mr. TESTER. Yes, I would.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. My understanding is over the last decade there have been \n28 Presidential disasters which occurred in that region.\n  Mr. TESTER. I believe that is correct.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. So 28 times in the last 10 years there has been a major \ndisaster that has been responded to, whether it is a fire in the park, \non the Federal land, or a border issue or whatever, so this is not just \nabout Whitefish, am I correct?\n  Mr. TESTER. It is not about Whitefish at all.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. It is about the entire region and the ability for all \nthe different agencies to respond, is that correct?\n  Mr. TESTER. That is correct.\n  Mr. MURRAY. That clarifies the importance for this emergency center. \nI thank the Senator.\n  Mr. TESTER. The Senator is spot on right. That is exactly right. It \nis not about Whitefish at all, it is about the region, it is about the \nlocation, and it is critically important we get this money for this \nproject. I appreciate the sponsor bringing the amendment up but, \ntruthfully, this is not pork. This is something that will help the \ncountry being secure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I certainly accept the argument of my \nfriend from Montana that this could be put to good purpose in \nWhitefish, MT. It could be put to good use in Yuma or Nogales or \nanywhere else in the country. That is why the 9/11 Commission said, and \nI quote again:\n\n       Homeland Security assistance should be based strictly on an \n     assessment of risks and vulnerabilities . . . The Congress \n     should not use this money as a pork barrel.\n\n  All we ask is, as the administration did, that the money be allocated \nbased on the risk assessment from the Department of Homeland Security, \nnot on the ability of a particular Congressman or Senator to get the \nmoney earmarked in a bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that page 396 of the 9/11 Commission report \nbe printed in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks, and again \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment, as at least one small \nstep we can take to demonstrate that we agree with the 9/11 Commission \nand we agree with the administration that these grants should be based \non risk, rather than earmarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   The 9/11 Commission Report, p. 396\n\n       Recommendation: Now, in 2004, Washington, D.C., and New \n     York City are certainly at the top of any such list. We \n     understand the contention that every state and city needs to \n     have some minimum infrastructure for emergency response. But \n     federal homeland security assistance should not remain a \n     program for general revenue sharing. It should supplement \n     state and local resources based on the risks or \n     vulnerabilities that merit additional support.\n       The second question is, Can useful criteria to measure risk \n     and vulnerability be developed that assess all the many \n     variables? That assessment should consider such factors as \n     population, population density, vulnerability, and the \n     presence of critical infrastructure within each state. In \n     addition, the federal government should require each state \n     receiving federal emergency preparedness funds to provide an \n     analysis based on the same criteria to justify the \n     distribution of funds in that state.\n       We recommend that a panel of security experts be convened \n     to develop written benchmarks for evaluating community needs. \n     We further recommend that federal homeland security funds be \n     allocated in accordance with those benchmarks, and that \n     states be required to abide by those benchmarks in disbursing \n     the federal funds. The benchmarks will be imperfect and \n     subjective; they will continually evolve. But hard choices \n     must be made. Those who would allocate money on a different \n     basis should then defend their view of the national interest.\n\n\n                  Command, Control, and Communications\n\n       The attacks on 9/11 demonstrated that even the most robust \n     emergency response capabilities can be overwhelmed if an \n     attack is large enough. Teamwork, collaboration, and \n     cooperation at an incident site are critical to a successful \n     response. Key decisionmakers who are represented at the \n     incident command level help to ensure an effective response, \n     the efficient use of resources, and responder safety. Regular \n     joint training at all levels is, moreover, essential to \n     ensuring close coordination during an actual incident.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I believe we need to ask for the yeas and nays, and I do at \nthis time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Has all the time been used on this amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, Senator McCain has an amendment that he \nwill speak to in a moment. I wish to let all Senators know I appreciate \ntheir cooperation. We are working through a number of amendments on \nboth sides that I am hoping we can get through this afternoon. Senator \nMcCain will speak to his amendment now, and we are hoping to have a \nvote around 2 to settle that and several others. If Members have an \namendment they are working on and have some last-minute language to \nwork on, please get it done because we would like to finish this bill \ntoday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1378\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask for the immediate consideration of \namendment No. 1378.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending.\n\n[[Page S7291]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, this amendment strikes an earmark of $39.7 million \nfor an advanced training center in West Virginia, a training facility \nfor U.S. Customs and border protection agents. The center features a \nrange of training environments, facilities, et cetera. The \nadministration requested and the committee approved $30.3 million to \noperate and equip the facility. While I have a problem with that, I do \nnot intend for the amendment to affect the $30 million the \nadministration requested to operate and equip the facility. This \namendment is not about that.\n  The committee earmarked an additional $39.7 million to equip, \nfurnish, and expand the Leadership Academy at the Center.\n  Let me be clear what the amendment does and does not do. It does not \nstrike the requested funding for the training facility. It does strike \nan unrequested, unauthorized, unnecessary earmark of nearly $40 million \nthat was added to this bill at the direction of a senior Member of this \nbody. I wish to make that perfectly clear. I am sure there will be \nopponents of this amendment but have no doubt: It does not affect the \n$30 million the administration requested. This is an additional $39.7 \nmillion to equip, furnish, and expand the Leadership Academy.\n  It might be of interest to our colleagues that today, at 9:23 a.m., \nthe CBO is reporting that the year-to-date budget deficit tops a \ntrillion dollars. We are considering a provision that adds an \nadditional $39.7 million in light of the Congressional Budget Office \nmonthly budget review. Its key points are, the Federal budget deficit \nis $1.1 trillion for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2009. Here we \nare with a bill loaded down with earmarks worth tens of millions of \ndollars on the very day that the deficit tops $1 trillion; in fact, it \nis $1.1 trillion. That is more than $800 billion greater than the \ndeficit recorded through June 2008. Outlays are 21 percent or $457 \nbillion higher than they were in the 9 months of 2008. Revenues have \nfallen by 18 percent, by some $346 billion. Outlays for unemployment \nbenefits so far this year are more than 2.5 times what they were at \nthis point last year. About half this increase is driven by a higher \nunemployment rate and half is driven by legislation expanding \nunemployment.\n  The estimated deficit reflects outlays of $147 billion for the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, recorded on a net present \nvalue basis, and spending of $83 billion in support of Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. Interest payments have declined 25.5 percent as a result \nof lower short-term interest rates.\n  So here we are looking at business as usual on the earmarks and \nappropriations bills. Meanwhile, the year-to-date budget deficit tops \n$1 trillion. Maybe it is approaching $2 trillion by the end of the \nyear--an incredible burden to lay on future generations of Americans.\n  I am sure--I am sure--this amendment will probably lose. I am sure \nproponents of the Advanced Training Center's Leadership Academy in West \nVirginia will stoutly defend it, and its essential functions will be \ngraphically described by the opponents of this amendment.\n  It is time we stopped. Isn't a $1.1 trillion deficit for the first 9 \nmonths of this year enough of a signal that maybe we ought to tighten \nour belts, that maybe we ought to stop adding $39.7 million to an \nalready requested $30 million to operate and equip an advanced training \ncenter--a training facility that is located in the State of West \nVirginia? I understand that. Our thoughts and prayers go out for the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia. We hope he regains his health soon. \nWe hope he continues in his very effective membership and service in \nthis body.\n  But the fact is, the committee--the committee--earmarked an \nadditional $39.7 million to equip, furnish, and expand the Leadership \nAcademy at the Center. Can't we delay expanding, equipping, and \nfurnishing a leadership academy? Can't we do that? Probably not. \nProbably not. Probably not.\n  But as long as Americans are bearing this incredible burden--a \nburgeoning deficit we are laying on our children and our \ngrandchildren--I and some others will be coming to this floor to try to \npoint out it is time we got rid of things that are maybe even necessary \nbut not vital to our Nation's future.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I do not think there is a Senator in \nthis body who has talked more about deficits or our national debt than \nthe senior Senator from Ohio.\n  Senator Lieberman and I have a bill in to create a commission to deal \nwith tax reform and entitlements. I have had a bill in called the SAFE \nCommission for the last 4 years: Saving America's Future Economy. There \nis no one more aware of where we are. We will have a deficit this year, \nI believe, of over $2 trillion when you take into consideration the \namount of money we are borrowing from our governmental trust funds.\n  That being said, I respectfully oppose the amendment offered by my \ngood friend, the Senator from Arizona. This amendment seeks to strike \nthe requirement in the bill for $39.7 million for the Advanced Training \nCenter.\n  This Advanced Training Center is designed to serve the specialized \nneeds of U.S. Customs and Border Protection. It officially opened in \nAugust of 2005. There may be some people who object to the fact that it \nis in West Virginia, but the fact is it is in West Virginia.\n  This year alone, the Center will provide advanced training to over \n3,200 U.S. Customs and Border Protection employees.\n  We have already mentioned we have increased the number of these \nemployees substantially to do what most people want us to do; that is, \nto protect the border and to go after those individuals who are illegal \nimmigrants. There is no question about that. But I also know from my \nwork on the Governmental Affairs Committee and my Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management, in the Federal workforce, the \npeople we hire have to be trained. You just cannot bring them on. You \nhave to train them.\n  So this is a critical training facility for frontline employees. In \nfact, the Department of Homeland Security and the Office of Management \nand Budget have endorsed the expansion of this facility as well when \nthey approved and sent forward to Congress their 5-year master facility \nplan.\n  This is not a boondoggle. This is not a waste of money. This is \nsomething to support a facility that is there and needs to be expanded \nbecause we have decided we want to hire a lot more employees. When you \nhire employees, you have to provide them the training. And that is \nexactly what this is doing.\n  Again, I wish to emphasize, if we are going to secure the border, it \nis going to cost a lot of money, including training the people we are \ngoing to hire.\n  So we should oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Ohio for his \nstatement in opposition to the McCain amendment.\n  I rise as well to speak on behalf of Senator Byrd who, as we all \nknow, is home recovering from a serious illness. The committee bill \ndoes include $39.7 million for the continued expansion of the U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection, CBP, Advanced Training Center. The ATC, \nwhich opened back in 2005, provides advanced firearms and tactical \ntraining to CBP law enforcement personnel and personnel of other \nFederal agencies.\n  The center is expanding in phases. It is consistent with this master \nplan I hold in my hand. This plan actually was transmitted to Congress \nback in 2007 and was approved then by the Office of Management and \nBudget and the Department of Homeland Security.\n  This master plan accommodates advanced training consistent with the \nmission of securing our borders. CBP employees are stationed throughout \nthe Nation at land and border crossings, at airports, at seaports, and \nother urban environments with a need for practical, unique, \nprogressive, and flexible training.\n  There is no other training of this kind, I want my colleagues to \nknow, and there has never been a time that it has been needed more.\n\n[[Page S7292]]\n\n  Senator Byrd strongly--he wants us to know--supports the Advanced \nTraining Center and its mission and is going to continue to fight hard \nfor the security of this great country. Customs and Border Protection \nneeds and deserves the advanced training facility to assure that the \nmore than 50,000 Customs and Border Protection agents, officers, and \nother personnel have the training they require when they are sent in \nharm's way.\n  This facility is expected to train over 3,200 law enforcement and \nother employees in fiscal year 2009, and that is expected to grow to \nmore than 5,000 each year.\n  I urge our colleagues to vote against that plan.\n  I, again, would like everyone to know we are hoping Senator \nRockefeller will be back shortly. He will speak on this amendment. We \nare hoping to set up this amendment for a vote around 2 o'clock.\n  Madam President, with that, I rise to offer the Dodd-Lieberman \namendment No. 1458, which I understand is at the desk.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I reserve the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator object?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1428, as Modified\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask for the regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is asking for the regular order \nwith respect to the Senator's pending amendment?\n  Mr. HATCH. With respect to a modification to amendment No. 1428. I \nsend the modification to the desk and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has the right to modify his \namendment. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1428), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 77, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 556.

Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise, I think, at a very appropriate \ntime, while we are talking about the budget and deficits and numbers, \nto say that rarely has a crystal ball proved so regrettably accurate.\n  Many warned, as did I, that the stimulus would amount to a mountain \nof wasted money. It produced record deficits, and thus far it has \nproduced little beyond that.\n  But I am not here to ask the Senate to take my word for this. You can \nread it in black and white in two reports that were released yesterday: \na CBO report and a GAO report.\n  According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Federal \nbudget deficit for the first 9 months, as Senator McCain mentioned, was \na whopping $1.1 trillion. This is the first time in our Nation's \nhistory that the annual deficit has been this high.\n  If that ``Guinness Book'' record-sized debt was not astonishing \nenough, we would all be floored that this debt is from only the first \nthree-quarters of the year. It is mystifying to me, horrifying to the \nAmerican taxpayers and their children who eventually will have to pay \nthe bill. It represents a dangerous reality for our future. Only 4 \npercent of the first stimulus funding has been spent, yet we are \nshattering national deficit records already.\n\n  This was easily predicted. Look back a few short months to February \nwhen we were debating the stimulus, a bill we were told we had to do \nright away.\n\n[[Page S7293]]\n\nOn February 4, 2009, I delivered my first speech as a Senator. I made \nsome simple predictions based upon my experience as a city council \nmember, a mayor, and as a Governor. Serving in those rolls, I learned a \nfew things about how money is spent at the local level, especially the \nhidden costs of money from the Federal Government that seemingly comes \nwith no strings attached. In that speech I warned what would happen \nwith the so-called stimulus legislation. I predicted that State \ngovernments would use the funds to replace State dollars and shore up \ntheir budget problems. Well, sure enough, the Government Accountability \nOffice, known as the GAO, reported this:\n\n       States reported using Recovery Act funds to stabilize State \n     budgets and to cope with fiscal distress.\n\n  The report states that 90 percent of the money distributed has come \nin the form of increased Federal education and health care grants to \nState governments. This money has helped many State governments to \npartially offset what they are facing, which is budget shortfalls.\n  I also warned that the result of replacing State funds with Federal \nfunds would lead to an enormous funding cliff for State budgets when \nthat temporary stimulus money ran out. The GAO report sends up a \nwarning flare, because States have not addressed the situation they \nwill be in when the stimulus funding runs out or how they will come up \nwith the funding to cushion the fall.\n  I wish I had been wrong in February--in fact, I think I said that at \nthe time. I wish I had been wrong when I said that the transportation \nsector jobs estimated to be created by the major infrastructure \nprojects wouldn't materialize because the funding would instead go to \nrepaving. I urged my colleagues to reconsider because repaving projects \nwould not lead to long-term economic growth or good jobs. So what is \nthe consensus since the stimulus bill went into law? The GAO report \nstates that nearly 50 percent of all transportation projects are for \nresurfacing and another 18 percent of the funds are being used to widen \nalready existing roads. That adds up to nearly 70 percent on temporary \nroad improvement projects.\n  Even though President Obama said there is nothing he would have done \ndifferently, I find that hard to believe considering his earlier \nremarks that predicted a much different result. In a speech on February \n10, soon after becoming President, he said:\n\n       We can use a crisis and turn it into an opportunity. \n     Because if we use this moment to address some things that we \n     probably should have been doing over the last 10, 15, 20 \n     years, then when we emerge from the crisis, the economy is \n     going to be that much stronger.\n\n  I doubt he had repaving projects in mind.\n  As evidenced by the GAO report, the stimulus bill is not laying down \nthe essential groundwork for sustained economic growth, long-term \ninitiatives, or jobs. In fact, unemployment reached 9.5 percent, the \nhighest rate in 26 years. This means that since the stimulus was signed \ninto law, 2,964 jobs have been lost every hour of every workday. \nClearly, the stimulus bill was sold to the American people as a quick \nfix to solve our economic woes, but it is failing.\n  The Obama administration and his supporters in Congress want to \nquickly tack on to the $1 trillion stimulus a litany of big spending \ninitiatives: health care reform, cap and tax, an overhaul of the \nfinancial system. The recklessness of proposed spending, new government \nprograms, and increased deficits is sobering. What does all this \nproposed spending add up to? A huge train wreck with stacks of IOUs all \nthe way to China as far as the eye can see. Yet some have the audacity \nto raise the possibility of a second stimulus. It defies logic.\n  I will conclude by saying that the last thing the Federal Government \nshould do, directly or indirectly, is stifle American businesses and \nhard-working families just as they are trying their best to crawl out \nfrom the economic yoke of debt, taxes, and a stagnant economy. Before \nwe drive the Federal budget off another cliff--and take State budgets \ndown with us--we need to put our foot on the brakes, slow down, and \ncorrect our course.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as \nin morning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I am here to talk about Judge \nSotomayor. I am looking forward to her confirmation hearing, which \nbegins next Monday. I continue to review her record, and I will not \nmake my ultimate judgment until after the hearing. But I must say I am \nvery impressed with Judge Sotomayor's qualifications, including her \nrestrained and fact-based approach to deciding cases. I'm also \nimpressed, as a former prosecutor myself, by her experience as a \npracticing attorney and as a line prosecutor. I think we are all \nimpressed by her educational achievements.\n  Like millions of Americans, I have been inspired by her personal \nstory. Frankly, it gives me goosebumps to think of that little girl \ngrowing up in the projects in the Bronx and growing into the woman we \nsee before us now at the top of the legal profession, with a career of \nexemplary conduct, exemplary academic achievement, exemplary judicial \nexperience behind her. It is really a great story of American \ndiscipline and achievement.\n  Unfortunately, critics of Judge Sotomayor's confirmation have \nunleashed an avalanche of innuendo meant to weaken the case for her \nconfirmation. These criticisms began among the right-wing talking \nheads, but unfortunately, some of them are now voiced by my Republican \ncolleagues here on the floor. Indeed, rather than waiting for the \nhearing to ask her about her record and her judicial philosophy, a \nnumber of my colleagues have come to the floor to attack her and her \nnomination.\n  Today, I would like to briefly address two particular and--frankly, \nvery surprising--attacks on Judge Sotomayor: first, the suggestion that \nher judicial philosophy is somehow outside of the mainstream; and, \nsecond, the suggestion that her life experience is somehow unhelpful to \nthe judgment she would bring to the Supreme Court.\n  First, Judge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy. My Republican \ncolleagues like to suggest that judges appointed by Republican \nPresidents are neutral ``umpires'' and that judges appointed by \nDemocratic Presidents are judicial ``activists.'' But Chief Justice \nRoberts himself, who, indeed, raised the ``umpire'' metaphor at his own \nconfirmation hearing, reveals the falsity of that comparison. Jeffrey \nToobin, a well-respected legal commentator, recently described a \npronounced ideological predisposition in Chief Justice Roberts.\n\n       In every major case since he became the Nation's \n     seventeenth Chief Justice, Roberts has sided with the \n     prosecution over the defendant, the state over the condemned, \n     the executive branch over the legislative, and the corporate \n     defendant over the individual plaintiff.\n\n  Let me say that again:\n\n       In every major case since he became the Nation's \n     seventeenth Chief Justice, Roberts has sided with the \n     prosecution over the defendant, the state over the condemned, \n     the executive branch over the legislative, and the corporate \n     defendant over the individual plaintiff.\n\n  Maybe this is a pure coincidence, and maybe it is a further \ncoincidence, to again quote Toobin, that this record ``has served the \ninterests, and reflected the values, of the contemporary Republican \nParty.'' Maybe it is also a coincidence that in the Heller decision, \nthe DC gun law case, the Roberts-led conservative block of the Court \ndiscovered a new constitutional right that had previously gone \nunnoticed through 220 years of the United States Supreme Court's \nhistory, and which just happens to appeal to the NRA and the Republican \nbase. Perhaps that is all a coincidence. But I will confess to you, I \ndoubt it. I think this record goes a long way towards disproving the \nmetaphor of the Republican judge as neutral umpire.\n  So let's put aside the notion that conservative men from the \nFederalist Society have no predispositions in legal matters but that \nanyone who differs from their views is the activist.\n\n[[Page S7294]]\n\nThat is just rhetoric, and what it's seeking to do is to normalize the \nright-wing activism that the Republican Party has calculatedly and over \nmany years moved onto our Court.\n  If you want to decide whether Judge Sotomayor has an appropriate \njudicial philosophy, look at her full record. Throughout her long \ncareer as a Federal judge, longer than any Supreme Court nominee since \nthe 19th century, Judge Sotomayor, has on every major issue, shown that \nthe facts and the law drive her determination of cases. On the Second \nCircuit, Judge Sotomayor agreed with her more conservative colleagues \nfar more frequently than she disagreed with them. In 434 published \npanel decisions where the panel included at least one judge appointed \nby a Republican President, she agreed with the result favored by the \nRepublican appointee in 413 cases--413 out of 434. That is 95 percent \nof the time, and it is no record of extremism. Indeed, it would seem to \nput her on the conservative side of the mainstream. And consider what \nshe told Chairman Leahy:\n\n       Ultimately and completely, as a judge, you follow the law. \n     There is not one law for one race or another. There is not \n     one law for one color or another. There is not one law for \n     rich and a different one for poor. There is only one law.\n\n  Furthermore, the idea that because the Supreme Court disagreed with \nJudge Sotomayor's Second Circuit panel decision in Ricci v. DeStefano, \nshe is somehow outside the mainstream is patently absurd. First, four \nJustices of the Supreme Court agreed with the Second Circuit's \ninterpretation of the law. Are Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and \nBreyer outside of the mainstream? Hardly.\n  Second, Judge Sotomayor and her panel were faithfully applying the \nsettled precedent of the Second Circuit when they rendered their \ndecision--just what a circuit court judge of the United States is \nsupposed to do. The five Justices on the Supreme Court in the Ricci \nmajority, in deciding the case, invented an entirely new test for \nresolving Title VII claims that, according to legal experts reported in \nthe New York Times, ``will change the landscape of civil rights law.'' \nIt is hardly fair to criticize Judge Sotomayor for not applying a test \nthat did not even exist when she decided the case. Nor for failing to \nventure into landscape changes of civil rights law.\n  In the Ricci decision and others, Judge Sotomayor's record \ndemonstrates a long career of faithfully applying the law to the facts \nof the case before her--and the careful exercise of judicial \ndiscretion.\n  That brings me to my second point. Wise exercise of judicial \ndiscretion is the longstanding tradition underlying the American system \nof law. It is harsh, narrow-minded, and ahistoric to contend that a \nrich life experience and natural empathy are at odds with that judicial \ntradition.\n  Any lawyer knows the importance of judicial discretion, both in our \ncommon law system and to the interpretation of the Constitution. As \nJustice John Paul Stevens has explained:\n\n       the work of federal judges from the days of John Marshall \n     to the present . . . requires the exercise of judgment--a \n     faculty that inevitably calls into play notions of justice, \n     fairness, and concern about the future impact of a decision. \n     . . .\n\n  That faculty has served the Nation well for over two centuries. \nIndeed, discretion is at the heart of the judicial role. Our legal \nsystem bears the imprint of the experience and wisdom of generations of \njudges. As Justice Holmes famously explained, ``[t]he life of the law \nhas not been logic: it has been experience.'' Indeed, as Holmes \ncontinued,\n\n       [t]he law embodies the story of a nation's development \n     through many centuries, and it cannot be dealt with as if it \n     contained only the axioms and corollaries of a book of \n     mathematics.\n\n  This discretion, of course, does not mean that judges are without \nbounds. But there exists a broad and lively discretion that falls far \nshort of ``judicial activism.'' Justice Benjamin Cardozo put it this \nway:\n\n       The judge . . . is not to innovate at pleasure. He is not a \n     knight-errant, roaming at will in pursuit of his own ideal of \n     beauty or of goodness. He is to draw his inspiration from \n     consecrated principles. . . .He is to exercise a \n     discretion informed by tradition, methodized by analogy, \n     disciplined by system, and subordinated to ``the \n     primordial necessity of order in the social life.'' Wide \n     enough in all conscience is the field of discretion that \n     remains.\n\n  Madam President, within this wide field of discretion, judges do not, \ncannot, and should not close their minds to their experience of the \nworld, nor to what their experience teaches them about the effects of \ntheir decisions on the world.\n  There has been plenty of empathy at the Supreme Court recently for \nthe rich and powerful, resulting in decisions that frustrate \ncongressional intent and deprive Americans of crucial statutory and \nconstitutional protections. There has been plenty of empathy for right-\nwing ideology and plenty of empathy for big corporations. Should we not \nalso admit to the Court a nominee who has common sense, who can \nappreciate how American laws affect different citizens, and who can \nalso empathize with the poor and the weak, as well as the more \nfortunate?\n  If reaching correct outcomes were as simple as plugging a few factors \nand elements into a computer, we would not need nine Supreme Court \nJustices. Quite simply, a broadened range of perspectives and \nexperiences will make for better judgment by our Court.\n  One final thing is worth noting about the judicial branch of \ngovernment. It is designed to be a check and balance to the elected \nbranches. The Founders were keenly aware of the corruption and passing \npassions to which those elected branches are vulnerable, and they \nestablished the judiciary as a place where all were equal before the \nlaw, and where power, money, and influence were intended to hold no \nsway. The courtroom can be the only sanctuary for the little guy when \nthe forces of society are arrayed against him, when proper opinion and \nelected officialdom will lend him no ear. This is a correct, a fitting, \nand an intended function of our judiciary, and the empathy President \nObama saw in Judge Sotomayor has a constitutionally proper place in \nthat structure.\n  If everyone on the Court always voted for the prosecution against the \ndefendant, for the corporation against the plaintiff, and for the \ngovernment against the condemned, a vital spark of American democracy \nwould be extinguished. A courtroom is supposed to be a place where the \nstatus quo can be disrupted, where the comfortable can be afflicted, \nand the afflicted find some comfort when no one else will listen. A \njudge of the United States is not an orderly, neutered little \nfunctionary of the power structure. Judge Sotomayor's broad background \nand empathy prepare her better for that proper judicial role than would \ngrooming in corporate boardrooms, scrubbing by the Federalist Society, \nand fealty to party ideology.\n  I am looking forward to Judge Sotomayor's hearing as an opportunity \nfor her to finally reply to her right-wing detractors, to demonstrate \nher intellect and qualifications, and to explain her judicial \nphilosophy. My preliminary review of her record suggests that she \nunderstands the importance of judicial restraint and modesty, of \nadherence to precedent, of respect for the legislative branch, and of \nthe timeless values enshrined in the Constitution. And she has \narticulated a desire to be scrupulously fair by keeping sight of--not \ndenying--the lessons she has learned during her extraordinary life.\n  Judge Sotomayor appears, more than anything else, to be a careful and \nconscientious judge. So let us not throw care and conscience to the \nwind by hurling unjustified, unhelpful, and tired labels at her; let us \nbe proud to have a Justice of the Supreme Court with the type of broad \nlife experience that will inform her good and proper judgment.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            NASA Nominations\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, yesterday the Commerce \nCommittee had its hearing for the NASA\n\n[[Page S7295]]\n\nAdministrator and Deputy Administrator nominees. Charlie Bolden and \nLori Garver respectively are the nominees for these two positions.\n  I have had the privilege of knowing Charlie Bolden for the better \npart of a quarter of a century. In addition to all of the numerous \naccolades that were heaped upon him yesterday by Members of the House \nand Senate, it came to the Commerce Committee to say a word on his \nbehalf. Many talked about his distinguished career as a graduate of \nAnnapolis, a marine test pilot, an astronaut, then back into the \nmarines--after four times flying in space on the space shuttle, twice \nas pilot and twice as commander--and then in his various positions in \nthe active-duty marines, retiring at the rank of major general. Those \naccolades were extensive and they were accurate.\n  I would merely add to those attributes describing him--all of which \nwere very laudatory--the attribute, the characteristic, that Americans \nhave come to honor, and that is that Charlie Bolden is an overcomer.\n  One of the first instances of this characteristic occurred in \nCharlie's native Columbia, SC, in 1964. He could not get an appointment \nto Annapolis from his congressional delegation because they were still \nembroiled with the fact that he was an African American. The \nadministration, at that time--the Johnson administration--had appointed \na retired judge with the specific purpose of going around the country \nand finding qualified minorities so they could go into the academies. \nThis gentleman found Charlie and arranged for a Congressman from \nChicago to appoint him to Annapolis. When Charlie arrived, he was \npromptly elected president of the freshman class.\n  Today, ADM Dennis Blair--now the Director of National Intelligence, \nand interestingly in the same class--alternated all 4 years at \nAnnapolis being president of the class with Charlie Bolden. Therein is \na story in and of itself where Charlie was an overcomer. But let tell \nyou of another part of Charlie's life where he represented an \novercomer.\n  Charlie went back into the Marine Corps after four space shuttle \nflights, and he came back in as a full bird colonel. The Marine Corps \nwasn't keen on promoting marine astronauts to general officer, and so \nthe first time that Charlie was in the zone of consideration, they \npassed him over. Charlie said, instead of retiring, I want to go back \nto Annapolis and I want to give back to the institution that gave me so \nmuch, including an education. He did so as the deputy superintendent, \nwhich is a marine slot. His superiors were so impressed by his attitude \nand his service that the next time he was up for consideration as \ngeneral officer, they promoted him. A second instance in Charlie's \nlife.\n  I will mention one other instance of Charlie's being an overcomer. He \nwas so well prepared and so expert at his task, that of a naval aviator \nand of a pilot astronaut, that 23\\1/2\\ years ago, after having the most \ndelayed space flight in our country's history--that 24th flight of the \nspace shuttle having been scrubbed four times in the course of a \nmonth--on the fifth try, the space shuttle lifted off. Charlie was the \npilot sitting in the right seat. The commander sits in the left seat. \nThe pilot, in NASA jargon, has all of the systems to monitor. As the \nshuttle had just cleared the launch tower on liftoff, on the intercom I \ncould hear Charlie's voice: We have a problem. We have a helium leak.\n  Had that not been a faulty sensor--which ultimately we discovered, \nbut at the time none of us knew that was a faulty sensor--a real helium \nleak would have caused a serious problem to the mission. But Charlie \nwas all over those switches and those systems. He got it under control \nand we went on to have an almost flawless 6-day mission in space, only \nto return to Earth and, 10 days later, Challenger launches and blows \nup.\n  That was another instance of Charlie being an overcomer, being \npresented with an almost insurmountable problem which he overcame.\n  So with this little aspect of the life of GEN Charlie Bolden, is it \nany wonder there were so many people who came in front of the Senate \nCommerce Committee yesterday to say a word on his behalf? And now, as \nwe will consider his nomination first in the Commerce Committee--which \nought to happen very shortly--and then in front of the Senate, I don't \nthink there is any expectation of any opposition. I believe that \nCharlie, as the newly installed NASA Administrator, is going to take on \nthis task where he is going to have to be an overcomer again, because \nNASA is at a crossroads. America's space program is at a crossroads, \nand it needs a vigorous leader. But NASA not only needs an \nadministrator who will lead it, it needs to be led by the President of \nthe United States, who is the only one who can be the leader of \nAmerica's ventures into space. I am hoping the combination of the two \nof them will put us on a path of reliving a lot of the excitement and \nthe magic this country lived several decades ago when we were achieving \nextraordinary achievements. It gave a whole new perspective to the \nhuman race when astronauts outside the bounds of Earth could look back \nat this extraordinary planet suspended in the middle of a void and \nrecognize that is our home--planet Earth.\n\n  When astronaut John Glenn lifted off on the first American successful \norbital flight: ``Godspeed, John Glenn,'' said Scott Carpenter on that \nimmortal day.\n  I think we in the Senate will unite in saying: Godspeed, Charlie \nBolden, in your new assignment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, we \nare hoping to get a vote in the next 15 minutes, about 2 o'clock, so we \ncan continue to move this bill forward.\n  I note that there is a Senator here who wishes to speak in morning \nbusiness. I am happy to accommodate him, but hopefully we will have \nthis agreement and be able to move forward on that very shortly.\n  I wanted to advise all Senators.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     NEW STEM CELL RESEARCH POLICY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to applaud the administration \nfor promptly issuing guidelines implementing President Obama's March \n2009 Executive Order on stem cell research. This week, the \nadministration removed the barriers to responsible scientific research \ninvolving embryonic stem cells that had been imposed by the previous \nadministration in 2001. The new guidelines establish sound policy and \nprocedures under which the Federal Government will fund such research \nand help ensure that the research is ethically responsible, \nscientifically worthy, and conducted in accordance with applicable \nlaws.\n  President Obama's action will have a profound impact on the long-term \nhealth and well-being of millions of Americans. More than 100 million \nAmericans have chronic, debilitating diseases such as Parkinson's, \nAlzheimer's, diabetes, and ALS. In addition, many Americans have \nserious spinal cord injuries. Embryonic stem cell research offers hope \nfor advancements in treatment that will improve the quality of life for \ncountless numbers of Americans.\n  For the past 8 years, American scientists have received limited \nFederal funding for stem cell research. In 2001, soon after taking \noffice, President Bush issued his stem cell policy. It permitted the \nuse of Federal funds to support research only on the stem cell lines \nthat were in existence as of the date of his Executive order, August 9, \n2001.\n  The Bush compromise seemed reasonable to many in the scientific \ncommunity at the time, as researchers at NIH believed between 60 and 78 \nstem cell lines would be available for use. In fact, only 22 lines were \navailable and some of these were found to have been contaminated. In \naddition, the 22 available lines were developed using science that has \nsince seen significant improvements. Scientists have testified that \nthese lines lack the genetic diversity necessary to perform research \nfor\n\n[[Page S7296]]\n\nseveral diseases that disproportionately affect minority populations. \nIn short, there were real deficiencies in the former administration's \npolicy. It reduced the opportunities available to our scientists, \nundermined progress, and it discouraged scientific exploration.\n  Perhaps the best case for stem cell research comes from the patients \nin the communities we represent here in Congress. I have learned first \nhand of the importance of moving forward on groundbreaking scientific \nresearch through my friendships with three individuals.\n  A few years ago, my closest friend in law school, Larry Katz, was \ndiagnosed with ALS. Once an active attorney in Baltimore, Larry's body \nexperienced a rapid decline from the symptoms of this debilitating \ndisease, and he died soon after his diagnosis.\n  Later, I was privileged to meet a young man named Josh Basile, who \nserved as an intern in my House office. Three years before he came to \nCapitol Hill, he was a healthy young man, leading an active life. But \nwhile wading in the Atlantic Ocean, a wave caught him, and he became a \nquadriplegic overnight. Josh is determined to walk again, and he is \nmaking substantial progress. He is also dedicated to helping others \nmake similar strides, and he has established a foundation called \n``Determined-2-Heal.'' Through hard work and rehabilitation, Josh has \nregained movement that many doctors thought was impossible. Josh is \nalso asking the Federal Government to do its part, by funding research \nand allowing scientists access to the tools they need to make medical \nadvances possible.\n  Later, in 2006, I came to know Michael J. Fox, a brilliant and \ntalented actor with a remarkable spirit. In 1991, Michael was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson's disease. He has used his prominence as a tireless \nadvocate for stem cell research.\n  The time I have spent with these three people has taught me much \nabout the burden of debilitating diseases. Those of us who have loved \nones experiencing these and similar circumstances share a \nresponsibility to do everything we can to promote medical research. Our \nscientists need the tools to discover cures and treatments, and stem \ncell research holds hope for dramatic progress.\n  There is an added benefit for our Nation beyond improving the health \nand lives of patients. We are also talking about maintaining the \ninternational preeminence of the United States in the field of medical \nresearch. My State of Maryland is home to some of the world's leading \nresearch institutions, including Johns Hopkins University and the \nUniversity of Maryland Medical Centers. These institutions have \ncutting-edge research technology and freeing up these important stem \ncell lines would jumpstart the numerous promising research tracks in \nthis area.\n  I meet regularly with scientists like Dr. John Gearhart and Dr. \nDouglas Kerr to try to get a better understanding about this issue. I \nam not a scientist nor do I know all the technicalities, but I have had \na chance to meet with these scientists to see what they are doing. They \nhave been able to implant embryonic stem cell growth in mice and see \nmovement where there had been paralysis. This research is extremely \npromising and is happening right now in my State.\n  The new National Institutes of Health funding guidelines for human \nembryonic stem cell research are the next important step to expand this \nresearch even further. It will result in the availability of \napproximately 700 lines for research, a dramatic increase over the \nnumber of currently available lines.\n  The new guidelines are based on solid principles. First, that Federal \nfunding for responsible research with human embryonic stem cells has \nthe potential to improve our understanding of human health and illness \nand discover new ways to prevent and treat illness. Second, individuals \ndonating embryos for research purposes must do so freely, with \nvoluntary and informed consent. They must be derived from embryos that \nwere created for in vitro fertilization and not for research purposes, \nand they must be excess embryos. To be eligible for NIH funding the \nembryonic stem cells cannot be obtained through monetary payments or \nother inducements.\n  Additionally, human embryonic stem cells eligible for testing must \nhave originated from facilities with proper documentation that the \nembryos were obtained in a voluntary and legitimate manner. Finally, \nthe guidelines prohibit Federal funding of research that would \nintroduce human embryonic stem cells into breeding animals or into \nnonhuman primate blastocysts. These guidelines are responsible, have \nstringent safeguards, and they are ethically sound.\n  As the new NIH guidelines are implemented, America's knowledge of the \npotential of stem cell research will continue to broaden. President \nObama's courageous actions will accelerate this process. The guidelines \nsend a clear message to scientists across the United States that their \nimportant work is now backed by the confidence and resources of the \nFederal Government.\n  I commend the administration for this decisive action which will \nstrengthen America's position as the global leader in medical research \nand for the tremendous hope and promise that its new policy is bringing \nto millions of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                          Admendment No. 1378\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m., the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to the McCain amendment No. 1378, with the \ntime between now and then equally divided and controlled in the usual \nform, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior to a vote in \nrelation thereto.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise in clear, strong opposition to \nthis amendment. Let me just say that the fact that this is located in \nWest Virginia is not part of my consideration. I am thinking about \nnational security, Border Patrol. I served as chairman of the \nIntelligence Committee. I know something about these things. What the \nSenator from Arizona wants to do doesn't make any sense at all.\n  What we are talking about is a one-of-a-kind. It is the only one in \nthe country that trains senior officers as well as others in border \nprotection, customs, and other things regarding homeland security. \nThere is no other place in the country that does this. There are 3,300 \nstudents there now. They are planning on 5,000 next year. There is no \nother place where this can be done. If we cut this, there is no \nsubstitute. We talk about border control. We talk about all those \nthings. Particularly senior officers side, this is where people are \ntrained. There is a huge master plan which I will not hold up. It has \nbeen approved by the Office of Management and Budget, by the homeland \nsecurity folks, and was submitted to Congress in 2007. The facility is \nused to train officers on waterborne tactics and operating ports of \nentry, things which are obscure but essential to national security. It \nincludes a firing range which is not only used by CPB officers but \nlocal law enforcement, DEA, Fish and Wildlife personnel, as well as the \nCapitol Police. It is the only facility of its kind in the Nation. \nThese are crucial jobs. There is no place to take its place. If we cut \nit, there is no way to make it up and carry out our responsibilities \nfor homeland security.\n  It is a very grievously formulated amendment. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from West Virginia for his remarks. I \nwould remind him that this amendment strikes $39.7 million which has \nbeen added to the $30 million that is already there for the center. The \n$39.7 million is described to equip, furnish, and expand a leadership \nacademy at the center. So all the missions the Senator just described \ndon't have anything to do with the additional $39.7 million. It does \nstrike an unrequested, unauthorized, unnecessary earmark. The \nadministration didn't ask for the additional $39.7 million, nearly $40 \nmillion. No Member of Congress, regardless of position or seniority, \nshould be able to spend $40 million on a pet project with no scrutiny, \nno hearing, and no competitive bidding process.\n\n[[Page S7297]]\n\n  I will take the word of the Senator from West Virginia. This is \nimportant. If it is important, why didn't we have a hearing on it \nbefore the Homeland Security Committee? Why didn't we have some \ncompetition from other parts of America? Why didn't we have a request \nfor it from the administration?\n  This is just another one of these egregious earmarks that may or may \nnot have merit. We may actually need a leadership academy that needs to \nbe equipped, furnished, and expanded in some place in West Virginia, \nbut no one will ever know that because we have never undergone the \nscrutiny that should be required before we spend $40 million of the \ntaxpayers' money.\n  I probably talked enough about this, and I would imagine that we will \nlose this amendment again. This is in the backdrop of a Federal budget \nwhich for the first 9 months of the fiscal year 2009--3 more months to \ngo--is $1.1 trillion. It is estimated to be as high as $1.8 trillion. \nThe last budget deficit that was anywhere near this in recent history \nwas about $450 billion. We are looking at a deficit of massive \nproportions, and yet we have to pile on additional millions, tens of \nmillions and even billions of dollars in projects that are of \nquestionable value. They may even be valuable, but there has been no \nauthorization, no request, no scrutiny, no competition. It is simply \nput into a bill in a process we call earmarking. That is not fair to \nthe American taxpayers.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I yield back the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment No. 1378.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I move \nto lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are working with the Republicans at \nthis time to come up with a list of remaining amendments this afternoon \nso we can make progress. We hope to be able to move forward shortly on \na number of amendments that will be pending that we have agreed on.\n  While we are doing that, the Senator from Illinois would like to \nspeak as in morning business. How much time does the Senator need?\n  Mr. BURRIS. I need 3 or 4 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois for morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      general james e. cartwright\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, I often have the opportunity to meet with the fine men and \nwomen who serve this country in uniform. Every day we demand the very \nbest from each of them--and in return, we owe them the best we have to \noffer. That means keeping our commitment to this Nation's veterans. But \nit also means supporting our troops in the field--with resources, \nequipment, and--perhaps most importantly--sound leadership at the very \nhighest levels.\n  No one understands this better than GEN James Cartwright, the current \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.\n  Our committee met with General Cartwright just this morning. The \nSenate has been asked to confirm his nomination for a second term as \nVice Chairman. And I rise today to offer him my strongest support.\n  After speaking with General Cartwright, I am convinced that his long \nrecord of loyal service, impeccable judgment, and bold leadership make \nhim the very best choice to continue in this important post. Up to this \npoint, his tenure as a member of the Joint Chiefs has been marked by \ninnovative thinking.\n  Along with Admiral Mullen, General Cartwright has helped to shape the \nmodern American military as we confront a range of new threats from \nacross the globe.\n  A native of my home State, General Cartwright was born in Rockford, \nIL, and began his service as a marine fighter pilot more than 30 years \nago. He is a distinguished graduate of the Air Command and Staff \nCollege at Maxwell Air Force Base, and has served all over the world. \nAs an aviator, he put his extensive training to good use on the front \nlines of our global defense network.\n  As a U.S. marine, he has never wavered in his commitment to the \ncountry we all love. And as a former head of the U.S. Strategic \nCommand, General Cartwright has demonstrated his leadership skills and \nhis deep understanding of the threats we face.\n  He has led the fight for cyber security technology at the Department \nof Defense, helping to protect America from the evolving threats of the \n21st century.\n  He is a credit to the fighting men and women of our Armed Forces, and \nan asset to the elected leaders who depend on him every day. Time and \nagain, he has answered the call.\n  When Secretary Gates first recommended him for nomination 2 years \nago, he understood that James Cartwright was someone we can rely upon. \nToday, as we consider whether he should remain Vice Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs, I believe his record speaks for itself.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting a speedy confirmation \nof General Cartwright.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, we need serious, substantive health care \nreform. The reasons for reform are well known, and they have led to \noverwhelming consensus in Congress that something needs to be done to \nmake health care more affordable and more accessible.\n  The desire for action extends beyond the walls of this great \nbuilding. The American people also want us to act. But this desire for \naction should not\n\n[[Page S7298]]\n\ngive way to legislative haste. Americans do not want us to rush at the \nexpense of getting it right. They have questions, and they deserve \nanswers.\n  There are two very basic and important questions with regard to \nhealth care reform. No. 1, how much is it going to cost? And No. 2, how \nwill we pay for it? First let's look at the question of cost.\n  The American public is alarmed about the massive debt we are \naccumulating. They realize that in the past year, on top of the almost \n$1 trillion stimulus bill, the Federal Government has also purchased \nbanks, an insurance company, and an auto company, all using borrowed \nmoney that we, as taxpayers, will need to pay back. All this massive \nborrowing and spending was done quickly and with little debate. This \nwas done, the public was told, in order to save the economy. How has \nthat turned out?\n  At the beginning of the year, the Obama administration told the \nAmerican people massive stimulus spending, if done quickly, would \ncreate 3 to 4 million jobs and would keep the country's unemployment \nrate at 8 percent. Today, sadly, unemployment is at 9.5 percent, the \nhighest level since 1983. The jobs that were promised have not \nmaterialized. In fact, 467,000 additional jobs were lost last month \nalone.\n  The administration now says they misread the economy. Our government \nrushed to borrow and spend $1 trillion, but now we are basically being \ntold they were wrong. Vice President Biden said as much only a few days \nago.\n  Unfortunately, the American taxpayers are not going to get a do-over \non this spending. They are still on the hook for the almost $1 trillion \nwe borrowed, plus interest. Now there is talk of yet another expensive \nstimulus package to make up for the one that did not work.\n  So considering this, it is no surprise the American public is \nskeptical about the rush to spend yet another $1 trillion or more to \ncreate a Washington-run health care scheme.\n  We have a number of proposals in Congress that attempt to fix health \ncare. There are workable reform proposals that go at the problem in a \nway that does not incur such prohibitive costs for taxpayers. \nUnfortunately, however, our Democratic colleagues have plans \naccompanied by astronomical costs to taxpayers. The Finance Committee \nis struggling to keep its bill at $1 trillion over 10 years. We are \ntold that just a portion of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee bill will cost over $1 trillion. That is just a portion of \ntheir bill. Some have estimated the total cost for that bill will be \nover $3 trillion. These are not scare tactics. These are Congressional \nBudget Office estimates.\n  On the other side of the Capitol, the House Democrats' bill is \nexpected to cost closer to $2 trillion. Over and above these Federal \ncosts, there are frightening costs to the States. If the HELP Committee \nproposal to expand Medicaid is enacted, we can expect a wholesale \ncollapse of State budgets and, of course, we are already seeing the \ncollapse of some State budgets. They are already struggling under the \nunsustainable costs of the current program.\n  These spending figures are startling by themselves and even more \ntroubling taken on top of the massive amount of debt we have already \nacquired.\n  Even more troubling is the expectation that costs of the Democratic \nproposals will continue to rise year after year, well beyond the 10-\nyear budget window used to figure the pricetag of these proposals.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated the annual cost of the \ninsurance subsidy program contained in an earlier version of the HELP \nbill would rise 6.7 percent per year until it is fully phased in. This \npotential spending explosion should not come as a surprise. Medicare \nand Medicaid, two programs we need to strengthen, help, and sustain, \nare both already on unsustainable paths with enormous unfunded \nliabilities.\n  This daunting amount of spending has taxpayers worried, and they are \nbeginning to speak up. One of my Democratic colleagues acknowledged \nthis recently saying: ``The big challenge--and I actually heard this at \nhome during the recess--is the sticker shock.''\n  Other supporters of the President are also warning him and his \nDemocratic colleagues in Congress to slow down and be more careful with \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  On Sunday, former Secretary of State Colin Powell, an Obama supporter \nlast year, warned the President about the ongoing spending spree, \nsaying:\n\n       You can't have so many things on the table that you can't \n     absorb it all.\n\n  To quote Secretary Powell:\n\n       And we can't pay for it all.\n\n  In addition to the massive costs associated with these proposals, no \none can yet tell us where the money will come from to pay for it. All \nthe proposals we have seen are creative in the way they spend tax \ndollars but very short on specifics on how to fund them.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have vaguely outlined \nsome ways they may pay for their plan, including a series of cuts to \nMedicare and Medicaid--I repeat, cuts to Medicare and Medicaid--along \nwith new taxes. But they have not been as forthcoming and specific as \nthey need to be with the American taxpayers.\n  There is a reason why more details have yet to be released. Since we \ndo not have the money to pay for a government takeover of health care, \nthere will need to be massive tax increases or more borrowing or a \ncombination of the two. In fact, one leading Senate Democrat was quoted \nin Wednesday's Wall Street Journal as saying they were ``broadening the \nsearch for revenue''--broadening the search for revenue--to pay for \nthis massive plan. What that means, of course, is they are intensifying \ntheir search for ways to raise taxes on the American people, whether it \nbe taxes on small business, which we have been hearing about lately, or \non health insurance plans or surtaxes on soft drinks or anything else \nthey can think of--massive tax increases for the American people for \nplans which admittedly will only cover one-third of the uninsured \npersons in the United States of America. All the while, this is being \ndone quickly and without time needed to provide the scrutiny the \nAmerican public expects and deserves.\n  All Americans--Republicans, Democrats, and Independents--want health \ncare reform, but they do not want a government-run health care plan. \nThey do not want to pay for it with Medicare and Medicaid cuts. They do \nnot want to drive up the debt. Getting it right is more important than \ngetting it done quickly.\n  Let's learn from the mistakes that were made in hastily passing the \nstimulus bill. Massive new amounts of borrowing, spending, and taxes \nare not the way to successful health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I wish to speak as in morning business. \nHowever, if anybody comes to the Chamber with an amendment or anything, \nI will immediately stop. I want to make that clear.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Cap And Trade Legislation\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I only rise on the floor for one reason; \nand that is, it is my intention next week--probably Tuesday or \nWednesday, whenever I get the floor time--to give a rather long history \nof the whole issue of the cap and trade. What I intend to do is start \nfrom the very beginning.\n  While the Presiding Officer was not presiding over the Senate back \nduring the Kyoto Treaty some 11 years ago, I was. At that time, the \nRepublicans were the majority, and I happened to be the chairman of the \ncommittee that had jurisdiction.\n  I have to tell you, at that time, I was a believer that manmade gas, \nanthropogenic gases, CO2, methane were the cause of global \nwarming. The reason is because everybody said that. Nobody had a \ndissenting view. It was not until the Wharton School came out with the \nWharton Econometrics Survey and said if we were to ratify the Kyoto \nTreaty and live by its emissions requirements,\n\n[[Page S7299]]\n\nit would cost somewhere between $300 billion and $330 billion a year \nthat I started thinking about that. I remember a tax increase that was \nenacted in 1993. That was the Clinton-Gore tax increase that at that \ntime was the largest one in a long period of time. This would have been \n10 times greater than that.\n  So I thought: Let's be sure the science is there. That is when I \ndiscovered there were many scientists who had been intimidated through \nthe use of manipulation in the awarding of grants from the Federal \nGovernment or from the Heinz Foundation or from many of these \norganizations. They had been suppressed very much like the man in the \nEPA was suppressed last week. In looking at that, we started examining \nit and finding out that many scientists around said: No, that is not \nthe case.\n  I will be specific because this was back when President Clinton was \nin office and Al Gore was the Vice President. At that time, he wanted \nto determine how much we could accomplish if the developed nations \nratified and lived by the Kyoto Treaty.\n  He went to Thomas Wigley, who was one of the top scientists at that \ntime. He was chosen by the then-Vice President of the United States, Al \nGore, who said: We want a study. Over a 50-year period, if all \ndeveloped nations would ratify and live by the emissions standards of \nthis treaty, how much would it reduce the temperature over a 50-year \nperiod?\n  When the results came out, it was seven one-hundredths of 1 degree \nCelsius; in other words, not even measurable. That is what began to \ncatch on, and people realized it was a lot of pain, a lot of \npunishment, a lot of heavy taxes--like the current cap-and-trade \nproposal is, or like the one that passed the House--yet there is not \nany gain. Even if you were to believe--as I do not--that a major cause \nof global warming is CO2, then what good would it do for us \nunilaterally to do it if the developing nations are not doing it?\n  We discovered something yesterday in a hearing. I have a great deal \nof respect for Lisa Jackson, who is the new Administrator of the EPA. \nHer honesty was incredible yesterday. Showing her a chart, I asked her \na question, stating: This is what we used during the consideration, 13 \nmonths ago, of the Warner-Lieberman bill. The chart shows the numbers \nas to living within or without the limits of the CO2 \nemissions. If we only did it in the United States, would it make any \ndifference at all in the world amount of CO2? She said: No, \nit would not.\n  I think that is the most significant thing. Because individuals, and \nwell-meaning individuals who believe manmade gases are causing global \nwarming, should realize that does not do it, even if you believed it. \nIn fact, the reverse would be true. There is no doubt--and we have all \nkinds of studies to show it--if we had passed any of the last three \ncap-and-trade bills we considered on the floor of this Senate, that \nwould have had the effect of pushing the manufacturing jobs out of \nAmerica into countries where they have no emissions requirements, such \nas China, and that would have caused a net increase--a net increase--of \nCO2.\n  So I think that was a major thing yesterday that took place. It is my \nintention next week to go back through the history of this issue, to \nbring us up to the present time, and then to look into the future as to \nwhat we might be doing with this legislation.\n  I was very happy to hear, a few minutes ago, that Chairman Barbara \nBoxer has decided not to come out of the committee with a bill until \nafter the August recess. Quite frankly, I think it works in my favor. \nThe longer we have to inform people as to some of the misinformation, \nthe better I think it is going to be in terms of a vote that would take \nplace. I cannot imagine that if there are only some 35, 36 votes that \nwould have been there to pass the Warner-Lieberman bill 13 months ago, \nthat there would be any way today to get up to 60 votes.\n  So, quite frankly, I do not think it is going to pass anyway. But I \ndo think during the recess we are going to have an opportunity to talk \nabout this issue.\n  Today, I visited with a national farm group, and we were talking \nabout how it would disproportionately hurt the farmers. The fact is, 70 \npercent of their wheat cost is in fertilizer and energy. Fertilizer and \nenergy are where the costs would be increased dramatically if we were \nto pass some kind of a cap-and-trade bill.\n  Then, of course, there is the regressive feature. The fact is, poor \npeople in America have to have gasoline in their cars. They have to \nheat their homes. They spend a lot larger percentage of their \ndisposable income on heating and in using energy than wealthy people \ndo.\n  So I think, with all these things working right now, we are in a \nposition to stand back and say, cap and trade is not going to work. It \nis going to be history. And we can start approaching this in ways, \nperhaps somewhat like President Bush tried to do with the Clear Skies \nAct, where he talked about real pollutants, such as SOX, \nNOX, and mercury, and have meaningful reductions in those to \nprotect our environment.\n  That is what our plans are for next week, and I look forward to \nsharing these thoughts with anyone who is willing to listen.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded, just that I may speak for up to 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, as the manager of this bill, who has \nbeen very cooperative, and others on the floor know, I have been \nworking hard to get a vote on my reimportation amendment. It is a very \nsimple, straightforward amendment. It is a limitation amendment--at \nleast it will be once it is perfected and modified. In fact, it is an \namendment that has passed the Senate before, in 2006. So it is not new. \nIt has actually passed the Senate before.\n  Unfortunately, because of the nature of the issue and, in fact, \nbecause of the powerful nature of the pharmaceutical interests who \noppose this amendment, this is being blocked using every procedural \ntool in the book. That is unfortunate, but it seems as if that is going \nto be the case.\n  If I cannot get a fair hearing and a fair vote on this amendment, I \nam going to use the procedural tools available to me to block votes on \nother nongermane amendments, on other amendments that are subject to \npoints of order--which I think are most, if not all, of the other \npending amendments.\n  At this point, given the fairly certain nature of certain Members' \nfierce opposition to this reimportation provision, I simply suggest we \nmove forward and not waste folks' time. I am certainly amenable to \nmoving to dispense with any pending amendment which is germane, which \ndoes not have a point of order against it, move through those and then \nmove to final passage of the bill as quickly as possible. I am \ncertainly open to that and would encourage that and would like to move \nforward in that vein.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                         long term care reform\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I recently spoke to my colleagues \nabout the urgent need to pass health care reform, and in particular \nabout the importance of ensuring that reform includes a strong public \noption. Today, I want to discuss another one of my priorities for \nhealth care reform, and that is long-term care.\n  I have been working to reform long-term care since I began my career \nin public service. In 1982, during my first term as a Wisconsin State \nSenator, I became Chair of the State Senate Aging Committee. I was not \nyet 30 years old, so you can imagine that I was not the obvious \ncandidate to chair a committee on aging. It was through my work on this \ncommittee that I was first exposed to the fractured system of supports \nand services available to those needing long-term care, and learned \nabout the efforts to reform\n\n[[Page S7300]]\n\nthat system which were just beginning in Wisconsin. Over the next 10 \nyears, made long-term care reform a priority, authoring the State's \nAlzheimer's program and drawing attention and resources to the \nmanagement of this devastating disease. I helped expand Wisconsin's \nCommunity Options Program, known as COP, which provided flexible, \nconsumer-oriented and consumer-directed long-term care services in \ncommunity-based settings, enabling thousands of people needing long-\nterm care to remain in their own homes rather than going to a nursing \nhome.\n  I have continued to fight for long-term care reform in the U.S. \nSenate. I served as Chair of the Long-Term Care Working Group at the \nrequest of then-Majority Leader George Mitchell during the 1994 attempt \nat health reform. The recommendations of our working group proved to be \none of the least controversial aspects of health reform legislation. \nOur recommendations drew from the lessons and experiences of states on \nthe cutting edge of long-term care, such as Wisconsin. But when overall \nreform efforts failed, our recommendations went nowhere.\n  Now, 15 years later, Congress is debating health reform legislation \nonce again. And reform is even more necessary than it was in 1994. More \nand more families are struggling to provide care for loved ones who are \ndisabled, ill, and aged. More and more families face the difficult \ndecision of moving a loved one into a nursing facility because no other \noptions exist. These families are stuck in an impossible situation--\nlimited by financial resources and community programs, but dedicated to \nsecuring the best care for their family member. We can and must do \nbetter.\n  Long-term care reform is not a luxury, or a minor part of health care \nreform--it is needed in order to help achieve the goals of health care \nreform. Federal, State, local, and individual expenditures on health \ncare, including long-term care, are unsustainable. In 2007, the Federal \nand State governments spent $311 billion on long-term care, or just \nunder 3 percent of the United States' gross domestic product.\n  Approximately three-quarters of this amount represents government \nspending on Medicaid and Medicare. Long-term care reform could be one \nof the most effective tools to ensure solvency for our entitlement \nprograms, reducing the Medicaid burden on State budgets, and getting \nhealth care spending under control.\n  I have worked on these issues for the better part of three decades. \nAnd after devoting so much time to long-term care, a number of things \nare clear. First, we must have a cohesive strategy to care for those \nneeding long- term supports and services. Modern medicine has turned \nfatal diseases into chronic diseases, and enabled individuals to live \nmuch longer. These are tremendous accomplishments. But the reality is \nthat these individuals need even more assistance because of medical \nadvancements from their families, communities, and government.\n  Long-term care assistance is not something that most people can plan \nfor or save for. This is a very important point. Of the 10 million \nAmericans needing long-term care, 40 percent were working-age adults or \nchildren who have become disabled, or too ill, to live independently. \nThis is something that the Trifunovich family in Cudahy, WI, knows all \ntoo well. At 33, Aleksandar Trifunovich suddenly suffered a deadly \nbrain stem stroke, cruelly leaving him ``locked in.'' His brain \nfunction, eyesight, and hearing remained normal, but his entire body \nwas paralyzed. Against all odds, Aleksandar survived surgery and has \nmade miraculous development through rehabilitation. Today, Aleksandar \nis no longer ``locked in,'' but fights every day to preserve the \nprogress he has made and regain even more of his mobility. Along the \nway, his sisters Vera and Andjelija have stepped in, as so many family \nmembers do, to support and care for their brother. The family is \nacutely aware of the current fractured long-term care system. Calling \nit ``unnavigable,'' they say that it is a daily battle to ensure \nAleksandar has access to the care, supports, and services he needs to \ncontinue regaining his mobility and independence.\n  As for the 60 percent of older Americans and senior citizens needing \nlong-term care, who theoretically might have had time to save for these \nmedical needs, financing long-term care on their own is simply too \nexpensive. Not only is the cost of long-term care growing at twice the \nrate of inflation, seniors are using long-term care supports and \nservices earlier and more often. And families are feeling the strain. \nStudies estimate that over 85 percent of long-term care is provided by \nfamily and friends, but the cost of providing care and forgoing \nearnings elsewhere is not included in projections on long-term care \nspending. Long-term care reform is not an issue of making people be \nmore responsible, save earlier, or save more. It is needed because the \nsystem, on a fundamental level, is strained to the breaking point.\n\n  Second, we do not necessarily need to spend more, but we must spend \nmore wisely. This means establishing consumer-oriented and consumer-\ndirected flexible benefits as well as making fundamental reforms to the \nlinkages between the long-term care and acute care systems. For too \nlong, long-term care has been synonymous with institutional care. \nCongress has a rare opportunity to redefine long-term care, and put \nreal weight and spending power behind home- and community-based long-\nterm care options.\n  Central to this effort is creating a system of home- and community-\nbased flexible services that respond to individual consumer choice and \npreference from the initial assessment right on through to ongoing \nservices, with case managers and others regularly consulting with the \nconsumer and family members to be sure their needs are met in a \nsatisfying manner. I have been working with my colleagues on the Senate \nFinance Committee and Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee for months now, to draw attention to the excellent programs \nwe have in my home State of Wisconsin as we begin to fill the gaps in \nlong-term care supports and services. Wisconsin's progress in long-term \ncare should be used as a template for national reform, and I was \npleased that Chairman Baucus included new incentives for home and \ncommunity-based care programs like those Wisconsin uses today in the \npolicy proposals he put forward earlier this year.\n  Wisconsin's progressive tradition is the driving force behind Family \nCare, our State entitlement program for low-income and disabled adults \nto receive necessary care, supports, and services in their homes and \ncommunities. Family Care currently operates in almost every county in \nthe State, and provides a flexible benefit for beneficiaries to receive \nlong-term care supports and services in the comfort of their own homes. \nFamily Care has demonstrated two important things: First, it showed \nthat you can establish a long-term care program that is flexible and \nable to respond to the needs of individual consumers; second, it showed \nthat kind of flexible program could be a cost-effective alternative to \nnursing homes.\n\n  Family Care coordinates consumers with social workers, registered \nnurses, and local Aging and Disability Resource Centers to identify \nwhat each consumer needs to remain a productive and independent \ncitizen. Entitlement benefits can be used for such purposes as hiring \nhelp with basic daily tasks like bathing, dressing, or shopping, or \nwith challenges like shoveling snow, which in Wisconsin is not a \ntrivial task.\n  Because of this benefit, long-term care consumers in the State are \nchoosing to stay in their own homes and saving the State money in the \nprocess. One independent assessment of Family Care estimates that the \nprogram saves the State $1.2 million each month by allowing long-term \ncare consumers to arrange for the care they need to remain independent, \nand out of the nursing home. If overwhelming popularity and savings \nwere not enough, counties with Family Care have seen decreases in \nnursing home admissions, emergency room use, and hospital readmittance. \nInstead, long-term care consumers are seeing their primary care \nphysicians more to maintain and manage their health.\n  How we care for those who need it most--seniors, people with \ndisabilities and other who need long term care--is a key part of any \neffort to change our health care system. I have thought often of my \nwork as Chair of the long-term care working group over the last\n\n[[Page S7301]]\n\n15 years. If just those recommendations we put together back then had \nbeen enacted, we might not be spending the trillions on health care \nthat we are today. We can not continue to make the mistake of \noverlooking long-term care in the broader debate. Congress must place \nthis critical issue front and center in the health care debate. It is \ntime to put long-term care in the spotlight and use Family Care, \nWisconsin's outstanding example of flexible and cost-effective care, as \na model for broader reform.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, as soon as this amendment logjam is \nbroken, it is my intention to offer an amendment which is cosponsored \nby Senators Carper, Casey, and Kerry. This amendment deals with an \nissue of significance to all 50 States in our country and maybe \nespecially rural America.\n  In the midst of the financial crisis we are facing, our capabilities \nto support fire departments--both professional and volunteer--and the \nEMS services they provide is under great stress.\n  What my amendment would do is add $100 million for the Assistance to \nFirefighters Grant Program as well as for another important program for \nfire departments, the Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency \nResponse, or SAFER, Grant Program--$50 million for each program. In the \n$50 million for the SAFER Grant Program would be included $30 million \nthat would go for addressing the real crisis rural volunteer fire \ndepartments are facing.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, I do not know what the situation is \nin New Hampshire, but in Vermont--and I think in many parts of the \ncountry--we are seeing a real problem with recruitment and retention. \nMany people in urban areas may not understand that. But in rural \nAmerica, most folks get their fire service and most folks get their \nEMS, their first responder service, from volunteers. If there are not \nvolunteers available for one or another reason--and we have seen both \nrecruitment and retention problems in volunteer fire departments--if \nthose volunteers are not there, what is going to happen is, when fires \nhappen, those fires are not going to be able to be contained. When \nsomebody has a heart attack and dials 911, they are not going to get \nthe kind of speedy ambulance service they need.\n  In the midst of this recession, what we are seeing is not only a \nreduction and a real stress on volunteer firefighting departments all \nover this country, and their EMS services, we are also seeing, in terms \nof professional firefighters, reductions in one part of the country \nafter another part of the country, after another part of the country. \nCities and towns under stress are cutting back, and they are doing it \nin ways which are certainly endangering the well-being and the health \nof the people in their communities.\n  Surveys by the International Association of Fire Fighters say that up \nto 5,000 firefighting jobs are in jeopardy. In Prince George's County, \nMD--not far from here--there is a new phenomenon called ``brownouts.'' \nThis is where fire stations are closed, five at a time, to save money. \nIn Atlanta, GA, the economic crisis has resulted in the shutting of \nfive firehouses. In Flint, MI, 22 firefighters were laid off. Proposals \nin Columbus, OH, include laying off 238 firefighters. In Warren, OH, 17 \nfirefighters received layoff notices. Orlando, FL, plans on laying off \n46 firefighters. In Spokane, WA, up to 15 firefighting positions could \nbe eliminated. There is also a serious problem about funding the \nequipment our firefighters need.\n  So we have a real problem. It seems to me at this moment this is a \npriority for this Nation, and it is something we should be addressing.\n  This amendment is supported by the volunteer firefighters of America.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the National Volunteer Fire Council. The National \nVolunteer Fire Council is strongly supporting this amendment, and they \nrepresent thousands of volunteer firefighters throughout this country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                              National Volunteer Fire Council,\n\n                                      Greenbelt, MD, July 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Bernie Sanders,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Robert Casey,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Sanders: I am writing to express the full \n     support of the National Volunteer Fire Council (NVFC) for \n     your amendment to increase funding for the Assistance to \n     Firefighters Grant (AFG) program and the Staffing for \n     Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grant program by \n     $50 million each in the FY 2010 Department of Homeland \n     Security Appropriations Act. The NVFC represents the \n     interests of the more than one million volunteer firefighters \n     and EMS personnel in the United States.\n       AFG helps fire departments and EMS agencies purchase \n     desperately needed equipment, apparatus and training. Nearly \n     20,000 fire departments applied for more than $3.1 billion in \n     funding through AFG in FY 2009--more than five times the $565 \n     million appropriated for this year. The $380 million \n     allocation in the Committee-passed version of the FY 2010 DHS \n     Appropriations Act represents a reduction of 33 percent from \n     last year and is $10 million below the House-passed companion \n     bill.\n       AFG is a highly successful program that relies on input \n     from the fire service and a direct grant process to ensure \n     that funding quickly reaches the agencies that need it most. \n     An FY 2007 review of AFG by DHS found the program to be 95 \n     percent effective, the second highest rating of any program \n     at DHS.\n       A needs assessment survey conducted by the Fireman's Fund \n     Insurance Company recently found that 60 percent of \n     respondents report that their fire department has delayed \n     equipment replacement purchases due to the economic downturn. \n     Fifty percent of respondents reported that if economic \n     conditions do not improve within the next 12 months that it \n     could affect their ability to provide service to their \n     communities. Local fire and EMS agencies need AFG funding now \n     more than ever.\n       SAFER funds assist fire departments to build staffing \n     capacity through hiring of career firefighters and \n     recruitment and retention of volunteers. There is no single \n     more significant challenge facing the volunteer fire service \n     than recruitment and retention. Since 1987, the percentage of \n     volunteer firefighters under the age of 40 has shrunk from 65 \n     percent to approximately 50 percent today. As this trend \n     suggests, fire departments are increasingly having difficulty \n     recruiting and retaining the next generation of volunteer \n     firefighters. Volunteer fire departments can use recruitment \n     and retention funds for a variety of activities from \n     marketing campaigns to establishing modest incentive \n     programs.\n       Your amendment would provide critical additional funding to \n     assist first responders and signal to local fire and EMS \n     agencies that they remain an important national priority even \n     in these difficult budgetary times. Thank you again for \n     offering this amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Heather Schafer,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I will be speaking about this amendment \nat a later time, but I wanted to let my colleagues know this issue is \nof great concern all over this country. It is a concern to the \nfirefighting community, it is a concern to the EMS community, and it is \ncertainly a concern to rural America.\n  I look forward to my colleagues supporting this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n   Amendments Nos. 1459 and 1455, as Modified, to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \npending amendments be set aside and that it be in order for me to call \nup the following two amendments en bloc: amendment No. 1459 and \namendment No. 1455, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mr. Tester, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1459 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n[[Page S7302]]\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mr. KYL, for \n     himself, and Mr. McCAIN, proposes an amendment numbered 1455, \n     as modified, to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1459\n\n (Purpose: To condition funding for the National Bio and Agro-defense \n                               Facility)\n\n       On page 77, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 5__.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1458 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendments be set aside and that amendment No. 1458 be the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray], for Mr. Dodd, \n     for himself, Mr. Lieberman and Mr. Carper, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1458 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide additional funds for FIRE grants under section 33 \n        of the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974)\n\n       On page 77, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. _ (a) The amount appropriated under the heading \n     ``firefighter assistance grants'' under the heading ``Federal \n     Emergency Management Agency'' under by title III for \n     necessary expenses for programs authorized by the Federal \n     Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 is increased by \n     $10,000,000 for necessary expenses to carry out the programs \n     authorized under section 33 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 2229).\n       (b) The total amount of appropriations under the heading \n     ``Aviation Security'' under the heading ``Transportation \n     Security Administration'' under title II, the amount for \n     screening operations and the amount for explosives detection \n     systems under the first proviso under that heading, and the \n     amount for the purchase and installation of explosives \n     detection systems under the second proviso under that heading \n     are reduced by $4,500,000.\n       (c) From the unobligated balances of amounts appropriated \n     before the date of enactment of this Act for the \n     appropriations account under the heading ``state and local \n     programs'' under the heading ``Federal Emergency Management \n     Agency'' for ``Trucking Industry Security Grants'', \n     $5,500,000 are rescinded.\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the amendment that is now pending is an \namendment that increases fire grant programs by $10 million. It is \nfully offset. The fire grant programs provide funds to equip, train, \nand hire our firefighters. The committee provided an increase in the \nbill because in 2007 there were over 20,731 applications, totaling $3.1 \nbillion, and FEMA could only approve 5,132 of those applications due to \nlimited funds.\n  I hope we can move quickly to a vote on this amendment. We wish to \nmove forward. I know several Senators have amendments they wish to \noffer, and if we can move to a vote on this fairly quickly, I think \neverybody would be amenable to that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1467 to Amendment No. 1458\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I certainly share the desire to move \nforward and resolve these issues and go through these votes. In that \nvein, I send to the desk a second-degree amendment to the Dodd \namendment.\n  This is a straight limitation amendment. It is a germane amendment \nwith no points of order against it, which would simply enact \nlegislation that the Senate enacted in 2006 with regard to \nreimportation.\n  I would be happy to explain the amendment more fully if it is \nappropriate to have a debate either now or in the near future on it. \nBut again, it enacts language that was previously enacted by the Senate \nin 2006. It is a straight limitation amendment, which is germane, and \ndoes not have points of order against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1467 to amendment No. 1458.\n\n  Mr. VITTER.

Mr. President, in a moment I will send a managers' \npackage to the desk. We are waiting for one quick decision. Hopefully, \nin a moment, I will be sending a managers' package to the desk with a \nnumber of\n\n[[Page S7303]]\n\namendments that have been worked out on both sides. We hope to adopt \nthat package.\n  I know Members have been waiting to get to votes. We have several \nSenators who require votes on their amendments.

Mr. President, I am proud to join with Senators Cornyn and \nPryor to offer this amendment to the Department of Homeland Security \nappropriations bill. This bipartisan amendment will bring clarity to \nthe definition of what should be classified as a switchblade knife. \nThis amendment is in response to a proposal by the U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection, CBP, to revoke four ruling letters that would change \nthe definition of a switchblade knife.\n  The definition of what is a switchblade has been clear and settled \nsince the Federal Switchblade Act was\n\n[[Page S7305]]\n\npassed in 1958, and it has been reaffirmed by many years of legal \ndecisions. The act is very clear that a switchblade must have an \nautomatic mechanism that is activated by a button usually located on \nthe handle. Without a button, it is not a switchblade, and this has \nbeen upheld by numerous cases on many levels over the years.\n  This amendment will clearly define that any knife that can be opened \nwith one hand is not and should not be classified as a switchblade. \nThis amendment conforms to the original intent of Congress when it \npassed the Federal Switchblade Act in 1958.\n  According to knife industry sources, 80 percent of pocketknives sold \ntoday are one-hand or assisted openers. On a daily basis, good working \nfolks use these knives in their daily tasks as electricians, \ncarpenters, and construction workers. As such, Leatherman-type \nmultitools with one-hand opening features, as well as folding utility \nknives that have a stud on the blunt portion of the blade to assist \none-hand opening, would have been defined as a switchblade. The \namendment offered today will provide a permanent statutory remedy to \nthis issue. This amendment will continue to prohibit switchblades, but \nnot at the expense of knives that were never meant to be categorized as \na switchblade. Because of that, I saw the need to offer this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1428, as Modified\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Hatch \namendment, No. 1428, as modified, be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1428), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to \nspeak about an issue that I have been working on for several years and \nwhich has been addressed once and for all by the amendment that Senator \nHatch has proposed--No. 1428--and that I have cosponsored, along with \nSenators Cornyn, Bennett of Utah, Schumer, Menendez, Reid, Kennedy, and \nGillibrand. The amendment contains several important provisions, \nincluding my bill to put an end to what has become known as the ``widow \npenalty.'' This bipartisan support for this amendment has brought out \nthe best in the Senate, and the Senate's action today represents a \ngreat achievement.\n  Under our immigration laws, a foreigner who marries a U.S. citizen is \nentitled to become a permanent U.S. resident. Yet our own immigration \nservice has been trying to deport several hundred widows and a few \nwidowers--foreigners who had been married to American citizens when the \nAmericans died.\n  To illustrate, here is a little story from a June 14 CBS ``60 \nMinutes'' rebroadcast:\n  Raquel Williams, a young nursing student from Brazil, was visiting \nFlorida when one night she and three girl friends drove into a gas \nstation. They caught the eye of a car full of guys who were also \ngetting gas.\n  ``I guess they noticed that we were, you know, not from here,'' \nRaquel remembers, recalling when she first met her future husband. That \nchance meeting with Derek Williams led to love, marriage, and \neventually parenthood. Two years after they met, their son Ian was \nborn.\n  But then the unthinkable happened.\n  Raquel told ``60 Minutes'' she woke up about 4:30 a.m. one morning to \nfind her husband lying on the couch. She could see something was wrong. \nHe wasn't breathing. Raquel called 911. ``Please, please,'' she \npleaded, ``come fast. Fast.''\n  But he was already gone. Derek had insomnia, so he would watch TV on \ntheir couch during the night. But he also had breathing problems and an \nirregular heartbeat, which proved fatal.\n  After he died, Raquel and Ian moved in with Derek's parents. And 3 \nmonths after Derek died, Raquel finally had the immigration interview \nthat she had been seeking for a year to gain status as a permanent U.S. \nresident.\n  She went to the interview with Ian, and brought all the documentation \nneeded to prove she had been married to Derek; she also brought the \ndeath certificate.\n  Her case was denied. ``They said, `You're gonna have to go back to \nBrazil.' And I said, `I have my son. You know? This is my son. He's \n[an] American citizen.' And they said that, `You can go. He can stay.' \n''\n  Ian was 5 months old at the time.\n  Raquel found herself caught in what is now referred to by many as the \nwidow penalty--when a surviving spouse faces deportation because they \nhad yet to be married 2 full years when their American husband or wife \ndied.\n  Tragically, there are hundreds of cases in which men and women are \ncrying out for common sense and reason to prevail. Earlier this year, I \nfiled standalone legislation--the Fairness to Surviving Spouses Act of \n2009--to put an end to the unfair and arbitrary widow penalty.\n  Then, 2 weeks ago, joined by Representative Jim McGovern, the sponsor \nof the House counterpart to my bill, I held a meeting here in \nWashington with a number of surviving spouses from around the country. \nAll of them today find themselves in Raquel's situation.\n  They included Diana Engstrom, whose husband was killed working with \nthe Army in Iraq, and Natalia Goukassian, a Florida woman who, like \nRaquel, lost her American husband and then found the Federal Government \nmoving to deport her.\n  Natalia is but one of a few hundred spouses of deceased Americans \nwhose legal status hangs in the balance, but her story is illustrative. \nShe came into the country legally from Russia and met her future \nhusband. They married on June 30, 2006, and soon after they filed for \nNatalia's permanent resident status in the Orlando office of \nCitizenship and Immigration Services. Tigran died on December 1, 2006, \nof an aggressive form of cancer related to his service in the U.S. \nmilitary. Natalia was denied in March 2009. For now she is here \nlegally, but that status soon will end unless this amendment becomes \nlaw.\n  Widows and widowers facing deportation were given a potential \nlifeline on June 9, when the Obama administration put plans to send \nthem to their home country on hold. But the administration says they \nwill need a permanent fix, legislation from Congress, to be able to \nkeep them in the country.\n  Today, with the adoption of our amendment, we finally have given them \none. Our amendment puts an end to the widow penalty once and for all. \nSurviving spouses would still need to prove their marriage was a bona \nfide marriage before receiving a green card. And they would be still be \ncounted against the overall cap of persons allowed to immigrate to this \ncountry each year. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services would \nretain the discretion to deny petitions, but they would no longer deny \nthem automatically in response to the death of the citizen spouse.\n  The significance of the Senate's action today to the surviving \nspouses who will benefit from its provisions cannot be overstated. Our \ngovernment no longer will be ``piling on'' by responding to the tragic \ndeath of spouse with an order of deportation instead of an offer of \ncondolences. On behalf of Diana Engstrom, Natalia Goukassian, Raquel \nWilliams, and all the surviving spouses who will have the chance to \ncontinue their lives in this country, I thank my colleagues and look \nforward to seeing this provision, which reflects our values as \nAmericans, embraced by the House so that it may finally become the law \nof the land.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to present my second-degree \namendment.\n\n[[Page S7306]]\n\n  In a few minutes we will be voting on the Vitter second-degree \namendment to the Dodd amendment. This is very straightforward and is \nsomething this body has considered very directly before. This amendment \nsimply prohibits funds in the bill from being used by Customs and \nBorder security to prevent the reimportation of prescription drugs from \nCanada only and for personal use only. So it is a reimportation \namendment but only from Canada and only for personal use. It is very \nlimited in that regard.\n  Also, it only limits funds with regard to enforcement by Customs and \nBorder security. There are numerous other agencies in the Federal \nGovernment, such as the Justice Department and many law enforcement \nagencies, which regularly are in the business of going after \ncounterfeits and other problems in the drug trade. This amendment \ndoesn't limit that activity in any way because it only impacts Customs \nand Border security.\n  Finally, this exact amendment was considered and passed by the Senate \nin July of 2006. It was not only passed by the Senate, but that Vitter \namendment, essentially identical, was adopted 68 to 32. A few months \nlater, modified language passed the entire Congress. It was somewhat \nmodified, but it passed the entire Congress and is law now.\n  So based on all that history, I urge a strong bipartisan vote in \nfavor of this amendment as we had in 2006. I reserve the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to my friend's \namendment.\n  For the past several years, there has been a provision in this \nappropriations bill that says that Customs and Border Protection cannot \nstop an individual from bringing in on their person 90 days' worth of a \nprescription drug from Canada. While I am not crazy about that \nlanguage, it has been law for some time and codifies what had been an \nexisting practice at the border. However, my colleague from Louisiana \nis proposing to radically alter what happens at the border.\n  This amendment is bad policy, and I hope our colleagues will vote \nagainst it. It is not adequate to protect the public health, and it \nwill not keep Americans safe.\n  This amendment would strike three important elements of existing law. \nInstead of just individuals, anyone could bring in drugs. There would \nbe no license required for businesses to get into this line of work. \nThere would be no inspections of their facilities, no minimum \nqualifications, no background checks, no limits on resale, no oversight \nwhatsoever. This would be an open door for criminals to get into \nAmericans' medicine cabinets.\n  The amendment removes the limit on the method of importation. Instead \nof bringing in the drugs on your person, you could do it by mail order \nor more likely via the Internet. This creates a problem with drugs \ncoming not from Canada but through Canada. Many of the drugs ordered \nonline today are purported to be from Canada, but when GAO and others \ninvestigate, they are found to be from other countries.\n  Finally, there would be no limits on the quantities permitted to be \nimported. Canada has only one-tenth the population of the United \nStates. They cannot serve as our pharmacy. The drugs will be sourced \nfrom somewhere else. It is inevitable. While many people may be \ncomfortable with drugs from Canada, I doubt they will have the same \nlevel of comfort with drugs from Pakistan, China, or Malta. There is \nnothing in this amendment to ensure that the drugs come from Canada, \nbut there is every incentive for them not to come from Canada.\n  Most Americans who turn to imported drugs do so because of cost, but \na counterfeit, tainted, or substandard drug is unsafe at any price. As \nwe consider the issue of drug importation, the safety of our citizens \nmust be our primary concern.\n  I support finding ways to reduce the cost of drugs but never at the \nexpense of safety. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  It is a well-intentioned amendment, I am sure. I care a great deal \nfor my colleague, but I think we should oppose it and vote it down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to briefly address some of the \nissues brought up by my distinguished colleague from Utah.\n  First, this amendment is only about individuals, and you can look at \nthe clear language of the amendment. It is about individuals, not \ncorporations, not mega businesses, not anything else but individuals.\n  Secondly, it is only about personal use. It is only about businesses \nnot in the business of importing prescription drugs. So these \nindividuals cannot be in that business, cannot be in that activity as a \nbusiness. We specifically refer to the relevant portion of the Federal \nFood Drug and Cosmetic Act, section 801(g).\n  Third, it is for personal use because of that limitation.\n  Fourth, we are only limiting funds that go through border security \nfor this purpose, not any other law enforcement agency; and there are \nmany that are involved in the fight against counterfeits and other \nthings, including the Department of Justice.\n  Fifth, and finally, this language was passed by this body in 2006 by \na strong bipartisan vote of 68 to 32 and, as Senator Hatch said, a \nmodified version was actually passed into law and has operated in law \nfor 3 years, with no apparent safety problems that we are aware of.\n  I yield back my time and look forward to the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I yield back my time, also.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we just approved a 3-year extension of \nthe Religious Workers Act, which has a good goal and a worthy motive. \nWe need to do better with this program.\n  We did have, in this legislation that passed, a study of the program \nto see how well it is working. But in July of 2006, the Homeland \nSecurity Department conducted an evaluation of the program, and it was \nnot a good report. Essentially, the situation is that a religious group \nwould be entitled to ask for and petition for someone to be brought \ninto the country to work in their religious entity. It is called a \n``religious worker program.'' It is usually not a minister, but some \nsort of lay worker.\n  The assessment was done by the Homeland Security group. It was an \nassessment of 200-plus cases, without any indication that any of those \nwere fraudulent. They just took them at random and checked the 220 \ncases. Field inquiries were conducted where necessary, and fraud was \ndetermined to be the willful misrepresentation or falsification of a \nmaterial fact--that means something that would probably have meant they \nwere not entitled to the benefit of the program.\n  Under this evaluation, it was found that out of 220 cases evaluated, \n72 were fraudulent; that is, 33 percent--or 1 out of 3--of the \nreligious workers entering the country under this program entered \nfraudulently. That is not a good record. In fact, it appears to be the \nhighest fraudulent record of any immigrant program we have in the \ncountry.\n  They cited some of the examples of abuses. For example, a beneficiary \nwas invited into the country by a petitioner to work at a religious \ninstitution, and when they checked, the institution didn't exist. And \nthe petitioner had filed a number of other petitions bringing in other \npeople.\n  Another one dealt with a paper church--a church that didn't exist--\nand the addresses and all that were given were not legitimate.\n  Another one: Age 33, the beneficiary. The person who filed the \npetition to bring this foreign worker in couldn't be located, and there \ncould be no connection between the person who petitioned and the group \nfor which they claimed to be petitioning. So it appears that this \nindividual petitioned for another individual to come and work at a \nschool or a church, and the school or church they said they were going \nto work at didn't even know this was happening. Of course, when the \nperson came in, they were therefore just able\n\n[[Page S7307]]\n\nto enter the country illegally and never worked at a church.\n  There are several more like that. Here is another one. The signer of \nthe petition was no longer at the school, and the school board members \ninterviewed said they didn't know who was invited to come through the \npetition and were not even aware a petition had been filed.\n  In another case, the petitioner had filed at least 82 petitions, with \nmany fraudulent indicators, including the misrepresentation of the \nqualifications and duties of the beneficiary.\n  Another one dealt with a situation where the beneficiary couldn't be \nlocated, and the petitioner whose name was on the petition when found \nand interviewed said he didn't know anything about the filing. He \ndidn't file it. So somebody just filed it and used his name and brought \nin somebody, supposedly to work at a religious institution, and it was \nall bogus.\n  So this is a program which has some real difficulties. I hope the \nstudy will help us figure out how to make it a more honest system that \ncan meet the goals of our program without allowing for so much fraud \nand abuse.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing amendments be the only amendments remaining in order to the \nByrd substitute amendment No. 1373 and H.R. 2892, and that at 8:25 p.m. \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendments in the order \nlisted; that prior to each vote, there be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided and controlled in the usual form; that no other amendments be \nin order; further, that upon disposition of the Vitter amendment No. \n1467, the Dodd amendment No. 1458, as amended, if amended, be agreed to \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that after the \nfirst vote in the sequence, the vote time be limited to 10 minutes \neach. The amendments in order are Vitter amendment No. 1467, Dodd \namendment No. 1458, Coburn amendment No. 1433, Murray amendment No. \n1468, Coburn amendment No. 1434, Grassley amendment No. 1415, and \nSanders amendment No. 1430; that upon disposition of the listed \namendments, the substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to, the \nbill, as amended, be read a third time, and the Senate proceed to vote \non passage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate insist on its \namendment, request a conference with the House on the disagreeing votes \nof the two Houses, and that the Chair be authorized to appoint \nconferees on the part of the Senate and that members of the \nsubcommittee be appointed as conferees; further, that if a budget point \nof order or any other point of order is raised and sustained, then it \nbe in order for the majority manager to offer another substitute \namendment minus any offending provision, but including any amendments \nwhich had been agreed to, and that no further amendments be in order; \nthat the substitute amendment, as amended, if amended, be agreed to, \nand the remaining provisions beyond adoption of the substitute \nremaining in effect; and further, that the cloture motions be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Vitter Amendment No. 1467\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, with that, we are ready to vote on the \nVitter amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  There is 2 minutes of debate equally divided prior to the vote.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, Senator Hatch and I have both spoken, and \nI am prepared to yield back the time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. And I will yield back time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 1467.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Burris), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island (Mr. Reed), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1433, offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I had a chance to discuss amendment No. \n1433 with Senator Coburn during the previous vote. I believe he is \nwilling to take a voice vote on it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I call up the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1433 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the payment of bonuses to government contractors \n                         for poor performance)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n       proper awarding of incentive fees for contract performance\n\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Washington. \nThis simply eliminates inappropriate\n\n[[Page S7308]]\n\nbonuses at the Department of Human Services. We did that at the \nDepartment of Defense, which saved $500 million. It is also an OMB reg \nfor the agency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1433) was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 1468, to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I call up amendment No. 1468.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk the read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Washington [Mrs. Murray] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1468 to amendment number 1373.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place insert the following:\n       None of the funds appropriated or othewise made available \n     by this Act may be used by the Department of Homeland \n     Security to enter into any federal contract unless such \n     contract is entered into in accordance with the requirements \n     of the Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of \n     1949 (41 U.S.C. 253) or Chapter 137 of title 10, United \n     States Code, and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, unless \n     such contract is otherwise authorized by statute to be \n     entered into without regard to the above referenced statutes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided on the amendment.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for the information of all Senators, the \namendment following the vote on the Murray amendment is a Coburn \namendment about ensuring that government contracts are competitively \nawarded. I agree with the premise of the amendment that follows this. \nHowever, his amendment is drafted in a way that precludes certain types \nof contracts that are authorized by statute and have the strong support \nof Congress. For example, his amendment doesn't acknowledge contracts \nthat are authorized by the Small Business Act, such as minority-owned \nbusinesses, women-owned businesses, businesses owned by service-\ndisabled veterans. The Coburn language also ignores the AbilityOne \nProgram, known as the Javits-Wagner-O'Day Program, which provides job \nopportunities for blind and disabled Americans through Federal \ncontracts.\n  The amendment I am offering assures that we do award government \ncontracts competitively but does it in a way that makes sure we take \ncare of small businesses and veteran-owned businesses and women-owned \nbusinesses.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to vote for the Murray amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if I understand this correctly, this will \nactually eliminate competitive bidding on grants so grants may be \nearmarked and would not have to be competitively bid. I believe it is \nimportant the American people know we competitively bid for contracts \nand we competitively bid for grants on the basis of priority and merit. \nTherefore, I am in opposition to this amendment and in support of my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the Murray \namendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1468.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

If you vote against my amendment, you are saying we should not. \nThat is all there is to it.\n  Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is the Senator offering the amendment?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I actually have to offer the amendment. I \ncall up amendment No. 1434 and ask for its consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1434 to amendment No. 1373.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit no bid contracts by requiring the use of \ncompetitive procedures to award contracts and grants funded under this \n                                  Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n\n                          competitive bidding\n\n       Sec. __.  (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to make any payment in \n     connection with a contract unless the contract is awarded \n     using competitive procedures in accordance with the \n     requirements of section 303 of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C. 253), section \n     2304 of title 10, United States Code, and the Federal \n     Acquisition Regulation.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be awarded by grant unless the process used to award \n     such grant uses competitive procedures to select the grantee \n     or award recipient.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate just adopted an amendment that \nensures that the government contracts are competitively awarded. The \namendment Senator Coburn is now offering will undo everything we just \ndid to assure that all businesses--small business, minority-owned \nbusinesses, women-owned businesses, businesses owned by service-\ndisabled veterans--\n\n[[Page S7309]]\n\nwill be eligible to bid on these contracts.\n  I urge the Senate to vote no.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Burris), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island (Mr. Reed), and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Missouri (Mr. Bond), the Senator from Oklahoma (Mr. Inhofe), and \nthe Senator from Florida (Mr. Martinez).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the next amendment in order is the \nGrassley amendment No. 1415. I have told the Senator we are willing to \ntake it on a voice vote if he wants to offer it.\n  I call up amendment No. 1415.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1415) was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1430 to Amendment No. 1373\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the next amendment and final amendment in \norder is the Sanders amendment. I believe the Senator will speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment is cosponsored by Senator \nCasey, Senator Carper, and Senator Kerry. It is also supported by the \nNational Volunteer Fire Council representing the interests of over \n800,000 volunteer firefighters.\n  At a time when due to the economic crisis fire departments all over \nthis country are laying off firefighters, and in rural America \nvolunteer fire departments are finding it increasingly difficult to \nattract and retain those firefighters who not only help us, saving our \nproperty and our lives, but also are involved in EMS services, we are \nputting some of that $100 million directly into recruitment and \nretention for volunteer firefighting efforts. The offset is the science \nand technology fund, which I have nothing against, but I think the \npriorities now have to be for firefighting and for volunteer fire \ndepartments.\n  I yield 15 seconds to Senator Casey.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Casey, Mr. Kaufman, and Mr. Kerry, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1430 to Amendment No. 1373.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To increase funding for firefighter assistance grants and \n                   recruitment and retention grants)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. FIREFIGHTER ASSISTANCE GRANTS AND RECRUITMENT AND \n                   RETENTION GRANTS.\n\n       For an additional amount for programs authorized by the \n     Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974 (15 U.S.C. \n     2201 et seq.) under the heading ``firefighter assistance \n     grants'' under the heading ``Federal Emergency and Management \n     Agency'' under title III there are appropriated $100,000,000, \n     of which $50,000,000 shall be available to carry out section \n     33 of that Act (15 U.S.C. 2229) and $50,000,000 shall be \n     available to carry out section 34 of that Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2229a) : Provided, That of the $50,000,000 made available \n     under this section to carry out section 34 of that Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 2229a), $20,000,000 shall be available for recruitment \n     and retention grants under that section. The total amount of \n     appropriations under the heading ``research, development, \n     acquisition, and operations'' under the heading ``Science and \n     Technology'' under title IV of this Act is reduced by \n     $100,000,000.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to this amendment. I \nalso want fire grants. I want everybody to understand that the \ncommittee amendment already has $810 million in it for fire grants. \nThat is an increase of $35 million. We just adopted another amendment \nto add $10 million to this.\n  The offset that is in this bill will eliminate all the technology \ndevelopment and design to address capabilities. It decimates the \ncounter-improvised explosive device--IED--technology. It specifically \neliminates mass transit-specific counter-IED technologies. It decimates \ncyber-security research and development. The Senate computers are being \nattacked today. It eliminates the research to make sure we can stop \nthat. It eliminates development and assessment of high throughput cargo \nscreening technology. The list goes on.\n  I believe we should be doing all we can for our firefighters. Even \nthe International Association of Firefighters does not support this \namendment--although I appreciate the Senator offering this amendment, \nand I agree with what he would like to do. But the offset decimates \nmuch of the technology we need to protect our citizens.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1430.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Illinois (Mr. Burris), \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd), the Senator from Connecticut \n(Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator \nfrom Vermont (Mr. Leahy), the Senator from Rhode Island (Mr. Reed), and \nthe Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from \nVermont (Mr. Leahy) would vote aye.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n             Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning Program\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of entering into \na colloquy with the Senator to highlight a serious concern with regard \nto FEMA's subcontracting practices related to the Risk Mapping, \nAssessment, and Planning Program.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I welcome a colloquy with my distinguished colleague.\n  Mr. Menendez. I thank the Senator. I have constituents back in my \nhome State of New Jersey who have highlighted a concern with a current \nFEMA solicitation for their Risk Mapping, Assessment, and Planning \nProgram. I am concerned that this solicitation shuts out both small and \nmedium sized businesses. After Hurricane Katrina, FEMA was, rightly so, \ncriticized for issuing sole-source contracts to three very large \ncompanies. We need to be sure this pattern is not repeating itself.\n  I agree that updating the Nation's flood map is critical to managing \nand reducing the Nation's flood risk, but operating the program to \nbenefit taxpayers by utilizing local, highly qualified businesses, I am \nsure, will produce the best results for the region, the State, and the \ncountry as well.\n  In addition, I believe that taking local companies, with over a \ndecade of experience and a track record of success, out of regional \nIndefinite Quantity and Indefinite Delivery contract work is \ncounterproductive and has the potential to cost the taxpayers more \nmoney while providing an inferior product.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Senator from New Jersey for highlighting \nthis issue. I agree that the flood-map program is an instrumental tool \nin reducing the loss of life and property from floods. The Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee will work with the Senator to review the recent \ncontract solicitation. I am committed to ensuring that DHS invests \nacquisition dollars in projects that are well planned, competitively \nawarded, well managed, closely overseen, and best able to serve local \nneeds.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I appreciate the Senator's comments on that. This is \nnot just about the State of New Jersey, which has had a number of \nflooding problems in the past, but this is an important concern of \nfairness to address the issue of flooding across the country as well. I \nthank the Senator for her interest and willingness to work with me on \nthis issue.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to say a few words about the \nfiscal year 2010 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  First, let me thank my colleagues who have worked to develop this \nlegislation, especially Senators Byrd and Voinovich, the chairman and \nranking member, respectively, of the Appropriations subcommittee on \nHomeland Security. I also thank Senators Inouye and Cochran, the \nchairman and ranking member of the full Appropriations Committee. \nFinally, thanks also to Senator Murray for her skilled management of \nthe appropriations bill in Senator Byrd's absence.\n  The bill before us is a fair, carefully balanced, and well-considered \nspending plan for the Department of Homeland Security. The resources \nprovided in the bill are sufficient to carry out the Department's core \nmissions of protecting the homeland against the threat of terrorism, \nsecuring our borders, enforcing our immigration laws, and preparing for \nand responding to terrorist attacks and natural disasters. While there \nare many programs and activities at DHS deserving of funding above the \nlevel provided in this bill, we are in a time of serious economic \nchallenge, and obviously tough choices had to be and were--made in \nputting this legislation together.\n  This bill reflects the priorities of a department that has made great \nstrides in the last 6 years but still faces many hurdles before we can \nsay it has fulfilled the mission Congress laid out for it in 2002. \nSenator Collins and I have worked together since DHS was created--\nalternating as chairman and ranking member of the primary authorizing \ncommittee for the Department--to strengthen the Department's ability to \ncarry out its many national security missions, to strengthen its \nmanagement, facilitate its integration, and to hold its leadership \naccountable to an American public that has a right to be safe and \nsecure within the borders of our own nation.\n  In May, I wrote to Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Voinovich setting \nforth what I believed to be the most significant appropriations \npriorities for the Department, and I am grateful that a number of my \nrecommendations have been incorporated into this bill. Let me briefly \ndiscuss a few sections of this bill that I believe are particularly \nimportant to our homeland security.\n  First, I am pleased the Appropriations Committee recognized that the \nDepartment's management and operations accounts need adequate funding \nif DHS is to succeed as it must. Secretary Napolitano has emphasized \nthe need to create ``One DHS'' where the Department's many components \nare working closely together. To accomplish this, the offices for \npolicy, human capital, acquisition, and information technology need \nadditional resources, and all received significant increases in their \nbudgets. The additional investments in acquisition oversight is \nparticularly gratifying, as it will improve the Department's ability to \noversee the $12 billion it spends each year on contracts with the \nprivate sector to better ensure our tax dollars are not wasted on \nbloated or ineffective programs.\n  In previous years, these management and operations accounts have \noften been used as offsets for amendments. I would urge my colleagues \nto refrain from offering amendments that would take away funds from \nmanagement and operations; these funds are critical to the success of \nthe entire Department.\n  Second, this bill, together with the funding provided in the fiscal \nyear 2009 supplemental, significantly increases resources for combating \nviolence on our southern border and includes the bulk of the $500 \nmillion in border security funding Senator Collins and I successfully \nadded to the Senate budget resolution in March. The FBI has said that \nthe Mexican drug cartels are the No. 1 organized crime threat in \nAmerica today, replacing the Mafia, and now DHS will be able to send \nover 500 additional law enforcement officers to ports of entry. Almost \nhalf will help conduct southbound inspections to interdict the illegal \nflow of cash and guns into Mexico that is fueling the cartel-driven \nviolence.\n  The funding will also add hundreds of ICE investigators to work on \ndrug, currency, and firearms cases in the border region and will expand \nthe Border Enforcement Security Task Force fusion centers that ICE has \nestablished along the southwest border. This funding was badly needed \nto help Federal, State, and local law enforcement agencies take down \nthese sophisticated and dangerous drug-and-human smuggling networks. \nThe Mexican drug cartels represent a clear and present threat to \nhomeland security, and I remain fully committed to working with the \nadministration to support our Federal law enforcement agencies in this \ncrucial fight.\n  Third, this bill continues funding for the Homeland Security Grant \nPrograms that our first responders need to prepare for acts of \nterrorism and natural disasters at the State, local, and tribal levels. \nFunding for the State Homeland Security Grant Program, which provides \nbasic preparedness funds to all States and is the largest of DHS's \ngrant programs, remains steady from last year at $950 million, \nincluding $60 million for grants focused on border security, \nessentially the full level authorized by Congress in the implementing \nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007. Funds for Urban \nArea Security Initiative, UASI, grants, which provide resources to the\n\n[[Page S7311]]\n\nNation's highest risk metropolitan areas, are increased by nearly $50 \nmillion over last year.\n  I am also pleased that funding for SAFER grants , which assist local \nfire departments with the cost of hiring new firefighters, was doubled \nto $420 million for fiscal year 2010. In this era of budget \nconstraints, this funding will help ensure that communities are able to \ncontinue to staff their local fire houses. The Appropriations Committee \nhas also wisely restored a significant portion of the funding cut from \nthe President's budget for assistance to firefighter grants. These \ngrants fund essential equipment, vehicles and training for \nfirefighters. However, the $380 million for these grants represents a \ncut of nearly one-third below the fiscal year 2009 appropriation.\n  Fourth, this bill wisely supports the administration's request for a \nsignificant increase in funding for cybersecurity at DHS, which has \nbeen identified as one of our top national security priorities. The \nDepartment needs resources to protect Federal civilian networks from \ncyber-related threats and to work with the private sector to protect \ntheir networks and infrastructures. The Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee is currently working to develop \nlegislation that strengthens the government's authorities with respect \nto cybersecurity, so this funding decision is particularly important.\n  This bill makes other essential homeland security investments in port \nsecurity, transit security, science and technology, and biosecurity, \nall of which are critical to the overall security of the Nation.\n  I am concerned that the bill cuts funding for FEMA's main operating \naccount, making it difficult for FEMA to continue implementing the \ncritical improvements necessary for it to become, nearly 4 years after \nHurricane Katrina, the ``new FEMA.''\n  Also, insufficient funding has been appropriated for the Secret \nService to make necessary improvements to its information technology \nsystems, and, in particular, to complete essential work to allow secure \ncommunications between the Secret Service's White House detail and its \nfield office.\n  Despite these particular concerns, however, I believe that overall \nthis is a strong and essential piece of legislation. I thank the \nleadership and the members of the Appropriations Committee for their \nwork on this bill and strongly urge my colleagues to support its \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this has been a long day, but I appreciate \neveryone's cooperation. It has taken a long time to get to where we \nare. We set out this week to accomplish a few things, and with the \ncooperation of the Members, we have been able to do it. We don't have \nto vote tomorrow; we don't have to vote over the weekend. Our first \nvote next week will be at 5:30 p.m. on the nomination of the Census \nDirector, Mr. Groves. That is on cloture with Mr. Groves.\n  We are coming in at 10 a.m. tomorrow, but there will be no votes. \nMonday, we will be in at 11 a.m. Senators Levin and McCain will begin \nmanaging the Defense Authorization bill, and we appreciate being able \nto start that. There are a lot of very big, important amendments on \nthat bill.\n  Next week is the only disjointed week of this work period. As I \nindicated earlier, we will have no votes after 2 p.m. on Tuesday, and \nFriday has been long announced as a no-vote day, which means the \nfollowing 3 weeks are going to be very grueling, and everyone should \nunderstand that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are now moving to final passage on the \nHomeland Security Appropriations bill. I thank all our Senators, \nespecially Senator Voinovich, for his cooperation. I want to thank all \nour staff members, and I will submit their names for the Record. I \nthank everyone for helping us move this bill forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would be remiss if I didn't thank, \nfirst of all, the chairman of our subcommittee, Robert Byrd, for the \ncooperation he has shown me and his staff. I particularly thank Senator \nMurray. I think this is my first opportunity to do one of these bills \non the floor of the Senate, and it has been an interesting experience \nfor me.\n  I also particularly thank Chuck for his work, and my great staff \nhere, because without them, we wouldn't have been able to get this job \ndone. I thank all of you for your cooperation in making this all \nhappen.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the substitute amendment, as amended, is \nagreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1373), as amended, was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on the engrossment of the \namendment and third reading of the bill.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed, and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The bill having been read the third time, the \nquestion is, Shall the bill as amended, pass?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, just before we left for the Fourth of July \nwork period, U.S. diplomats hosted a forum in Washington to bring \ntogether representatives from 33 countries, a host of nongovernmental \norganizations, and others interested in Sudan. The purpose of the \ngathering was to reiterate their support for Sudan's 2005 Comprehensive \nPeace Agreement, CPA, and to develop an effective way forward on Sudan. \nDuring the forum, leaders from Sudan's southern region and the Khartoum \nGovernment agreed to a joint communique highlighting ``the importance \nof credible, peaceful and transparent nationwide elections'' in 2010 \nand to holding a referendum on the south's secession in 2011.\n  While this appears to be a positive step on north-south relations, \nlike many of my colleagues, I remain deeply concerned about the \nsituation in the south and about the policies of Sudanese President \nOmar Bashir in the Darfur region--policies that have led to the murder \nof hundreds of thousands of innocent people. So while I appreciate the \nsignificance of the communique I remain skeptical of the Khartoum \nGovernment's commitment to the north-south peace process, and to fair \nelections, and hope the Obama administration will maintain pressure on \nthe government of President Bashir and hold that government accountable \nfor a change in direction and real results. Following up on this event, \nI wish to discuss the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act of 2007 \nand to update my colleagues on its recent implementation.\n  In October of 2007, after months of consulting with interested \nstakeholders, I was joined by Ranking Member Shelby in introducing a \nbill that empowered our country's State and local governments to divest \nfrom companies with business operations in Sudan. My colleagues, \nparticularly Senators Durbin and Brownback, and I were very concerned \nabout the ongoing violence in Sudan, especially in the southern and \nwestern regions such as Darfur where the Sudanese Government arms the \nmilitias which have ravaged communities and killed many innocent \npeople. The international community has condemned President Omar Bashir \nfor his role in authorizing this genocide, and he has been indicted by \nthe International Criminal Court for these crimes. Given the \ndevelopments in Sudan and a worsening situation there, we thought it \nwas imperative that we help strengthen the growing movement in the \nUnited States of those interested in divesting from Sudanese businesses \nwhose presence serves to bolster and support Sudan's Government, \nenabling its security forces, and those militias responsible to them, \nto continue to commit these atrocities.\n  By the time this bill was brought to the floor, 20 U.S. States had \ninitiated some form of divestment from Sudanese firms, and divestment \ncampaigns were underway in many other States. However, a Federal \ndistrict court in Illinois had held the State's divestment law \nunconstitutional and permanently enjoined its enforcement. The Sudan \nAccountability and Divestment Act was written partly in response to \nthese complications and designed to provide States and local \ngovernments, as well as businesses and investors, the authority and \nlegal framework to proceed with divestment. The Senate passed the bill \nby unanimous consent, the House took it up and adopted it several days \nlater, and the President signed it into law on December 31, 2007.\n  The law was deliberate in targeting four specific economic sectors \nwidely recognized as key sources of revenue for the Sudanese \nGovernment: oil, power production, minerals, and military equipment. \nAccording to one former Sudanese Finance Minister, 70 percent of the \nKhartoum Government's share of oil profits was spent on military \nequipment used to bolster militias like the janjaweed.\n  According to the Sudan Divestment Task Force, since the enactment of \nour legislation, five more States have passed divestment laws targeting \nSudan, with many State and local retirement funds divesting hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in assets. Four States have prohibited contracting \nwith corporations that provide support to the Sudanese Government, \ndemonstrating broad-based support for the divestment movement.\n  The law also serves to enable acts of conscience in the private \nsector, allowing businesses and investors the right to divest from \nSudan-related assets without violating their normal fiduciary \nresponsibilities. The number of universities, companies, and investment \nfunds, as well as international and religious organizations, engaged in \ndivestment is growing. For example, shareholders of Vanguard and \nFidelity funds and pensioners from TIAA-CREF recently assembled to ask \ntheir managers to withdraw investments from Sudan.\n  Finally, the act requires Federal Government contractors to certify \nthat they are not conducting business operations in Sudan that bolster \nthe Sudanese Government's capabilities. This provision was meant to \nensure that U.S. taxpayers' money is not aiding, even indirectly, a \nregime that systematically murders its own population. Even so, some \ncritics have suggested that the law's implementation at the Federal \nlevel has come up short, particularly regarding limits on U.S. \nGovernment procurement. It is critical that the U.S. Government \nenforces a fair and appropriate certification process on companies that \nare conducting certain business sanctionable under the act. \nAdditionally, updated information must be maintained by relevant \ncontracting agencies. Such a process requires a concerted, interagency \neffort, not an ad hoc approach. Some work remains to be done to \ncoordinate such a policy. I have been in contact with various Federal \nagencies to address these concerns and will continue to work with them \nto get this right.\n  Meanwhile, various nonprofit organizations such as the U.S.-based \nGenocide Intervention Network and its newly initiated Conflict Risk \nNetwork are providing innovative solutions to investors who feel \nmotivated to divest out of moral and prudential obligations. Thanks to \nsuch efforts, investors can make well-informed assessments of Sudan's \nconflict zones and understand the political and reputational risks \nassociated with investments in Sudan. Moreover, States and local \ngovernments now have more credible information on which to base their \ndivestment decisions. Save Darfur, another nonprofit organization, \ncontinues to educate millions of people around the world about the \nongoing atrocities in Sudan and provides activists with effective tools \nand resources. Others are following suit.\n  In the end, these efforts are being made to maintain pressure on the \nSudanese Government and to effect positive change there. But much work \nremains to be done. Actions, not words, must be the true test of \nprogress there.\n  As State and local governments, businesses, and private investors \ncontinue to press the government in Khartoum through their divestment \nefforts, they should be applauded. But we must maintain the pressure \nand closely monitor the situation. And the Obama administration must \nstay actively and assertively involved. The President understands this, \nand I am pleased that he has appointed a new special envoy to Sudan, \nretired general Jonathan Scott Gration, to coordinate U.S. policy on \nSudan. I look forward to working with him on these important issues. I \nhope that the many ways the international community is seeking to\n\n[[Page S7313]]\n\npress the Sudanese Government for real change, and the many ways our \ngovernment is joining that effort--including by tough and thoroughgoing \nimplementation of the Sudan Accountability and Divestment Act--will \nbegin to bring critical change to this troubled region and to its \nsuffering people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7313-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                Senior Chief Petty Officer Daniel Healy\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, it is my honor to rise today in special \ntribute to SCPO Daniel Healy of Exeter, NH. I am proud to recognize the \ndedication ceremony of the ``SCPO Daniel Healy USN SEAL'' Memorial \nMonument and Bridge in honor of his courageous service to the United \nStates of America.\n  On June 28, 2005, Daniel lost his life when his helicopter was shot \ndown during a rescue mission to save the lives of fellow soldiers in \nKunar Province, Afghanistan. For his fearlessness under fire, Senior \nChief Petty Officer Healy was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star with \nCombat ``V'' for Valor, the Purple Heart, and the Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal. In recognition of outstanding performance throughout his \nmilitary career, Daniel was awarded the Navy and Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal, the Joint Meritorious Unit Award, the Meritorious \nUnit Commendation, the National Defense Service Medal, and the Good \nConduct Medal.\n  On Sunday, July 19, 2009, the town of Exeter, NH, will honor Daniel \nby renaming the Guinea Road Bridge and Exeter Town Pool, in remembrance \nof his life and service. Although we can never truly do enough to honor \nhis sacrifice, this bridge and monument will stand as a lasting \ntestament to a dedicated individual that selflessly paid the ultimate \nsacrifice in support of his brothers in arms.\n  This dedication speaks volumes about Daniel's character. At a time \nwhen we have two wars ongoing, it is an extraordinary reminder of the \nkind of person who serves this country and commits him or herself to \nthe protection of others, even until death. I am sure that Daniel would \nbe the first to say that although this bridge and pool will bear his \nname, the honor truly belongs to everyone who proudly wears the uniform \nof our great Nation.\n  Daniel's kind and determined attitude will always be remembered by \nthose who knew him and it is with the utmost respect that we remember \nhis life with this entry into the official Congressional Record. On \nbehalf of my wife Kathy, and myself, I want to express our deep \ngratitude and respect for a father, husband, son, brother, and true \nAmerican hero. With this, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking \nDaniel's family for his service to the Nation and his devotion to our \nfreedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7313-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           INDIA AND HONDURAS\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I would like to address America's \npolicies toward two nations. Each of these nations has strong \ndemocratic institutions. Each of these nations is a key trading partner \nof the United States. And each of these nations offers even more \npotential for cooperation in the future--if the administration makes \nthe right choices going forward. These two nations are India and \nHonduras.\n  First, I would like to discuss America's relationship with India. \nIndia is the world's largest democracy--and one of the world's largest \nand most dynamic economies. During this decade, India and the United \nStates have cooperated more closely than ever before. America is now \nIndia's largest trading and investment partner. Last year Congress \nauthorized a new era in civil nuclear cooperation between our two \ncountries--which I was proud to support. India has joined the United \nStates and many nations in supporting the people of Afghanistan. India \nhas committed more than $1.2 billion to reconstruction efforts there. \nOur nations work closely together to fight terrorists--especially since \nthe devastating attacks in Mumbai last year. And since 2004, India and \nthe United States have built a strategic partnership--based on our \ncommon values--and committed to expanding opportunities in education, \nenergy, and beyond.\n  As cochairman of the Senate's India Caucus, I strongly support closer \nties with our strategic partner in South Asia. Yesterday, several of my \ncolleagues and I had breakfast with Secretary Clinton at the State \nDepartment. I am pleased that she sees India as a top priority for our \nNation's diplomatic engagement. I appreciate her determination to \nstrengthen our strategic partnership with India in security, trade, and \nmany other issues. I wished her well in her visit to India in the \ncoming weeks.\n  I also took the opportunity to bend the Secretary's ear on the \nsubject of Honduras. Honduras and the United States have been good \nfriends and neighbors for many years. We are trade partners through the \nCentral American Free Trade Agreement. Our two peoples cherish our \nindependence and liberty--and have helped others claim their freedom. \nHonduras joined the United States as one of the first contributors to \nOperation Iraqi Freedom. Most of all, the people of Honduras and the \nUnited States respect the democratic institutions we have built--and we \nhonor the rule of law.\n  Honoring the rule of law means that no one is above the law--\nincluding the President. In Honduras, the President is limited to a \nsingle term in office. Their Constitution--like the U.S. Constitution--\nplaces strict limits on the executive power. These limits are important \nto the Honduran people because of the history of authoritarian rule in \ntheir country--including periods of military dictatorship.\n  Unfortunately, President Zelaya was not happy with the limits to his \npower--so he tried to get the Constitution changed. First he tried to \ndo so legally. Then he tried to do so illegally. Eventually he tried to \norder the military to help him get his way. In short, President Zelaya \nsaw himself as the Honduran Hugo Chavez. And he has relied on Chavez's \npolitical and material support--including Venezuelan-owned media--in \nhis quest for more power.\n  President Zelaya's attempts to subvert the Constitution became too \nmuch for the people of Honduras. It was too much for their supreme \ncourt, for their Congress, and for their military--all of whom agreed \nthat President Zelaya had acted way beyond the powers of his office. So \nthe other branches of government acted and removed Mel Zelaya from \noffice on June 28.\n  I met with representatives of the Honduran people yesterday. They \nincluded two former Presidents of Honduras, several Honduran \nCongressmen, and two leaders who helped draft their Constitution in \n1982. They all agreed that the legislative and judicial branches of \ngovernment acted properly. They acted justly. They acted \nconstitutionally. I believe the United States should stand with the \nHonduran people and with the Constitution they wrote.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration has loudly taken the wrong \nview on Honduras. From day one, the White House and the State \nDepartment have issued strong statements in defense of Mel Zelaya and \noffered no support to all the other constitutional officers in \nHonduras.\n  Just this week in Moscow, President Obama again called for the return \nof Mel Zelaya to power--just as Hugo Chavez, Raul Castro, and Daniel \nOrtega are doing.\n  The United States should not be standing with the dictators and \ndemagogues of our region--we should be standing with the people of \nHonduras and all who wish to live in freedom and under the rule of law.\n  So I told Secretary Clinton yesterday that she should rethink the \nadministration's approach to Honduras. I said I shared her hope that \nmediation by President Arias of Costa Rica would be successful. Yet I \nalso made clear that America's priority should be to nurture freedom \nand support the rule of law and not excuse or enable the ambitions of \ntyrants.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7313-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7313-S7314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          25TH ANNIVERSARY OF MINOR LEAGUE BASEBALL IN VERMONT\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I rise today to commemorate the 25th \nanniversary of the return of professional baseball to Burlington, VT.\n  I recall that moment 25 years ago with great clarity, as it occurred \nwhen I was mayor of the city of Burlington. After a series of lengthy, \nbut eventually productive, negotiations with the Eastern League and the \nowner of one of its teams, my administration with the\n\n[[Page S7314]]\n\nhelp of some local and very dedicated baseball buffs--was successful in \nbringing the Vermont Reds to Burlington. This AA-league team thrilled \nbaseball fans--young and old, who watched them play at Centennial \nField, which boasts a grandstand that is the oldest complete grandstand \nstructure in use in Minor League Baseball. We watched Barry Larkin, \nJeff Montgomery, Rob Dibble, Chris Sabo, Paul O'Neill and Norm Charlton \nplay for the Vermont Reds. These fine athletes later went on to become \nthe core of the 1990 World Champion Cincinnati Reds. Larkin won the \nNational League MVP Award in 1995 and O'Neill won four more World \nSeries rings with the New York Yankees. The Reds eventually left, to be \nreplaced by the Vermont Mariners, and Vermont spectators had the thrill \nof watching certain Hall-of-Famer Ken Griffey Jr. speed around the \nbases as he played for our new team.\n  When the Mariners left, the Single-A Expos took their place; when \nMontreal's franchise moved to Washington, the Expos became a Washington \nNationals farm team and were renamed the Vermont Lake Monsters. Today, \nthe Lake Monsters fill the stands during the summer months, as baseball \nfans come to watch America's pastime in picturesque surroundings.\n  It is worth celebrating this quarter-century of baseball in \nBurlington, as Centennial Field has been called home by some \noutstanding players and amazing Minor League teams. Apart from those I \nhave already mentioned--many of our players continued their careers in \nthe Big Show. The scenic setting, the welcoming stands, the fan-based \npromotions, and of course the thrill of professional baseball all \ncombine to make this a great family-friendly arena. Throughout the \nyears, more than 2 million fans have enjoyed rooting for the home team.\n  As mayor of Burlington, my work was centered on building civic life \nand creating a vital community. Baseball proved to be an excellent \ncatalyst for bringing people together and helping to foster a greater \nsense of community. Perhaps Minor League Baseball would be taken for \ngranted in a big State or a big city, but in Burlington, VT, it is \ncherished by many. It is a source of pride to me that, working with a \ncitizens committee led by local businessmen, I was able to bring Minor \nLeague Baseball to Vermont and that it has continued to thrive in the \nquarter of a century since.\n  As we look for a new dawn in this time of economic difficulty, the \npast 25 years of professional baseball in Burlington are a shining \nexample of how important community-based activities are, and how much \nthey can enrich a city and a State.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7314-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                125TH ANNIVERSARY OF WHITE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ncommunity of White, SD, on reaching the 125th anniversary of its \nfounding.\n  White was founded in 1884 as a railroad town and named after the \noriginal owner of the townsite, W. H. White. The community has a \nstrong, patriotic history, beginning with many original settlers who \nhad served in the Civil War. During World War I, a Red Cross chapter \nwas formed, and children sold Liberty Bonds. World War II saw scrap \ndrives in the town to collect any useful materials for the war effort.\n  The White Area Historical Society, founded in 1983, owns the Afton \nTownship No. 15 Schoolhouse, a log cabin from Oak Lake Township now on \nthe museum site, and the museum itself, which is the former Methodist \nChurch. It carries on the colorful stories of White for the future \ngenerations to reflect on their heritage and strong history.\n  The citizens of White will be celebrating the town's anniversary \nduring the annual White Pioneer Days with a parade, chili cookoff, arm-\nwrestling tournament, and entertainment for all ages. I am proud to \njoin with the community members of White in celebrating the last 125 \nyears and look forward to a promising future. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7314-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7314-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7314-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:48 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1275.

A joint resolution adopted by the General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee urging Congress to extend the \n     deadlines for all phases of the States' implementation of the \n     REAL ID Act for at least an additional 2 years, or \n     preferably, repeal the REAL ID Act of 2005 in its entirety; \n     to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                     House Joint Resolution No. 285\n\n       Whereas, the federal REAL ID Act of 2005, Public Law 109-\n     12, creates a national identification card by mandating \n     federal standards for state driver's licenses and \n     identification cards and requires states to share their motor \n     vehicle databases; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act mandates the documents that states \n     must require to issue driver's licenses and requires states \n     to place uniform information on every driver's license in a \n     standard, machine-readable format; and\n       Whereas, the REAL ID Act requires the creation of a massive \n     public sector database containing information on every \n     American that is accessible to all motor vehicle employees \n     and law enforcement officers nationwide and that can be used \n     to gather and manage information on citizens; and\n       Whereas, in addition to being terrible public policy, the \n     REAL ID Act places a costly, unfunded mandate on states, with \n     initial estimates for Tennessee of more than one hundred \n     million dollars, plus the additional burden of millions of \n     taxpayers dollars in ongoing annual expenses, and a national \n     estimate of more than eleven billion dollars over the five \n     years following its implementation; and\n       Whereas, in these dire economic times, the massive costs \n     that will be incurred by Tennessee, and other states, in \n     implementing the REAL ID Act are especially onerous; and\n       Whereas, by December 1, 2014, Americans who are fifty (50) \n     years of age and younger will be required to present REAL ID-\n     compliant identification to board commercial aircraft and to \n     access certain federal facilities; by December 1, 2017, all \n     state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards must \n     be REAL ID-compliant; and\n       Whereas, the deadline for the initial implementation of the \n     REAL ID Act has already been extended for all fifty (50) \n     states from May 11, 2008 until December 31, 2009: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the House of Representatives of the One Hundred \n     Sixth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee, the Senate \n     Concurring, That in light of the recessionary nature of our \n     economy at this time and the many budgetary hardships being \n     faced by state governments, this General Assembly hereby \n     memorializes the United States Congress to extend the \n     deadlines for all phases of the states' implementation of the \n     REAL ID Act for at least an additional two (2) years, or \n     preferably, repeal the REAL ID Act of 2005 in its entirety. \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That we strongly urge and encourage each member \n     of Tennessee's delegation to the U.S. Congress to exert the \n     full measure of his or her influence to accomplish the \n     actions delineated in the first resolving clause. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker and the Clerk of the United States \n     House of Representatives, the President and the Secretary of \n     the United States Senate, and each member of Tennessee's \n     Congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-54. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging Congress to take actions as are necessary to \n     create a national catastrophe fund; to the Committee on \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 86\n\n       Whereas, the hurricane seasons of 2004, 2005, and 2008 were \n     startling reminders of both the human and economic \n     devastation that hurricanes, flooding, and other natural \n     disasters can cause; and\n       Whereas, creation of a federal catastrophe fund is a \n     comprehensive, integrated approach to help better prepare and \n     protect the nation from natural catastrophes, such as \n     hurricanes, tornadoes, wildfires, snowstorms, and \n     earthquakes; and\n       Whereas, the current system of responses to catastrophes \n     leaves many people and businesses at risk of being unable to \n     replace what they lost, wastes tax dollars, increases \n     insurance premiums, and leads to shortages of insurance \n     needed to sustain our economy; and\n       Whereas, creation of a federal catastrophe fund would help \n     stabilize insurance markets following a catastrophe and help \n     stabilize insurance costs for consumers while making it \n     possible for private insurance to be written in catastrophe-\n     prone areas; and\n       Whereas, a portion of the premium collected by insurance \n     companies could be deposited into such a fund which could be \n     administered by the United States Treasury and grow tax free; \n     and\n\n[[Page S7316]]\n\n       Whereas, a portion of the interest earnings of the fund \n     could be dedicated to emergency responder efforts and public \n     education and mitigation programs; and\n       Whereas, the federal catastrophe fund would operate as a \n     ``backstop'' and could only be accessed when private insurers \n     and state catastrophe funds have paid losses in excess of a \n     defined threshold; and\n       Whereas, utilizing the capacity of the federal government \n     would help smooth fluctuations which consumers currently \n     experience in insurance prices and availability because of \n     exposure to large catastrophic losses and would provide \n     better protection at a lower price; and\n       Whereas, when there is a gap between the insurance \n     protection consumers buy and the damage caused by a \n     catastrophe, taxpayers across the country pay much of the \n     difference, as congressional appropriations of billions for \n     the after-the-fact disaster relief in the aftermath of \n     Hurricane Katrina demonstrated; and\n       Whereas, on November 8, 2007, the United States House of \n     Representatives passed the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007 \n     (H.R. 3355) that would help ensure that individuals and \n     communities destroyed by natural catastrophes have the \n     resources necessary to repair, rebuild, and recover in the \n     aftermath of massive hurricanes, earthquakes, or other \n     natural events; and\n       Whereas, the Homeowners' Defense Act of 2007 was sponsored \n     by Florida Representatives Ron Klein, Tim Mahoney, and Ginny \n     Brown-Waite and nearly four dozen cosponsors from around the \n     country including then Congressman Bobby Jindal, now governor \n     of the state of Louisiana; and\n       Whereas, President Barack Obama and members of both \n     political parties have expressed support for a national \n     catastrophe fund. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to take actions as are \n     necessary to create a national catastrophe fund. Be it \n     further\n       Resolved That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-55. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging Congress to address the issue of global \n     climate change through the adoption of a fair and effective \n     approach that safeguards American jobs, ensures affordable \n     energy for citizens, and maintains America's global \n     competitiveness; to the Committee on Environment and Public \n     Works.\n       Whereas, there is some scientific belief that greenhouse \n     gases could impact the atmosphere; and\n       Whereas, the greenhouse gas emissions of developing \n     countries are rising more rapidly than the emissions of the \n     United States and have surpassed the greenhouse gas emissions \n     of the United States and other developed countries; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana accounts for only 0.48 \n     percent of total global greenhouse gas emissions; and\n       Whereas, any system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \n     must not eliminate American jobs or diminish the ability of \n     American industry to compete in the global marketplace; and\n       Whereas, any system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \n     must not add to the already high costs of power and gasoline; \n     and\n       Whereas, any system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \n     must reward, and not punish, early adopters of energy \n     efficient technologies and practice; and\n       Whereas, any system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \n     must adopt an international component to prevent ``emissions \n     leakage'' and ensure that emissions do not simply migrate to \n     another nation; and\n       Whereas, the only manner to quantify these emissions is \n     through a domestic and international greenhouse gas emissions \n     registry that is uniform, transparent, and verifiable; and\n       Whereas, any system to regulate greenhouse gases must \n     ensure that the adopted regime does not result in the off-\n     shoring of international trade sensitive industries; and\n       Whereas, the state of Louisiana has lost over thirty \n     thousand one hundred manufacturing jobs since 1998, which is \n     a sixteen percent decrease; and\n       Whereas, any system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \n     must ensure the availability of sufficient and affordable \n     energy, including clean energy, before restricting emissions \n     in a manner that could reduce the volume of energy available \n     to consumers; and\n       Whereas, any system to regulate greenhouse gas emissions \n     must provide credits or allowances to support operations, \n     such as recycling and other practices, that reduce greenhouse \n     gas emissions; and\n       Whereas, any action taken by Congress should be structured \n     to:\n       (1) Promote American jobs;\n       (2) Save American citizens and industry from higher energy \n     prices;\n       (3) Reward early adopters of efficient practices and \n     technologies;\n       (4) Prevent ``emissions leakage''; and\n       (5) Champion the global competitiveness of American \n     industry. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to address the \n     issue of global climate change through the adoption of a fair \n     and effective approach that safeguards American jobs, ensures \n     affordable energy for citizens, and maintains America's \n     global competitiveness. Be it further\n       Resolved That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-56. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to enact legislation \n     to prohibit fetal torture and dismemberment; to the Committee \n     on the Judiciary.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 101\n\n       Whereas, the United States has ratified the United Nations \n     Convention Against Torture, and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or \n     Degrading Treatment or Punishment which recognizes that equal \n     and inalienable rights are afforded to all members of the \n     human family, and are derived from the inherent dignity of \n     the human person; and\n       Whereas, the United Nations Convention Against Torture, and \n     Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment \n     defines torture as any act causing severe pain or suffering, \n     whether physical or mental; and\n       Whereas, Article 5 of the Universal Declaration of Human \n     Rights and Article 7 of the International Covenant on Civil \n     and Political Rights, provide that no one may be subjected to \n     torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or \n     punishment; and\n       Whereas, the Declaration of Independence of the United \n     States of America affirms, ``We hold these truths to be self-\n     evident, that all men are created equal, that they are \n     endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, \n     that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of \n     Happiness.--That to secure these rights, Governments are \n     instituted among Men, deriving their just power from the \n     consent of the governed . . . ''; and\n       Whereas, Amendment No. 5 to the Constitution of the United \n     States provides that no person shall be `` . . . deprived of \n     life, liberty, or property, without due process of law . . . \n     ''; and\n       Whereas, Amendment No. 8 of the federal constitution \n     prohibits the infliction of `` . . . cruel and unusual \n     punishments . . . ''; and\n       Whereas, President Obama has issued executive orders to \n     close secret prisons operated by the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and shut down the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and \n     he has declared that the United States will not use torture \n     in pursuit of intelligence, announcing, ``We must leave these \n     methods where they belong--in the past. They are not who we \n     are. They are not America.''; and\n       Whereas, in President Barack Obama's speech on detainee \n     policy and national security at the National Archives Museum, \n     he stated, ``I can stand here today, as President of the \n     United States, and say without exception or equivocation that \n     we do not torture. . . . And if we cannot stand for those \n     core values, then we are not keeping faith with the documents \n     that are enshrined in this hall''; and\n       Whereas, President Obama has acknowledged that in our world \n     ``the strong too often dominate the weak'' and ``find all \n     manner of justification'' for injustice and he has talked \n     about health policies grounded ``not only in sound science'' \n     but in ``clear ethics'' as well; and\n       Whereas, the Partial Birth Abortion Act of 2003 does not \n     outlaw the fetal dismemberment procedure to terminate a \n     pregnancy, which causes similar pain and suffering to the \n     fetus, allowing for torture and dismemberment; and\n       Whereas, at least by twenty weeks after fertilization, an \n     unborn child has the physical structures necessary to \n     experience pain; and\n       Whereas, there is substantial evidence that by twenty weeks \n     after fertilization, unborn children draw away from certain \n     stimuli in a manner which in an infant or an adult would be \n     interpreted as a response to pain; and\n       Whereas, expert testimony confirms that by twenty weeks \n     after fertilization an unborn child may experience \n     substantial pain even if the woman herself has received local \n     analgesic or general anesthesia; and\n       Whereas, anesthesia is routinely administered to unborn \n     children who have developed twenty weeks or more after \n     fertilization who undergo prenatal surgery; and\n       Whereas, there is substantial evidence that the method to \n     terminate pregnancy most commonly used twenty weeks or more \n     after fertilization cause substantial pain to an unborn \n     child, whether by dismemberment, poisoning, penetrating or \n     crushing the skull, or other methods including, but are not \n     limited to, the dilation and evacuation (D and E) method \n     which is commonly performed in the second trimester of \n     pregnancy, in which the unborn child's body parts are grasped \n     with a long-toothed clamp, the fetal body parts are then torn \n     from the body and pulled out of the vaginal canal, the \n     remaining body parts are grasped and pulled out until only \n     the head remains, and the head is then grasped and crushed \n     in order to remove it from the vaginal canal; and\n       Whereas, partial-birth abortion is a termination of \n     pregnancy in which the practitioner delivers an unborn \n     child's body until only the head remains inside the womb, \n     punctures the back of the child's skull with a sharp \n     instrument, and sucks the child's brains out before \n     completing the delivery of\n\n[[Page S7317]]\n\n     the dead infant, and as further defined in federal law; and\n       Whereas, there is a valid federal government interest in \n     preventing or reducing the infliction of pain on sentient \n     creatures with examples being laws governing the use of \n     laboratory animals and requiring pain-free methods of \n     slaughtering livestock; and\n       Whereas, there is a valid federal government interest in \n     preventing harm to developing human life at all stages and \n     examples of this include regulations protecting fetal human \n     subjects from risks of ``harm or discomfort'' in federally \n     funded biomedical research. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes a \n     the Congress of the United States to enact legislation to \n     prohibit fetal torture and dismemberment. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-57. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to enact legislation \n     and appropriate monies in order to provide additional \n     homeland security funding for state maritime enforcement \n     agencies; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 82\n\n       Whereas, before, during and after the events of September \n     11, 2001, state maritime enforcement agencies have assisted \n     the United States Coast Guard in its maritime and port \n     homeland security mission; and\n       Whereas, some of the state maritime enforcement agencies \n     have entered into enforcement agreements with the United \n     States Coast Guard to support the security of our nation's \n     ports and waterways; and\n       Whereas, these enforcement agreements strengthen the close \n     interagency and working relationships between the state \n     maritime enforcement agencies and the United States Coast \n     Guard, and take a major step forward in the creation of a \n     seamless national maritime security blanket; and\n       Whereas, the supportive role that state maritime \n     enforcement agencies have performed and continue to perform \n     with the United States Coast Guard and other federal agencies \n     is currently funded solely by state monies; and\n       Whereas, federal legislation and appropriation that \n     provides additional homeland security funding for state \n     maritime enforcement agencies should allow such monies to be \n     used to pay for personnel overtime, use of existing \n     equipment, maintenance and replacement of equipment, fuel, \n     and training; and\n       Whereas, by adding to the current state-directed homeland \n     security program funding and allowing the United States Coast \n     Guard to administer a partnership program with state maritime \n     enforcement agencies, such additional homeland security \n     funding will help mitigate funding and security gas in \n     national maritime security; and\n       Whereas, despite the lack of financial support from the \n     federal government, state maritime enforcement agencies are \n     tasked with assignments outside of their core missions in \n     order to ensure the safety and security of the United States \n     of America. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to enact legislation and \n     appropriate monies in order to provide additional homeland \n     security funding for state maritime enforcement agencies. Be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives, to \n     each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress, to the secretary of the United States Department of \n     Homeland Security, to the commandant of the United States \n     Coast Guard, to the secretary of the Louisiana Department of \n     Wildlife and Fisheries, to Louisiana's state boating law \n     administrator, and to the president of the National \n     Association of State Boating Law Administrators.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/09/senate-section/article/S7317-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. INOUYE, from the Committee on Appropriations:\n       Special Report entitled ``Further Revised Allocation to \n     Subcommittees of Budget Totals from the Concurrent \n     Resolution, Fiscal Year 2010'' (Rept.

A bill to amend section 42 of title 18, United States Code, \nto prohibit the importation and shipment of certain species of carp; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Asian Carp \nPrevention and Control Act to list bighead carp as injurious under the \nLacey Act, along with Senators Voinovich, Schumer, Feingold, \nGillibrand, Durbin and Stabenow. \n  Asian carp are a significant threat to the Great Lakes because they \nare large, extremely prolific, and consume vast amounts of food. The \nBighead carp grow quickly and can grow to over 50 pounds. In addition \nto the harmful ecological impact that the Bighead carp has had to \nnative fisheries, these fish pose a considerable hazard to boaters and \ncan cause human and property injuries.\n  The Bighead carp compete with native fish for food and habitat. The \nBighead carp, along with the other species of Asian carp, account for \nthe majority of fish in the Missouri River. These fish have little \neconomic or sport value compared to native fish.\n  The Bighead carp are used in aquaculture ponds in the South to \ncontrol algae, and because of flooding in the 1990s, the fish escaped \nthe aquaculture ponds and entered into the Mississippi River. They have \nspread to most of the Mississippi River watershed and the Missouri \nRiver. Because the Mississippi River is connected to the Great Lakes \nthrough a man-made sanitary and ship canal, the Asian carp are now \nclose to invading the Great Lakes. Fortunately, the Corps of Engineers \nis operating an electric dispersal barrier to prevent the carp and \nother non-native fish from moving between the Mississippi River and the \nGreat Lakes.\n  I want to make sure that all pathways to introduce the Bighead carp \nare blocked. The legislation that I am introducing today would list the \nBighead carp as injurious under the Lacey Act. Listing the Bighead carp \nas injurious would minimize the risk of intentional introduction by \nprohibiting the importation and interstate transportation of live Asian \ncarp without a permit. This legislation would not interfere with \nexisting state regulations of the fish, and permits to transport or \npurchase live Bighead carp may be issued for research or educational \npurposes. The Fish and Wildlife Service has already listed three other \nspecies of Asian carp as injurious through rulemaking procedures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. This country is facing a \nserious challenge as a result of thousands of invasive species, like \nthe Bighead carp, being introduced into this Nation.\n\n[[Page S7320]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Webb, Mr. Dood, Ms. Murkowski, \n        Ms. Collins, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 1422. A bill to amend the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 to \nclarify the eligibility requirements with respect to airline flight \ncrews; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nfollowing colloquy be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 Flight Crew Technical Corrections Act\n\n       Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I would like to engage my friend, \n     the Senator from Washington and the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee on Employment and Workplace Safety, with whom I \n     have been pleased to work on many initiatives on behalf of \n     America's workforce, in a conversation about the bill she has \n     just introduced. I would like to take this opportunity to \n     clarify the treatment of workers contained in the Flight Crew \n     Technical Corrections Act before us today that pertains to \n     flight crews. Is it the Senator's understanding that her \n     legislation resolves a problem unique to flight crews--\n     meaning flight attendants and pilots--and that no other group \n     of workers is addressed under this bill?\n       Mrs. MURRAY. Yes, the Senator is correct. This bill is \n     narrowly constructed to address the unique situation faced by \n     flight attendants and pilots in the calculation of the hours \n     they need to qualify for leave under the Family Medical Leave \n     Act, FLMA. The FMLA eligibility calculation does not include \n     paid vacation, sick, medical or personal leave unless \n     otherwise agreed to in a collective bargaining agreement or \n     the employers manual. This bill reflects the intent of the \n     FMLA's original sponsors to provide an alternative way to \n     include flight crews that addresses the airline industry's \n     unique time-keeping methods. I am proud that the Flight Crew \n     Technical Corrections Act fixes a technical problem that has \n     left many full time flight crew members ineligible for Family \n     Medical Leave for many years due to the unique way their work \n     hours are calculated.\n       Mr. ENZI. In other words, is it the Senator's understanding \n     that the bill should not be construed to apply to other \n     occupational groups that operate under reserve systems such \n     as health care, railway, and emergency services to seek \n     similar treatment?\n       Mrs. MURRAY. Correct, this bill narrowly deals with flight \n     crews only. The bill is a technical correction for language \n     that was intended to be in the original Family Medical Leave \n     Act, but for some reason or another was left out. Flight \n     crews were specifically mentioned in the FLMA's legislative \n     history. Thus, I believe that the correction is clearly \n     appropriate for flight crews. If other groups were to attempt \n     an adjustment in their FMLA eligibility requirements, I \n     suggest that their situation and the ramifications of such an \n     adjustment would need to be examined on a case by case basis.\n       Mr. ENZI. The Senator mentions the FLMA's legislative \n     history. Is it the Senator's further understanding that this \n     is the only group of employees which was intended to be \n     included with an alternative eligibility standard?\n       Mrs. MURRAY. The Senator is correct. The original authors \n     stated that they did not intend to exclude flight crews in \n     unique circumstances from the bill's protection simply \n     because of the airline industry's ``unusual time keeping \n     methods''. They believed that these workers--flight \n     attendants and pilots--were entitled to family and medical \n     leave under the law based upon the situation they \n     specifically faced.\n       This legislation received overwhelming bipartisan support \n     in the House of Representatives. I am pleased to present it \n     in the Senate with bipartisan support. This language was \n     drafted through a process that included representatives from \n     large and small airline carriers and carrier associations, \n     and organized labor. I need to recognize the work that \n     Senator Clinton did on this bill when she introduced its \n     precursor in the 110th Congress.\n       Mr. ENZI. I would like to thank the Senator from Washington \n     and the former Senator from New York for the deliberative \n     process you both utilized while drafting this legislation. As \n     you know I am a frequent advocate for following Senate \n     Committee process so as to create the opportunity for all \n     affected stakeholders to be included in the process. In this \n     case, you have done an admirable job of vetting the \n     legislation with most stakeholders and produced a better \n     product.\n       Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     the text of the bill be printed in the Record.\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1422\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nrequire coverage under the Medicaid Program for freestanding birth \ncenter services; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Medicaid \nBirth Center Reimbursement Act, which would help ensure that birth \ncenters across our country can continue to provide quality and \naffordable care to thousands of mothers and newborns each year.\n  There are almost 200 birth centers nationwide that provide quality \nand cost effective health care services, particularly for low-income \nfamilies. Since 1987, birth centers have participated in Medicaid, but \nrecently the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, has begun \nto cut off access to these providers in several States including \nAlaska, South Carolina, Texas and Washington State--because the agency \nlacks clear statutory authority to pay birth centers to care for \nMedicaid patients.\n  Although this problem has not yet affected my home State of \nCalifornia, if this policy is not reversed before the State begins to \nrenegotiate its Medicaid plan, the same cuts will be forced on birth \ncenters in California. Without reimbursement from Medicaid, birth \ncenters in all States could be pushed to the brink of closure and \nthousands of low-income women could lose access to these vital \nservices.\n  At a time when Congress and the administration are working hard to \nincrease access to health care for all Americans, we cannot afford to \nclose birth centers that provide essential services to thousands of \nwomen and newborns every year.\n  At a time when Congress and the administration are working hard to \nreduce waste, and cut down on costs in our nation's health care system, \nwe cannot afford to cut off access to such cost-effective maternity \ncare.\n  The cost of care at birth centers is about $1,900 per birth, compared \nto an estimated $7,400 at hospitals. Right now as much as 27 percent of \nhospital charges under Medicaid go towards care for mothers and newborn \ninfants. Just imagine how much unnecessary spending could be saved if \nmore women were given the choice of going to a birth center to have \ntheir baby.\n  Cutting off access to birth centers that provide quality, cost-\neffective care is a step backward.\n\n[[Page S7321]]\n\n  Taking away choices from pregnant women trying to get essential \nhealth care services is a step backward.\n  As I work with my colleagues to help push for comprehensive health \nreform, I urge them to join me in cosponsoring the Medicaid Birth \nCenter Reimbursement Act, and taking an important step forward for \nmothers and newborns across our nation.\n  I would also like to thank Reps. Susan Davis and Gus Bilirakis, who \nhave championed this legislation in the House. I hope that this \nimportant legislation can be included in the health care reform efforts \nof the 111th Congress.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Collins, Ms. \n        Landrieu, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Casey, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        Mr. Johnson, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 1425.

FINDINGS AND STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Women around the world are especially vulnerable to \n     poverty. They tend to work longer hours, are compensated \n     less, and have less income stability and fewer economic \n     opportunities than men.\n       (2) Women's share of the labor force is increasing in \n     almost all regions of the world. Women comprise more than 40 \n     percent of the global labor force as well as 40 percent of \n     the labor force in eastern and southeastern Asia, sub-Saharan \n     Africa, and the Caribbean. Women comprise a third of the \n     labor force in Central America and nearly a third of total \n     employment in South Asia. About 250,000,000 young women will \n     enter the labor force worldwide before 2015.\n       (3) Women are more likely to work in informal employment \n     relationships in poor countries compared to men. In sub-\n     Saharan Africa, 84 percent of women are employed informally \n     compared to 71 percent of men. In the Middle East, 44 percent \n     of women are employed informally compared to 29 percent of \n     men. Informal employment is characterized by lower wages and \n     greater variability of earnings, less stability, absence of \n     labor organization, and fewer social protections than formal \n     employment.\n       (4) Changes in the economy of a poor country affect women \n     and men differently. Women are disproportionately affected by \n     long-term recessions, crises, and economic restructuring and \n     they often miss out on many of the benefits of growth.\n       (5) International trade can be an important tool for \n     economic development and poverty reduction. The benefits of \n     international trade should extend to all members of society, \n     particularly the world's poor women.\n       (6) Policies that promote fair labor practices for women, \n     and access to information, education, land, credit, physical \n     capital, and social services can be a means of reducing \n     poverty, ensuring food security, and boosting productivity \n     and earnings for the economies of developing countries.\n       (7) Expanding economic opportunity for women in developing \n     countries can have a positive effect on child nutrition, \n     health, and education, as women often invest their income in \n     their families. Increasing women's income can also decrease \n     women's vulnerability to HIV/AIDS, gender-based violence, and \n     trafficking, and make women more resistant to the impact of \n     natural disasters.\n       (8) Policies that promote economic opportunities for women, \n     including microfinance and microenterprise development and \n     the promotion of women's small- and medium-sized businesses, \n     can be a means of generating gainful, safe, and dignified \n     employment for the poor.\n       (9) Women play a vital, but often unrecognized, role in \n     averting violence, resolving conflict, and rebuilding \n     economies in postconflict societies. Women in conflict-\n     affected areas face even greater challenges than men do in \n     accessing employment, training, property rights, credit, and \n     financial and nonfinancial resources for business \n     development. Policies designed to ensure economic opportunity \n     for women in conflict-affected areas play a significant role \n     in economic rehabilitation and consolidation of peace.\n       (10) Given the important role of women in the economies of \n     poor countries, poverty alleviation programs funded by the \n     United States in poor countries should seek to enhance the \n     level of economic opportunity available to women in those \n     countries.\n       (b) Statement of Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to \n     ensure that the policies of the United States actively \n     promote development and economic opportunities for women, \n     including programs and policies that--\n       (1) promote women's ability to start \n     micro-, small-, or medium-sized business enterprises, and \n     enable women to grow such enterprises, particularly from \n     micro- to small-sized enterprises and from small- to medium-\n     sized enterprises, or sustain current business capacity;\n       (2) promote the rights of women to own, manage, and inherit \n     property, including land, encourage the adoption of laws and \n     policies that support women in their efforts to enforce those \n     rights in administrative and judicial tribunals, and address \n     conflicts with country-specific legal regimes or practices \n     (often known as ``customary law'') to increase the ability of \n     women to inherit and own real property;\n       (3) increase women's access to employment, enable women to \n     access higher quality jobs with better remuneration and \n     working conditions in both informal and formal employment, \n     and improve the quality of jobs in sectors dominated by women \n     by improving the remuneration and working conditions for \n     those jobs; and\n       (4) bring the benefits of international trade policy to \n     women in developing countries and continue to ensure that \n     trade policies and agreements adequately reflect the \n     respective needs of poor women and men.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 regarding highly qualified teachers, growth models, adequate \nyearly progress, Native American language programs, and parental \ninvolvement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the School \nAccountability Improvements Act.\n  As you know, the 2001 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, also known as the No Child Left Behind Act, or NCLB, \nmade significant changes to Federal requirements for schools, school \ndistricts, and States. Many of these changes have been good, and were \nnecessary.\n  Because of NCLB, there is more national attention being paid to \nensuring that schools, districts, and States are held accountable for \nthe achievement of students with disabilities, those who are \neconomically disadvantaged, and minority students. In my own State of \nAlaska this has meant, for example, that our more urban school \ndistricts are paying more attention than ever to Alaska Native \nstudents' needs.\n  People across the nation are also more aware that a teacher's \nknowledge of the subject matter and his or her ability to teach that \nsubject are the most important factors in ensuring a child's \nachievement in school.\n  Teachers, parents, administrators, and communities have more data \nthan ever about the achievement of individual students, subgroups of \nstudents, and schools. With that data, changes are being made to school \npolicies and procedures and more students are getting the help they \nneed to succeed in schools.\n  While these are just a few of the positive effects of the No Child \nLeft Behind Act, there have been problems. This is not surprising, as \nit is difficult to write one law that will work well for both New York \nCity and Nuiqsut, AK.\n  My bill, the School Accountability Improvements Act is meant to \naddress 6 issues that are of particular concern in Alaska and in other \nStates around the nation.\n  First, my legislation would give flexibility to states regarding \nNCLB's ``Highly Qualified Teacher'' requirements. In very small, rural \nschools, it is common for one teacher to teach multiple core academic \nsubjects in the middle and high school grades. NCLB requires that this \nteacher be ``Highly Qualified'' in each of those subjects.\n  While it is vital that teachers know the subjects they teach, it is \nalso unreasonable to expect teachers in very tiny schools to meet the \ncurrent requirements in every single subject. It is almost impossible \nfor tiny, remote school districts to find and hire such teachers. Yet, \nstudents deserve to have teachers who know the subjects they teach.\n  My legislation would provide flexibility by allowing instruction to \nbe provided by Highly Qualified teachers by distance delivery if they \nare assisted by teachers on site who are Highly Qualified in a \ndifferent subject. This provision is offered as a compromise in those \nlimited situations.\n  Second, my legislation would give credit to schools, rather than \npunish them, if students are improving but have not yet reached the \nState's proficiency goals by requiring the U.S. Department of Education \nto allow States to determine schools' success based on individual \nstudents' growth in proficiency. While it can be useful to teachers and \nadministrators to know how one group of third graders compares to the \nnext year's class, it is much more useful for educators, students, and \nparents to know how each child is progressing--is the child proficient, \non track to be proficient, or falling behind? Many States now have the \nrobust data systems that will allow them to track this information; \nNCLB should allow them to use the statistical model that will be most \nuseful.\n  My bill also improves NCLB's requirements for school choice and \ntutoring. No Child Left Behind gave parents an opportunity to move \ntheir children out of dysfunctional schools. I support that. But the \nlaw requires school districts offer school choice, and to set aside \nfunds to pay for transportation, in Year Two of Improvement Status. \nSchools do not have to tutor the students until the following year. \nThis is backwards logic. Schools should be given the opportunity to \nhelp students learn first before transporting them all over town. I \nthink most parents agree, and that is one reason why we are seeing \nfewer than 2 percent of parents choose to transfer their children to \nanother school. My bill would require schools to offer tutoring first \nbefore providing school choice.\n  Mr. President, NCLB also requires schools to tutor and offer choice \nto students who are doing well at their neighborhood school. Schools \nshould not be forced to set aside desperately needed funds to serve \nstudents who don't need those services. My bill would require schools \nto provide tutoring and choice only to those students who are not \nproficient. In addition, it would allow school districts to provide \ntutoring to students even if the district is in Improvement Status. \nWhile school districts may need improvement overall, those same \ndistricts employ teachers who are fully capable of providing effective \ntutoring.\n  Many educators and parents also have concerns about NCLB's \nrequirements for Corrective Action and Restructuring. These are very \nsignificant requirements that can include firing staff and closing \nschools that don't meet the law's AYP requirements. They are even more \nsignificant if the actions are not based on reliable information.\n  As you know, assessing whether a child is proficient on state \nstandards in a reliable and valid way is difficult. It is even more \ndifficult when the child has a disability or has limited English \nproficiency. Some question whether or not the tests we are giving these \ntwo groups of students are valid and reliable. Yet, NCLB requires \ndistricts and States to impose significant corrective actions or \nrestructure a school completely if a school or district does not make \nAYP for any subgroup repeatedly. For truly dysfunctional schools and \ndistricts, that may be appropriate.\n  But, how do we justify taking over a school, firing its teachers, \nturning its governance over to another entity, or other drastic \nmeasures if the students are learning but have not yet met the State's \nproficiency benchmarks? We can not.\n  That is why my bill would not allow a school or school district to be \nrestructured if the school missed AYP for one or both of those \nsubgroups alone and the school can show through a growth model that the \nstudents in those two subgroups are on track to be proficient in a \nreasonable amount of time. Schools that are improving student learning \nshould not be dismantled based on potentially invalid test results.\n  In Alaska, Hawaii, and several other States, Native Americans are \nworking hard to keep their indigenous languages and cultures alive. \nTeachers will tell you, and research supports them, that Alaska Native, \nNative Hawaiian, and American Indian students learn better when their \nheritage is a respected and vibrant part of their education. This is \ntrue of any child, but particularly true for these groups of Americans.\n  Many schools around the country that serve these students have \nincorporated indigenous language programs into their curriculum. The \nproblem is that in many instances, there is no valid and reliable way \nto assess whether or not the students have learned the state standards \nin that language. Neither is it valid to test what a student knows in a \nlanguage they do not speak\n\n[[Page S7325]]\n\nwell. Research also tells us that students who are learning in a full \nlanguage immersion program do not test well initially, but by 7th grade \nthey do as well or better on State tests and they can speak two \nlanguages.\n  My legislation would allow schools with Native American language \nprograms in States where there is no assessment in that language to \ncalculate Adequate Yearly Progress for third graders by participation \nrate only. It would then allow the school to make AYP if those students \nare proficient or on track to be proficient in grades 4 through 7.\n  Finally, I know as a parent how important it is to my boys that their \nfather and I have always been involved in their education. NCLB \nrecognizes, in many ways, how important parents are in a child's \neducation, but improvements can still be made. My bill would amend \nTitle II of NCLB--which authorizes subgrants for preparing, training, \nand recruiting teachers and principals--to allow, but not mandate, more \nparental involvement in our schools. This section of my bill would \nallow parent-teacher associations and organizations to be members of \nfederally funded partnerships formed to improve low-performing schools \nand to provide training to teachers and principals to improve parental \nengagement and school-parent communication.\n  I can tell you that as wonderful as our Nation's teachers are, very \nfew of them graduate from college having had a course in how to \neffectively communicate with parents. Teachers are very busy people, \nand when a parent shows up at the classroom door and says, ``Hi, I'm \nhere to help'' teachers often do not know how to react. Many teachers \nhave difficulty communicating with parents who may be working two jobs, \nor who have a different cultural background or language. In my view, \nparents should be a part of improving their children's schools, and \nhave insights into how communication between school and home can be \nimproved.\n  I know that these 6 issues are not the only issues that my \ncolleagues, Alaskans, and Americans may have with the No Child Left \nBehind Act. I have been talking with Alaskans about NCLB since I came \nto the Senate, and I look forward to working hard on the \nreauthorization of the law this year.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1430\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
