Madam President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1. The time until 5:30 will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees. At \n5:30, the Senate will vote in an attempt to end the filibuster. That \nwill be on the Collins-Nelson substitute amendment. Cloture will be \nvoted on at that time.\n  The Presiding Officer and I came to Congress together many years ago. \nWe have been now serving in the Senate together for many years. Last \nweek reminded me of when we first came to the Senate. There was open \ndebate, amendments offered--that is what happened last week. Faced with \nthe worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, Senators from \nboth parties engaged in serious debate over the best way forward.\n  Realizing the critical need for action, we moved President Obama's \neconomic recovery plan as quickly and as responsibly as we could. But \neven though we wanted to move it as quickly and as responsibly as we \ncould, we did not do anything to cut off debate or limit the \nopportunity of every Senator to have their say. Both Republicans and \nDemocrats were given the opportunity to offer amendments and each \nreceived votes on their amendments. Many Democratic and Republican \namendments were adopted and, on the whole, the amendment process \nstrengthened the legislation.\n  A bipartisan group of Senators, led by Senators Nelson, Lieberman, \nSnowe, Collins, and Specter, worked tirelessly during last week to \nforge a compromise amendment, to focus the bill on job creation and tax \nrelief. All this work has resulted in the legislation that is now \nbefore the Senate. This evening we will vote on cloture, setting up a \nvote on final passage for tomorrow. After final passage, the House and \nSenate will move to conference between the House and the Senate and \nthen send the enrolled bill to the President's desk.\n  We are going to do our utmost to do this as quickly as possible. The \nRepublican leader and I have agreed on a general position as to how we \nare going to move forward with the conference, and I will visit with \nhim some more later today. But we have to complete this work this week. \nThere is every opportunity for us to complete it by Friday. Even though \nit is a complex bill, the bill now has been on the desk since Saturday \nand people have had an opportunity to read and review this in detail.\n  We will hopefully pass this tomorrow. We will put this side-by-side \nwith the bill that has passed the House, and come back with a proposal \nthat is bold, is robust, is job creating.\n  I was with the Governor of Maryland last night, and he was so happy \nabout the work we had done in the Senate. He indicated to me he had \nspoken to other Governors. In fact, he called me again this morning \nindicating he had spoken to other Governors around the country, and \nthey were quite happy with this legislation. It is my understanding the \nPresident is in a place called Elkhart,\n\n[[Page S1992]]\n\nIN, today to talk about the travails we face as a country. Elkhart, IN, \nhas an announced unemployment rate of more than 15 percent. But in the \ncommentary I heard this morning, it is believed the unemployment is \nactually well over 20 percent in Elkhart, IN.\n  The President is going to do a live press conference tonight, 8 \no'clock eastern time. Tomorrow he is going to be in Florida with the \nRepublican Governor of Florida and others to talk about the situation \nhe finds in Florida.\n  We need to complete this legislation as quickly as possible. We are \ngoing to continue to be cooperative, as have been my Republican \nfriends--cooperative. I think this has been a very good debate. It has \nbeen a stimulating debate. I was so satisfied with the debate that took \nplace Saturday. Republicans and Democrats engaged in a serious debate \nSaturday. Those who supported the legislation, I thought did a good \njob. Those who opposed it, I thought they did a good job explaining \ntheir problems with this legislation.\n  The message I leave as the majority leader of the Senate is we are \ngoing to continue to move forward on this legislation. We are not going \nto leave for our Presidents Day recess until we complete this.\n  I have said, on a number of other occasions, that if people out there \nare thinking we are going to take a vacation for a week when we leave \nWashington, that is not the case. We have things to do in our home \nStates. It is good for me--and I think I speak for all Senators--to be \nback in our States on a weekday. We plan and hope all next week to be \nhome so we can be doing things we cannot do on weekends. But if we \ncannot complete this legislation, we will have to cut into that. Our \nresponsibilities at home will have to be set for some other date.\n  I am confident we can get it done by Friday. There is no reason we \ncannot. With a little bit of cooperation on both sides, we can move \nforward. I have been in touch with the House leaders. They understand \nthe difficulties we have over here, and I understand their situation.\n  I repeat, I am very confident this legislation is in keeping with \nwhat President Obama wants; that is, to have a program out there that \ncreates lots of jobs and gives middle-class America tax relief. That is \nwhat this legislation is all about.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S1992-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 5:30 will be equally divided and controlled between the leaders \nor their designees.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, Senator Baucus is my designee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Baucus is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this afternoon the Senate returns to its \n7th day of work on this important jobs bill. The case for this bill \ncontinues to grow stronger every day. Last week, for example, we \nlearned that 3.6 million Americans have lost their jobs since this \nrecession began--3.6 million Americans have lost their jobs. The \nunemployment rate has risen to 7.6 percent and it is rising. Job losses \nappear to be accelerating.\n  Last year, more than 3 million families lost their homes to \nforeclosure--3 million families in 1 year--and many more foreclosures \nappear to lie ahead.\n  We face the worst economic disaster in the lifetimes of most \nAmericans alive today. History will judge how we respond and let us not \nlet this Nation down.\n  In the late 1920s and early 1930s, there were those who questioned \nvigorous Government response. There were those who fretted about short-\nterm deficit. We were spending too much, they said. History has not \njudged them kindly.\n  Rather, the consensus of economists came to agree with the great \nBritish economist, John Maynard Keynes. Keynes argued that in times of \nhigh and rising unemployment, the Government has an important job to \ndo. The Government must make up for lagging demand in the private \nsector, he said, and the Keynesian school teaches the best way to \nincrease demand is to get money in the hands of those most likely to \nspend it quickly.\n  It is true some economists questioned the Keynesian consensus, but \nthose questioners are very much on the fringe of economic thinking. The \nmainstream--by far the mainstream is that we have to use public money \nto help pull us out of recession.\n  Our time of testing is upon us. The broad consensus of economic \nanalysis informs us what to do. The question before us is now one of \npolitical will. Will this generation have the courage to confront the \neconomic storm of our time or will this generation be like that which \npreceded the New Deal? Will our generation, by its inaction, be found \nwanting or will our generation rise to the challenge of our times?\n  The path to address this crisis lies ahead of us today. At about 5:30 \np.m. this evening this Senate will conduct a rollcall vote on the \nmotion to invoke cloture on the Collins-Nelson substitute. That \nsubstitute is the best clear chance for the Nation to respond to the \neconomic crisis we face.\n  Under the previous order, if the Senate invokes cloture on the \namendment, then the Senate will be able to complete action on this bill \nwith a vote at 12 noon tomorrow. If a Senator raises a budget point of \norder against the amendment, then the Senate will vote tomorrow on a \nmotion to waive that point of order; otherwise, under the previous \norder, the adoption of the amendment will still be subject to a 60-vote \nthreshold, and the Senate would then vote on passage of the bill. \nEither way, the Senate faces two 60-vote hurdles for this important \nlegislation, one this evening at 5:30 and another tomorrow at noon.\n  That familiar arithmetic dictates the path before us. The amendment \nbefore us provides the one clear chance to surmount that 60-vote \nhurdle. The Collins-Nelson substitute provides an opportunity for \nCongress to respond and respond quickly, swiftly. Let us take that \nopportunity.\n  The Collins-Nelson substitute is a principled compromise. Yes, if I \nhad my way, I would have written it differently. I brought a slightly \ndifferent bill to the floor on behalf of the Finance Committee. But the \nsubstitute makes the change we need so as to allow the broad consensus \nwe need to pass this bill. In the Collins-Nelson substitute, we agreed \nto trim the underlying bill. But I am pleased the compromise does not \nsacrifice the main thrust of the bill.\n  So what is the compromise? The Collins-Nelson substitute would trim \nthe COBRA subsidy--that is the health subsidy for persons who lose \ntheir jobs and therefore lose their health insurance. It would provide \na 50-percent subsidy for 12 months for the purchase of health insurance \nfor those who have lost their jobs. This saves $5 billion. The \nagreement trims the health information technology proposal. It would \ncap the amount of funds that a critical access hospital can receive \nunder the health IT provisions at 1.5 million per hospital. This change \nsaves $5 million per hospital.\n  The Collins-Nelson substitute also cuts back on some of the tax \nincentives. The agreement eliminates the general credit carry-back \nprovision, saving about $9 billion.\n  The agreement trims the recovery zone bonds by providing $10 billion \nin private activity bonds and $5 billion in refundable credit bonds. \nThe agreement provides a 35-percent tax credit for Build America bonds \nfor 2009 and 2010, with a 40 percent tax credit for small issuers. This \nchange saves $2 billion.\n  The Collins-Nelson substitute trims the number of people eligible for \nthe make work pay credit by beginning the phase out of the credit at \n$70,000 in annual income for singles and at $140,000\n\n[[Page S1993]]\n\nin annual income for couples. This change saves $2 billion.\n  And the refundable child tax credit threshold is decreased to $8,100, \nsaving $3 billion.\n  Other than these changes, the underlying tax provisions are \nessentially intact. The bill remains a balanced approach to getting our \neconomy back on track.\n  The bill would continue to provide more than $300 billion in tax cuts \nfor individuals. The bill would help working families with the make \nwork pay. Seniors, disabled vets, and SSI recipients would receive a \none-time payment of $300.\n  Families with children would also get help. The bill would still \nexpand the earned-income tax credit and the refundable child tax \ncredit. Families would still get benefits for college with the American \nopportunity tax credit and the expansion of 529 college savings plans.\n  The bill would expand the homeownership tax credit beyond first-time \nhomeowners and double the amount of the credit. For those receiving \nunemployment benefits, the first $2,400 would not be taxed as income.\n  There are also tax incentives for commuters and those buying \nautomobiles.\n  The bill would also provide a 2009 AMT patch, so that people can keep \nthe tax cuts they receive.\n  The bill contains $18.4 billion for businesses. There are several \nprovisions geared toward small businesses. The bill extends bonus \ndepreciation and 179 expensing. The bill also decreases the S-Corp \nholding period from 10 years to 7 years for built-in gains.\n  The bill would allow businesses to take accumulated AMT and R \ncredits in cash in lieu of bonus depreciation. The bill provides a \ndelayed recognition of certain cancellation of debt income. Net \noperating losses can be carried back 5 years instead of 2.\n  The bill still provides more than $19 billion in energy tax \nincentives.\n  These incentives will create green jobs producing the next generation \nof renewable energy sources, wind, solar, geothermal, spur development \nof alternatives, and help to combat climate change by reducing our use \nof carbon-emitting fuels.\n  The bill would extend and modify the renewable energy production tax \ncredit for qualifying facilities, in order to make the credit more \nuseable in the economic environment.\n  The bill includes additional funding for clean renewable energy bonds \nto finance facilities that generate electricity from renewable \nresources and conservation bonds for States to use to reduce greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  Energy efficiency is often cited as the low-hanging fruit, the \neasiest way for us to reduce our energy consumption and greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  We have included incentives for energy efficiency. The value of the \nexisting credit for energy efficient homes is increased and the \nlimitations on specific energy-efficient property are eliminated. The \ncredits for various types of energy efficient property, for both \nresidential and business, are extended.\n  The bill has two new tax credits designed to spur our alternative \nenergy and production.\n  The advanced energy research and development credit provides an \nenhanced 20 percent R credit for research expenditures incurred in \nthe fields of fuel cells, energy storage, renewable energy, energy \nconservation technology, efficient transmission and distribution of \nelectricity, and carbon capture and sequestration.\n  The second tax credit is an advanced energy investment credit for \nfacilities engaged in the manufacture of advanced energy property.\n  These energy tax incentives will help to keep our alternative energy \nsector moving forward as we confront the growing demand for clean, \nrenewable energy.\n  The bill would provide recovery provisions totaling $9.6 billion. The \nbill would provide for several types of bonds to help depressed areas, \nincluding recovery zone bonds, tribal economic development bonds, high \nspeed rail bonds, and broadband bonds. The new markets tax credit would \nbe extended. The bill would accelerate the low-income housing tax \ncredit.\n  The bill would also provide $14.3 billion in help for municipal bond \nmarkets. This recovery bill includes changes that will free up this \nmarket, unlocking cash for infrastructure investment.\n  Banks would be able to inject more capital into projects, creating \ndemand for municipal bonds, and driving down interest rates. And \nincreasing the small issuer exception would increase the range of \nmunicipalities from whom banks could buy.\n  The bill would also eliminate tax-exempt interest on private activity \nbonds as a preference item under the alternative minimum tax. This \nchange would draw new investors and help stabilize the market.\n  The legislation would also establish parity for tribal governments on \n$2 billion of tax exempt bonds. This important change would put Tribal \ngovernments on equal footing with other government issuers.\n  The bill would maintain the new tax-credit bond option, giving State \nand local governments a new tool to finance infrastructure projects.\n  The bill would also eliminate the 3 percent withholding requirement \nfor Government contractors.\n  The tax components of the bill are diversified. They would spur our \neconomy from several directions.\n  On health matters, the Collins-Nelson substitute preserves much of \nthe health IT investment that the original bill proposed. These sound \ninvestments will pay dividends in the future. They would reduce health \ncare costs and improve health care quality.\n  The health IT provisions preserved in this bill will also help \npatients to make better decisions about their health care. I am pleased \nthat these provisions remain intact. And the provisions have been \nimproved by the amendments offered by Senator Enzi last week.\n  The Collins-Nelson substitute also maintains the important \nprotections that we provided in the original bill to State Medicaid \nprograms. As we heard in the floor debate, the rise in unemployment has \nplaced significant strain on Medicaid.\n  Decreased revenue coming in means less money to fund Medicaid. And \nexperts warn that every percentage point increase in unemployment adds \n1 million more people to the Medicaid and CHIP rolls.\n  The substitute before us today would provide much-needed relief to \nevery State through a temporary increase in the Federal share of \nMedicaid funding. This funding would prevent States from making further \ncuts to a program that is already in dire circumstances due to the \neconomic downturn.\n  And the substitute also preserved the critical extension of emergency \nunemployment benefits. It also maintains the improvements to our \nunemployment insurance program by increasing and extending benefits to \nthose currently looking for work.\n  A key component of the economic recovery package helps unemployed \nworkers maintain their health coverage. When workers lose their jobs, \nthey lose more than their paychecks. They often lose their health \ninsurance coverage, as well. Losing job-based health insurance can have \ntragic consequences.\n  The initial proposal provided a 65-percent subsidy for COBRA coverage \nfor up to 9 months. The Collins-Nelson substitute shaved that coverage \nback to a 50-percent subsidy for 12 months. By doing so, we saved $5 \nbillion.\n  I am concerned that a 50-percent subsidy might not provide enough \nrelief. In the future, I will look for ways to maximize participation \nin this program for people who want to keep their health coverage.\n  But the product before us today is the result of principled and \nbipartisan negotiation. This is a compromise across the aisle in the \nfinest tradition of the Senate.\n  But we do not have time to waste. We must act quickly to pass the \nCollins-Nelson substitute. We must work quickly with the House in \nconference to reach consensus and put this bill on the President's desk \nwithout delay.\n  Let us not repeat the dithering of the late 1920s and early 1930s. \nLet us summon the courage to confront the economic challenge of our \ntimes. And when the roll is called this evening, let us invoke cloture \non the Collins-Nelson substitute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask the manager, I assume we will \ncontinue\n\n[[Page S1994]]\n\nthe practice we have been pursuing of going back to either side and \nthat any time in quorum call will come off the times of both sides?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That would be my intention.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the manager.\n  I would like to say for the benefit of my colleagues on this side of \nthe aisle that----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. If the Senator would suspend, I \nhave been informed there is no such unanimous consent agreement. If \nSenators would like to get that into the order, it would be appropriate \nat this time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nremaining allocated to this bill be equally divided and that all time \nin quorum calls be charged equally to each side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, obviously, if we have Members from that \nside who are waiting and none are on this side, we will adjust that, as \nwe have the last several days. I thank the Senator from Montana for all \nof his courtesies in making sure we have had balanced debate on this \nvery important issue.\n  Also, I would like to say to my colleagues on this side of the aisle \nthat speakers from my side, if they would come to the floor, I think \nthere would be time to recognize them. We have signed up Senators Kyl, \nEnzi, Alexander, Inhofe, Thune, Graham, Chambliss, Bond, Sessions, and \nCoburn. If others wish to speak, if they would notify the cloakroom.\n  Madam President, many of my colleagues are claiming that the \n``compromise bipartisan bill'' that is before us is a product and \nresult of serious negotiations, and it is neither. It is neither \nbipartisan nor is it a compromise. It is not bipartisan in that 3 \nRepublican Senators, after not a single Republican Member of the other \nbody, the House of Representatives, plus 11 Democrats voted against \nthis legislation.\n  Now, there continues to be touted that there were meetings that \nRepublican Senators attended. There are meetings that take place all \nthe time, all the time around here. There are meetings, both informal \nand conversations about it. But the fact is, we ended up with 3 \nRepublican Members of Congress out of 178 in the House and 40 here in \nthe Senate. So it is not ``bipartisan.'' To say otherwise belies \nhistory.\n  I am proud to have been a member of a number of bipartisan \nresolutions of issues that have come before this body, whether it be \nthe Gang of 14, on campaign finance reform, or whether it be on other \nimportant issues as far as national security and other issues are \nconcerned. That is when Republicans and Democrats have sat down \ntogether and came out in equal numbers--roughly equal numbers--to \nachieve bipartisan agreement.\n  This is not a bipartisan agreement. This is three Members of the \nSenate--none on the House side--who have joined Democrats for a \npartisan agreement. It is unfortunate that has happened because we are \nnow committing an act of generational theft. We are robbing future \ngenerations of Americans of their hard-earned dollars because we are \nlaying on them a debt of incredible proportions. We have already \namassed over a $10 trillion debt. Apparently, we will pass this \nlegislation, which is another, when you count the interest, about $1.1 \ntrillion dollars.\n  The House is about to take up a $400 billion Omnibus appropriations \nbill. It has been put off until tomorrow, probably wisely. The \nSecretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner, is going to recommend \nsomewhere around $\\1/2\\ trillion to $1 trillion for another TARP \npackage. So we are talking about trillions of dollars.\n  This morning, one of my colleagues, the Senator from New York, Mr. \nSchumer, said: ``Why quibble over $200 million?''\n  I am not sure the American people would agree.\n  What has been the result of this compromise? Ten out of hundreds \neliminated items: $34 million to renovate the Commerce Department; $100 \nmillion for governmentwide supercomputers; $14 million for cyber \nsecurity; $55 million for historic preservation; $20 million for Bureau \nof Indian Affairs; $5.8 billion for prevention wellness programs, $870 \nmillion for pandemic flu; $16 million for school improvement programs, \nconstruction; $3.5 billion for higher education facilities; $2.25 \nbillion for a neighborhood stabilization program. Ten have been \neliminated from the hundreds which totals $12.6 billion of the $140 \nbillion being touted as having been cut from the more than $900 billion \nbill. What we have done is, we have eliminated 10 items, reduced \nothers, which will probably be restored, reaching basically the same \nlevel, a ``compromise'' of about $827 billion which is a little more \nthan that passed by the House of Representatives. The total is over a \ntrillion dollars.\n  Both the distinguished majority leader and the Senator from Montana \nhave emphasized the need for speed, that we have to act quickly, right \naway. We will, I am sure, because a seminal moment was when the two or \nthree Republican Senators announced they would vote for this package. \nSo it is a matter of time.\n  Last week, the overseer of TARP I announced there had been $76 \nbillion wasted in paying for assets over their actual value. We acted \nin speed, with haste, and it cost the taxpayers $76 billion.\n  Again, this is an unusual circumstance we are in. These circumstances \nwe all appreciate. We appreciate the fact that millions of Americans \nare without a job, without health insurance, without the ability to \neducate themselves and their children, and without the ability to stay \nin their homes. We need to act. We need to act responsibly.\n  It is being said that every economist says we need to adopt this \npackage. That is not true. I even hear one of my advisers during the \ncampaign, Marty Feldstein's name, being mentioned as being for this \npackage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Martin Feldstein's Washington Post op-ed \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Jan. 29, 2009]\n\n                        An $800 Billion Mistake\n\n                         (By Martin Feldstein)\n\n       As a conservative economist, I might be expected to oppose \n     a stimulus plan. In fact, on this page in October, I declared \n     my support for a stimulus. But the fiscal package now before \n     Congress needs to be thoroughly revised. In its current form, \n     it does too little to raise national spending and employment. \n     It would be better for the Senate to delay legislation for a \n     month, or even two, if that's what it takes to produce a much \n     better bill. We cannot afford an $800 billion mistake.\n       Start with the tax side. The plan is to give a tax cut of \n     $500 a year for two years to each employed person. That's not \n     a good way to increase consumer spending. Experience shows \n     that the money from such temporary, lump-sum tax cuts is \n     largely saved or used to pay down debt. Only about 15 percent \n     of last year's tax rebates led to additional spending.\n       The proposed business tax cuts are also likely to do little \n     to increase business investment and employment. The extended \n     loss ``carrybacks'' are primarily lump-sum payments to \n     selected companies. The bonus depreciation plan would do \n     little to raise capital spending in the current environment \n     of weak demand because the tax benefits in the early years \n     would be recaptured later.\n       Instead, the tax changes should focus on providing \n     incentives to households and businesses to increase current \n     spending. Why not a temporary refundable tax credit to \n     households that purchase cars or other major consumer \n     durables, analogous to the investment tax credit for \n     businesses? Or a temporary tax credit for home improvements? \n     In that way, the same total tax reduction could produce much \n     more spending and employment.\n       Postponing the scheduled increase in the tax on dividends \n     and capital gains would raise share prices, leading to \n     increased consumer spending and, by lowering the cost of \n     capital, more business investment.\n       On the spending side, the stimulus package is full of well-\n     intended items that, unfortunately, are not likely to do much \n     for employment. Computerizing the medical records of every \n     American over the next five years is desirable, but it is not \n     a cost-effective way to create jobs. Has anyone gone through \n     the (long) list of proposed appropriations and asked how many \n     jobs each would create per dollar of increased national debt?\n       The largest proposed outlays amount to just writing \n     unrestricted checks to state governments. Nearly $100 billion \n     would result from increasing the ``Medicaid matching rate,'' \n     a technique for reducing states' Medicaid costs to free up \n     state money for spending on anything governors and state \n     legislators want. An additional $80 billion would be\n\n[[Page S1995]]\n\n     given out for ``state fiscal relief.'' Will these vast sums \n     actually lead to additional spending, or will they merely \n     finance state transfer payments or relieve state governments \n     of the need for temporary tax hikes or bond issues?\n       The plan to finance health insurance premiums for the \n     unemployed would actually increase unemployment by giving \n     employers an incentive to lay off workers rather than pay \n     health premiums during a time of weak demand. And this \n     supposedly two-year program would create a precedent that \n     could be hard to reverse.\n       A large fraction of the stimulus proposal is devoted to \n     infrastructure projects that will spend out very slowly, not \n     with the speed needed to help the economy in 2009 and 2010. \n     The Congressional Budget Office estimates that less than one-\n     fifth of the $50 billion of proposed spending on energy and \n     water would occur by the end of 2010.\n       If rapid spending on things that need to be done is a \n     criterion of choice, the plan should include higher defense \n     outlays, including replacing and repairing supplies and \n     equipment, needed after five years of fighting. The military \n     can increase its level of procurement very rapidly. Yet the \n     proposed spending plan includes less than $5 billion for \n     defense, only about one-half of 1 percent of the total \n     package.\n       Infrastructure spending on domestic military bases can also \n     proceed more rapidly than infrastructure spending in the \n     civilian economy. And military procurement overwhelmingly \n     involves American-made products. Since much of this military \n     spending will have to be done eventually, it makes sense to \n     do it now, when there is substantial excess capacity in the \n     manufacturing sector. In addition, a temporary increase in \n     military recruiting and training would reduce unemployment \n     directly, create a more skilled civilian workforce and expand \n     the military reserves.\n       All new spending and tax changes should have explicit time \n     limits that prevent ever-increasing additions to the national \n     debt. Similarly, spending programs should not create \n     political dynamics that will make them hard to end.\n       The problem with the current stimulus plan is not that it \n     is too big but that it delivers too little extra employment \n     and income for such a large fiscal deficit. It is worth \n     taking the time to get it right.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Washington Post op-ed is entitled ``An $800 Billion \nMistake.'' Martin Feldstein and many other economists believe this is \nan $800 billion mistake. He says:\n\n       On the spending side, the stimulus package is full of well-\n     intended items that, unfortunately, are not likely to do much \n     for employment. Computerizing the medical records of every \n     American over the next 5 years is desirable, but it is not a \n     cost-effective way to create jobs. Has anyone gone through \n     the long list of proposed appropriations and asked how many \n     jobs each would create per dollar of increased national debt?\n\n  Well, since Mr. Feldstein wrote that column, the Congressional Budget \nOffice did, indeed, go through the list. They found out it would \nincrease between now and the bill then, which has been changed somewhat \nbut basically will end up over a trillion dollars, it says it would \nincrease employment at that point in time by 1.3 million to 3.9 million \njobs. At $885 billion, 1.3 million jobs would work out to $680,769 per \njob. And at 3.9 million jobs, the cost would be $226,923 per job.\n  Several of my colleagues have celebrated the reduced cost of the \ncompromise from $885 billion to $827 billion. So let's do the math for \nthat amount. It is only $636,154 per job for 1.3 million jobs, and \n$212,000 for 3.9 million jobs created. If you add the cost of interest \nto the total for the compromise, we have $1.175 trillion.\n  There are numerous policy changes which have nothing to do with jobs \nin this bill. This legislation was delivered to our office at 11 \no'clock on Saturday night. My staff has been hard at work scrubbing \nthis bill, 778 pages, I believe, for the changes. One of them that is \nvery interesting, which has been added, is a new, far-reaching policy \nwith respect to unemployment compensation. Specifically, the title is \nUnemployment Compensation Moderation. It would allow a person to \ncollect unemployment insurance for leaving his or her job to take care \nof an immediate family member's illness, any illness or disability as \ndefined by the Secretary of Labor. This was originally sponsored \nlegislation in the 110th Congress and did not succeed. Each State would \nneed to amend their unemployment insurance in order to receive $7 \nbillion in funds.\n  Again, that may be a laudable goal to fundamentally change \nunemployment compensation. What in the world is it doing on what is \nsupposed to be an economic stimulus package?\n  I see my friend from Wyoming, Senator Enzi, is here. I will conclude. \nThis is neither bipartisan nor is it a compromise. It is generational \ntheft, because we rejected a proposal on this side to establish a \ntrigger that when our economy improves, we would be on a path to a \nbalanced budget and reducing spending. These spending programs will \nremain with no way of paying for them. What are we doing to future \ngenerations of Americans? We need a stimulus package. We need to create \njobs. We certainly don't need to lay a multitrillion dollar debt on \nfuture generations of Americans, once our economy has improved.\n  We found out when we received 44 votes on a triggering mechanism what \na lot of this is all about. It is increasing spending, increasing the \nrole of government in a Draconian and unprecedented fashion, and laying \na debt on future generations of Americans of many trillions of dollars. \nI urge colleagues to rethink their position. I still believe if it had \nnot been a process that started with ``we won and we wrote the bill,'' \nwe could have had a truly bipartisan approach which the majority of \nAmericans would not only support but benefit from.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it is worth repeating until it is \nunderstood: According to CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation, 99 \npercent of all the Finance Committee bill is spent in the first 2 \nyears. If we add the whole bill together, the Finance Committee portion \nand the Appropriations Committee portion, 79 percent is spent in the \nfirst 2 years. This is an approach to get money spent quickly.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does Senator McCain yield time to \nSenator Enzi?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield such time as he may consume to the Senator from \nWyoming.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the following speakers on the \nRepublican side be recognized for up to 10 minute each, in no \ndesignated order, with the remaining time under the control of Senator \nGrassley: Senators Kyl, Alexander, Inhofe, Thune, Graham, Chambliss, \nBond, Sessions, and Coburn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I have to say it: The emperor has no \nclothes. Somebody has to say it. I am referring to this additional \nbailout, a spending bill that spends everything we have on nothing we \nare sure about. I have watched with dismay and disgust as this stimulus \nballooned from $800 billion to more than $930 billion in only 4 days of \ndebate. Today my colleagues tell me I am supposed to be giddy that we \nare only spending $827 billion. Frankly, I have had enough of this \nbailout baloney. Members from both sides of the aisle are taking \nadvantage of taxpayer shell shock and a strident sense of national \nurgency to pump the recovery package with wasteful spending and \nunending tax provisions that blatantly fail a crucial yet simple test \nset by my Democratic colleagues--that the provisions of the stimulus \nbill would be targeted, timely, and, most important, temporary.\n  For example, this bill includes billions of new money for Federal \nagencies. Presumably these agencies will hire new workers. What happens \nat the end of the fiscal year when the funding for these new hires goes \naway? Will these new jobs be eliminated? Of course not. We never do. \nLawmakers simply come back to the well in a few months and exert even \nmore pressure to maintain the new programs and keep these new jobs and \nkeep the bloated spending that supports them. There is nothing \ntemporary about that kind of spending.\n  There is also nothing temporary about much of the programmatic \nspending included in this bill either. For example, the compromise \nincludes $13.9 billion in additional funding for Pell grants to help \ncollege students pay for college costs. I am a strong supporter of Pell \ngrants. But we provide funding for them in the normal appropriations \nprocess which, incidentally, we haven't passed last October's \nappropriations yet. I always wonder when we will get around to doing \nthat. We are\n\n[[Page S1996]]\n\nkidding ourselves that after the stimulus bill, we will be able to \nreturn Pell grants to their prestimulus level. If we try to go back to \nthat level, we will be accused of making college unaffordable. The same \ngoes for the IDEA Program. It receives $13 billion in the compromise to \nimprove education for disabled children. We are all for improving \neducation for disabled children. But if we suggest that the IDEA \nProgram go to a prestimulus level, we will be accused of cutting \nfunding for disabled children. They are both good programs, but they \nshould be funded in the normal appropriations process because they are \nnot temporary spending increases. That is $26.9 billion with only those \ntwo. That used to be big money around here.\n  While this bill does not include traditional earmarks, we should all \nunderstand that there are earmarks in this bill. There is $850 \nmillion--just millions, nothing--to bail out Amtrak; a $75 million \nearmark for the Smithsonian, a $1 billion earmark for the 2010 census.\n\n  In addition to that, thousands of the projects that will be funded \nfrom this bill are what the American people would consider to be \nearmarks. For example, the compromise includes $1.2 billion for Byrne \ngrants that will go to local law enforcement agencies to be spent on \nbasically whatever they desire. This bill is not a stimulus package; it \nis another bloated appropriations package. That is another $3 billion \nthat used to be real money around here. I wish I had time to cover the \nthousands of other spending ideas we would not fund in the past. Time \ndoes not allow it when you are talking about $800 billion.\n  I think it is ironic that Congress spent last fall criticizing \nsubprime mortgage lenders who sold overvalued homes to people who could \nnot afford them--and created this mess we are in--when we are \ncommitting that very same sin today in this ``stimulus'' bill. This \nChamber is guilty of trying to sell an overvalued, bloated spending \nbill to taxpayers who can ill-afford the price tag. But unlike those \nhomeowners who just left the keys and closed the front door, the \nAmerican taxpayer does not have that option of just walking away when \nthis bill comes due.\n  It is time to admit that, just like many Americans, the Federal \nGovernment has maxed out its credit card. But while most Americans are \nwisely trimming the fat in their budgets, reexamining their spending \npatterns, and focusing on what is truly essential, Congress has not \nsmartened up yet. Now is not the time to put every politician's \nChristmas wish list on the Government credit card.\n  We are already approaching the debt ceiling with alarming speed. In \nfact, I will bet most Americans do not know that buried deep in this \nstimulus bill is the increase to $12.1 trillion in the Federal debt \nlimit. Let me repeat that: a $12.1 trillion debt limit. And that is on \ntop of the trillions already set as a debt ceiling.\n  The American people want Congress to act now, to act with urgency. \nThey say we do not have time to wait. Well, that is what the party in \ncharge is telling us. My reply is, do we have time to get it right? The \nAmerican people do not want us to go fast for the sake of being fast. \nThey want us to solve the problem, and they want a solution that makes \nsense to them. That is what will give the American people confidence, \nand confident American people are going to make our economy better, not \nthe Federal Government throwing their money around with reckless \nabandon.\n  Do not get me wrong, I understand the immediate need to jump-start \nour economy. The employment numbers released last week were stark \nevidence that jobs continue to disappear at a fearsome pace. People are \nfrightened, and they feel they have nowhere to turn. But in steering a \nship through a crisis such as this, Americans need to be confident that \nthe lawmakers have a steady hand on the tiller and a firm eye on the \nhorizon. And it is clear from the sinking poll numbers that this \nstimulus bill gives them no such confidence. Americans have had enough \nbailout baloney too. What we need is a new plan and a new approach.\n  Alice Rivlin, a former OMB and CBO Director, suggested we split this \nbill into smaller pieces. I agree, and some of my colleagues agree too. \nOur first priority should be an antirecession package that can be both \nenacted and spent quickly. Elements of this bill should meet very \nstrict criteria: The funds must spend out completely or expire by the \nend of this calendar year; the funds cannot be used to support \npermanent obligations such as entitlements or operating budgets; and \nthe funds must be targeted at specific needs.\n  A second, separate set of packages could be considered without the \nsame urgency after the completion of the antirecession package. These \nsmaller bills would include funds for long-run investments that are not \nneeded to enhance the future growth and productivity of the economy, \nincluding infrastructure investment, education, and worker retraining. \nI have been trying to get that through for 4 years.\n  Rushing this type of spending through, as we are doing in this bill \ntoday, ensures that mistakes will be made, plans will be poorly \ncrafted, and precious taxpayer money will be wasted. This bill's \nability to create jobs is dubious at best.\n  When combined with the outrageous cost of past bailouts for Wall \nStreet and the automakers and bailouts we are told are yet to come for \nthe banking and housing sectors, the only sure thing about this bill is \nthat taxes are going up for everybody--working Americans; senior \ncitizens; businesses small and large; and, as we have mentioned all \nalong, our children and grandchildren. No one will be spared the cost \nof this stealth expansion of the welfare state. I simply cannot support \na future tax increase the size this bill implies and will need. I plan \nto oppose this bloated bailout, and I urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I just want to remind my good friends on \nthe other side, this bill also cuts taxes by $300 billion. It is a tax \ncut. My colleagues love tax cuts. This bill cuts taxes by $300 billion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask the Senator from Montana, he does \nnot like tax cuts?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Very much I like tax cuts.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Good.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. But I might say, all I hear is complaints. I know the \nSenators on the other side like tax cuts, but they do not talk about \nthe good stuff in this bill. There is a lot that is good about this \nbill, and it would just be great if they would talk about some of the \ngood provisions as well because I know all my colleagues like tax cuts, \nincluding my dear friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I urge my colleagues on both sides who \nwish to speak to come over and speak.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I will yield to the Senator from \nCalifornia such time as she desires.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. I thank my good friend.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Baucus). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank you so much, I say to the Presiding Officer, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, the Senator from Montana, for giving \nme this time and also for your very strong leadership on this very \nimportant bill.\n  I think, as I listened to the Senator from Montana this morning, he \nlaid out the case for this bill better than I have heard, frankly, from \nanyone in\n\n[[Page S1997]]\n\nthe most clear fashion. When somebody tells you something is very \ncomplicated and you do not understand it, do not believe it.\n  There is a very simple, cogent, important, urgent reason for this \nbill: We need to save jobs, we need to create jobs, because if we do \nnot, at the rate we are shedding jobs in this country, we are going to \nbe headed for not a deep recession but perhaps even worse than that. My \nfriend who is presiding pointed out that 3.6 million jobs were lost \nlast year. How can anyone possibly turn away from that fact?\n  Saturday, I spoke on this bill and the need for it, and I had a \npicture of 1,000 people in Florida showing up at a job fair for 35 \nfirefighter jobs--1,000 people. It looked almost like a rock concert--\nall these young people trying to get in line and fill out the forms for \nthese jobs. The police had to come in--everyone was calm--just to make \nsure it was an orderly process.\n  My friend from Montana pointed out that history will judge us on how \nwe act right now. Again, just to keep it simple and focused, there are \nthree things we can do. One, do nothing. Doing nothing, to me, is \naction. It is action for the status quo. Doing nothing, to me, is a \nhostile act on the American people. Doing nothing, from my mind, is \nclosing our eyes to the election that was just held, an election that \nsaid: We need change.\n  Now, what else could we do? We could pass a perfect bill. Trust me \nwhen I tell you, I can write one perfect for me. The Senator from \nMontana can write the bill perfect for him. The Senator from Arizona, \nwho is leading the opposition--and, by the way, Senator McCain, I am \npleased he is out here doing that because I think the people in America \nunderstand the difference between Senator McCain's approach and \nPresident Obama's approach, and this debate is about that, make no \nmistake. So Senator McCain could write the perfect bill.\n  (Mrs. HAGAN assumed the Chair.)\n  I see Senator Hagan has come to the Chamber. She could write the \nperfect bill. Each of us could write the perfect bill for us. And guess \nwhat. If we each stood up here and said: My way or the highway, there \nwould be no bill, and therefore we would have nothing. Nothing is, in \nmy mind, a hostile act on the American people.\n  Then there is a third choice: a compromise, a compromise plan that \nhas been put together by Democratic Senators on our side and several \nRepublican Senators on the other side. Now, for the life of me, I do \nnot understand how anyone can say that is not bipartisan. Of course it \nis bipartisan.\n  Let me be clear, our Republican friends are filibustering this bill. \nWe could get 58 votes for this bill. We know that. That would be a \nstrong majority. We do not have 60, and we need Republicans to help us. \nSeveral have stepped forward, and I thanked them so much the other day, \nand I repeat it again.\n  So the three choices we have: do nothing is one choice, in the face \nof these horrific job losses and layoffs continuing--and in my State of \nCalifornia, I put in the Record Saturday company after company after \ncompany laying off, pulling in, fearful--we could do nothing; we could \nhave the perfect bill, which means that each of us will fight for that \nperfect bill--maybe we can get one or two others to agree it is \nperfect--or we can have a compromise bill. That is what is before us.\n  So just remember, if someone tells you this is not bipartisan, they \nare not telling you the truth because if they did not filibuster us, we \ncould pass a bill with 51 votes. They are forcing us to get 60 votes; \ntherefore, we must get Republicans to support us.\n  Passing this compromise means we get to conference with the House. \nNow, that is going to be a very tough conference, and my friend from \nMontana knows better than anyone how tough it will be.\n  I want to send a message to my friends in the House of \nRepresentatives: I know how you feel. I know things were left out of \nthis compromise that you desperately want in this bill. But I will say, \nyou should fight for that, but at the end of the day, again, go back to \nthe three options: doing nothing, doing the perfect bill, or doing the \ncompromise. My kids always say to me, ``You are where you are.'' And we \nknow where we are. We are in the middle of a filibuster. We have 58 \nDemocrats, and we need to pick up Republican support, and we have done \nso.\n\n  Now, I have to again point out to my colleagues why I feel my \nRepublican friends are being just a little bit disingenuous when they \nshed bitter tears about the debt. Let's face facts. I didn't see those \nbitter tears during the Bush years. We went from $5 trillion in debt to \n$10 trillion in debt. Now they are very worried about another $800 \nbillion. I understand they are worried. We didn't like the debt either, \nand we don't like the debt. When we were in charge with Bill Clinton, \nwe got that debt down. We turned deficits into surpluses. We know how \nto do that, and we will get our economic house in order. We have done \nit before. When the first President Bush handed us billions of dollars \nin deficits and trillions in debt, we worked on balancing that budget, \nand we handed George Bush a budget surplus--we Democrats did--a budget \nsurplus. Now the debt is $1 trillion, and our friends on the other side \ncry about it.\n  There is a cartoon in the paper today that was given to me, if I can \nfind it. I remember it. Oh, here it is. It is called ``Deficit \nPatrol.'' It is frame after frame of Republicans sleeping through the \nincrease in the debt. They slept through billions of dollars in tax \ncuts; never said a word about the debt. Those tax cuts were to their \nfriends, the highest earners. They slept through billions in debt to \ninvade Iraq, billions more for oil and gas subsidies, billions more for \nIraq, and this thing goes on and on. They kept snoozing through the \ndebt. The debt doubled. As a result of their action, every man, woman, \nand child in America carries an additional $17,000 of debt because of \nthe war in Iraq, subsidies to oil and gas, and because of tax cuts to \nthe very wealthy. Suddenly, now--when it is time to help working \nfamilies and invest in them and in our schools and rebuilding our \ninfrastructure and creating jobs--suddenly they wake up and say: Do you \nhave any idea what that will do to the debt?\n  Look, I support my friends on the other side having the right to do \nwhatever they want to stop this bill, but I will tell my colleagues \nwhat is hard for me: to have these tears about the debt when all \nthrough the Bush era we had an open checkbook for Iraq, an open \ncheckbook for the wealthiest Americans, and nobody cared about the \ndebt. Nobody cared. Nobody cared about the deficits on the other side. \nWe never had this conversation.\n  What I want to say is, we certainly learned from the depression era; \nthat when times are as rough as these times are, we must act. We must \nact. Now, it is sad to say we don't have a surplus, that we don't have \nthe debt on the way down, but that is the way it is. You are where you \nare. So we can either do nothing, do the perfect bill, or do the \ncompromise.\n  So I would say to every Member of the Senate and every Member of \nCongress that we need to work together. I watched President Obama and \njust a little bit of his townhall meeting. He is out there and he is \nanswering questions--some tough ones too--about why this is necessary, \nand he makes the point. He said: People go to the floor in Congress, in \nthe House and the Senate, and they say: Oh, my goodness, we are \nspending in the face of this recession. Well, that is the whole point. \nThere is no money in this economy. The banks won't lend. We have used \nthe monetary policy to bring interest rates to the banks way down. We \nfed money to the banks and perhaps we forestalled a complete crisis. \nHowever, I will tell my colleagues, they are still not doing what they \nshould in terms of lending. People are fearful. They are not spending. \nSo it is a vicious circle, and we need to stop this vicious circle. The \nway to do it is to save jobs from being lost and create new jobs.\n  Now, we know this all started with the housing crisis. Believe me, we \ntried on this side to pass housing legislation. Seven times we were \nfilibustered--seven. Seven times we were filibustered. We must address \nhousing, and I am glad to hear my colleagues on the other side coming \nup with some very good ideas on how to do that, and I agree with some \nof those ideas. This is a three-legged stool. We have to pass this jobs \nprogram, this jobs plan--and by the way, these jobs will be created in \nthe private sector as we go out to rebuild our roads and our bridges \nand our\n\n[[Page S1998]]\n\nschools and make them energy efficient. Private sector jobs will be \ncreated. These will be contracts. So the first leg of that stool is \njobs, jobs, jobs. That is what we are talking about.\n  Next we have to deal with the housing crisis, as I said, belatedly \nso. I would like to see mortgages down, mortgage rates down for folks \nwho will get a boost from that, an economic stimulus in their pocket \nfrom that. We have things we can do. Senator Durbin's plan for the \nbankruptcy courts is very important. If someone is underwater with \ntheir house, and they go to bankruptcy court, let's have the judge \nrestructure their loan. These are things we should and must do. That is \nthe second leg.\n  The third is the financial crisis. I know the Obama administration is \nlooking at some new ways, not just giving a blank check to these \ninstitutions, to these banks, but ensuring that they don't use it for \nbig high salaries for the people at the top, for golden parachutes, and \nthat in fact taxpayers have a stake in those institutions so we get \npaid back. That is a refreshing change. We are going to see that \ncoming. That is going to be a very tough vote. I don't know how I am \ngoing to wind up voting on that. It depends on how much of that is \naimed at the housing sector.\n  But that is tomorrow, and this is today, and we are where we are. \nThere have been more than 3 million jobs lost. Imagine that. In the \nState of Delaware there are less than 1 million people. So figure, it \nis almost four States of Delaware where every single person has lost \ntheir job. These are no ordinary times.\n  Around here, I learned after many years the easiest vote was no. Vote \nno. It is so much easier. You could point to something in the bill you \ndon't like--I say to my friend who is sitting in the chair, a wonderful \nnew Member--you can vote no and say: You know, on line 7, page 240, \nthere was something in there. It just brought me to a ``no'' vote. I \ncouldn't take it. I disagreed with it.\n  It is easy. It is the easiest way to vote because we don't know at \nthe end of the day whether this package is going to do every single \nthing we hope it will do. But I will tell my colleagues it will do some \nof those things. It will create jobs. It will save jobs. It will help \nour States. It will help our communities. It will help make us energy \nefficient. It will help make us energy independent. It will lead us on \nthe road to clean energy. It will unleash the technological genius of a \nlot of our people looking at clean energy.\n  I want to close by again thanking those Republicans who joined with \nus. I know how hard it is. I have been in situations where I have \nstepped out, done something not popular with my caucus. It is very \ndifficult. It is really hard, but at the end of the day we have to put \ncountry first. Country first. If you line up every economist in this \nNation from the left to the right, except for a few on either end of \nthe spectrum, they are all telling us to do a package about this size. \nDon't make it too small or it will be inefficient.\n  I think the Senator from Montana was very instructive when he pointed \nout that the tax cuts will kick in--certainly almost 100 percent of \nthem--in 2 years, and overall, 75 or 76 or even 80 percent of the \npackage, spending and tax cuts, will kick in, in the first 2 years. \nLarry Summers, a great economist working for President Obama, has said \nhe believes if a few dollars kick in 2 years out, that is not all bad \nbecause this is a deep recession. We are going to need those dollars as \nwell.\n  So to those three colleagues who came forward--I think I should say \nthe two who came forward with Ben Nelson, Senator Collins and Senator \nSpecter, taking the lead--thank you. I know it is hard. You are \nreaching out to this new President. He has everything on his shoulders. \nThis is what he promised. He promised he would not sit back and allow \nthe policies of the past to dominate: bickering, bickering, bickering, \nnever getting anything done, and finding fault just for the sake of \nbeing able to vote no.\n  Saturday I read into the Record a story about one of my constituents \nwho has been out of work and out of work and out of work. He worked in \nthe high-tech sector. He can't find a job. He is just desperate. He had \nto place his children into foster care. We cannot do nothing. When my \nfriends on the other side say, oh, they are for doing something, at the \nend of the day, it seems to me, by making us reach a 60-vote, \nfilibuster-proof majority, they are making it tough for us to do \nsomething. Let's not forget that. They are filibustering this bill. \nThat is why we need to get 60 votes. So they are slowing it down and \nslowing it down and slowing it down. As a matter of fact, they stand \nhere and say: What is the rush?\n\n  I will tell them what the rush is: people being laid off every day, \npeople losing health care every day, people losing confidence every \nday, people losing housing every day, people losing hope every day, \neconomists telling us to move swiftly every day. So don't say you are \nfor something when you are making us get a 60-vote supermajority, \nbecause people are smart in this country. They get it. They know what \nyou are saying when you all of a sudden are afraid of the debt because \nwe are doing things you don't like. You didn't mind going into debt for \nthe war in Iraq--open checkbook. Rebuilding Iraq? Fine. Tax cuts for \nthe wealthy few? Wonderful. No problem. You should look at that \ncartoon. It says it better. It just happens to be in Politico.\n  So don't say you want to do something and then set up a 60-vote \nhurdle. Don't say you want to do something, but you are afraid of the \ndebt when, for 8 long years, you have doubled the debt from $5 billion \nto $10 billion. Say the truth. Say the truth. I think I know what the \ntruth is. You don't really like investing in schools. You don't like \ninvesting in workers. You don't really think it makes sense at this \ntime to build more infrastructure. You don't like helping our cities. \nThat is the truth.\n\n  But we believe that is the way to stimulate this economy and grow it, \nstop it from sliding, reverse it. We are going to try to do it. We \nstill have a long road ahead of us, no question about it. This isn't \neasy, but we are on the path to do it. I hope the American people will \nlisten to our President both today and tonight when he holds his press \nconference. I hope the people will listen to this debate because it is \nvery clear where the sides line up.\n  What we need to do is the right thing for America. Those choices are \nclear: Do nothing, hold out for your perfect bill, or embrace the \ncompromise. I am embracing the compromise, and I urge my colleagues to \ndo it. I hope more will do it from the other side. I think it will be \nsuch a vote of confidence in the future and confidence in this \nPresident and confidence in this country if we can pick up more votes \non the other side. I hope we will. I am very pleased to have had this \nopportunity to speak.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I am going to speak both about the general \napproach to the so-called stimulus package, as well as the deal reached \nat the end of last week that we will be voting on at 5:30 this \nafternoon.\n  First, let me say you can usually tell when proponents of an idea \ndon't have good arguments for their proposition. They generally set up \na false premise, what is sometimes called a ``strawman.''\n  It goes like this: We can't just sit here and do nothing. I ask \nanyone here, has anybody in this Chamber said we have to do nothing in \nthe face of this crisis? No. Everyone who has spoken on both sides has \nsaid we have to do something. Has anybody here said we need to slow \ndown and not act with alacrity because there is no problem or real \nemergency facing us? No. I think everybody has said we have a real \nproblem in this country, people are hurting, and we have to do \nsomething as quickly as we can.\n  It is not a choice between doing nothing or doing something. It is \nnot a choice between acting quickly or taking our sweet old time at it. \nThere is a legitimate difference of opinion. One reason we have \nliberals and conservatives and Democrats and Republicans is we have \npeople in this country who are smart and very patriotic, but they \ndisagree about the best way to proceed ahead in various situations, \nincluding the crisis we are in right now. So let's don't denigrate the \narguments of the other side.\n  I respect what my colleagues are saying. They believe spending a lot \nof\n\n[[Page S1999]]\n\nmoney in the way they are doing it is the right way to go forward. As \nthe President has said: What do you think a stimulus bill is except a \nspending bill? I understand what he means. If you spend a lot of money, \nthe theory goes, jobs will be created and that will stimulate the \neconomy. But the original test he and others in his administration set \nforth was a little more precise than that. It was the correct test, put \nforth by Larry Summers, who said they are going to be choosing \ninvestments ``strategically based on what yields the highest rate of \nreturn for our economy.'' That is the right approach, not just spending \nfor spending's sake; not just throwing a lot of money at the wall and \nseeing what sticks but targeting investments to see what really works.\n  Unfortunately, that is not what has been done here. Let me give you \none example. In the debate we had after the deal was announced by the \nSenators who went off and negotiated some reductions in the original \nbill, there was the comment made that the House bill was just a \nChristmas tree--I will quote it:\n\n       It was a Christmas tree upon which every member virtually \n     had his or her favorite project. It was bloated, expensive, \n     and ineffective.\n\n  That was the criticism of the House bill. Now, the deal struck by \nthese Senators reduced some of the spending in various parts of the \nSenate bill. But it turns out that the final product is actually $7 \nbillion more than the House bill they just criticized. So even though \nthey cut some money at the margins, the various pieces of the bill, \nbecause of other things that were added in the Senate which they didn't \ncut, the total Senate bill is even more than the House bill.\n  I ask, is this money really targeted? One of the things one of the \nauthors of this deal said made it a good deal was they added $14 \nbillion in Pell grants. Now, Pell grants are the money that each year \nthe Appropriations Committee appropriates so that students can get a \ngrant from the U.S. Government to go to college. We do it every year. \nIt is a good program. People love to take advantage of it. It has never \nbeen viewed as a stimulus package. That money is appropriated every \nyear through the regular appropriations process. But we have added $14 \nbillion in Pell grants.\n  Pell grants means students who graduate from high school can go to \ncollege. They are not getting a job; they are not going out into the \nworkplace. The teachers teaching them already have jobs teaching. I \ndon't know where the jobs are created here.\n  My point is twofold. It is a worthwhile program. We do it every year \nas part of the regular appropriations process. Why is it included in \nthis bill as if it is going to stimulate something, as if it will \ncreate new jobs? It is not a stimulus. We do it every year. It is not a \ntargeted investment strategically based on what yields the highest rate \nof return from the economy. It is sending kids to college, which is, of \ncourse, a good thing, but it should not be part of the stimulus \npackage.\n  The stimulus package, with regard to spending, is supposed to \nidentify those things that will require a lot of people to go to work \nand, therefore, get hired on to do jobs. But this is an example of the \nkind of thing that isn't targeted strategically to achieve that \nobjective.\n  Another item was $6 billion for special education. Special education \nis a good thing. We appropriate money for it every year in the regular \nappropriations process. Why is it in this bill? Emergency spending? You \ndon't have to offset it with spending reductions somewhere else or tax \nincreases. It goes right to the bottom line of the deficit. It doesn't \nhave to compete with anything else. As far as I know, you don't have a \nlot of special education teachers who are unemployed today. As a matter \nof fact, in education and health care you have the lowest unemployment \nrates in the country, around 2 to 3 percent. What is the targeted \nnature of this?\n  It turns out these are things the people in the room making the deal \nwere all for. They wanted to make sure these programs got funded well \nthis year, so they stuck them in the bill. This is not targeted. It is \nnot stimulative, for the most part. It is just money we think would be \na good idea to spend.\n  So a bill that was intended to encourage economic growth originally \nby investing in high-return projects has turned into a wild spending \nspree that is out of proportion and reason and won't achieve the \nobjective it was intended for. In the process, it is going to cause \ntremendous waste. CBO noted that Government agencies don't have the \nability to spend this kind of money quickly and efficiently. They are \nasking them to spend a lot of money quickly. That, obviously, results \nin a lot of waste.\n  Even so, the reality is, they cannot spend that much money, as it \nturns out. In fact, less than half of the discretionary money of the \nkind I just identified will be spent before 2011--less than half. So \nmore than half of the money we will start spending in 2011 and beyond. \nI hope the recession is over by 2011. So by that definition, over half \nof the money doesn't go to stimulate the economy and create jobs. It is \nongoing, more permanent spending.\n\n  We actually create around 30 new Federal programs in this bill and \nover $180 billion in mandatory or permanent spending. So it is not \ntargeted for stimulative relief in the short run.\n  Now, one of my colleagues said we should acknowledge requiring 60 \nvotes, as if that is somehow wrong, and Republicans are filibustering \nthe bill.\n  Let's understand we started debating this bill about 1 week ago. We \nare spending more money than we have ever spent in a piece of \nlegislation in the history of the United States of America, and we have \nonly spent 1 week at it, and the critical vote is at 5:30 tonight--1 \nweek after we started the debate. That is hardly filibustering. That is \na point on which we don't need to spend any further time.\n  There are still so many things in the bill that are wasteful. Time \ndoesn't permit getting into all of it. Let me note some of the things \nwe had talked about originally that I thought at least the people who \nmade this deal would want to cut to avoid embarrassment. It appears \nthat these things are in the bill: transition to digital TV. I am not \nsure how that creates jobs. There is another $300 million for Federal \nGovernment cars. That may help the auto companies. There is money for \nAmtrak. There is $1 billion for the census. There are green cards for \nthe military. There are Filipino veterans of World War II in the \nPhilippines.\n  As I said, none of these things create jobs. They may be good ideas. \nLet them compete through the regular appropriations process and see how \nmany would actually get through that process and what the priority \nwould be.\n  About a year ago, Amity Shlaes, a historian, wrote a book called \n``The Forgotten Man'' about the Great Depression. The title was used \nfor two reasons. It is a phrase Franklin Delano Roosevelt used in one \nof his speeches kicking off one of his programs. It actually was \nborrowed from another person who was referring to, in today's terms, \nthe ``little guy'' in our economy who bears the burden in our economy, \nwho lives and plays by the rules and works hard and ends up paying the \ntaxes on which everybody else relies. That is who the real forgotten \nman was at that time.\n  I think there are a couple of forgotten groups of people here too. \nThe first are the small businesses. I note about three-tenths of the \ntotal package is dedicated to small business relief. Yet small \nbusinesses create 80 percent of all new jobs. This is supposed to be a \njob creation bill. Think about that. Small businesses create 80 percent \nof the jobs, so you would think a good piece of the relief would go to \nsmall business. No, it is just three-tenths of 1 percent. They are the \nforgotten folks.\n  The other group of forgotten folks includes our children and our \ngrandchildren. I have two grandchildren, one whose birthday was \nyesterday and one whose is today. I cannot believe how fast they are \ngrowing up. I think about the legacy we are going to leave them in \nterms of all of this debt. It is very clear, from the CBO and all the \nothers who have examined this that this $1 trillion is going right to \nour deficit. We are going from a $1 trillion deficit to a $2 trillion \ndeficit next year. Eventually, of course, the debt has to be paid back.\n  Other countries are buying much of the debt. When they say: We want \nour money back, Americans have to do one of two things: produce their \nway out of the debt; that is to say, have such a robust economy that it \nis producing a lot\n\n[[Page S2000]]\n\nof tax revenue to pay the debt back or, inevitably, there will be a tax \nincrease.\n  Unfortunately, because of the effects of this bill, according to CBO, \nafter 10 years there will be negative economic growth; that is to say, \nminus one- to three-tenths of a percent of negative growth over what it \nwould have been. We cannot count on growth to lift us out of the \neconomic situation we will be in. They say it is a little like a sugar \nhigh. We may get stimulus right away, and like when you have the sugar \nhigh, you then crash.\n  So they are talking about .1 to .3 percent decline in GDP. Obviously, \nwe cannot count on economic growth to produce the revenue to pay back \nthe people who bought the debt. That could mean a tax increase. That \nwould be a very bad thing to leave these kids and grandkids I love as \npart of what I did on my watch, to say we spent the money today so they \ncould pay it back later.\n  All I am saying is, we need to be much more careful about what we are \ndoing. If we were talking about $200 million or $300 million, I would \nsay we can take a chance; that it is a lot of money, but let's see if \nit works. Nobody knows for sure whether this will work. Anybody who \nsays they know this will work, you can believe one thing: They are not \ntelling you the truth.\n  Nobody knows. But to spend $1 trillion and not know whether it is \ngoing to work is very bothersome. One of my colleagues said a trillion \ndollars is a terrible thing to waste. I don't think we would be wasting \n$1 trillion. A lot of this will actually build something we can use \nlater, so it is not all going to be wasted. As CBO said, you cannot \nspend this much without wasting a bunch of money.\n  Since most of it is not targeted to job creations, for reasons I \nmentioned, even though it may produce some result later on, the \nquestion has to be asked: Is it worth the expenditure now, in view of \nthe crowdout effect in the private economy? Every dollar we spend is \nmoney that is crowded out in the private sector which, at the end of \nthe day, is what creates jobs.\n  Looking at that three-tenths of 1 percent for small business is \nillustrative of the point. Small business creates 80 percent of the \njobs in the country. You would think we would be focused on small \nbusinesses if we are talking about spending money in this bill to get \njob creation. Yet only three-tenths of 1 percent goes to small \nbusiness.\n  Our point is, we are not being wise in the way we are spending this \nmoney, that we should be much more wise and that the deal that was \nstruck last weekend to get the votes to pass the bill does nothing more \nthan shave off some of the money at the top but does not fundamentally \nattack the problem I believe should be attacked.\n  For that reason, I hope my colleagues will reconsider, and when we \nhave this vote in about 3 hours, that they will consider the \npossibility that we could do better, that we could do better by making \nmore modifications to this bill than were done in the so-called deal \nthat was struck last weekend. Hopefully, if they vote no, we will have \nthe opportunity to go back and do that. If we don't, we are on this \nslippery slope to spend $1 trillion to an uncertain outcome, except we \nknow we eventually will have negative growth and a lot of waste to show \nfor our efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, first, let me state something that is \nunexpected at this time. I was with Wade Paschal yesterday, and we were \ntalking a little bit about love, something we don't see or sense a lot \nof in this body. In 1 Corinthians 13:13, there are three things--faith, \nhope, and love, and the greatest of these is love. I find myself faced \nwith this dichotomy sometimes with feeling this and yet telling the \ntruth at the same time because sometimes the truth isn't that prevalent \naround here either.\n  I had an unpleasant experience last Thursday with the junior Senator \nfrom West Virginia. I was pretty well assailed in different ways, and \nyet it really didn't bother me. Keith Oberlin called me the worst \nperson in the world; Vanity Fair, a conspiracy theorist. I have to say \nthis, though: At least they are all liberals. I love them all.\n  Having said that, let me discuss the politics of what is happening \nright now because this is something I think is going to end up being a \npositive thing for Republicans. I know not many people have thought \nthis through in the same way I am going to present it.\n  Tonight the Senate will vote on whether to shut off debate--well, \nfirst of all, it needs to be clarified. A lot of people do not know \nwhat is going to happen tonight. I have been asked a lot of questions: \nIs it tonight at 5:30 or tomorrow? The key vote is tonight. This one \nneeds 60 votes to cut off a filibuster. They have to have, in this \nSenate, two Republicans. If all Republicans stuck together in this \nSenate, such as they did in the House last week, this legislation would \nbe dead. It wouldn't go anywhere. However, that is not what is going to \nhappen.\n  Martin Feldstein called this an $800 billion mistake. He is not the \nonly one disappointed in the Senate. Democrats worked hard in the past \nweek to make this nearly a $900 billion mistake. In fact, the \nCongressional Budget Office reported, during the House consideration of \nits $820 billion version of this spending bill, that the cost of \nservicing the debt on all new debt created by this bill would be \nroughly $347 billion over 10 years, which means at $820 billion, the \nreal cost, as we have heard before from many other people, would be \n$1.2 trillion.\n  It is a hard thing for people to grasp. It is hard for me. I remember \nwhen we were talking about the $700 billion bill that came up last \nOctober in the bailout, as it has been called, trying to put that into \nwords so people would understand it.\n  If you take the 140 million families who file tax returns--and do \nyour math--that is $5,000 a family. Now we are talking about something \nfar greater than that.\n  I have been quoted as saying this bill we are going to be considering \nat 5:30 p.m. today is 93 percent spending and 7 percent stimulant. We \nknow what stimulant is. We know what it takes to stimulate the economy. \nWhen I talk about what is in this bill to stimulate, I find only two \nthings. One, a very small tax provision, accelerated depreciation and a \nloss carryback provision and, second, it has $27 billion in highway \nconstruction. This is interesting because the House bill actually had \n$30 billion. My feeling is if we are going to spend all this money, \nlet's at least get something for it, provide some jobs, get some roads, \nhighways and bridges, things this country needs. But they elected not \nto do that.\n  If you add together the accelerated depreciation and the tax \nbenefits, that is about 3\\1/2\\ percent, and the $27 billion is about \n3\\1/2\\ percent of the total amount we are going to be talking about. \nThat is where you get 7 percent of stimulus and 93 percent spending.\n  We know what works. That is the issue that is frustrating to a lot of \npeople. We know how to stimulate the economy. We have done it. At the \nend of World War I, they said: We raised taxes to support the war. Now \nwe are going to reduce taxes because we don't need that money anymore. \nThey reduced taxes, and it increased the revenues.\n  The real one who discovered this who had the foresight was President \nKennedy. President Kennedy, during that time, made a statement that we \nhave to have more revenue to run all these Great Society programs, and \nthe best way to increase revenue is to reduce marginal rates. He did. \nHe lowered tax rates across the board. He helped create the longest \neconomic expansion in American history.\n  Listen to this: Between 1961 and 1968, the economy grew by 42 \npercent--42 percent. Fast forward to the eighties. In the eighties, we \nhad a President named Ronald Reagan. In 1980, the total amount of \nrevenue that was derived from the marginal rates was $244 billion. In \n1990, it was $466 billion. It almost doubled in the decade that had the \nlargest tax reductions in this Nation's history. So we know what we can \ndo.\n  I have to say that a lot of this started with the $700 billion \nmistake that was made, in my opinion, back in October. The Senate voted \n74 to 25 to empower one unelected bureaucrat to buy billions of \ndollars' worth of troubled assets. As it turned out, interestingly \nenough, he didn't do that. That is what he said he was going to do. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S2001]]\n\nwhat he told me personally he was going to do.\n  Finally, after all this bailout mania extended to the auto industry, \nCongress had the opportunity to redeem itself on the second half of \nthat $700 billion mistake. In that vote, 33 Republicans and only 9 \nDemocrats voted disapproving release of the second $350 billion.\n  We have to look at what has been going on in the debate. We are \ndebating this multibillion-dollar legislation, and I think some of my \nRepublican colleagues are too gracious to lay collective blame where it \nshould be, and that is clearly on the Democratic side.\n  As the House considered this spending bill in a vote of 244 to 188, \nnot a single Republican voted in favor of the $820 billion spending \nbill. Only by Republicans sticking together, 100 percent together in \nthe Senate, can we stop this $1.2 trillion mistake. But should it pass \nthis week, no one should be fooled and think it was done in a \nbipartisan way.\n  At the end of the Senate's consideration of H.R. 1, we are voting \ntonight to end debate on what is going to be called a compromise \nproposal. It is being called a compromise proposal. Let me tell the \nAmerican people that the vote tonight on a proposal supported by all \nthe Democrats and two Republicans is the furthest thing from a \ncompromise proposal. In fact, the proposal we are now considering makes \nthis past week in the Senate a waste of all our time.\n  Why do I say that? Let's look at the numbers. The House passed an \n$820 billion bill. In the Senate, we started with nearly $855 billion, \nmore than the House. Although the compromise proposal reportedly only \ncosts $780 billion, it includes the cost-raising amendments the Senate \nconsidered, bringing the price tag to around $827 billion. So what we \nare going to be considering tonight is actually $7 billion more than \nthe House bill.\n\n  I do believe Senator McCain made an excellent statement. I am going \nto read the statement because I think he captures it. This is on the \nfloor of the Senate. He said:\n\n       There are 178 Members of the House of Representatives who \n     are Republicans. They all voted against the bill, plus 11 \n     Democrats. There are 40 Republican Senators here. We now have \n     2, count them, 2, who have decided behind closed doors, \n     without consultation with the other 38, to come to an \n     agreement, which you can call it a lot of things but \n     bipartisan isn't one of them, unless you say that 2 \n     individuals and possibly a third, but no more than that out \n     of 40, are in agreement. I've been involved in a lot of \n     bipartisan legislation . . .\n\n  What we are talking about is 2 out of 535 in the Congress. This \ncannot be considered by anyone to be bipartisan.\n  I offered some amendments I thought would be good that would actually \nstimulate the economy. There are two of them. One was to redirect over \n$5 billion from programs, such as television coupons, trail \nimprovements, renovations to Federal buildings in Washington, DC, to \nmilitary spending and procurement. According to economic reports by \nStandard & Poor's, defense spending along with infrastructure \ninvestment and tax cuts has a greater stimulative impact on the economy \nthan anything else the Government can do. However, how did my amendment \nfare? Thirty-seven Republicans and Senator Lieberman voted in favor of \nit. All the Democrats voted against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has spoken for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to continue \nspeaking for another 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Can the Senator make that 5?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Five is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, that is part of it. The other is \ninfrastructure. To cut this short, the Department of Transportation \nrecently estimated that for every $1 million invested in highways and \nbridges, 27,800 jobs were created, and the last jobless numbers show \nthat 899,000 construction workers have lost their jobs. If you do the \nmath and take both these amendments, had they been adopted, it would \nhave provided over 4 million jobs. This is the number President Obama \nhas talked about doing. Again, it should not have been defeated, but it \nwas right down party lines.\n  We have had several amendments. Senator McCain had probably the best \none because it substituted reducing payroll taxes, lowering marginal \nrates, lowering corporate rates, offering accelerated depreciation for \nsmall business. This is exactly what Presidents Kennedy and Reagan did. \nOn this amendment, all the Republicans voted for it and all the \nDemocrats voted against it.\n  A bipartisan amendment was offered to allow repatriation of foreign \nearnings at a reduced tax rate.\n  Senator DeMint offered a substitute with provisions to reduce \ncorporate taxes and individual marginal rates, repeal the AMT, reduce \ncapital gains and estate taxes. The result of that amendment was 36 \nRepublicans supporting it and 57 Democrats opposing it.\n  Senator Thune offered a substitute to reduce marginal rates, offer \nAMT relief, offer bonus depreciation and small business tax relief, \ndeductions for health coverage, and homebuyer assistance. The result of \nthat amendment was 37 Republicans supporting it and 57 Democrats \nopposing it.\n  All these amendments would have stimulated the economy; however, they \nwere all killed down party lines.\n  The reasons I said at the beginning--and I planned to get into a lot \nmore detail, but I didn't know we would be operating under the rules \nunder which we are operating. This does have a happy ending. Katie, my \ndaughter--Senator Kyl was talking about his two grandchildren. These \nare my 20 kids and grandchildren. I equally have a great concern over \nwhat is happening. This little girl, Katie, my daughter, and these \nlittle girls asked the question: What does the United States do? If we \ndid that, would our country go bankrupt?\n  I said: No. I want you to remember 1992. In 1992, a very similar \nthing happened. We had a Democrat in the White House, we had a \nDemocratic-controlled House, a Democratic-controlled Senate, and we saw \nwhat happened. They started spending money. We had Hillary health care. \nAll these things the American people know won't work.\n\n  So I would say this: I believe what is happening today, as bad as it \nsounds to conservatives right now, are things that can change this, if \nit will get the attention of the American people. I believe we are \ngoing through the same thing we did in 1992 and we are going to have \nthe same results we had in 1994. This is the largest spending in the \nhistory of humankind and in the history of the world, and it is \nsomething we should not let happen, but it is going to happen right \ndown party lines.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I always enjoy hearing my friend from \nOklahoma. But I regret he feels that what is happening in America today \nsomehow relates to 1992, implying that when Democrats assume power, \nsomehow things are going to collapse, and we find ourselves in a tough \nsituation because all they want to do is spend, and all this and that. \nThe fact is there is plenty of blame to go around with respect to what \nhas happened in this country. It is not one party, it is both parties.\n  I say to my friend: We have seen a hemorrhaging of red ink in this \ncountry the last 8 years. I am not going to spend time talking about \nit--but I could, and almost should, except I don't think it contributes \ntoo much at this time to point out that we decided to go to war and not \npay for a penny of it in 8 years, to charge it all and run up the \nFederal debt. Look, there are a lot of things wrong. A lot of things \nhave been done wrong by the past administration, by Republicans and by \nDemocrats. I understand all that. That is not the issue. The question \nis what do we do to put it right.\n  You know, there was a situation in Miami the other day. They had 35 \njobs for firefighters and a thousand people showed up to apply. Now, \nlook at these faces. Look at the faces of these people, one by one. All \nthey hope for is an opportunity. A thousand of them showing up, \nthinking perhaps they will get a shot at one job, because there are \nonly 35 available. These people don't\n\n[[Page S2002]]\n\ngive a rip whether you are talking about Republicans or Democrats. All \nthey care about is whether you can talk about what might succeed to \nhelp put their life back in order, to help put this economy back on \ntrack, and to give them a feeling that they might have an opportunity \nto find a good job, one that pays well and provides benefits, and one \nthat allows them to help take care of their family. That is all they \ncare about. That is why a thousand of them lined up down the sidewalk \nin search of 35 jobs.\n  Now, this looks like a crowded picture. But what if we could take a \nlook at 2.6 million of them? There is no picture of the 2.6 million. \nThat is the number of people who lost their jobs last year. Actually, \nit turned out to be just over 3 million in the last 12 months. What if \nwe had a picture of the last 2 months, with over 1 million people \nlining up wanting a job because they got laid off? Think of it.\n  More than one million people had to come home, or call home and say \nto their family, the person they love, you know what, I have lost my \njob. No, it is not because I have done a bad job. I have worked here \n10, 15, 20 years, and I did everything I could. I got all evaluations \nthat were in the top 5 percent. I am a terrific worker, but I lost my \njob because the company had to cut back.\n  I wish we could have a picture of a million people lined up so we \nwould understood the faces and the agony and the despair of losing your \njob in the last 2 months. And it would describe the urgency. No, not \nthe urgency to come and talk about Democrats and Republicans, but the \nurgency to talk about what we can do to put this place back on track.\n  I wonder sometimes whether anyone knows what exactly the right \nmedicine or the right dose of medicine is needed to fix what ails this \neconomy. I confess I don't know. I know what we shouldn't do. I have a \npretty good handle on what we shouldn't do. Let's not take the position \nof being an observer and deciding, you know what, we intend to do \nnothing. Let whatever happens happen. If our economy is perched on the \nedge of a cliff and falls off the side to a deep depression, so be it. \nThat is not my position. I think our position has to be to do whatever \nwe can to try to put a foundation under this economy and see if we can \nlift this economy to provide jobs, provide growth, and expand and give \npeople hope once again.\n  I have given many speeches on the floor of the Senate about the past. \nI have talked about what has caused this wreck--and this clearly is a \nwreck. In 1999, this Congress and the President decided what we wanted \nto do was to get rid of all those old-fashioned things that were put in \nplace after the Great Depression to separate traditional banking from \nrisk. Let's get rid of all of that and see if we can allow banks to \ncreate big old holding companies and merge, and so it happened. They \nran that through here like a hot knife through butter, and everybody \nwas fat and happy and singing songs of celebration.\n  Not me. I voted against all that. I fought against it all. I said at \nthe time that within a decade I thought we would see massive taxpayer \nbailouts. And we have. The biggest financial institutions in this \ncountry, the biggest banks and the biggest financial institutions in \nthis country got involved in a series of risks--buying toxic assets, \ndoing things that were unbelievable--and the whole tent came collapsing \ndown. Then we were told, you know what, it is the taxpayers' \nresponsibility. So the Federal Reserve Board rushes in with a net and a \npillow to say to the big financing institutions: We have money for you.\n  You know, it is interesting. We are told now, at the latest count, \nthat $8.9 trillion--no, not the $800 billion we are talking about on \nthe floor of the Senate--but $8.9 trillion has been used of taxpayers' \nfunds to lend and guarantee certain things, most of it by the Federal \nReserve Board and some by FDIC. Most of it was done without a vote. It \nis done well outside the sunlight of good government. In fact, an \nenterprising news organization called Bloomberg had to sue the Federal \nGovernment to find out how much has been committed.\n  I don't know that there is some divine right of all the biggest banks \nin this country--who got bigger and created holding companies and \nbecame too big to fail--to be kept to succeed and to continue to live. \nMaybe--and we won't talk about this much, because no one wants to--we \nshould recreate or create new financial institutions. But no one wants \nto talk about that. Why is it we decide to invest in failure? Probably \nwe should invest in success. Maybe we should decide, if these financial \ninstitutions ran this country into the ditch, to create new financial \ninstitutions, to help capitalize those institutions that won't do that.\n  Again, briefly, as I talk about why we must do something, it is not \nstrange that we have seen this wreckage. I had someone on Saturday at a \nmeeting I was at in North Dakota, saying: You know what, the government \nhas caused all this. I said: I tell you what, the government has plenty \nto answer for. You are darned right the government has a part of it--\nfighting a war without paying for it. Part of it is a trade deficit of \n$700 billion to $800 billion a year. Most people here are willfully \nblind about the fact that we are consuming significantly more than we \nproduce. Two billion dollars a day represents our trade deficit, every \nsingle day. You can't keep doing that. Our fiscal policy deficits are \nway out of control because we fought a war and we didn't pay for it. So \ngovernment has plenty to answer for.\n  But I told the person who asked me that question--isn't this all the \ngovernment's fault?--I said: Government didn't put out all this bad \npaper. That was greedy mortgage companies out there writing bad \nmortgages, unbelievable mortgages, no different than Madoff's Ponzi \nscheme, and then packaging them in securities and selling up to hedge \nfunds, and then selling up to investment banks, and the whole country \nis larded now with toxic assets that we are told threaten the entire \nbanking system. So now the American taxpayer has to be a backstop in \norder to save the very companies that ran this into the ditch.\n  You wonder why the smartest in the room, the best and the brightest, \ndidn't understand it was a bad security when you put a mortgage into \nthe hands of someone who can't pay it and then tell them they only have \nto pay interest; you don't have to pay any principal; in fact, if you \ndon't want to pay interest, you can pay no principal and only partial \ninterest, and you don't have to document your income in order to get a \nloan from us. Bad credit, no credit, bankrupt, slow pay, no pay, then \nyou come to us. Those were the advertisements by Millennium Credit, \nZoom Credit, and Countrywide Mortgage. They all did it, and they put \nout a lot of bad paper. The whole thing's collapsed.\n\n  The banks were all happy because they were all buying these things \nand they had high yields. And the reason they had high yields is they \nloaded them up with prepayment penalties, so the borrower couldn't get \nout of it. So here we are with this system that has collapsed around \nus, and what are the consequences? Do you think most of the people who \ndid this have lost their jobs with the big banks? Absolutely not. They \nare still accepting big paychecks. But these people lining up in Miami, \na thousand of them for 35 jobs, are the victims of an economy that has \ncollapsed.\n  The question is: Do we do nothing? Some of my colleagues are \nperfectly content to do that. They come to the floor and talk about, \nyou know what, this is all about 1992; or let's go back to Calvin \nCoolidge. How about let's blame it on Calvin Coolidge or Jimmy Carter? \nIt doesn't make any sense at all to be doing that. Let's talk about \nwhere we find ourselves and where we want to be and how we might get \nfrom here to there.\n  I confess I don't know exactly what is going to work. I used to teach \na little economics in college, but I don't know that there is any \neconomist or anybody who can say that if we do these three things, this \nis going to work. I confess that we don't know. Normally, there are two \ntools in the toolbox to try to fix the economic engine of this country: \nOne is called fiscal policy--taxing and spending. But the fact is we \nhave had a stimulative fiscal policy for a long time. We have been \nrunning big deficits for a long time, so it is not exactly that that \ntool hasn't been available. That tool has been used and reused, and I \ndon't know how effective it is. The other tool in\n\n[[Page S2003]]\n\nthe toolbox is monetary policy. There is nothing in the toolbox left \nthere. Interest rates are down nearly to zero with respect to the Fed \nand what it charges. So there is not much juice left in monetary \npolicy. But what the Fed has done is used its ability--somewhere in the \nshadows--to push a lot of money out the door with no transparency as to \nwho got what and how it was used. So I don't know, with respect to the \nfiscal or monetary policy, the impulses they might have to help fix \nthis economy.\n  What I do know is this: A piece of legislation--an economic recovery \nplan--has been put together. That follows on the heels of the $700 \nbillion TARP legislation--the Troubled Asset Relief Program. I voted \nagainst TARP, and am happy I did. I didn't think they had the foggiest \nidea what they were going to do with that money, and I was dead right. \nI have no idea where it went or what was accomplished with it. There \nwas no accountability and no strings attached. This is different. This \nlegislation is an attempt to say: You know, we can learn at least \nsomething from some things that we have tried in the past.\n  We have an unbelievable backlog in infrastructure investment that \nshould have been made in this country and has not. I will give an \nexample: In the last few years, we have been funding 900 water projects \nin the country of Iraq with taxpayers' money--900 water projects. We \nhave tens of billions of dollars in infrastructure backlog in this \ncountry--of water projects--which we have not been doing what we should \nabout. So how about investing here at home repairing the roads, \nrepairing the bridges, repairing other infrastructure--building the \nwater projects that are authorized and ready to go, fully designed and \nfully engineered? That puts people to work. It puts people on a \npayroll. It takes people out of this line and says, we will put people \nto work even as we build infrastructure for this country's future. Is \nthat a good thing? It seems to me it probably is.\n  My colleagues have put together a piece of legislation, and I have \nbeen a part of it. I was involved in the negotiations last Friday for \nabout 3 hours to see if we could find middle ground, which we have \ndone. We cut nearly $110 billion out of the proposal that existed. I \nwas all in favor of those cuts. It seemed to me there were areas that \ncould and should be trimmed, and now are trimmed from that proposal. \nBut at this point, the question is: What do we do?\n  I certainly have respect for those who have a different view. Some \nhave a view we should simply use tax cuts, because tax cuts have the \nbiggest juice. But the economists say that is not true. It isn't the \ncase. And besides, if that were the menu, we have been through a decade \nof that. We know the function of all of that. So I have respect for \nthose who believe that; I just believe there is a different approach. \nThe key is not to use some proxy to put people back to work. The key, \nat the short term, is to see if you can put people back to work now \ndoing something that represents gainful employment and which will build \nan asset for this country.\n  That is what our attempt is here. And, boy, I think there is plenty \nof reason to be critical. I understand that fully. The question is: Are \nwe willing to do something? I have often told my colleagues, I think it \nwas Mark Twain who was asked once if he would be willing to engage in a \ndebate. He said: Oh sure, as long as I can take the negative side. And \nthe person who asked said: But we haven't even told you what the \nsubject is. He said: Oh, it doesn't matter. The negative side will take \nno preparation.\n  So it is easy, it seems to me, to decide what doesn't work and to \noppose it. It is much more difficult to decide how you put together \nsomething that is constructive and positive that you think will give \nthis country some help and some hope.\n\n  I said when I started, I don't know, and no one does, exactly what \nwill work. I told a meeting on Saturday when I was asked the question: \nCan you guarantee this will work? I said: No, I can't. There isn't one \nperson you can bring into this room who can tell you, yes. If they do, \nthey are not telling you the truth.\n  What unites all of us is none of us have ever been here before. We \nhave never seen a circumstance where the system of finance has \nvirtually collapsed with toxic assets laced everywhere in the system, a \nsystem in which we have had a subprime loan scandal. It has resulted \nnow in the complete collapse of the housing bubble--which was, by the \nway, aided and abetted by my friend, Alan Greenspan, who was supposed \nto have been overseeing this sort of thing and did not. But now you \nhave, according to Martin Feldstein, one in four homes in this country \nin which the home has less value than the mortgage on the home. That is \na pretty significant problem.\n  Then you have 598,000 people told their jobs are gone as of the last \nmonth and a half million people the month before. It is running into \nthe millions of people who lose their jobs and lose their homes and \nthen lose hope and lose confidence.\n  I would say this: When I taught economics--I did the things you do. \nYou teach the supply-demand curves, Gresham's law, and all the things \nyou teach in economics. But, by far, the most important thing I taught \nstudents is confidence. If the American people are confident, believe \ntheir future will be better than the past, have confidence in tomorrow, \nthen they will do the things that represent and manifest that \nconfidence. They buy a suit of clothes, buy a car, take a trip--they do \nthe things that will expand this economy. Why? Because they have \nconfidence in the future. When they lose confidence in the future and \nthey are unsure of that future, they do exactly the opposite. They say \nI am not going to make that purchase. I am not going to take that trip. \nI will not buy that car. That is the contraction side of the economy.\n  You can do all the things you want to do in the Senate, and the Fed \ncan do all they want to do. The fact is, we are in trouble if we don't \nprovide some way to say to the American people: You can have confidence \nin this country. You can have some belief that things will be better \nfor your kids than they were for you. So we can start the economic \nengine on the ship of state and get it moving again. If we can say that \nto the American people, we will turn this economy around.\n  I know that there is not just one idea that represents a silver \nbullet. I understand that as well. But at the end of the day, the \nSenator from Montana, the Senator from Hawaii, who are managing this \nlegislation--at the end of the day, it is our responsibility, their \nresponsibility, it is the responsibility for us to govern in a way that \nsays to the American people: Here is a plan we think has a chance. Here \nis an approach we believe has an opportunity to put us back on track \nonce again.\n  I want to make one final point. Even as we do all of this as best we \ncan to try to help this country recover, it is very important for us to \nseek accountability, going backwards and forwards. We need to \ninvestigate exactly what has happened. We need a prosecution task \nforce, we need a select committee in the Senate, we need to do all \nthese things. We ought to be subpoenaing people in front of committees \nto say: What did you do? We need to get to the bottom of all of this \nand make sure it can never happen again.\n  This notion of deciding self-regulation, quote-unquote, according to \nAlan Greenspan, works in the interests of everybody--let's understand \nthat. Self-regulation did not work. What happened to us in self-\nregulation is we were stolen blind and the American people have paid \nfor it now to the tune of maybe $9 trillion and still counting.\n  We need to put a lot of things back together. I want to be a \nconstructive party of one, saying I want to play a role. Whatever the \nconsequences, I want us to take action to try to help this economy \nrecover.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I want to take issue with something that \nwas said on the Senate floor earlier about this being rushed and that \nRepublicans are blocking this or slowing this down or delaying this \nbill. I have to take issue with that.\n  If you think about the enormity of what we are dealing with, we are \ntalking about spending $1 trillion of our hard-working American tax \ndollars. We have been on this bill literally since\n\n[[Page S2004]]\n\nlast Tuesday. So 4 days last week and today--it seems to me, at least \nby Washington standards, that is pretty much light speed for moving \nanything around here. So to suggest that somehow Republicans are \nblocking or delaying this bill is a complete misstatement of the facts \nwith regard to anything historical in the Senate.\n  When you are dealing with big issues, when you are dealing with \nissues of consequence, the Senate typically takes a certain amount of \ntime and considers amendments. We have had 26 rollcall votes on this \nbill, only 5 amendments have been accepted. Unfortunately, most of the \namendments that have been voted on and been accepted are amendments \nthat have added to the cost rather than reduced the cost. But the point \nsimply is the 4 or 5 days of time in the Senate to spend $1 trillion. I \nsaid this before, but I will repeat it: $800 billion, which is the base \namount of the bill, when you add in the interest costs of about $350 \nbillion, it gets you up to almost $1.2 trillion. But I said this last \nweek: Between the Revolutionary War and the Presidency of Jimmy Carter, \nwe only, as a nation, borrowed, cumulatively, $800 billion. We are \ntalking about borrowing $800 billion from future generations in this \none piece of legislation.\n  This is historic. It is unprecedented. It is stunning in terms of the \nsize and scope and scale, and it certainly ought to be given the \nconsideration I think something of this consequence and magnitude to \nthe American people deserves.\n  I think it could be said about this legislation: The more things \nchange, the more they stay the same. I said before, when we saw this \nbill come over from the House, it was about $820 billion. It got added \nto in the Senate, got up to a little over $900 billion. Then this last \nweek there was this big debate about we are going to be able to reduce \nits size; we are going to change some of the ways in which it is \nfunded, make it more stimulative and more oriented toward job creation. \nBut the reality is, in spite of all those statements to the contrary, \nwe are faced with a bill today that is essentially larger than the bill \nthat came to us from the House.\n  The so-called compromise, which was designed to cut extraneous \nwasteful spending from this bill, reduced the overall amounts in some \nspecific categories, but it didn't eliminate the categories. We are now \nspending on the same types of wasteful nonstimulative items--we are \njust spending slightly less than we were going to under the original \nbill we had last week in front of us. In fact, compared, as I said, to \nthe bloated House bill to which so many people across the country \nreacted negatively, we are actually spending more.\n  So the Senate bill, the so-called compromise, is actually not smaller \nbut, rather, larger than the House bill.\n  Second, the same shotgun approach to funding programs that are not \ntemporary and not targeted is being employed. So we continue to fund \nbudget items that still reflect bad policy and bad precedent. We just \ndo so a little less. Expansions of Medicaid, COBRA, the first ever \nforay by the Federal Government into school construction--they are all \npolicy and precedent-setting changes from which it will be very hard to \nretreat.\n  Make no mistake about it, with this bill we start down a path to a \nbigger and more pervasive Federal role, thereby changing the \ntraditional dynamic between the Federal Government and State and local \ngovernment. I do not believe this is the bargain the American people \nthought they were getting.\n  Just where are we in this process, as we end up on the Senate floor \nthis Monday afternoon? We still have a $800 billion bill, more than \n$800 billion. As I said earlier, it is larger than the House bill. The \nHouse bill came over at $820 billion. The Senate added to it, got it up \nclose to $940 billion. It got cut back under the so-called compromise \nthat emerged last week. But the compromise leaves us at a point where \nwe are actually spending more, $827 billion, than the bill that \noriginally came to us from the House, which was scored at $800 billion. \nAdd in the interest: $1.2 trillion.\n  It really has not been reduced from the levels that most Americans \nfound to be very disturbing about the House bill. In fact, the Senate \nbill is actually larger, not smaller, as I said before, than the House \nbill.\n  Second, it continues to be poorly targeted, spraying money at all \nkinds of programs, new and old, that have little hope of creating \nprivate sector jobs. We got the report from CBO last week which \nsuggested, again, that there could be as few as 1.3 million jobs \ncreated from the previous Senate bill. My assumption, of course, is \nalthough this has been reduced--not by much--the overall job creation \nwill be less under the so-called compromise than it was under the \noriginal bill introduced last week.\n\n  Third, it is not timely. Much of the job creation in here will take \nyears, due to the number of new programs that are created which will \nrequire new bureaucracies to be stood up, regulations to be issued, and \nall the redtape that is attendant to the creation of new Government \nprograms.\n  Fourth, it is not temporary. The mandatory funding in this bill will \nbe added to the baseline, creating long-term spending programs and \nliabilities that are permanent. Let's not fool ourselves. Much of the \nspending in this bill is not going away.\n  Fifth, every penny is borrowed from future generations. There is no \nway we can get around what we are doing to our children and \ngrandchildren. Not only are we handing them all this debt, according to \nCBO, passing this bill will cost us in GDP growth down the road, making \nit even harder for our children to experience the growth in the economy \nthat will be necessary to retire this kind of debt, not to mention the \ninevitable increase in inflation and interest rates that come with \ngreater Government borrowing.\n  Finally, lest there be any confusion about the magnitude of what we \nare doing, let's remember again what $1 trillion represents. As I said \nbefore, more than the total amount of borrowing between the \nRevolutionary War and the Presidency of Jimmy Carter. The debt service \nalone on that amount of money, that amount of borrowing, is almost $350 \nbillion over a 10-year period. The deficit for this fiscal year alone \nwill exceed 10 percent of our gross domestic product, a level we have \nnot seen since World War II.\n  I was a business student years ago. When we did financial \ncalculations, we used a Texas Instrument Business Analyst II calculator \nto do our financial calculations.\n  That calculator would be inadequate to today's debate. There was not \nenough room on the screen to accommodate the number of zeros we are \ntalking about.\n  This is serious business. We better get it right. This bill misses \nthe mark. It spends too much, and it does too little. We offered lots \nof amendments last week to make it better, all of which were rejected. \nBut I submit there is a better way. This bill has the votes to pass. We \nknow that based on the agreement that was reached. But it is not too \nlate to put the brakes on and actually sit down and work on a true \nbipartisan basis on a solution that sticks with the mantle of fiscal \nresponsibility and actually would create jobs.\n  I hope my colleagues will defeat this bill and avoid making a mistake \nfor which our children and grandchildren will pay for generations to \ncome.\n  We know there are other installations of borrowing that are coming. \nWe know the debate that was going to occur in the House last week on \nthe first ever $1 trillion Omnibus appropriations bill was delayed \nbecause they didn't want to get it conflicted with the other $1 \ntrillion we are going to be spending for stimulus. So we have a $1 \ntrillion bill coming, an appropriations bill coming, a $1 trillion \nstimulus. We know the announcement is going to be coming tomorrow from \nSecretary Geithner about what their intentions are with respect to \nmarket stabilization and additional liabilities the country will \nacquire as a result of that effort. As my colleague from North Dakota \nearlier today noted, there is the Bloomberg story today about the \ntrillions and trillions of dollars which Americans are being put on the \nhook for in the future.\n  We have lots of additional liabilities, obligations, debt that is \ncoming down the pike. It is going to affect our children and \ngrandchildren for generations to come.\n  There was something said earlier about Republicans do not have any\n\n[[Page S2005]]\n\nideas; they do not have any alternatives. We offered lots of \namendments. I offered two substitutes last week----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. That would have improved this bill dramatically. But this \nbill is the wrong way to go, and I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, an earlier speaker, the Senator from \nArizona, made some comments regarding Pell grants which I think should \nbe addressed. He essentially said that spending on Pell grants; that \nis, helping young Americans go to college, would not help the economy. \nHe was opposed to the increases in the Pell grant.\n  I am surprised he made that statement, because I think it is \ninaccurate. Let me explain why. First, money in the hands of low-income \nfamilies--and Pell grant recipients are low-income families--is money \nthat will be injected into the economy quickly.\n  Low-income people who receive money spend it. They have to spend it. \nThey have to spend it to make ends meet. They have to pay the bills. \nThey have to pay a mortgage. They have health care. You name it. It is \nvery difficult--very difficult.\n  So to say that money spent on Pell Grants is not a good idea, \nimplying it is not stimulative, is highly incorrect. Low-income people \nspend the money they receive. And this legislation does increase Pell \ngrants. Again, Pell grants are the grants that go to low-income \nstudents to go to college. That is what Pell grants are.\n  He was suggesting that is a bad thing, it is not good to increase \nPell grants. I am pointing out that the money in the hands of low-\nincome families, such as Pell grant recipients, is money that is spent \nin the economy very quickly. It is highly stimulative.\n  Second, what happens to that money when the low-income families \nreceive a Pell grant? What happens to that money? Well, it keeps \nteachers working, jobs in colleges, it helps the college meet its \npayroll. It helps the college meet its expenses.\n  Pell grants are spent. First, they are spent. It is stimulative. And, \nsecond, the dollars are spent to help colleges, to help colleges meet \ntheir payroll and meet the expenses they have to make. Many State \ncolleges are having a hard time these days because they are cutting \nback. They are cutting back in their colleges, the expenditures of \ntheir colleges. Why? Because we are in a recession. It is tough. Some \nkids are not going to college as they usually would.\n  Second, Pell grant dollars are not only stimulative, but they help \nkeep jobs at the colleges where the dollars are spent. Third, and \nperhaps most important, a dollar spent on Pell grants is a dollar that \nmakes it much more likely for a young woman or young man to go to \ncollege.\n  I think that is a good incentive, to help people go to college. The \neconomists tell us if a person goes to college, they will, over their \nlifetime, earn $1 million more than someone who does not go to college. \nWe want to encourage kids to go to college, especially help low-income \nkids go to college, because they otherwise cannot go to college.\n  When that person goes to college, that young woman, that young man, \nand earns more money, economists tell us it is $1 million more compared \nto kids who do not go to college. That is more money that goes into the \neconomy.\n  Now, granted, it takes a little time for that college graduate to \nearn that $1 million. Maybe in that sense it is not stimulative. But \nthe main point is, Pell grants are stimulative. It is a good idea, and \nanother reason why this legislation should be adopted.\n  I am quite surprised, frankly, that the Senator from Arizona \ncriticized Pell grants, saying they should not be in this bill. And \nclearly they should be in this bill. It is stimulative. There are a lot \nof other examples I can give. But that is one I thought needed to be \naddressed.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and under the \norder, the time will be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto use whatever time allotted to our side until the next Republican \nspeaker arrives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I want to come back to the one point I \nneglected to make earlier or did not have the time to make in my \nremarks; that is, even though I made the point that the House bill when \nit came over was at a certain funding level, $820 billion, the Senate \ncompromise is $827 billion, and that actually the compromise is more \ncostly than was the bill that so many people complained about as being \npork laden when it came over from the House. There are those who are \nsaying this bill is going to get bigger in the conference committee \nwhen the House and Senate get together to work out their differences.\n  I want to note what one of the Senators from Michigan said recently, \nand that is: I expect there will be some significant improvements over \nthe package that comes out of the Senate. He said: There would be a \npush for more spending on infrastructure, education, and aid to the \nStates.\n  The President indicated recently: ``I will be honest with you, the \nSenate version cut a lot of education dollars. I would like to see some \nof this restored.''\n  We talk about cuts in this program as if we are actually cutting \nsomething that already exists. We are talking about $1 trillion in new \nspending, an unprecedented amount of spending that has not been \nauthorized. It did not go through regular order. Now we are actually \ntalking as if somehow because the Senate bill, although as large as it \nis, larger than the House bill, is smaller than it was relative to \nwhere it was a week ago, which was over $900 billion, that somehow that \nbill has been cut, and that when we go in conference we are going to \nrestore some of this money.\n  So I guess the only point I would make is, as this bill makes its way \nthrough the legislative process, we are not talking about a bill that \nis going to be smaller, we are talking about a bill that is going to be \nincreasingly larger. I suggest when it goes to the conference committee \nwith the House of Representatives, that this will not--if it is at 820 \nin the House and at 827 in the Senate--you can bank on it, that is \ngoing to be the minimum--it is probably going to get significantly \nlarger.\n  As I said before, we believe there is a much better way of doing \nthis. First, there was a great comprehensive approach last week put \nforward by the Senator from Arizona, which many of us supported, which \ninvested in infrastructure, which addressed the housing issue, which \nmany of us believe is central to our ability to emerge from this \ncrisis, and which also appropriately targeted a lot of the stimulus \ntoward job creation in the form of tax relief for small businesses, \nwhich, frankly, create most of the jobs in our economy, at least a good \nshare. Two-thirds to three-quarters of the jobs in our economy are \ncreated by small businesses.\n  It also directed a lot of that particular approach and package to tax \nrelief for middle-income families, putting more money into their \npockets and allowing them to get out and to spend and to take advantage \nof something that might benefit them more than some government program \nthat is going to be funded in Washington, DC, from which they probably \nwill derive very little benefit.\n  So this is not getting smaller, it is getting larger at every step in \nthe process. There are better ideas and better alternatives out there. \nThis has been proven, at least by the CBO, to have very, I think, \nquestionable ability to create jobs and also to do more long-term \ndamage to the economy down the road. In their study which came out last \nweek, it suggested that if in fact this stimulus bill was enacted, it \nwould lead to lower GDP growth in the outyears.\n  I see some of my colleagues have arrived.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n[[Page S2006]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from South Dakota \nfor his effective leadership in helping the American people understand \nthe full implications of this legislation on American families. I ask \nthat I be informed when I have 1 minute remaining.\n  A number of things have been said about the so-called stimulus \npackage, which I feel, many of us feel, is more of a spending bill than \na stimulus bill. But there is no doubt about the fact that it increases \nour national debt.\n  The debt is not some abstract thing. Our national debt is $10.7 \ntrillion. This adds to the national debt as much money as--well, let's \nput it this way. It took from the beginning of the Republic until 1982 \nto have a cumulative debt of $850 billion. And this bill is more than \nthat. This is a lot of money. We are adding the $820 or 830 billion \nthat we have heard about plus the interest over the next 10 years. That \nadds about $10,000 to each family's share of the debt. Well, with that \n$10,000 you can pay in-state tuition for 1.5 years at the University of \nTennessee. You could pay for 21 years of public school lunches every \nday for the average middle school student. You could buy a gallon of \nmilk a week for 57 years. That is a lot of money.\n  I wish to make three points today as we think about this stimulus \nbill which, I believe, is more of a spending bill. First, this bill \nmakes a number of policy decisions on education, health, and energy \nthat ought not to be made in such a bill, but ought to be separately \ndebated and considered.\n  No. 2, we should have all of the proposed spending on the table. Mr. \nGeithner is coming up to Congress this week to tell us how much we need \nfor banks. Then we need more for housing. Then we need more for the \nwar. I think if we knew all of the money we are about to have to \nborrow, our appetite for spending $1.2 trillion, mostly on projects \nthat do not create jobs in the next few months, would diminish.\n  And, third, this is not the kind of bipartisanship that I expected. \nAs I listened to the President, I thought he wanted to change the way \nWashington works. The way Washington works in a bipartisan way is for \nus to sit down and talk with one another and come up with something \nboth Republicans and Democrats can agree upon; not we won the election, \nwe will write the bill and let's see if we can pick off two or three \nSenators.\n  First, a number of policy decisions. The first version of the Senate \nbill actually doubled Federal spending for education without any \ndiscussion. I used to be the Secretary of Education. Today, that \nDepartment has about a $68 billion budget. The original version of the \nSenate bill doubles that. It took 40 years to get to $68 billion. But \nthe original Senate bill would increase education spending by $140 \nbillion over the next two years--on top of that $68 billion we're \nalready spending per year. So the bill would double the $68 billion \nthis year, and keep it doubled next year. Then it is supposed to go \nback down to $68 billion the year after that, which seems unlikely.\n  But there was no discussion about this. Would you not think, if they \nwere going to double the Federal commitment to education, we would have \na discussion about what would be best to spend it on? I mean, are we so \ndelighted with the performance in kindergarten through the 12th grade \nand our preschool programs that we have nothing to do but say, let's \ndouble the money for more of the same?\n  Even the small things that have crept into the legislation, some of \nwhich President Obama has said he supports, should be fully debated. \nFor example, we have some new Senators at the forefront of federal \nsupport for the Teacher Incentive Fund. We have a new Secretary of \nEducation who supports this effort to help reward outstanding teaching \nand outstanding school leading, but not a penny was included in the \nSenate bill.\n  What about charter schools? A lot of us on both sides of the aisle \nwant to give teachers the freedom to use their own common sense and \ngood judgment in dealing with the children who are brought to them. \nThat is what a public charter school does. Not a penny in the Senate \nbill.\n  So education is the first policy area that should have been debated \nseparately. Then on health care, the House added nearly $90 billion for \nMedicaid. The President has said we need to make health care available \nto every American. We Republicans agree with that. So we are ready to \nhave a debate about that. That will cost some money.\n  One of the major proposals, in fact, the one that has the most \nbipartisan support, the Wyden-Bennett legislation, would get rid of the \nMedicaid Program and replace it with individual accounts. This preempts \nthat decision by giving $90 billion more to the States.\n  So the States get $90 billion. That is a lot of money. Tennessee's \nshare of that would be $1.5 or $2 billion. That is going to make the \nprogram so rich the States will not want to give it up, and we will not \nbe able to have a full discussion about health care when that comes \naround.\n  Then an energy bill. Last year, I asked the Energy Information \nAdministration to estimate what kind of subsidies we were doing for \nrenewable energy, because it seemed to me it was all going to wind and \nnothing else. I was about right.\n  EIA said: We are subsidizing wind at 27 times greater than all other \nforms of renewable energy per kilowatt hour; 53 times greater than \nsubsidies for coal per kilowatt hour; and 15 times greater than the \nsubsidy for nuclear, which produces 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity.\n  That was in the middle of last year. That was at a time when we only \nwere committed to $11.5 billion to give to rich people and big banks, \nsome of which we are bailing out, that get big tax credits when they \nbuild wind turbines. So that was $11.5 billion in the middle of last \nyear.\n  Then in October of last year we passed legislation that brought that \nup to $16 billion over the next 10 years, and this bill brings to $25.7 \nbillion the amount of taxpayer dollars that we are paying rich people \nand banks so they can get big tax credits for building wind turbines.\n  As far as the beautiful mountains of North Carolina and Tennessee, I \ndon't want those things littering our area, particularly because the \nwind doesn't blow there enough to make it efficient. But even in areas \nwhere it does make sense, do we really need, without any discussion, to \ngo from $11.5 billion last year to $26 billion this year with a \nnational windmill policy? Why don't we have a debate about energy, and \nlet's have a technology-neutral way to encourage all forms of renewable \nenergy, especially emerging forms.\n  We have an education bill, a health care bill, and an energy bill, \nbut we don't have a stimulus bill. We shouldn't have all this on the \ntable.\n  Mr. Geithner has apparently delayed his recommendation about what we \ndo about credit and banks until we have had the vote on this stimulus \nbill. This was supposed to be a transparent administration. To be \ntransparent, let's put it all out there. How much do we need to \nappropriate for banks? I voted for that twice now. I might vote for it \nagain if I think we need to do it. It was not an easy vote, but I did \nit. How much do we need to spend on housing? How much do we need to \nspend on the war in Afghanistan and to finish the war in Iraq? How much \ndo we need to spend on the health care plan the President and we in \nCongress have said we want to work on? And how will we shape all this \ninto some control of entitlement spending? It would be nice if we had \nit all on the table.\n  If we knew, as the testimony suggested before the Budget Committee \nlast week, that we really need to appropriate $400 or $500 or $600 \nbillion to take care of $2 trillion of toxic assets in banks to get the \neconomy moving again, we might have less appetite for lumping an energy \nbill and an education bill and a health care bill and a lot of projects \nthat don't really stimulate the economy in with this borrowed money.\n  Finally, on this side of the aisle, just as on that side of the \naisle, we like the new President. He was our colleague. He came to see \nus. We walked out of that meeting between the President and Republican \nSenators saying: Here is an accomplished man who wants to help our \ncountry. We want him to succeed because if he does our country will \nsucceed. But we want to be a part of it. We expected to be a part of \nit.\n  President Bush technically didn't need the Congress to wage the war \nin\n\n[[Page S2007]]\n\nIraq. So he didn't get support, for example, for the Iraq Study Group \nprinciples when Senator Salazar and I----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. When Senator Salazar and I and 17 Senators and more \nthan 60 House Members of both parties suggested it. He could do it, but \nwithout that support, it made the war harder and the Presidency less \nsuccessful.\n  This stimulus bill is the easy thing to do. What the White House and \nthe majority in the House and the majority in the Senate need to \nrecognize is that if you want to be bipartisan, we want our ideas \nconsidered. If you want 20 Republicans, you are probably going to lose \n10 Democrats. That is the way things work around here. So the majority \ncan either say: We won the election and we will write the bill and try \nto pick off two or three Republicans, or we can sit down together and \nmake it work. We are ready to do that to make it work. But when you get \nto banks and housing and entitlements and health care and the war, it \nis going to get harder. I hope this is not an example of the kind of \nbipartisanship we will have. This is borrowed money. This is a spending \nbill, not a stimulus bill. It would be better if all of the money we \nare going to be asked to spend were on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. And it also would be better if we all had the \nopportunity to see exactly what the total bill is before we vote on \nthis part of it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Could the Chair inform me when I have used 9 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, we are about to vote at 5:30. Under \nSenate rules, we need 60 votes to bring closure to a bill, to basically \nend debate, move on with any amendments that are left hanging, and \nbring the debate to an end. I hope people were listening to my \ncolleague from Tennessee. I thought he made a very good argument that \nwe are bringing to close a debate that really never began.\n  I don't remember debating doubling the size of the Education \nDepartment budget. I do know that education spending in Washington has \ngrown significantly under the Bush years. Maybe there is room for it to \ngrow even more. But I thought we were trying to create jobs to get our \neconomy going. I am quite confident that many of the programs they are \ntrying to expand in the Education Department have more to do with a \nparticular agenda of a few people than creating jobs. The health care \nissue is enormous. Providing broadband service to rural America is very \nimportant. There is $9 billion in this bill to do that. But the \nquestion is, Does that money create a job in the near term?\n  The reason I believe we need a stimulus package is because I don't \nthink the private sector has the ability to jump-start the economy \nbecause they can't borrow money. There are not many businesses out \nthere that have the ability right now to expand.\n  One thing we could do in Washington to help the economy is cut \npeople's taxes so that businesses would have more money to expand and \nhire new people; cut individual taxes so people would have more money \nto meet the needs and manage the budget and make their house payments; \nand infuse into the economy some spending, shovel-ready projects. You \nare going to need a shovel when this bill passes, not to build \nanything, just to get the money out the door.\n  There is $200 million in oversight; $200 million is going to be spent \njust to try to figure out where the money went. This is an incredible \namount of money being spent, $1.2 trillion over the next 10 years with \ninterest, and we have spent 4 days on it in the Senate.\n  The House started this process, and they couldn't pick up one \nRepublican vote. I can assure you, there are Republicans in the House \nand Senate who really do believe we need to cut taxes and spend money \nto jump-start the economy. They lost 11 Democrats in the House.\n  This bill started poorly and has gotten worse. It comes to the Senate \nin the compromise, and I applaud Members for trying to reach a \ncompromise. The bill is $7 billion more in the Senate than it was in \nthe House. I wouldn't want these people to buy me a car. That is not \nexactly what I had in mind when it came to compromise.\n  Every Republican voted for a bill--I think it was $415 billion--to \ncut taxes, money for infrastructure spending, money to extend \nunemployment benefits and food stamps, and other programs to help \npeople who have lost their jobs. Compromise is not going from $415 to \n$7 billion more than the House bill. To those who said this is the best \ndeal we could get, I couldn't disagree more. This is the best deal you \ncould get with two or three people.\n  But I do believe the American people have seen through this bill, and \nthey don't like it. They don't know exactly what to do. That is \nprobably true of many of us in Congress. This is something unusual. But \nthey know this process is not what they had in mind when it came to \nchange. They know this bill stinks.\n  This bill was written by appropriators, not by economists. The focus \nof this bill--to create jobs in the near term--has been replaced by \nwhat I consider basically an orgy of spending. People have piled onto \nthis bill policy changes that were never debated. We made up numbers \nwhen it comes to education and health care without really any vetting. \nThe markup in the Senate, where the bill was drafted, lasted an hour \nand 40 minutes. We have had 2 or 3 days on the floor to talk about the \nbill. It has been helpful. But at the end of the day, we are bringing \nclosure to a bill that spends $1.2 trillion that will transfer to the \nnext generation of young Americans a debt on top of what they already \nowe, and we are digging a hole for the next generation of Americans I \ndon't think they will be able to get out of. Shame on us.\n  If it creates 4 million jobs, who knows, that is still $275,000 per \njob. If it is 1.3 million, that is almost $600,000 per job. What was \nintended to be a good thing has turned out to be the old way of doing \nbusiness. Less than 20 percent of the money gets into the economy \nwithin the first year. I argue, if you can't get the money into the \neconomy within a year or 18 months, we should not be doing it.\n  The sad thing is that the fundamental problem with the economy is \nunaddressed; that is, housing, what got us into this mess, a collapse \nof the housing industry. You can't borrow money at banks. Why? Banks \nhave a hard time lending money because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and \nother organizations pushed home loans to people who couldn't afford to \npay the loans. They took these questionable mortgages and repackaged \nthem 1,000 times over, calling them different things such as mortgage-\nbacked securities, and it spread throughout the entire world. Now banks \nown these troubled assets. And the first round of TARP that was \nsupposed to get some of these assets off the book--we just gave the \nmoney to banks to keep them from folding.\n\n  We have yet to address the housing problem and the banking problem. \nWe are going to find out maybe tomorrow what additional money would be \nrequired to fix those two aspects of the economy. There is $310 billion \nleft in the TARP fund. It will not cover the needs of the banking or \nhousing industries. The public will be asked to give more money.\n  My point is simple: Every dollar that is unfocused and wasted in the \nstimulus could be spent on helping people stay in their homes and \nhelping banks lend money. That is the way I look at it. There is so \nmuch in this bill that may be worthy but doesn't create a job and could \nbe transferred to the housing and banking problems and not just spent.\n  The President called this a spending bill. I thought it was a bill to \ncreate jobs. We have a way to spend money. It is called the \nappropriations process. We came together early on after the election to \ntry to find a new way of doing business. We, most of us--I think there \nare 20 Republicans--would sign up for a bill that would cut taxes and \nspend money in a focused way. The bill we have before us cuts taxes and \nspends a lot of money, and neither one of them is focused.\n  The public will be asked again to put more of their money on the \ntable--and it is all borrowed from their children--to deal with the \nfundamentals of the economy, housing and banking, that are pretty much \nunaddressed. It is disappointing for me that we are bringing\n\n[[Page S2008]]\n\nto close a debate that really never happened.\n  To the Senator from Tennessee, he has a great reputation of being \nsomebody who listens and is pretty easy to get along with. I think I \nhave a reputation of reaching across the aisle, sometimes to my own \npolitical detriment. It is in my nature to try to find common ground on \nbig problems that no one party can solve. I argue that the economic \ncrisis we are in is not going to be solved by one group of people. It \nis going to be solved by America working together.\n  The message from the election that I thought was received by most \nAmericans is that you want us to be smarter and you want us to work \ntogether.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. The public was hopeful that the Congress and the new \nPresident would be smarter and we would work together. I think we have \nfailed. I don't believe this bill is smart at all. It certainly wasn't \na work product that came from working together.\n  Where do we go from here? We go to get more of the public money to \nfix housing and banking. We wasted a lot of their money. We cannot \nspend enough money through a stimulus package to save this economy \nunless we deal with banking and housing. We have thrown a lot of good \nmoney after bad. I apologize, and I am sorry that we can't do better. I \nnow know why the Congress is in such low esteem.\n  I am disappointed in this new President. Like everyone else, I want \nhim to do well because our country needs to do well. But he has missed \na great opportunity.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield myself 5 minutes from the time of Senator \nChambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, the President last week talked about the \nneed for speed. He equated spending with stimulus. He even said: That \nis the point, spending is stimulus.\n  If you are going to spend a trillion dollars, you better spend it \nright. Ask the country of Japan, during the 1990s, when they had six \ndifferent stimulus bills. Stimulus was not equal to spending in their \ncountry because they spent the money incorrectly. They had many \nexamples of bridges to nowhere and roads to nowhere. It isn't just a \nquestion of spending money and spending it fast; it is a question of \nhow you spend it. You better spend it correctly.\n  One of the huge problems we have in this bill is that it does very \nlittle for housing. When the bill first came out, it did almost nothing \nfor housing. There has been a little bit of change to it since then, \nand that is good.\n  I brought forward a proposal earlier that I believed--and many \nbelieved--would have done a great deal to solve the housing problem.\n  We all know it is the housing problem that has dragged the rest of \nthe economy down. It is the housing sector that has effected the rest \nof the economy. During the early part of this decade, housing was \nbooming, and it actually helped the rest of the economy. But it was a \nfalse bubble, and all bubbles burst, whether it was the dot.com bubble, \nthis housing bubble or any of the bubbles from the past. They always \nburst.\n  This bubble, by the way, was caused by the Government, and that is \nwhy we as the Government have a responsibility to fix it. But the speed \nwith which this bill is coming forward--a trillion-plus dollars--means \nwe are going to make some major mistakes. You cannot do it this quickly \nand do it right.\n\n  The President has just put together a new economic team, including \nsome very talented people as his economic advisers. I suggest we start \nover. I suggest we combine the administrations economic team with \nDemocrats from the House and Senate in order to come up with the best \nideas and put forward a bill that will actually fix the economy. When \nwe put together a bill such as this one, a bill so complex and so large \nand it is done behind closed doors with one party, you are going to \nhave problems. That is why you have seen so much objection to this bill \nfrom our side of the aisle.\n  In the House of Representatives, this bill was jammed through. It was \n$819 billion. Not a single Republican voted for it, and 11 Democrats \nvoted against this bill. The only thing bipartisan in the House version \nof this bill was the opposition. Now we come over to the Senate, and \nRepublicans are excluded from the process of writing this bill. It has \nbeen an open process on amendments, but almost all of the amendments \nhave been rejected.\n  We should sit down and start over so we get this economic package \nright the first time. As I have said before, you do not get do-overs \nwhen you are talking about a trillion dollars. The budget deficit going \ninto this year was slated to be $1.2 trillion. We are talking about \nover $800 billion in this bill. The Senate bill is actually more than \nthe House bill. I think the Senate bill is $827 billion. When you count \ninterest, it is actually $1.2 trillion.\n  So, Madam President, when you start adding up this debt we are \npassing on to our children--and, as the President has said, in the next \n4 or 5 years, we are looking at annual budget deficits of over $1 \ntrillion--this is going to lead to higher taxes, it is going to lead to \nsevere inflation. As we are running up this debt, we have to sell \nTreasury bills to be able to pay for the debt. If other countries in \nthe world decide they are not going to buy our Treasury bills, this \ncountry's economy will completely collapse. It will be worse than the \nGreat Depression.\n  We have to get this right. We cannot get it right with outlandish \nspending. We need to shrink the size of the package and target spending \nso it is effective, so it is actually not building bridges to nowhere \nbut rather bridges that are needed, roads that are needed and mass \ntransit that is actually needed.\n  This bill includes money for electric golf carts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, let's start over and get this thing \nright.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the 10 \nminutes immediately prior to the cloture vote today, as well as the 10 \nminutes prior to the 12 noon vote on Tuesday, February 10, be equally \ndivided and controlled between the two leaders or their designees, with \nthe majority leader controlling the final 5 minutes prior to the vote \non each day covered in this agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise to speak on the stimulus \npackage today. Much has been said on this package that is before us \nnow--in fact, so much that the often employed adage over the weekend \nwas that everything that can be said has been said but not every man \nhas had a chance to say it. While those musings are certainly \napplicable, it is important to note our debate here is healthy.\n  The perils facing our economy are of the gravest concern and \nmagnitude, which requires a response in kind. When faced with such an \nundertaking, it is understandable to seek a solution with one voice in \nthe spirit of bipartisanship and compromise. However, when differences \narise that are so fundamental, spirited debate and disagreement can \npose a healthy return to our purest forms of thought and help to foster \nbasic solutions advocated by a set of guiding principles.\n  The party makeup of the Senate all but confirms passage of this \nenormous spending bill. Still, I use this time to highlight the most \nbasic differences in beliefs so as to assure the American people that \nour reason for opposing this bill is not political, is not partisan, \nbut, rather, based on true economic principles.\n  It is a cornerstone of my thinking that the American people deserve \nand are rightfully entitled to best determine how their own money is \nspent. While there are most certainly essential Government functions \nwhich require funding by the American taxpayer, when faced with a \ndecision as to who can best govern themselves and how to spend their \nmoney, I will always side with the taxpayer. As such, I cannot support \nthis spending plan--a\n\n[[Page S2009]]\n\nplan which not only adds over $1 trillion to our national debt, which \nwould increase our debt ceiling to over $12.1 trillion, but, most \nimportantly, a plan which will do nothing to truly stimulate the \neconomy. Government spending taxpayer dollars on behalf of taxpayers \ndoes not grow the economy in the manner which is needed to return \nstrength and stability to our economy.\n  This past month, the unemployment rate hit 7.6 percent. It is higher \nthan that in my home State. Madam President, 598,000 jobs were lost in \nJanuary 2009, for a total of 11.6 million people unemployed. We must \nenact policies that create jobs, not simply spend taxpayer dollars, \nrobbing Peter to pay Paul. We must provide incentives to businesses to \nhire, expand, and grow. This bill does none of that.\n  Unfortunately, this Democratic spending bill will cost the American \ntaxpayer more of the money they so desperately need to be allowed to \nkeep. Moreover, it simply does not do enough to address the crux of the \nproblems facing our economy, which is the housing industry. In fact, \nthe original bill that came out of the Finance Committee did not \ncontain one single provision that addressed the housing crisis. Thank \ngoodness we have an amendment that seeks to address it, but more must \nbe done. Housing problems got us into this mess, and solutions targeted \ntoward housing will help get us out. It is imperative that we work \ntoward narrowing the gap between supply and demand of houses. As long \nas supply remains at its current level as related to demand, home \nvalues will continue to drop and our economy will continue its downward \nspiral.\n  With this plan, the Democrats are saying they believe the Government \ncan spend its way out of our current economic perils by spending the \ntaxpayers' money for them. There is nothing wholeheartedly I disagree \nwith more. The Government must not act as the purchaser and spender of \nlast resort. Government intervention into private markets and \nimposition into citizens' pocketbooks does more harm than good. They \nattack the solutions we have offered as financially imprudent yet \nadvocate a spending plan which spends more money than the entire \neconomy of Australia.\n  But as I began, at the heart of this debate, the numbers here are not \nas important as is the difference in fundamental economic principles. \nThis spending package only succeeds in doing two things: expanding \npermanently the size of Government and saddling the taxpayer with the \ncost and requiring our children to repay the debt. If we reduce the \nsize of Government, limit its impositions into the free market, and \nallow the private sector to prosper where the Federal Government has \nstaked a claim, businesses will grow, creating more jobs, injecting \nmore capital into the economy. But a piecemeal compromise such as this \nproposal serves only to dilute the framework needed to allow our \neconomy to return to prosperity.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I understand the Senator from Iowa, Mr. \nGrassley, wishes to speak. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Iowa. \nI think he has some time he wishes to use as well.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Total of 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, first of all, let me express great \nappreciation to the chairman for giving me an opportunity to use some \nof his time when I am going to be speaking against the legislation. It \nis very much brotherly love and I appreciate that.\n  Today I wish to talk about some of the questionable spending in this \nbill and some of the amendments we aren't going to be able to vote on. \nFirst of all, there is $87 billion in Medicaid funds in this bill. As I \nhave said on this floor several times, it is more than States need to \npay for enrollment-driven increases in Medicaid spending due to the \nrecession. We all accept the fact that there needs to be more money for \nMedicaid, as long as it is directly related to an increase in \nunemployment. However, I explained last week how the facts show that \nthis amount is far more than States need for the cost of the new \nMedicaid enrollment resulting from a downturn in the economy. What the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined was that what States \nneed to pay for increases in Medicaid enrollment is not the $87 billion \nin the bill but a lot smaller amount--$10.8 billion--directly related \nto an increase of unemployment Medicaid use.\n  So the question is, Why does the bill provide almost eight times what \nthe States actually need for the new enrollment resulting from that \ndownturn? I say we shouldn't kid ourselves. This bill gives States, in \na sense, a slush fund. Now, I am willing to admit States might need \nmoney for other programs, but it shouldn't be covered up by saying it \nis Medicaid money.\n  On Friday night, I had an amendment to ensure that Medicaid funds \nwould have been distributed fairly. Amazingly, 17 Members of the Senate \nvoted to give their States less money, but at least in that case, I was \nable to get a vote. I had several other amendments that were never \nallowed to be made pending. All day Wednesday we were prevented from \nmaking amendments pending. Retreats and signing ceremonies got in the \nway. Thursday evening we spent more time arguing over whether \namendments would be made pending rather than actually processing \namendments. It seems contrary to what President Obama said on Monday \nnight. He said the Republicans have a lot of good ideas and we ought to \nmake this a bipartisan bill. So we get to 10 o'clock on Friday morning. \nWe were encouraged to bring our amendments to the floor so they could \nbe debated. For some reason, the first amendment was not allowed until \n4\\1/2\\ hours later.\n  So I am disappointed that several amendments on this side of the \naisle, including some of my own, would not receive a vote. I am not \nconvinced the majority wanted to have open debate and take votes on \nmany of these amendments, including mine. It is too bad because this \nbill still can be made a bipartisan bill, and this bill can still be \nmade a more effective bill.\n  Congress is giving States, then, $87 billion for Medicaid and resting \non the hope that States don't strip the health care safety net for low-\nincome families and then pocket money. For instance, in my State of \nIowa I recently read in the paper that they are going to cut $20 \nmillion out of Medicaid. So if we can do things with all the money we \nare going to give to the States to make sure these programs aren't cut, \nit seems to me, for that additional $76 billion, we ought to get some \nof that assurance. I use the word ``hope'' that they don't do that \nbecause the underlying bill doesn't do enough to make sure States do \nwhat is best with the Medicaid Program. Does the bill prevent States \nfrom getting Medicaid Programs? It does not. The bill only prevents \nStates from cutting Medicaid on one of three propositions, this one \nbeing income eligibility. So that is a good thing. But if Congress is \ngiving States $87 billion and telling them not to cut Medicaid \neligibility, shouldn't Congress also tell States they can't cut \nbenefits? If Congress is giving States $87 billion and telling them not \nto cut Medicaid eligibility, then shouldn't Congress also tell States \nthey can't cut payments to providers? Will Medicaid beneficiaries who \nare elderly or disabled be able to receive home- and community-based \nservices? Will there be enough pharmacists taking Medicaid? Will there \nbe enough rural hospitals or public hospitals taking Medicaid patients? \nWill there be enough community health centers taking Medicaid people? \nWill Medicaid beneficiaries who are elderly or disabled be able to get \ninto nursing homes? Will States cut mental health services because \nCongress didn't prevent them from doing so in this bill? Will there be \npediatricians or children's hospitals there for children on Medicaid?\n  So if the Senate does nothing to protect access to these vital \nproviders, nobody will be able to assure the people who count on \nMedicaid that the care they need will be there. I filed an amendment \nthat prevents States from generally cutting eligibility and benefits \nand providers. In other words, I am\n\n[[Page S2010]]\n\nbuilding on what the bill's authors did. They said don't cut \neligibility. I agree with that. But shouldn't we, at the same time, not \nallow States to cut benefits and providers while all the time the \nStates are getting $87 billion, which is about $75 billion, $76 billion \nmore than what the recession-driven unemployment qualifiers for \nMedicaid need? The other day, if we had a chance, Members could have \nvoted, in other words, to protect Medicaid providers and people who are \non it. That should have had a vote.\n  The bill provides in addition a COBRA subsidy to involuntarily \nterminated employees. The bill places no limits on the eligibility for \nthe subject. Why? I haven't quite figured it out. I know the amendment \nwe are now considering lowers the subsidy, but it still has no limits \non eligibility for that subsidy.\n  Last week, President Obama and his administration issued guidelines \nfor capping compensation paid to CEOs whose institutions receive \ntaxpayers' dollars through the TARP program, but the fact of the matter \nis this: Former Wall Street CEOs and hedge fund managers who have made \nmillions of dollars while running our economy into the ground will get \na taxpayers' subsidy equal to now 50 percent of their health care \ninsurance. It seems to me that is outrageous.\n  I filed an amendment that simply said if a worker who was voluntarily \nterminated from their job earned income in excess of $125,000 for \nindividuals or $250,000 for families as a whole, this worker would not \nbe eligible to receive the subsidy. What is magic about $250,000? It is \nthe same level President Obama in the campaign said that people above \nthat level should have tax increases. So I figured $250,000: You \nshouldn't be eligible for a subsidy for your health insurance, \nparticularly if you are coming from a company that as a CEO you drove \ninto the ground. That amendment should have had a vote.\n  It is not just the health care amendments. This bill could be \nimproved by increasing the tax credit for education expenses. Senator \nSchumer and I filed an amendment--now, that is a bipartisan amendment--\nthat would have done just that. It would have increased the American \nOpportunity Tax Credit from $2,500 to $3,000. It was a bipartisan \namendment. It should have had a vote.\n  I also remain deeply concerned about the oversight of this bill. On \nthe front page of today's Washington Post, there is a story with this \nheadline: ``If Spending Is Swift, Oversight May Suffer.'' Well, a \nperson such as I was very interested. I spend more time on oversight \nthan I do on legislating because I don't think we do enough of it here. \nThe article says:\n\n       The Obama administration's economic stimulus plan could end \n     up wasting billions of dollars by attempting to spend money \n     faster than an overburdened government acquisition system can \n     manage and oversee it.\n\n  When there is a potential for waste, fraud, and abuse, Congress needs \nto be proactive, not reactive. This is why I filed an amendment to \nensure Congress has the ability to get information from the executive \nbranch and respond to the allegations that will inevitably come in. The \namendment would ensure that any agency that gets funding under this \nbill would be required to provide records upon written request by a \nchairman or ranking member of a committee of Congress. The committee \nrecords should not be kept secret from the elected representatives of \nthe people. I have always tried to focus on good Government issues such \nas waste, fraud, and abuse. That is what my amendment did. That should \nhave had a vote.\n  I know a lot of people have worked very hard putting this bill \ntogether. I have done some of that myself, so I know what work it \ntakes. I know a lot of people worked very hard putting a substitute \namendment together. I respect that they have worked hard. Hard work \ndoesn't mean, though, that it is necessarily good work. We should all \nhave been allowed to consider and vote on more amendments than we have. \nI would say on all the amendments I have discussed in my remarks today, \ngiving $87 billion, even though that is as much as eight times what \nthey need to stay ahead of enrollment-driven Medicaid increases, is \nstill not well thought out. Giving States $87 billion while still \nallowing them to cut their Medicaid Programs is still not well thought \nout.\n  Giving a COBRA subsidy to millionaires is still not well thought out. \nIt is still not well thought out. It is still out of control.\n  The Senate should have been allowed to vote on the numerous \namendments I have discussed today to address the shortcomings that \noccur when partisan bills are moved too quickly. We could still do \nthat. We could process these amendments today. But as we have seen \nthroughout, the majority is not interested in true bipartisanship or in \nprocess that allows for full and open debate on amendments. We have the \nHouse of Representatives and the ``House of Representatives in \ntraining,'' given how this debate has been run.\n  Today we are being told ``just do it,'' at the expense of doing this \nvery important and urgent legislation in a way that does right by the \nAmerican people in the short and longer term.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I wish to set the record straight on a \nfew points that speakers on the other side of the aisle have made. I \nthink it would be totally unfair if they go unchallenged and the record \nis not set straight.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma said the bill before us is the biggest \nspending bill ever. That is not true. It is true this is a big bill, \nand that is because the economy is in such dire shape and because we \nare in a recession. That is a big problem. It needs to be faced. This \nis a big bill, and I would suggest the appropriate response to a big \nproblem is a big bill. An inappropriate response would be not a big \nbill to a very big problem.\n  I might say that this is a big problem also because economists \nproject that the economy is likely to suffer $2 trillion to $3 trillion \nless growth because of this recession than would have occurred with \nfull employment. Again, that is $2 trillion to $3 trillion of less \ngrowth because of the recession than would have occurred with full \nemployment. We have a lot of lost jobs, as we know. We need to do \nsomething pretty significant about that.\n  The size of the bill is an appropriate level to try to replace some \nof the activity this recession is robbing from our economy.\n  The second point is this is not the largest bill that Congress has \never considered. That assertion, made by a Senator on the floor not \nlong ago, was inaccurate; it is not true. The fact is, in past years, \nwe have passed legislation that would cut taxes by trillions of dollars \nand all in one bill.\n  Those who call this the largest bill in history are forgetting recent \nhistory. The 2001 Bush tax cuts, the Economic Growth and Tax Relief \nReconciliation Act, was estimated back then to cost $1.3 trillion over \n10 years. Frankly, I think it turned out to be more than that. It was a \nlarger bill than this. This is a $827 billion bill; that was about $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  I also think it is important for us to remember that as of October of \nlast year, Congress had approved a total of $864 billion for the Iraq \nand Afghanistan wars and for enhanced security at military bases from \n2001 through 2009. About $657 billion of that amount, about 76 percent, \nwas approved for the war in Iraq, and the conflict is not over yet. So \nan accurate tabulation would conclude that the Afghan and Iraq wars are \nbigger than the stimulus bill before us. So it is inaccurate that this \nis the largest spending bill we have ever had.\n  Next, the Senator from South Dakota asserted that the mandatory \nspending in the bill is permanent. That is not accurate. The spending \nin this bill is not permanent. The spending provisions in this bill are \nnearly all sunsetted, not permanent. We have crafted a bill that has \nits effects in the first 2 years.\n  I remind my colleagues that according to CBO and the Joint Committee \non Tax, a nonpartisan, bipartisan professional staff, whose job it is \nto analyze legislation before us, concluded that 79 percent of the \neffect of the Finance Committee provisions would take effect the first \ntwo years. That doesn't sound like it is permanent to me. The Joint \nCommittee on Tax and CBO, in a combined analysis, concludes\n\n[[Page S2011]]\n\nthat 79 percent of the entire bill's effect will be spent in the first \n2 years. That is not my statement. That is CBO, made up of very highly \ntrained professionals who deal with these issues. So it is not true \nthat this spending goes on forever. This bill is very temporary, by \ndefinition.\n  Another colleague on the other side complained that this doesn't do \nenough for small business. Let's see if that is true. The business \nprovisions in the bill, like the loss carrybacks, help small businesses \nby providing immediate cash to help them meet payroll and make \ninvestments. That can clearly help all businesses. In addition, the \nbill has something specifically targeted at small businesses that are \ntrying to make ends meet. That is expanded expenses in section 179. \nThat section is a provision in the law that allows businesses to fully \nexpense their expenditures for that year. They don't have to depreciate \nand apply that depreciation against earnings in subsequent years. \nRather, they can fully expense the expenses. I forgot the cutoff, but \nit is around $700,000 or $800,000. It is significant. That is in this \nbill.\n  Also, there are other business provisions, such as the extension of \nbonus depreciation. We extend that provision in current law, and that \nis extended next year. That provision says any expenses that any \ncompany makes can be fully expensed irrespective of the size and \npurpose--50 percent can be fully expensed in the first year, and the \nrest has to be amortized. That is a big boon for small business. There \nare many other provisions. We picked up some of the big ones.\n  I mentioned the 5-year carryback of operating loss. That helps \nbusiness. Section 179 is targeted only to small business. There is \ndelayed recognition of certain cancellations of debt income. There is a \nsmall business capital gains provision. That will help small business \nand also the S-corp holding period. Most small businesses or S-corps--\nthere is a provision here of half a billion dollars relief over 10 \nyears. Altogether, the tax portion of the bill contains about $28 \nbillion worth of provisions targeted to small business.\n  This bill certainly contains provisions that are very helpful. So the \nassertion that there is nothing in this bill to help small business is \nsimply inaccurate.\n  Fourth, two Senators said this bill spends hundreds of thousands of \ndollars for every job this bill creates. A lot of Senators are throwing \na lot of numbers around. It is kind of wild. That is one of them. That \nis wildly inflated. Why? First, those who make that assertion simply \ndivide the total cost of the bill by the number of jobs created in any \n1 year. This bill spends out over 2 years, not 1 year. The jobs it \npreserves or creates will extend over 2 years and longer. Thus, the \nSenators need to cut their estimates per job at least in half. They \ntake 1-year numbers, and we are talking about 2 years. When this bill \nis passed with the jobs it creates or preserves, the people who would \nget those jobs will pay taxes, payroll taxes, income taxes. Thus, they \nbring money back into the Treasury. That also helps cut taxes, the \ntotal number of dollars per job. A fair analysis would cut first their \nassertion in half, and it would add back additional revenues that would \ngo back into the Treasury because of the jobs these people would have \nwould produce payroll taxes and sales taxes--we are talking about \npayroll tax and income tax.\n  I wish when Senators speak--and certainly they can have their \nopinions, and every Senator has come to the conclusion whether he or \nshe is for or against the bill--I wish when the Senators describe the \nbill, they would describe it in a fair and balanced way and then reach \ntheir conclusion--not just take one set of facts only because it is \ninaccurate and misleading, frankly, to the American public, who want us \nto do the right thing, to figure out a way to stop the recession. I \nfirmly believe the public should have all the facts, and they would \nprobably reach the conclusion that this is the right thing to do. In \nstatements I have made, I have acknowledged this is a big bill. I have \nacknowledged it is imperfect. But I also conclude it is far better to \npass this legislation than do nothing. If we don't pass this, we ain't \nseen nothing yet, in terms of the foreclosure of homes underway and \njobs lost. We will get close to the Great Depression.\n  There is no other conclusion than we must pass this legislation \nquickly so we can get on to the next issues we have to face.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, these last few days, I have been traveling \nacross my State of Missouri, and to say that people are outraged over \nthis $1 trillion budget buster would be an understatement. \nUnfortunately, many of the people have called the office and talked to \nthe fine young people who work for me have had all kinds of harsh \ncomments made to them. But as I have traveled around the State from my \nhometown of Mexico in central Missouri to the rural folks in Ava and \nGainesville in south Missouri, to the people in the metropolitan area \nof St. Louis, Missourians are telling me how they are overwhelmingly \nopposed to this stimulus bill.\n  It is not just Missourians I met with in person; thousands have been \ncalling my offices in the State and in Washington, as I said, to voice \nstrong opposition. The numbers aren't even close. It is about 4 to 1 \nagainst this bill. They want me to vote against it because Missourians \nknow the only thing about this bill that will stimulate is the national \ndebt and the growth of Government. Don't get me wrong, Missourians \naren't opposed because they are untouched by the economic crisis. In \nfact, a large percentage of Missourians, such as many other Americans, \nare struggling right now. They want to do something positive. Missouri \nworkers are facing the loss of jobs, Missouri small businesses are \nfailing and Missouri families are struggling to pay their bills and put \nfood on the table.\n  Last week's unemployment report only underscores the suffering of the \nfolks in Missouri and the rest of the Nation. It is clear we must act \nquickly and boldly to protect and create jobs and put people back to \nwork as soon as we can. We cannot afford to sit on the sidelines and \nlet this suffering continue. But we cannot afford nor should we spend \n$1 trillion on a spending bill that will jump-start spending in \nGovernment but not jobs and the economy. I want a responsible stimulus \nbill--not a big spending bill--that will create jobs now and help our \nfamilies.\n\n  Instead of seeing a well-targeted, temporary, and timely emergency \nstimulus bill, what Missourians see is the bill before us today, and \nthey see it for what it is: a budget buster that will fail to create \nthe jobs we need so desperately now and not down the road, if then. As \na matter of fact, CBO said the impact of this bill will be to slow our \nnational gross domestic product by two-tenths to three-tenths of a \npercent in the long run.\n  This trillion-dollar baby is loaded with pet programs and wasteful \nspending, despite the efforts of people on my side to trim the bill's \nprice tag and include some real stimulus. Some of this funding could be \nall right on its own. There are good arguments for them. But it does \nnot belong in an emergency spending bill which goes beyond the budget \nand does so in the name of jump-starting the economy when it will not.\n  The bottom line is that this bill nickel-and-dimes the American \npeople. Unfortunately, it is nickels and dimes with many zeros behind \nthe fives and the tens, and it will result in over $1 trillion in \nadditional debt that our children and grandchildren will spend their \nlives repaying. That is too much to ask of them, especially when it \nwill not do the job we need to do now.\n  Some of my colleagues are talking about a grand compromise. The only \nthing grand about this compromise, regrettably, is its price tag. Only \nin Washington would trimming a $1 trillion bill down to $827 billion be \ncalled fiscally responsible. With interest, this is still a trillion-\ndollar baby, and that is on top of $9 trillion of spending loans and \nguarantees that the Government has already committed, as reported by \nBloomberg news service today.\n  This budget-buster spending bill--$7 billion more than the House \nbill--is\n\n[[Page S2012]]\n\nstill loaded with too much spending that will not create jobs, will not \nlet working families keep more of their hard-earned money, and will not \nstrike at the heart of our economic crisis, which is why, in good \nconscience, most Republicans, such as myself, will be voting no.\n  I am disappointed that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nare trying to point fingers at Republicans for Democrats' failures. \nPresident Obama was very compelling, and he made a strong and very \nurgent pitch for bipartisanship. Instead of bipartisanship, we got a \nbait-and-switch. Calls for bipartisanship switched to partisanship when \nthe bill was taken over by majorities in the House and the Senate.\n  We heard from the President wonderful talk of a timely, targeted, and \ntemporary stimulus bill and the fact that everybody was going to be \ninvolved, both sides. And then it was switched to a bloated, business-\nas-usual spending spree with Democratic priorities, stuffed with \nbillions in wish-list items that will not create jobs. Families need \nhelp now. It is time for this bait-and-switch to end.\n  Rather than an irresponsible spending spree, our economic recovery \nplan must include three key components for it to work. Any economic \nrecovery plan must include real and significant tax relief for working \nfamilies and small businesses. Second, an economic recovery plan must \nbe focused on including significant investment in ready-to-go \ninfrastructure projects, things where you can go to work this year and \nput people to work building roads, bridges, highways, locks, transit \nsystems, water and sewer projects, other items that we badly need in \nthis country. Third, any economic recovery plan must include a solid \nplan to attack the root cause of this economic crisis--the housing and \nfinancial crisis. That is what brought us down. That is what is going \nto hold us here unless we do something about it. Japan spent 10 years \ntrying to spend its way out of a similar crisis, but they did not get \nthe debt out, and as a result they had 10 years of stagnation. We \ncannot afford to spend $1 trillion and have 10 years of stagnation. \nUnfortunately, the Democrats' trillion-dollar spending bill fails to do \nany of the three things that are needed.\n  I want to talk about the third point a little bit. There is broad \nagreement that without help, our economy cannot recover from the \nbreakdown of our financial and credit markets. We were supposed to see \nthe plan to tackle the root of the crisis today. Instead, the President \npostponed the critical announcement and went around campaigning, trying \nto force Republicans to vote for a bill that we know is a pig in a \npoke. We are not going to vote for a pig in a poke. If any of my \ncolleagues don't know what a pig in a poke is, I will explain it to \nthem.\n  Why would President Obama put off talking about the most important \npart of our economic recovery? Perhaps the President does not find the \nidea of coming to Congress and asking for another trillion dollars on \ntop of this budget buster too appetizing before they get this bill \npassed. But just wait, folks, the numbers that are going to come in \nwhen that plan is announced will curl whatever of your hair is not \ncurled already. I think it is one more example of the mixed-up \npriorities. Republicans understand that we must fix the problem first. \nA trillion dollars is a terrible thing to waste.\n  I urged and continue to urge that the President's representatives sit \ndown with the bipartisan leaders of the House and the Senate and the \nappropriations and the tax-writing committees and come up with a bill \nthat is smaller, that is focused, that will get the job done. We do not \nneed an irresponsible bill that stimulates the debt, stimulates the \ngrowth of Government, but fails to stimulate our economy or job \ncreation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, what is the time on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes remaining, of which 5 is \nsupposed to be for the Republican leader.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I return again for the fourth time now \nto ask that the Senate be allowed to vote on my E-verify amendment. \nThat amendment has been refiled to make sure it is applicable to the \nsubstituted bill.\n  I do not see any Members from the majority, so I will not ask at this \nmoment to get UC. The bill managers and the majority leader have been \never so nice, as we have discussed, but having been around here a few \nyears, I have to say I am getting a message, and the message is: The \nanswer is going to be no.\n  The fact is that this legislation has been moving in a certain way \nwith a unanimous consent agreement that was obtained late Friday night \nthat is going to make it not possible to get a vote on the amendment \nwithout unanimous agreement of the Senate. The people who participated \nin that should have known and I am sure did know they were eliminating \nthe amendment I desire to offer. I want to ask again for that unanimous \nconsent and will before I give up the floor.\n  E-Verify is being used by over 100,000 businesses across America. It \nis a free, voluntary system set up by the Department Homeland Security. \nE-Verify allows any employer who has an interest in making sure they \nhire legal workers to simply punch in the Social Security number, and \nwithin a few minutes it shows whether there is a problem with that \nnumber. Ninety-six percent of the persons queried are approved \nimmediately. Employers can feel good, even feel safe in hiring those \napproved by the system, even though that is not absolute proof of the \nlegal status of that applicant.\n  I simply want to offer in this amendment exactly the same language \nthat was accepted, without a vote, in the House bill. Furthermore, the \nlanguage that extends the E-Verify program passed the House by a vote \nof 407 to 2 last July. The amendment simply extends the E-verify \nprogram, No. 1, and also says that if a company gets stimulus money, \nmoney which is supposed to create jobs for Americans, they ought to \ntake the 2 minutes to check to make sure that the people they are \nhiring are lawfully here. We want to make sure that only citizens and \npeople who are here legally can be hired. This includes green card \nholders and temporary workers who are here on valid visas. This \namendment would ensure that only people who are illegally here don't \nget hired.\n  The leadership in the Senate, for some reason, has made up their \nminds that they are not going to let us vote on it. If we had a vote on \nit, it would pass. It already passed the House, and if it passes the \nSenate, it must be a part of the final bill. It cannot be taken out in \nconference without real sculduggery undertaken, and I think it would be \nin the final bill.\n  The game here is clearly to subtly and otherwise keep this vote from \noccurring, let this bill be forced out of here. It will not be in the \nSenate bill. It will be in the House bill. And the conferees will meet \nand they will decide to take it out. That is what is happening. If the \nAmerican people want to know, if the Members of Congress would like to \nknow why people are so upset with us, it is this kind of game playing. \nAll the Members of the House who voted for it can tell their \nconstituents: I voted for it. I don't know why it wasn't in final \npassage. And people in the Senate could say: I didn't vote on it. I \nwould have been for it if I didn't get to vote. But the net result is \nit is not part of the law.\n  I cannot imagine why persons would not want this amendment to be in \nany legislation that would at least take the steps to see that those \nwho are illegally in the country do not get this money.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I rise to address my colleagues \nregarding the importance of improving access to health care in our \nrural communities. Rural America accounts for about 20 percent of the \nNation's population, yet only 9 percent of the country's physicians. It \nshould, therefore, come as no surprise that nearly 70 percent of the \nprimary care health professional shortage areas are in rural \ncommunities.\n  The disparity in access to quality health care has a substantial and \ntangible impact on the quality of care and the quality of life for \nrural Americans, who are typically older, poorer, and\n\n[[Page S2013]]\n\nsicker than the population at large. That also has an impact on the \neconomic vitality of those regions.\n  I do not believe that the stimulus legislation is the right vehicle \nfor the majority of the spending it contains. Of the spending it \ncontains, I note that the bill spends a substantial amount of money for \nhealth care in rural communities. This spending is directed toward \nhealth care access points, health information technology, workforce \ntraining development, and broadband deployment. At this point, it is \nlikely some version of this package will move forward. As Congress \nspends this money, I would encourage my colleagues to give appropriate \nfocus to preventive care and approaches that integrate these various \ncomponents of health care across an entire region.\n  Improving health outcomes for a community requires going beyond \nbuilding hospitals and clinics. A regional ``systems'' approach to \nimproving health may provide effective opportunities to improve the \nhealth outcomes of individuals and communities in a cost-effective \nmanner. Such an approach could integrate health coverage initiatives \nwith prevention programs, primary care clinics, advanced specialty \noutpatient care programs, hospital-based care, and a regional health \ninformation network.\n  I plan to work with my colleagues to shape policies this Congress \nthat will improve health care across America, including rural \ncommunities. Individuals, communities, private foundations, and the \nGovernment must work together if we are to be successful.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, today I want to talk about some of the \nquestionable spending in this bill and some of the amendments that we \naren't going to be voting on.\n  First of all, there is $87 billion in Medicaid funds in this bill.\n  That is a huge payment to the states.\n  And as I have said on this floor several times, it is more than \nStates need to pay for enrollment-driven increases in Medicaid spending \ndue to the recession.\n  I explained last week how the facts show that this amount is far more \nthan States need for the cost of new Medicaid enrollment resulting from \nthe economy.\n  What the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office determined was that \nwhat States need to pay for increases in Medicaid enrollment is not $87 \nbillion but $10.8 billion. That is about $76 billion less than what \nthis stimulus bill gives the States.\n  So the question is, why does this bill provide almost eight times \nwhat the states actually need for the new enrollment resulting from the \ndownturn?\n  Let's not kid ourselves; this bill gives States a slush fund. This \noutlandish sum of money is not needed for Medicaid.\n  It is a slush fund for the States.\n  I thought that money should be spent fairly. I thought there should \nbe some accountability.\n  On Friday night, I had an amendment to insure the Medicaid funds \nwould have been distributed fairly.\n  Amazingly, 17 Members of the Senate voted to give their States less \nmoney.\n  But at least in that case, I was able to get a vote.\n  I had several other amendments that were never allowed to be made \npending.\n  All day Wednesday, we were prevented from making amendments pending.\n  Retreats and signing ceremonies got in the way.\n  Thursday evening, we spent more time arguing over which amendments \nwould be made pending rather than actually processing amendments.\n  At 10 o'clock Friday morning, we were encouraged to bring our \namendments to the floor so they could be debated.\n  For some reason, the first amendment was not allowed until 4\\1/2\\ \nhours later.\n  I am disappointed that several of my amendments will not receive a \nvote.\n  I am not convinced the majority wanted to have open debate and take \nvotes on many of my amendments.\n  It is too bad, because this bill still needs fixing.\n  Congress is giving States $87 billion and just resting on hope that \nStates don't strip the health care safety net for low income families \nand then pocket the money.\n  I use the word ``hope'' because the underlying bill doesn't do enough \nto make sure States do what is best for the Medicaid Program.\n  Does the bill prevent States from cutting their Medicaid programs?\n  It does not.\n  The bill only prevents States from cutting Medicaid income \neligibility.\n  But if Congress is giving States $87 billion and telling them not to \ncut Medicaid eligibility, shouldn't Congress also tell States they \ncan't cut benefits?\n  If Congress is giving States $87 billion and telling them not to cut \nMedicaid eligibility, shouldn't Congress also tell States they can't \ncut payments to providers?\n  States can't change income eligibility, but under the bill as \nwritten, they can cut provider payments or benefits to providers.\n  Will there be Medicaid beneficiaries who are elderly or disabled able \nto receive home and community based services?\n  If we want to keep seniors and the disabled in their homes, rather \nthan institutions, paying direct care workers to provide home and \ncommunity based services is critical.\n  Will there be enough pharmacists taking Medicaid?\n  Will there be enough rural hospitals or public hospitals taking \nMedicaid?\n  Will there be enough community health centers taking Medicaid?\n  Will Medicaid beneficiaries who are elderly or disabled be able to \nget into nursing homes?\n  Will States cut mental health services because Congress didn't \nprevent them from doing so in this bill?\n  Will there be pediatricians or children's hospitals there for \nchildren on Medicaid?\n  If the Senate does nothing to protect access to these vital \nproviders, nobody will be able to assure the people who count on \nMedicaid that the care they need will be there for them.\n  I filed an amendment that prevents States from generally cutting \neligibility and benefits and provider payment rates while they are \nreceiving the $87 billion in additional aid.\n  Members could have voted to really protect Medicaid.\n  That should have had a vote.\n  As written, the bill gives states $87 billion also in the hope that \nStates don't take actions that are contrary to economic growth.\n  I use the word ``hope'' because the bill doesn't do enough to make \nsure States do what is best for our economy either.\n  We should ask for more guarantees that States will spend the money \nappropriately and not make decisions that work against economic \nrecovery.\n  If Congress gives states $87 billion and tells them not to cut \nMedicaid, should Congress also tell States not to raise taxes?\n  If states react to their deficits by increasing taxes, they will \ndefeat the goal of economic recovery.\n  It makes no sense for us to leave the door wide open for States to \nraise taxes while getting an $87 billion windfall from the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I filed an amendment that prevents States from raising income, \npersonal property or sales taxes as a condition of the receipt of $87 \nbillion in federal assistance.\n  That should have had a vote.\n  If Congress gives states $87 billion and tells them not to cut \nMedicaid, should Congress also tell States not to raise tuition at \nState universities?\n  If States can price young people out of an education, that does \nnothing for preparing our workforce for the 21st century.\n  I filed an amendment that prevents States from raising tuition rates \nat State colleges and universities as a condition of the receipt of $87 \nbillion in Federal assistance.\n  That should have had a vote.\n  For $87 billion, what does this bill do to ensure that all those \nFederal taxpayer dollars are being spent appropriately?\n  Almost nothing.\n  Senator Cornyn and I filed an amendment that requires States to do \nsomething to improve their waste, fraud and abuse in exchange for the \n$87 billion in Federal taxpayer's money.\n  It provides a list of eight options to combat waste, fraud and abuse, \nand the Secretary can provide more options as well.\n  These are all very reasonable steps States could and should take if \nCongress is going to send them 87 billion in additional Medicaid \ndollars.\n\n[[Page S2014]]\n\n  They don't have to do all of these various options.\n  Just four.\n  Just show the American people that States can take four simple steps \nto reduce fraud, waste and abuse.\n  Shouldn't Congress at least ask that much of States for $87 billion?\n  That should have had a vote.\n  If Congress passes all this Medicaid spending, what guarantee do we \nhave that the fiscal challenges facing Medicaid in the future will be \nsolved?\n  Sooner rather than later, we must recognize that our entitlements are \nunsustainable as currently constructed.\n  President Obama has acknowledged this himself on numerous occasions \nrecently.\n  One of my concerns about the additional Medicaid funding that is in \nthis bill is that it places too much emphasis on Medicaid in the here \nand now and ignores future fiscal challenges.\n  Just last year, the CMS Office of the Actuary reported that Medicaid \ncosts will double over the next decade. That is simply unsustainable.\n  It is critical that both the Federal Government and States recognize \nthe fiscal challenges we face and take action now.\n  Senators Cornyn and Hatch and I filed an amendment that requires \nStates to submit a report to the Secretary detailing how they plan to \naddress Medicaid sustainability.\n  It is critical that we look at the future of Medicaid if Congress is \nto give States $87 billion in additional Medicaid funding.\n  That should have had a vote.\n  The bill provides a COBRA subsidy to involuntarily terminated \nemployees.\n  The bill places no limits on the eligibility for the subsidy. Zilch, \nZero. Why? I haven't quite figured it out.\n  I know the amendment we are now considering lowers the subsidy, but \nit still has no limits on eligibility for the subsidy.\n  Frankly, I am surprised my Democratic colleagues--and especially the \nObama administration--have not tried to place limits on the \navailability of the subsidy.\n  After all, the subsidy is paid for with taxpayer dollars.\n  Last week, the Obama administration issued guidelines for capping \ncompensation paid to CEOs whose institution receives taxpayer dollars \nthrough the TARP program.\n  But the fact of the matter is this, former Wall Street CEOs and hedge \nfund managers who have made millions of dollars--while running our \neconomy into the ground--will get a tax payer-funded subsidy equal to \nnow 50 percent of their health insurance policy.\n  That is outrageous.\n  I filed an amendment that simply said that if a worker who was \ninvoluntarily terminated from their job earned income in excess of \n$125,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families during 2008, this \nworker would not be eligible to receive the subsidy.\n  Some of my colleagues may ask why we set the cap at $125,000 and \n$250,000.\n  Well, when Candidate Obama was campaigning to be President Obama, he \ncontinually said that he wanted to raise taxes on families making over \n$250,000 a year.\n  Why?\n  Because then, Candidate Obama felt that these people are too ``rich'' \nto pay lower taxes.\n  If these families are too ``rich'' to receive a tax benefit in the \nform of lower taxes, aren't these people too ``rich'' to receive a \ntaxpayer-funded subsidy for health insurance?\n  That should have had a vote.\n  And it is not just the health care amendments.\n  This bill could be improved by increasing the tax credit for \neducation expenses.\n  Senator Schumer and I filed an amendment that would have done just \nthat.\n  It would have increased the American opportunity tax credit from \n$2,500 to $3,000.\n  Senator Schumer has shown great leadership in the area of education, \nand I thank him for partnering with me to help families better afford \ncollege through the tax code.\n  It was a bipartisan amendment.\n  That should have had a vote.\n  I also remain deeply concerned about the oversight of this bill.\n  On the front page of today's Washington Post, there is a story with \nthis headline: ``If spending is swift, oversight may suffer.''\n  The article says,\n\n       The Obama administration's economic stimulus plan could end \n     up wasting billions of dollars by attempting to spend money \n     faster than an overburdened government acquisition system can \n     manage and oversee it.\n\n  When there is a potential for waste, fraud, and abuse Congress needs \nto be proactive, not reactive.\n  We have created a special inspector general for the TARP program and \nwe have the Government Accountability Office reporting to Congress \nevery 60 days on the use of that money as well.\n  However, there is nothing like that for the money in this bill.\n  That is why I introduced an amendment to ensure that Congress has the \nability to get information from the executive branch and respond to the \nallegations that will inevitably come in.\n  The amendment would ensure that any agency that gets funding under \nthis bill would be required to provide records upon written request by \na chairman or ranking member of a committee of Congress.\n  In my experience, the executive branch consistently misinterprets a \nnumber of statutes in order to claim that it is legally prohibited from \ncomplying with oversight requests from Congress.\n  This amendment would make the will of the Congress clear that when we \nask for records, the agencies have an obligation to comply.\n  The public's records should not be kept secret from the elected \nrepresentatives of the people.\n  The idea that only the majority should be able to request documents \nfrom the executive branch is just an invitation for a timid legislative \nbranch.\n  The President's choice to head the Office of Legal Counsel at the \nJustice Department, Dawn Johnson, wrote in July 2007:\n\n       With regard to Congress, oversight obviously tends to be \n     least effective when the President's political party \n     dominates. . . .\n\n  Now that the White House and the Congress are controlled by the same \nparty, I am worried that oversight will suffer, just like Dawn Johnson \nsaid it would.\n  I have always tried to focus on good government issues like waste, \nfraud, and abuse.\n  That's what my amendment did.\n  That should have had a vote.\n  I know a lot of people have worked very hard putting this bill \ntogether.\n  I know a lot of people worked very hard putting the substitute \namendment together.\n  I respect that they have worked hard.\n  Hard work doesn't mean that it is good work.\n  And we should have been allowed to consider and vote on all of the \namendments I have discussed here today.\n  Giving States $87 billion even though that is as much as eight times \nwhat they need to stay ahead of enrollment-driven Medicaid increases is \nstill not well thought out.\n  Giving States $87 billion while still allowing them to cut their \nMedicaid programs is still not well thought out.\n  Giving States $87 billion while still allowing them to raise taxes or \ntuition is still not well thought out.\n  Giving States $87 billion without requiring them to do a better job \nof addressing fraud, waste, and abuse is still not well thought out.\n  Giving States $87 billion without making them address the fiscal \nsustainability of their Medicaid programs is still not well thought \nout.\n  Giving a COBRA subsidy to millionaires is still not well thought out.\n  It is still not well thought out. It is still out of control.\n  The Senate should have been allowed to vote on the numerous \namendments I have discussed today to address the shortcomings that \noccur when partisan bills are moved too quickly.\n  We could still do that.\n  We could process these amendments today.\n  But as we have seen throughout, the majority is not interested in \ntrue bipartisanship or in process that allows for full and open debate \non amendments.\n  One of the key questions in the stimulus debate has been whether one \nside or the other is acting in a partisan manner.\n  To put a finer point on it, you could break it down to two precise \nquestions. The first question would be: Has the\n\n[[Page S2015]]\n\nmajority party, meaning my friends on the Democratic side, ever invited \nmy side, the Republicans to the negotiating table?\n  That is, has an offer, with an intent to negotiate, ever been \nextended by the Democrats? If the answer to the first question is yes, \nthen the second question would be: Has the minority party, the \nRepublicans, ever responded to the offer and taken the next step in the \nnegotiating process.\n  These are the fundamental questions that need to be asked and \nanswered to determine whether the stimulus bill before us is a \nbipartisan process.\n  Let's go to the first question. It is a basic question. My friends on \nthe other side did very well in the last election. We congratulated our \nnew President, Barack Obama, on his victory. The Democrats have robust \nmajorities in both houses of Congress.\n  They have their biggest majority in the House since 1993. They have \nthe biggest majority since the Carter administration. We Republicans \nrecognize they set the agenda.\n  It is kind like the role of the point guard in a basketball game. \nThey have the ball. Just as a point guard runs the plays, so too does \nthe Democratic Leadership in both bodies decide the plays. Republicans \ndon't have the ball.\n  We are in a position of responding. That's all we can do. It's really \nup to the Democratic majority to make the first move. So, with the \ncontext in mind, let's bear down on that first question. Did the House \nDemocrats make an offer?\n  Did the Senate Democrats make an offer?\n  Maybe I missed something, but I don't recall receiving an offer. As I \nsaid in committee and in the opening floor debate, my friend, Chairman \nBaucus, courteously and professionally consulted with me. But \nconsultation is not the same thing as negotiation. They are very \ndifferent actions.\n  As a former chairman, I know well the pressure from the leadership, \nthe caucus, the House, and an administration of one's own party.\n  You really have to push uphill to get a bipartisan deal. The benefit \nof a bipartisan deal is the policy is likely to stand the test of time. \nThe leadership, caucus, and administration are likely to understand \nthat benefit in the abstract, but unlikely to take concrete actions to \nrealize it.\n  All of those partisan pressures will look to pull apart any \nbipartisan plan. I know my friend, Chairman Baucus understands that \ndynamic. He would probably prefer a bipartisan process and product, but \nthe partisan edge is too great. The expectations on the Democratic side \nare too high. It's like the old saying: ``our way or the highway.''\n  So, Madam President, we can't get to the second question. That \nquestion, whether Republicans have engaged in a bipartisan process, \ncan't be answered. It can't be answered because the process was never \nstarted. An offer was never made. We were not invited to the \nnegotiating table.\n  We have the House of Representatives and the House of \nRepresentatives-in-training given how this debate has been run.\n  Today we are being told ``just do it'' at the expense of doing this \nvery important and urgent legislation in a way that does right by the \nAmerican people in the short and longer term.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I wish to to speak to my amendment that \nexpands the eligible participants of the National Telecommunications \nand Information Administration, NTIA, Broadband Technology \nOpportunities Program. This program will be very valuable toward \nincreasing broadband availability and access nationwide.\n  The current language unduly limits private sector participation to \nthat of only public-private partnership. And while I have been a long \nsupporter of these efforts as an additional way to roll out broadband \nservice and have cosponsored legislation in the past to that effect, I \nbelieve it is necessary to expand their eligibility in the program in \norder to more effectively and immediately increase the availability and \naccess to broadband service, mainly in this economy.\n  While many States have established very useful initiatives that have \nadvanced broadband deployment in rural communities where the digital \ndivide existed, other States unfortunately haven't. So by requiring a \npublic-private partnership, it could hinder achieving the fundamental \ngoal established by the program if there is lack of interest or \nresources from the public entities.\n  In addition, this provision imposes a 20-percent match requirement \nfor these grants, which may be satisfied by the grant applicant or any \nthird-party partnering with the grant applicant, and only may be waived \nunder special circumstances. With at least 45 states facing budget \nshortfalls, which the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimates \nfor the current and next two fiscal years could surpass $350 billion, \nit may be difficult or impractical for States and local government to \nengage in these endeavors at this time. The last thing we need to do is \nto put States or local governments in position to have to find \nadditional funds or possibly incur future costs to participate in this \nprogram.\n  Over the past 5 years, the private sector has led the way in \ninvesting billions of dollars to build out communications networks in \norder to meet the growing demand for speed to due the flood of Internet \ncontent and applications. Through technologies such as DOCSIS 3.0, \nADSL2+, and Fiber-to-the-Home, consumers can now achieve download \nspeeds of more than 20 megabits-per-second and in some cases exceeding \n50 megabits-per-second. Wireless broadband, such as Wi-Fi and Wi-Max, \nis playing an increasingly significant role by providing valuable \nmobility--making the Internet portable.\n  In order to achieve these speeds in rural areas and to meet the goals \nprescribed by this provision, it is central that we allow the private \nsector to continue its leadership. If the private sector is willing to \nmake the investment then they should be able to participate in this \nbeneficial program, with or without a public-private partnership.\n  At the same time, States must play a significant role with this \nprogram by working with NTIA and the industry to determine the areas in \nmost need of broadband investment--unserved areas. Doing so will \nprovide a targeted effort toward erasing the digital divide that \ncontinues to exist in many rural communities and inner cities. These \nare the areas that have the most to gain from its availability.\n  Without question, broadband has a significant impact to our economy. \nThe availability of broadband in communities adds over 1 percent to the \nemployment growth rate and a 0.5-percent in business growth to that \narea.\n  With the poor state of our economy, we must look at all opportunities \nthat will not just create jobs but will create 21st century jobs to \nmake our Nation more competitive in this global digital economy, not \nlimit them. This is why I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                               Broadband\n\n  Madam President, I wish to also speak to my amendment that builds \nupon a beneficial provision in this legislation that will advance the \ninvestment and deployment of broadband. It does so by providing \ncompanies an incentive to build broadband infrastructure by using a \ntargeted tax credit. I am very supportive of this measure but believe \nwe can do more in order to have a greater impact.\n  Specifically, this amendment increases the tax credits made available \nfor current generation and next generation broadband deployment to make \nthe provision more attractive; it establishes an ``intermediate \ngeneration'' broadband tier with speeds of 50 megabits per second \ndownstream and 5 megabits per second upstream to set a migration path \nbetween the current and next generations speeds and have more carriers \nparticipate in the program. Also, the amendment refines the definitions \nof areas to provide a greater focus on building out in the areas that \nneed it most--communities where the digital divide continues to exist.\n  It is estimated that 9 to 10 million American households that use the \nInternet still lack access to broadband. And many areas that do have \n``broadband'' lack sufficient bandwidth speeds to utilize the full \npotential and benefits the Internet has to currently offer. These \nareas, typically rural communities, are the ones that have the most to \ngain from broadband. The availability of broadband in communities adds \nover 1 percent to the employment growth rate and 0.5 percent\n\n[[Page S2016]]\n\nto business growth in that area. Also, the Brookings Institute \nestimates that $5 billion increase to broadband investment would \nsuccessfully increase broadband penetration by 7 percent and result in \n2.4 million new jobs throughout the economy. So it is clear that \nbroadband is increasingly becoming a principal anchor to our economy.\n  Over the past 5 years, the private sector has led the way in \ninvesting billions of dollars to build out communications networks in \norder to meet the growing demand for speed due to the flood of Internet \ncontent and applications. Through technologies such as DOCSIS 3.0, \nADSL2+, Fiber-to-the-Home, and Wi-Max, urban and suburban consumers are \nachieving bandwidth speeds that were only available or affordable to \nbusinesses and corporations. But rural communities are unfortunately \nbeing left out in many cases. So we cannot sit idly by while the \ndigital divide continues to exist. If we do not act, millions of \nAmericans without access to modern technology will also find themselves \nunable to realize the educational and employment opportunities of the \nfuture.\n  I take personal interest in this endeavor because approximately 10 \npercent of Mainers still do not have any access to broadband. In \naddition to the creation of construction, engineering, and information \ntechnology jobs that will result from these tax credits, it will help \nrevitalize local economies that have been disseminated by job loss. \nWith a computer, a broadband connection, and an idea, a displaced \nworker can start his or her own business or take continuing education \ncourses online to improve their skill set in order to reenter the \nworkforce. With Internet broadband access, rural small business can \nconnect to a global marketplace.\n  With the poor state of our economy, we must look at all opportunities \nthat will not just create jobs but will create 21st century jobs to \nmake our Nation more competitive in this global digital economy. This \nis why I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 537\n\n  Madam President, Amendment No. 537 to the recovery package will \nensure that all regional electricity planners are eligible for funds \nfor transmission development under this proposal. Under the proposal \ndeveloped by the Appropriations Committee, the language clearly \nbenefits Western States' development of transmission lines to \npopulation centers. This not only unfairly benefits this particular \nregion, but it fails to reflect the proximity of the renewable \nresources in rural New England to population centers. I strongly \nrecommend that this language remain silent on what region or what \nentity should receive funds for transmission planning, and allow the \nDepartment of Energy to determine the merits of each region's plan.\n  My amendment would simply expand the types of technical assistance \ngrants under the Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability Program \nthat shall be provided to all regional transmission organizations, \nregional reliability entities, States, and other transmission owners \nand operators. Currently, the language inequitably limits the types of \nfunds provided to western entities. I strongly believe that this \nlanguage must be expanded upon to provide my State of Maine, and the \nindependent system operator of New England to develop the critical \nrenewable energy sources that exist in New England and construct the \ntransmission lines to bring this power to population centers.\n  I strongly recommend that we adopt this language and I look forward \nto working with my colleagues from New England, the Appropriations \nCommittee, and the Department of Energy, to ensure that this funding is \ndistributed in a regionally equitable manner.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 553\n\n  Madam President, amendment No. 553 will provide dedicated funding for \nhomeowners to replace inefficient fossil fuel heating systems with \nrenewable energy sources. Although there is near unanimity in Congress \nwith regard to the disastrous consequences of our failed energy policy, \nthere still remains to be a bold effort to address this issue. Madam \nPresident, I believe that the consensus will ultimately build to reach \na substantive change in our energy policy, but I believe it is critical \nthat we begin these critical steps within this recovery package and \ndedicate resources to homeowners to utilize renewable energy sources to \nheat their homes, rather than foreign oil.\n  Madam President, in my home State of Maine, roughly 80 percent of the \npopulation utilizes heating oil to keep warm in the winter. In New \nEngland, 40 percent of homes use heating oil. As a result, on average \nnearly 4.7 billion gallons of heating oil are consumed by New England. \nThis is not only an enormous cost to families across the region, but it \ncreates massive greenhouse gas emissions and increases our country's \ndemand of foreign oil. This is not merely a regional issue, this is a \nnational issue, and it should be a priority of Congress to reduce \nheating oil use in New England.\n  Last week, I introduced an amendment that would dedicate $100,000,000 \nof the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program to \nhomeowners who replace their current heating system with a renewable \nenergy system. These can include solar energy systems, geothermal \nenergy systems, and wood pellet systems. These are all alternatives \nthat should be pursued with boldness. While I continue to believe that \nsignificant investments must be made into energy efficiency, we should \nalso work to reduce the percentage of homeowners who use heating oil. I \nbelieve that this is a critical downpayment to addressing our energy \npolicy, and I look forward to working with my colleagues to dedicate \nfunds to replacing fossil fuel systems.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Madam President, the bill before us includes critical funding and \ninfrastructure to at last move our health care system out of the pen \nand paper era so that we may realize the promise of modern technology \nto reduce the toll of medical errors, improve care, and reduce costs. \nIn doing so, it has been estimated that we will create from 40,000 to \nas many as 200,000 new jobs.\n  To make this effort a full success, patients must be willing to trust \ntheir health records to a secure system which protects privacy. That is \nwhy I am pleased that Senator Kennedy has joined with me in my effort \nto achieve that.\n  Today the public's confidence has been shaken by a dramatic growth in \nbreaches of medical records. Such events--affecting over 42 million in \nthe past 4 years carry serious and irreversible consequences. The \nimpact just in the areas of employment and health coverage can be \ndevastating.\n  That is why I am pleased to see a number of provisions provided in \nthis legislation to assure our constituents that greater data security \nand privacy protections will be used to protect their health \ninformation. Foremost among these, I note that the provision I authored \non breach notification has largely been incorporated and extended. Yet \na serious problem remains.\n  Because the fact is that the provisions regarding breach--that notice \nis provided that the HHS Secretary reports on the problem and progress \nin addressing it--that measures are instituted to assure compliance . . \n. these will simply be ineffective. And that is because they will \nseldom be applied. That is because, in defining a breach, and providing \nsome exceptions for inadvertent acts, the language actually excludes \nunintentional disclosures. An unintentional disclosure--the cause of \nthe overwhelming number of breaches--simply would no longer be \nconsidered a breach!\n  We all appreciate that exceptions may be made for some unintentional \naccess. For example, a health care worker might inadvertently call up \nthe wrong record on a computer. But the fact is, there are technical \nmeasures to prevent that in nearly every case. Yet the current language \nstates that breach does not include any unintentional acquisition, \naccess, use, or disclosure of such information by an employee or agent \nof the covered entity or business associate involved if such \nacquisition, access, or use, respectively, was made in good faith and \nwithin the course and scope of the employment.\n  So if one should lose a laptop containing data, or transmit \ninformation to an unauthorized party, or perhaps leave a patient's on-\nline medical history exposed for anyone to see . . . under the language \nin this bill that disclosure is not a breach, and the breach provisions \nsimply do not apply. Since the vast majority of breaches are \nunintentional, we won't see the measures of\n\n[[Page S2017]]\n\nthis bill employed to secure and protect health records. It would apply \nonly to intentional acts--and these are currently already addressed in \ncurrent law as criminal acts. So without a conforming change in this \noverly broad exclusion, we will do little to address one of the \npublic's greatest concerns about Health IT.\n  Our amendment makes the necessary conforming change to the \nexception--simply removing the term disclosure as an exception. \nUnauthorized disclosures of protected health information are breaches--\nand we all know that. Our amendment ensures that we will actually take \nthe steps outlined in this bill to protect Americans from abuse of \ntheir medical data.\n  In addition, we have heard from providers of their concern that the \nlanguage in the bill may not properly extend reasonable exceptions to \nsome health care workers--such as physicians with admitting \nprivileges--who may be neither an employee of the hospital nor an \n``agent'' of that entity. The language of our amendment makes clear \nthat such individuals who are authorized by the entity or business \nassociated to handle protected health information would fall under the \nreasonable exception for inadvertent acts, with the same qualification \nthat further ``acquisition, access or use'' does not occur.\n  We also have added clarity to the bill's definition by stating that \nbreach does not occur when an unauthorized individual simply could not \nreasonably have been able to retain protected health information. That \nmakes it indisputable that many ``no foul'' situations will not be \nswept into breach reporting, such as unopened mailings by covered \nentities which are returned as undeliverable.\n  Once again, I thank Senator Kennedy for his cooperation and support. \nThe product of our bipartisan work ensures that Americans will be \nbetter protected from medical data breaches--and more critically--that \nwe will see a reduction in this perilous threat.\n  Madam President, I now will speak to the substitute to the stimulus \npackage we are considering today--against the backdrop of a moment in \ntime in which our Nation lost 600,000 jobs last month alone, we are \nsuffering under a 7.6 percent unemployment rate, and the number of \nAmericans receiving unemployment benefits has reached 4.8 million--the \nhighest since recordkeeping began in 1967.\n  Indeed, the landscape facing us is so grave that economists of all \npersuasions--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--indisputably agree \nthat inaction is not an option and that the question which has been \nbefore this Chamber since last week and before that in the Finance \nCommittee is, What will actually work to jump-start this economy?\n  Yet even the best economic minds are not in agreement or accord on \nwhat is the optimal stimulus to pursue--and what it would achieve. \nBusiness Week, in its January 28 issue, asks ``how much does boosting \ngovernment spending or cutting taxes help the private sector? Can \nmassive fiscal stimulus create jobs and increase economic output?'' \nDavid Leonhardt, economics columnist for the New York Times, stipulated \nin an article on January 29, 2009, that such a ``bill should help the \neconomy in both the near term and the long term. But the government \ndoesn't go out and spend about $800 billion every day. The details \nmatter.'' He is absolutely right--the details do matter. That is why we \nhave been engaged in this necessary, vigorous debate. And then there \nare economists such as Alan Viard, formerly of the Bush administration \nand now with the American Enterprise Institute, who questioned the idea \nof a stimulus initially who now agree that one, although limited, is \nrequired.\n  As I said last Monday here on the floor, I want to support a stimulus \npackage, but I cannot support just any package. We are confronting a \nmultidimensional crisis that requires a multidimensional approach, and \nwe cannot afford to get it wrong.\n  Already Congress passed a rescue plan for financial institutions, but \nthe lending expected to free up our credit markets has yet to \ntranspire. Already the Federal Reserve has essentially exhausted its \noptions to improve the economy through monetary policy, having reduced \ninterest rates to zero--something else that hasn't happened since the \n1930s--and lent more than $1 trillion to stabilize the financial and \ncredit markets. So, as I said during the markup of the Senate Finance \nCommittee's portion of this package, we ought to remember that for us \nin crafting fiscal policy to meet this historic challenge, there are no \ndo-overs. We only have so many arrows in our fiscal quiver.\n  So the question at this point isn't if an economic stimulus is called \nfor. And it isn't about how much we label as ``tax relief'' and how \nmuch we label as ``spending.'' In the final analysis, it is about the \nmerits of the individual measures in this legislation and whether the \ntotality of the package can--in the timely, temporary, and targeted \nfashion we have employed on stimulus measures in the past--deliver job \ncreation and assistance to those who have been displaced. Because both \nelements are essential to turning the economic tide and aligning our \nNation for a more prosperous future.\n  I know this process got off to a less than stellar start. The House \nof Representatives, frankly, did not put its best bipartisanship foot \nforward by closing the door on House Republicans with an end result of \nthe House bill receiving zero Republican votes. I like to think that \nthere is a more constructive dynamic here in the Senate--a belief I \nwill look to substantiate further in the coming days once we move to \nconference.\n  So I recognize and share the frustration of my fellow Republicans. At \nthe same time, we are no longer in control of this Chamber, and we \nshould embrace our role as a minority to do all we can to exercise our \nrights to make constructive changes to this legislation. That is what \nmany of my colleagues have been doing, and that is what this debate is \nall about.\n  I have been in the Senate long enough to know that in a process like \nthis there has to be give and take. And, in fact, the American people \nlook to the Senate to temper the passions of politics, to provide an \ninstitutional check that ensures all voices are heard and considered, \nbecause while our constitutional democracy is premised on majority \nrule, it is also grounded in a commitment to minority rights.\n\n  The bottom-line challenge is crafting a package that is effective--\nand that means forging a measure that doesn't confuse stimulus with \nomnibus. And on that score I believe the Finance package--which \nultimately came to comprise 65 percent of the combined legislation we \nare now considering, and with its tax provisions comprising more than \n40 percent of the overall package--set an appropriate standard as \nright-sized, properly targeted, and timely--thanks to Chairman Baucus \nholding 10\\1/2\\ hour markup and working through the issues. Under the \nleadership of Ranking Member Grassley, we included relief from the \nalternative minimum tax--which bolsters the President's make work pay \nprovision I might add. We included a health information technology \nprovision I championed that will create 40,000 new jobs as well as \nrenewable tax credits I have long fought for that will create more than \n89,000 more. Frankly, if we had not dithered last year and opted to \npass the extension of the renewable tax credits at the beginning of \n2008, we would have already been on the road to creating 100,000 new \njobs.\n  We also included significant tax relief that could be available to \nsmall businesses, the true job generators of our economy. We extended \nunemployment compensation benefits which, as we heard last year from \nthe Congressional Budget Office, is a preeminent stimulus tool with a \ncost-effectiveness that is ``large,'' a length of time for impact that \nis ``short,'' and an uncertainty about the policy's effects that is \n``small.'' And we provided vital Medicaid assistance to the States--and \nI have heard the arguments against it, but does anyone seriously \nbelieve that a projected, combined budgetary shortfall of $350 billion \nfor the States over the next 2 years won't have a profound impact on \nour national economy, as States grapple with raising taxes or slashing \nspending to balance their budgets.\n  Our package also contains a payroll tax credit for more than 95 \npercent of working families in the United States--which Mark Zandi has \nsaid will be ``particularly effective, as the benefit will go to lower \nincome households\n\n[[Page S2018]]\n\n. . . that are much more likely to spend any tax benefit they \nreceive.'' And it increases eligibility for the extraordinarily \nsuccessful refundable portion of the child tax credit that I originally \nspearheaded--to reach low-income families earning between $8,100 and \n$14,767 a year. Now, I have heard the arguments before against \nrefundability, but this program reaches people who may not earn enough \nto have Federal tax liability but who work and contribute local taxes \nand payroll taxes--and will therefore get additional money into the \npockets of those most likely to spend it.\n  Before I go on to describe additional critical tax provisions in the \nFinance portion, I should note that although an extension of the \nsuspension of required minimum distribution rules applicable to IRA, \n401(k), 403(b), and 457 plans is not included, I appreciate that \nChairman Baucus has agreed to work with me to address this issue. While \nCongress provided critical relief to retirees by suspending these rules \nfor 2009, Congress must go further and waive the rules for 2010. \nEquities markets have not recovered after a disastrous 2008, and our \nNation's seniors will require considerable time to recoup their \nsubstantial losses. I trust that the Finance Committee will act to \ncontinue relief in a forthcoming pension or tax extenders bill.\n  As ranking member of the Small Business Committee, I am also pleased \nthe bill before us contains tax provisions I authored to help them \nsustain operations and employees, as part of my Small Businesses \nStimulus Act of 2009. Our package extends enhanced section 179 \nexpensing for 2009, allowing small businesses throughout the Nation to \ninvest up to $250,000 in plant and equipment that they can deduct \nimmediately, instead of depreciate over a period of 5, 7, or more \nyears.\n  Our package also lengthens the carryback period of net operating \nlosses to 5 years to provide businesses facing unprecedented losses due \nto the economy with a $67.5 billion infusion of capital in 2009 and \n2010. But crucially, this proposal also ensures that those receiving \nFederal bailout funds from the TARP program will not be allowed to take \nadvantage of these additional taxpayer resources.\n  That is why I also appreciate the chairman's inclusion, at my \nrequest, of an initiative based on a bill that Senator Kerry and I have \nintroduced to eliminate the taxation of gain on small business stock--a \nproposal President Obama had also made. Under current law, section 1202 \nprovides a 50-percent exclusion--a 14-percent effective tax rate--for \nthe gain from the sale of certain small business stock held for more \nthan 5 years. This provision is limited to individual investments and \nnot the investments of a corporation.\n  As a 14-percent effective tax rate provides little incentive to hold \nsmall business stock, given that Fortune 500 company stock is taxed at \n15 percent if held for only 1 year, the provision allows a 75-percent \nexclusion--7 percent effective tax rate--for individuals on the gain \nfrom the sale of certain small business stock field for more than 5 \nyears. This change is for stock issued after the date of enactment and \nbefore January 1, 2011.\n  Furthermore, I was pleased to see that the chairman included a \nprovision I joined Senators Lincoln and Hatch in spearheading to lessen \nthe impact of the built-in gains tax on small businesses. By reducing \nthe period from 10 to 7 years that S corporations converting from C \ncorporation status must hold appreciated assets before they can be sold \nat lower tax rates, this proposal will enable small businesses to \nunlock capital that is currently frozen. This change is absolutely \nessential at a time in which our Nation's credit markets remain frozen \nand small businesses are struggling to meet their financing \nrequirements. This provision benefit up to 900 small businesses in my \nhomes State of Maine.\n  We must neither neglect nor forget our Nation's distressed and rural \ncommunities. The Finance package rightly recognizes that imperative by \nincluding an additional $1.5 billion in 2008 and 2009 allocation \nauthority for the new markets tax credit. I am told that the Community \nDevelopment Financial Institutions Fund, which administers the \nincentive, can allocate the augmented 2008 credit authority within 90 \ndays, which will create 11,000 permanent jobs and 35,000 construction \njobs.\n  Moreover, I am pleased the chairman agreed to my provision--based on \nlegislation I introduced in January--to expand the definition of \n``manufacturing'' as it pertains to the small-issue Industrial \nDevelopment Bond, or IDB Program to include the creation of \n``intangible'' property. For example, this would allow the bonds to be \nused to benefit companies that manufacture software and biotechnology \nproducts by helping them get the financing necessary to assist their \noperations in innovating and create new jobs.\n  With this change, State and local financing authorities could use \nIDBs to raise capital to provide low-cost financing of manufacturing \nfacilities with the jobs of the future, helping to attract new \nemployers and assist existing ones to grow. Notably, knowledge-based \nbusinesses have been at the forefront of this innovation that has \nbolstered the economy over the long term. For example, science parks \nhave helped lead the technological revolution and have created more \nthan 300,000 high-paying science and technology jobs, along with \nanother 450,000 indirect jobs for a total of 750,000 jobs in North \nAmerica.\n  Our package also includes, at my request provisions from legislation \nSenator Kerry and I introduced to keep the alternative minimum tax from \neroding the value of private-activity bonds, which are used to promote \ninfrastructure and student loans. Congress repealed the AMT for use \nagainst housing private activity bonds as part of last summer's housing \nbill, and this proposal extends that beneficial treatment to other \ntypes of private-activity bonds. This should help spur demand for these \ntypes of bonds in a time in which the Nation is experiencing a credit \ncrunch.\n  I also appreciate the fact that the chairman agreed in a colloquy \nwith me to address the critical issue of energy efficiency in the 25C \ntax credit. I am deeply concerned that our package fails to include \nmodernizations to the efficiency standards, and I am alarmed that this \nprovision, which I authored in 2005, may not propel our country forward \nto the truly advanced energy efficiency products. In addition, I am \ntroubled that the stimulus proposal seems to address energy efficiency \nmerely through appropriations. The Finance Committee has been on the \nvanguard of developing an energy efficiency industry through the Tax \nCode, and I am deeply concerned that we have failed to complement the \nAppropriations Committee proposal.\n  In regard to the high-tech agenda ahead of us, the Finance measure \nestablishes a tax credit for broadband infrastructure investment in \nrural and underserved areas that I coauthored with Senator Rockefeller. \nThe purpose of our proposal is to drive job creation and to stimulate \nbroadband deployment, particularly in areas where the digital divide \ncontinues to exist.\n  Specifically, this proposal promotes broadband deployment in rural \nareas by providing a two-tiered tax incentive to stimulate new \nbroadband investment. The provision contains a 10-percent tax credit to \ncompanies expanding their ``current generation'' broadband services--\ndefined as a download speed of 5 megabits per second--to rural and low-\nincome areas and a 20-percent tax credit to companies deploying ``next \ngeneration'' broadband services--defined as download speeds of 100 \nmegabits per second. Any provider installing broadband service in the \ntargeted areas, whether by standard telephone wire, cable, fiber \noptics, terrestrial wireless, satellite or any other medium, would be \neligible.\n  The data is abundant and clear on the significant impact that \nbroadband plays in communities--the availability of broadband in \ncommunities adds over 1 percent to the employment growth rate and 0.5-\npercent in business growth to that area. Businesses locate operations \nand hire employees in urban locations that have adequate broadband \ninfrastructure, rather than in rural or inner-city locations that are \notherwise more efficient due to the location of their customers or \nsuppliers, a stable or better workforce, and cheaper production \nenvironments. It is not an understatement to say that the deployment of \ntechnology could fundamentally transform the future of rural and inner \ncity America.\n  Finally, today there are 45 States which face budget shortfalls over \nthe\n\n[[Page S2019]]\n\nnext 2 years which will result in a combined budget ``gaps'' of $350 \nbillion--would anyone suggest that this would not have a profound \nimpact on our national economy? Because States, which unlike the \nFederal Government, are required to balance their budgets, they will \nhave to raise taxes or reduce spending or both. And right now, States \nare struggling to serve even their current Medicaid enrollees, never \nmind facing the growing demand for Medicaid care--as with every 1-\npercent increase in unemployment an additional 1 million Americans will \nqualify for Medicaid or SCHIP assistance, under current enrollment \ncriteria.\n  So we should further assist their ability to serve their current \nMedicaid enrollees without imposing unacceptable tax increases or \nextending recent benefit cuts even further. At the same time, I thank \nthe chairman for including provisions I championed to ensure States \ncannot use the increased Federal match monies to expand eligibility and \nto ensure prompt payment to providers--as delays in payments can \nthreaten their continued operation, limit their ability to invest in \nnew technology, or hire new employees--just the type of activity we \nwant to encourage. I also thank the chairman for extending this \nrequirement for nursing homes, which is crucial to better supporting \nlong term care in this country.\n  We then came to this debate on the floor, having combined the finance \npackage--which had fully $325 billion in tax relief, and $198 billion \ntoward truly stimulative spending--with the appropriations portion at \n$365.6 billion. And as I stated on the floor last week, I share the \ndeep concerns that while more than 98 percent of the finance package \nwould spend out over the next 2 years, just 12 percent of the \ndiscretionary spending portion of the original, overall package would \nspend out in the first year--and just 49 percent over the 2 next years.\n  Further, as the President said last Wednesday in our one-on-one Oval \nOffice meeting, getting this not only right--but also right-sized--is \nalso imperative. As he stated, we will lose $2 trillion in consumer \ndemand this year and next--demand, I might add, that must be \n``backfilled'' in our economy with a substantial investment in both tax \nrelief and targeted, effective expenditures that will create jobs. The \nfact is, given the monumental level of this recession that's about to \nbecome the longest and deepest since World War II, we can't just be \nthrowing pebbles in the pond, Mr. President--we require the ripple \neffect of a boulder while at the same time ensuring that this is not an \nopen-ended passport to spending in perpetuity. We heard the President \nsay last week essentially that stimulus is spending. But let us \nremember, not all spending is stimulus.\n  In order to help address the various concerns that have been \nexpressed, I worked with Chairman Baucus to scale back the finance \npackage by $25 billion, to contribute to the overall level of \nreductions necessary in combination with cuts on the appropriations \nside to trim more than $100 billion from the package--which was a \nnumber I had suggested in my meeting with the President last week.\n\n  Overall, on the appropriations side, $83 billion has been excised \nfrom the package, and that is progress--as is the fact that more than \n40 percent of the Senate bill contains tax relief, whereas that ratio \ndrops to about 33 percent in the House bill. And we shouldn't stop \nthere, we should also require a specific listing of the numbers of jobs \nbeing created by each title in this act, and also rescind any \nunobligated balances of any program in the act that are not currently \ncreating--or cannot be reasonably expected to create--jobs or help \nthose displaced by the current recession.\n  Which brings us to today, Mr. President. We have now considered a \nweek's worth of amendments. And we have come to a compromise on both \nthe spending and tax portions of the package at about a ratio of more \nthan three to one. Is this compromise perfect, Mr. President? No. Is it \neverything that I personally would agree with? No. But it is, in fact, \nimprovement and progress--and it is critical that these improvements \nare preserved in conference with the House following final passage of \nthis bill.\n  Looking forward, Mr. President, this must be a two-way street between \nRepublicans and Democrats--and between the Senate and the House--if we \nare to craft a package commensurate with the times. I will support this \ncompromise, but I will also continue to work throughout the conference \ncommittee process to ensure the individual elements of the final \npackage will actually deliver job creation and assistance to people in \nneed to the best of our ability.\n  That is my bottom line--this process is far from complete, our work \nis far from complete, and make no mistake, my support at the end of the \nday will be predicated on the demonstrable ability of the elements of \nthe final package to provide a vitally necessary stimulus to our \neconomy through rapid job growth. That must be the yardstick by which \nwe measure the value of any final version of this bill.\n\n\n                   BIODEFENSE MEDICAL COUNTERMEASURES\n\n  Mr. CASEY. I rise to engage the esteemed chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, Senator Daniel Inouye; Senator Tom Harkin, \nchairman of the Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education \nSubcommittee; my Pennsylvania colleague, Senator Arlen Specter; and my \nKansas colleague, Senator Sam Brownback in a colloquy regarding funding \nfor creating capabilities to develop and manufacture biodefense medical \ncountermeasures.\n  As the chairmen and Senator Specter are aware, our country faces the \nrising threat of a bioterrorist attack against the U.S. homeland. \nIndeed, most experts agree that a bioweapons attack could be launched \nagainst the United States within the next few years. Such an event \ncould inflict civilian casualties on a scale that would threaten the \nviability of a city's or region's key institutions and impose a \nwidespread sense of vulnerability across the country and \ninternationally.\n  Moreover, President Obama has stated on numerous occasions that the \nbioterrorist threat is real and increasing. And, I believe, he will \nmake responding to such a threat a key element of his national security \nstrategy.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I agree with my colleague from Pennsylvania that our \nNation faces this growing threat and that we must respond accordingly.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, the bill the chairman has brought before \nthe Senate includes funding to respond to many economic and security \nissues facing our country today, and I congratulate him on his \ntremendous effort. In particular, the bill includes funding for the \nHealth and Human Services Department pandemic flu program, which falls \nunder the subcommittee on which I have dedicated much of my service to \nthe country. Unfortunately, the Senate bill does not identify specific \nfunding for HHS to address bioterrorism and the development and \nproduction of biodefense medical countermeasures.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. That is correct. I recognize the importance of these \ninvestments. It is my understanding that the House version of the \nrecovery bill includes funding for biodefense and medical \ncountermeasures within the public health and social services emergency \nfund.\n  Mr. SPECTER. A key component of preparedness is the availability of \neffective preventive and therapeutic drugs and vaccines to counter \ndiseases caused by man-made attacks and public health threats. \nIdentifying and funding the means to acquire these drugs and vaccines \nis an issue that I believe the Appropriations Committee and the Labor-\nHHS Subcommittee should urgently address.\n  Mr. CASEY. It is my understanding that the House version of the \nrecovery bill includes funding for biodefense and medical \ncountermeasures within the public health and social services emergency \nfund. I am sure my colleagues would join me in urging the Senator to \nagree to include funding for capabilities to support the development \nand production of biodefense medical countermeasures to address the \nbioterrorism threat in the conference report of this bill. We believe \nthere is no better use of American taxpayers' dollars to both create \nhigh-quality jobs, retain biotechnology expertise domestically, and \naddress a terrible threat to our Nation.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I agree with my colleagues, Mr. Chairman, that the \nbill the Senator has brought before us addresses many impending needs. \nThis\n\n[[Page S2020]]\n\nmatter we are discussing not only addresses a critical matter of \nnational security by creating the capability to develop enough medical \ncountermeasures to treat the U.S. population in the event of a \nterrorist attack, but it would expand domestic jobs and domestic \ninfrastructure in the biotechnology industry. Like Senator Specter \naddressed previously, this bill does not identify specific funding for \nthese needs.\n  I conclude that the best way of addressing these threats is for \npartnerships between the academic, industry and government sectors. \nAcademically affiliated, privately operated National Centers of \nExcellence for Flexible Manufacturing of Medical Counter Measures are \nthe answer to developing, sustaining, and integrating our country's \nbiodefense portfolio under the Biomedical Advanced Research and \nDevelopment Authority.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank my colleagues for raising this important issue \nwith me today. I intend to work with them and the members of the \nconference committee to try to identify funding to develop and produce \nbiodefense medical countermeasures.\n  Mr. HARKIN. The capability that we are discussing is vital to our \nNation's defense. It would also be a critical source of innovation, \ndeveloping novel countermeasures faster and cheaper. I will also work \nwith Senators during conference.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment I offered, the E-verify amendment, be made pending and we \nhave a vote on it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I might say, I was going to \nmischievously suggest to my good friend from Alabama, maybe we can work \nsomething out if he can make sure the managers' amendment receives no \nobjection.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would be delighted to talk with you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I knew you would. I must say, I expected that response, \nbut I must also say the Senator from Alabama knows full well there are \nother Senators who would like their amendments in and agreed to. In all \nthings considered, in fairness to all Senators all the way around, I \nthink it is prudent to object, so the Senator's amendment may not come \nup at this point.\n  I yield to the Senator from Nebraska--how much time does the Senator \nwish to speak?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Six minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. About 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, I rise today to take \naction--and I thank my friend and colleague from Montana for this \nopportunity to speak--for action is what is demanded by this American--\nand, indeed, global--economic crisis.\n  The economic recovery bill that came over from the House was a start, \nand the bill introduced in the Senate was better, but it was not good \nenough, and some elements did not seem to belong in a bill to create \nnew jobs, save the jobs people have now, and return our economy to \nprosperity as soon as possible. That is why Senator Susan Collins and I \nworked with a group of nearly a dozen and a half Senators--12 Democrats \nand 6 Republicans--to cut and tailor our bipartisan compromise. It \nfocuses like a laser beam on tax cuts for the middle class and job \ncreation for millions of Americans.\n  Critics have gone to great lengths to find fault. That is the old \nWashington way that leads straight down the path to partisan bickering, \ndeadlock, and a dead end. Many have said it spends too much. Others \nhave said it cuts too much spending. That is a sign, to me, that \nperhaps we have it just about right.\n  We cut $110 billion of inefficient or less stimulative spending out \nof the previous bill. As I say, we have trimmed the fat, fried the \nbacon, and milked the sacred cows. We didn't have a closed-door \nnegotiating system last week as some have said. It was open to all \nSenators, and they were invited. All were welcome to participate. In \nfact, several Republican colleagues did join us and participated, \nalthough they declined to support our final proposal. But they helped \nshape it, and their contributions were listened to, were considered, \nand were valuable.\n\n  Now, some critics also say that other approaches might have been \nbetter for the economy than what we put in place. But no other plan has \nenough bipartisan support--and that is what you have to have in the \nSenate--to get the 60 votes needed to pass. The time for talk is over, \nand it is time to act.\n  I believe our plan is the best chance for Congress to stop an \neconomic avalanche. In just a year's time, that avalanche has swept \naway jobs for 3.6 million Americans--including many in my State of \nNebraska--and nearly half nationwide vanished in the last 3 months. \nThat is three and a half million jobs lost in the last 12 months and \nalmost half of them in the last 3 months. The avalanche has erased \nbillions of dollars in assets, driven anxiety up, and pushed our \neconomy down toward the worst condition in seven decades. And it is \naccelerating. People in Nebraska and across America are losing their \nhomes every day. The cost of inaction would be far higher than the cost \nof this bill, and acting later, when we are in a deeper recession or \ndepression, will cost even more.\n  Other critics of the bipartisan plan also say we are creating too \nmuch debt to leave to our children. I am afraid they have not learned \nfrom the past. The surest way to get out of debt is the way we have \nbefore: economic growth. Let's review. In 1993, when President Clinton \ninherited a deficit of over $300 billion, we grew our way out of it \nwith tax cuts and jobs that lowered unemployment, increased \nproductivity, and increased revenues. With the help of the Congress, he \nturned that deficit into a surplus of over $200 billion. President \nObama has inherited a deficit of at least half a trillion dollars, and \nnow we must once again restart the American prosperity engine with a \nlean diet of tax cuts and jobs for the middle class. This is not only \nthe fastest plan to get us out of this economic slide; indeed, it is \nthe only thing that ever has.\n  While it certainly is easier to stay on the sidelines, it is our \nresponsibility, as Members of Congress, to the American citizens and \ntaxpayers to approve a recovery plan that is tailored, targeted, and \nlean, one that reduces taxes so middle-class Americans can get by today \nand that creates American jobs so we can grow our way out of this \ncrisis.\n  Some say we have cut too much from important programs, such as help \nfor struggling States. We did reduce spending by $40 billion, leaving \n$39 billion, because we didn't want to offer a taxpayer-backed blank \ncheck to States with little accountability or promise of job creation. \nThe plan leaves unchanged $87 billion to States under Medicaid. Now, \nlet's be clear. The cuts our group found are reductions in new spending \nand not actual cuts.\n  The more than $300 billion in tax cuts will help families with \nchildren, college students, home buyers, commuters, and businesses. \nThey also offer incentives to expand renewable energy and promote \nenergy efficiency. Cutting taxes has always been a key way Government \ncan drive private sector job and economic growth, and the economic \nrecovery plan we will consider delivers those major tax cuts.\n  The $110 billion leaner spending side of the plan will fuel, save, \nand create jobs in towns, townships, and cities across America. It \nstill provides robust support for infrastructure projects that will fix \nand build roads, bridges, highways, and sewer systems. It will improve \ncommunity health centers, refurbish childcare centers, expand broadband \nInternet service, and repair housing. It will create the smart grid for \nelectricity transmission across our country. Those upgrades will leave \na lasting legacy long beyond the terms of the legislation.\n  Our refocused bipartisan proposal isn't perfect. We all will admit \nthat. But it will, in my view, do the job we need right now, and it \nwill get many Americans back on the job while keeping many others in \ntheir jobs.\n  I would like to extend my gratitude to Senator Susan Collins from \nMaine, Senator Olympia Snowe from Maine,\n\n[[Page S2021]]\n\nSenator Joe Lieberman from Connecticut, Senator Arlen Specter from \nPennsylvania, and the more than a dozen others who joined our \nnegotiations--who, rather than taking the easy path of criticism, saw \nthe need for resolute action and joined in the task of building----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 6 minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield additional time to the Senator--\nsay, 4 more minutes?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Thirty seconds more.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield a full minute.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I thank my friends for these negotiations. \nRather than taking the easy path of criticism that we have seen, they \nsaw the need for resolve and they joined in the task of building our \nAmerican recovery, for I believe, as they do, in the hard work and \ningenuity of the American people, and that is how we will return to \nprosperity, as only Americans can and have.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague from \nMontana for that courtesy.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, how much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to consume that 4\\1/2\\ minutes \nand an additional 1 minute, if the generous chairman will accept.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I hear the word ``legacy.'' The legacy \nthat is going to be left from this bill is demonstrated to us by \nhistory. Here is what we did the last time we found ourselves in this \nshape. The Federal Government as a percentage of GDP went from 2\\1/2\\ \npercent to 20 percent in all the New Deal programs.\n  There is a wonderful book, and people ought to read it. It is called \n``The Forgotten Man,'' Roosevelt's ``Forgotten Man'' series. This is an \nanalysis of what we did, how we did it, what worked, and what didn't. \nQuite frankly, what you can see from this chart is that Government \nnever got small again. Never. And what is going to happen is, if you \nlook outside of this chart to what we are doing now, you are going to \nsee Government grow again. So the total State and Federal take from GDP \nwill be above 38 percent from now on. Now, what does that mean to you? \nWhat is the legacy of that? The legacy of that is lost opportunity--not \nfor us; we will be pushing up daisies. Our children and our \ngrandchildren, though, will suffer from a massive decline in their \nstandard of living.\n  That is not to say we shouldn't do a stimulus bill. The stimulus bill \nwe should do should be very targeted--this one is not--it should be \ntimely--this one is not--and it should be temporary--this one \nabsolutely is not because we are going to see this same thing happen. \nEven our own budget chairman, the honorable Senator from North Dakota, \nsays, at a minimum, $124 billion a year increase in the baseline, \nadditional spending that will never go away--never go away.\n  So what does it mean when we say we have a legacy? Here is the legacy \nof this bill: The cost this year, not including interest, for every \nfamily in this country is going to be $11,000. That is what we are \ngoing to borrow against your future earnings. We will increase the \nbaseline budget this year $350 billion. That is just this year. The \nincrease in the annual deficit will be somewhere between $50 billion \nand $185 billion, before interest. And we are going to pay $438 billion \nin interest on this borrowed money over the next 10 years. Everybody \nknows that if you save before you spend, it costs you about half. But \nwhat we are doing is spending and costing the future of our children.\n  What is the Congressional Budget Office's best guess? That we will \ncreate somewhere between 1.3 and 2.9 million new jobs. But also their \nbest guess is that in about 10 years, this ``stimulus'' will have a \nnegative effect on the economy. We are going to spend $15 billion to \nrenovate offices for Federal employees. What percentage of this $800-\nplus billion bill will really stimulate? About 12 percent.\n  The other thing that is wrong with the bill is that there are no \nbrakes on it. What happens when we have two or three quarters of \ngrowth? Do you think this body will come back and take this money away? \nNo. Politicians are averse to ever taking anything away because they \ncare more about getting reelected than they care about what is in the \nlong-term best interest of the country. So here we have a stimulus bill \nthat will forever raise the baseline and the interference of \nGovernment.\n  Now, what does this really mean if it goes to 35 percent? What it \nmeans is that you lose liberty. You lose freedom. If you think the \nGovernment is involved in the decisions you make now, just grow it \nanother 10 percent total and see what happens. Your liberty and your \nfreedom. It doesn't mean we shouldn't do a stimulus bill. We should. \nBut we ought to do one that will really make a difference.\n  The other moral hazard with this bill is that we didn't hear today \nwhat the plans are for the mortgage problems, the housing problems, or \nthe bank problems. Now, the reason we didn't hear about that is because \nwe have to get past this vote because when you get ready to swallow the \nnear trillion dollars they are going to come and ask for on those two \nproblems, this is going to seem small. But if you have to talk about \nboth at the same time, $1.8 trillion, now we are at $25,000 per family.\n  The fact is, what was done in this country from 1929 to 1938 didn't \nwork. We are not even doing as good a job as they did in terms of \ndirecting the money. Yet, because of the basis of fear, we are going to \npass a bill saying we have to do something. We do have to do something, \nbut it doesn't have to be done today. It needs to be done in a very \nmeticulous manner to make sure we get it right.\n  There is a legacy with this bill. I will spend the last few minutes \ntalking about the fact that there are no earmarks in this bill. That is \nan out and outright untruth. There are tons of earmarks in this bill, \nfrom electric golf carts, to power generations for specific lobbyists \nwho spent well over $1 million getting it in there, to a new building \nfor the State Department to train its security personnel. They spend \n$12 million a year now. They are going to spend $275 million now and \nstill spend $12 million a year, but we get a building in West Virginia \nbecause the Senators from West Virginia want that building there.\n  The competitiveness clause we put in, which the Senate voted \nunanimously on to put all contracts competitive, it will be blown out \nof the water, it will never come out of conference----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Because we don't want to do what is best for the children \nof this country; we want to do what is best for the politicians.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, is the time controlled?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is controlled. All remaining time is under \nthe control of the Senator from Montana.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on behalf of the \nbipartisan compromise amendment Senator Ben Nelson and I have filed, on \nwhich we will be voting very soon. Before I get to the specifics of our \namendment, let me address more generally the challenge, indeed the \ncrisis, we are facing as a nation.\n  Over the course of the past year and a half, and particularly during \nthe last 6 months, we have witnessed the collapse of the housing \nmarket, the unraveling of our Nation's financial institutions, and the \nevaporation of trillions\n\n[[Page S2022]]\n\nof dollars of what had been invested in the stock market and in \npeople's retirement accounts. As a result, millions of Americans are \nworried about whether they now have enough money to retire, how they \nwill make ends meet if they are already retired, or how they will help \npay for their children's education.\n  I have heard from far too many Mainers who have had to delay their \nretirement plans because they no longer have the nest eggs for which \nthey have worked so hard.\n  The crisis that started on Wall Street has become a crisis on Main \nStreet in every community in America. The deeply disturbing economic \nreport released last Friday underscores the magnitude of the challenge \nwe are facing. Nearly 600,000 Americans lost their jobs in the month of \nJanuary, bringing to 2.5 million the number lost since the end of \nsummer. The Nation's unemployment rate is the highest it has been in \nmore than 16 years.\n  In my home State of Maine, job losses totaled 3,400 in December and \nthe unemployment rate has reached 7 percent. It seems every day brings \nanother report of a business laying off hundreds or even thousands of \nworkers.\n  Friday we learned that Katahdin Paper, in East Millinocket, ME, is \nbeing forced to lay off 140 workers for at least a month because the \nbusiness simply does not have enough orders to keep these workers on \nthe job. These are people who have worked hard their entire lives to \ntake care of their families and now they fear for their future.\n  I know everyone in this body recognizes the difficult straits we are \nnavigating as a nation. Finding a consensus on how to address our \neconomic crisis is extremely difficult. There are some who believe no \naction is better than the action that has been proposed. I could not \ndisagree more. The future of our economy depends on immediate action \nthat is targeted and effective and the American people rightly expect \nthat this action will be bipartisan; that we will come together to \naddress the most serious economic crisis in generations. That is why I \njoined with my good friend, Senator Ben Nelson, and a group of Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle, including the Presiding Officer, to help \ncraft a bipartisan compromise to achieve these critical goals.\n  I want to recognize that, regardless of how many Republicans vote for \nthis package today, several were involved in the deliberations in which \nwe participated. Their insights and input were invaluable in crafting \nthe compromise package we are offering tonight. Our efforts to reach a \ncompromise would not have been possible without this hard work, this \ndedication, this commitment by our colleagues on both sides of the \naisle.\n  Here is what our amendment would do. First, we will provide more than \n$200 billion in aid to the States. I stress that because I have heard \nsome commentators say there is no money in here, that it has been \nslashed, that it has been cut, that there is nothing left for the \nStates. Madam President, $200 billion is included in this compromise. \nApproximately $87 billion of this amount will flow through a temporary \nincrease in the Federal share of the Medicaid Program. I know that as a \nformer Governor, the Presiding Officer is well aware that for most \nStates health care costs are the No. 1 item in their budget. If it is \nnot health care, it is education.\n  The loss of jobs often means the loss of health insurance and it is \nwell established that the number of persons relying on Medicaid \nincreases in a poor economy. Moreover, this increased demand for \nservices occurs at precisely the time that State budgets are under the \nmost pressure. Our proposal, therefore, includes $87 billion in \nassistance to States through a targeted, temporary increase in the \nFederal Medicaid matching rate. Maine will receive an additional $490 \nmillion in Federal Medicaid funds through this provision alone.\n  I want to recognize and salute the work of my colleague from Maine, \nSenator Snowe, who worked very hard in the Finance Committee with her \ncolleagues to shape this portion of the aid. And I also want to note \nthe hard work of my good friend Arlen Specter, whose efforts were so \nessential to the construction of this compromise.\n  Putting money in the hands of States is a commonsense way to \nstimulate economic growth. Leading economists have found that targeted \naid to States will generate increased economic activity of $1.36 for \nevery $1 spent. Moreover, this temporary increase will help States \navoid cutting back on health care coverage and services at the very \ntime that the number of families needing help is increasing.\n  Some of my colleagues are opposed to this provision because they say \nit will never be temporary, that once we increase the Federal matching \nrate it will become a permanent entitlement. We have only to look at \nhistory to know that is not true. In 2003, Senators Nelson, \nRockefeller, and I negotiated a similar temporary increase that proved \neffective in staving off drastic cuts in Medicaid and we need to \nprovide similar assistance again. I would note it was 18 months that we \ndid that for, so I believe we can do this in a temporary, targeted way.\n  Next, our amendment provides $41.6 billion for education programs. \nThat is right, more than $41 billion in new funding for education \nprograms. It includes $13.5 billion in funding through the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act, IDEA, what is known to most of us as \nspecial education, education for children with special needs. This new \nfunding will help fulfill a promise that the Federal Government made \nback in the 1970s, when it first passed IDEA. At that time, the Federal \nGovernment promised to pay 40 percent of the national average per-pupil \nexpenditure for every child in special education and we have never come \nclose. This is the granddaddy of unfunded Federal mandates. This money \nwill help relieve the burden on school districts. Every school district \nthroughout the United States will benefit from this increase in special \neducation funding. That, in turn, will help communities retain support \nstaff and teachers in the classroom because, after all, they cannot cut \nback on funding for special education because that is a Federal \nmandate. What happens is they are forced to cut back elsewhere. This \nwill help a great deal with teacher and support staff retention and it \nhelps relieve the pressure of this unfunded mandate.\n  Other education funding includes $10.4 billion in title I funding. \nThis is funding that goes to school districts with high percentages of \neconomically disadvantaged students.\n  Another education portion of this bill provides $13.9 billion for \nPell grants so that the maximum Pell grant will increase by $281 for \nthe 2009 school year, and by $400 for the 2010 school year. I worked at \na college prior to my election to the Senate and I know how critical \nPell grants are for our low-income families.\n  That is not all. The $200 billion in aid to States also includes $39 \nbillion for a new State stabilization fund, to help States and local \ngovernments with other key priorities.\n  Let me now talk about another part of this bill that I think is \nabsolutely critical and which fortunately enjoys widespread support. \nEvery State in the Nation has a backlog of needed infrastructure \nprojects that are ready to go--the engineering is done, the design is \ncompleted, they are truly shovel ready. We are providing nearly $52 \nbillion in funding to restore our Nation's crumbling infrastructure. Of \nthat amount, $45.5 billion is directed to a wide variety of \ntransportation projects and that is expected to produce $5.70 of \neconomic benefits for every $1 spent--a tremendous rate of return. For \nevery $1 billion invested in transportation infrastructure, up to \n35,000 jobs can be created, so this is a real job generator. Under our \namendment, the State of Maine could receive more than $170 million in \ntransportation infrastructure funding, and that will result in nearly \n6,000 jobs for Mainers.\n  This part of our amendment also provides $6.4 billion for the Clean \nWater State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund. \nAgain, these are more examples of unfunded Federal mandates where we \ncan help relieve pressure on States and communities while creating good \njobs.\n  There have been many discussions about what should not be included in \nthis bill. There are a number of worthwhile projects and programs that \nwere funded by the House bill and by the bills as reported by the \nSenate committees--programs I have always supported that are near and \ndear to my\n\n[[Page S2023]]\n\nheart. But the fundamental, critical goal of this bill is to provide a \njolt to our economy to get it back on track.\n  So some of these programs, while they are worthy of an increase in \nfunding, simply do not belong in an economic stimulus bill. This is the \ntest we applied: Will it help get our economy on track? Will it create \njobs? Will it save jobs? Will it put tax relief in the pockets of \nconsumers? These are the proper criteria.\n  It is the regular appropriations process that is the appropriate \nvehicle for considering funding for many of these programs that, while \nworthwhile, do not boost our economy. So our amendment eliminates $5.8 \nbillion for health prevention and wellness programs. I support these \nprograms. I am a strong supporter of them. But it simply does not make \nsense to fund smoking cessation programs as part of an economic \nstimulus package. It does not make sense to include $870 million for \npandemic flu preparedness, again an issue that I care deeply about \nbecause of my role on the Homeland Security Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to proceed for 2 additional minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 2 minutes to the Senator from Maine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank the chairman.\n  Madam President, we also struck--I am chagrined to say to the senior \nSenator from New Hampshire--$34 million to renovate the Department of \nCommerce building.\n  Now, again, undoubtedly there needs to be renovations, but that \nsimply does not meet the threshold for inclusion in this bill. I \nsupport many of these projects, but the stimulus bill should not be a \nvehicle for either my pet projects or anyone else's.\n  In closing my remarks, I want to emphasize that a substantial amount \nof the funding in our amendment, more than $365 billion, will be used \nto reduce the tax burden on Americans at a time when this relief is so \ncritical. We provide also important assistance for those who are \nstruggling the most, for those who need an extension of unemployment \ncompensation and an increase in the refundable child tax credit and an \nincrease in the earned-income tax credit.\n  We provide direct assistance to seniors, disabled veterans, and SSI \nrecipients. And very importantly, the amendment contains three \nprovisions that are especially critical to small business--the job \ngenerators of our economy.\n  These include an extension of the bonus depreciation and small \nbusiness expensing provisions we passed last year, plus a provision \nallowing businesses to carryback net operating losses for five years, \ninstead of the current two years. Taken together, these provisions will \ngive the American business community nearly $23 billion in much needed \ntax relief. I commend the Finance Committee for its leadership in \ncrafting these provisions.\n  All in all, I am proud of the bipartisan work we have done during the \nlast 10 days. As with any major legislation, this bill is not perfect. \nBut it can go a long way toward creating jobs and addressing the dire \neconomic crisis facing our Nation.\n  Our amendment is bipartisan, targeted, and effective. I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I commend the Senator from Maine, Ms. \nCollins, who has done a terrific job in helping us reach this point. \nShe has done great work. I commend both Senators from Maine. The \nSenators from Maine are the key to a solution because they are the ones \nwho created the impetus to get us where we are.\n  Because of their efforts, I might say, the Senate is within \nmeasurable distance of being able to respond to an economic crisis that \nconfronts the Nation. It is the efforts of the Senator from Nebraska, \nof course, and also Senator Specter, but the Senators from Maine are \nreally the ones who deserve the lion's share of the credit. Because of \ntheir work, millions of Americans will keep their jobs or get new jobs.\n  Again, I thank the Senators from Maine for what they are doing for \nour country.\n  The amendment before us is about creating jobs. The Office of \nManagement and Budget has estimated that this bill could create or save \n3 to 4 million jobs. The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that \nthis bill would create or save between 1.3 and 3.9 million jobs. This \namendment will help us to pass this bill. Literally millions of jobs \ndepend on the adoption of the amendment. Let me restate that. Literally \nmillions of jobs depend on the adoption of this amendment.\n  We face the worst economic disaster in the lifetimes of most \nAmericans alive today. History will judge how we respond. Let's not let \nthis Nation down. We do not have much time to waste. We must act \nquickly to pass the Collins-Nelson substitute in conference to reach a \nconsensus and put this bill on the President's desk without delay.\n  Let's not repeat the mistakes of the late 1920s and 1930s. Let's \nconfront the economic challenge of our times. When the roll is called \nminutes from now, let's invoke cloture on the Collins-Nelson \nsubstitute.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I want to point out to my colleagues, \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce has issued a letter strongly urging a \n``yes'' vote on cloture on the Nelson-Collins amendment.\n  I am going to put a copy of that letter on my colleagues' desk. But I \ndo ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 9, 2009.\n     To the Members of the United States Senate:\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urges you to support cloture \n     on the Collins-Nelson amendment to H.R. 1, the ``American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.'' The Chamber also \n     renews its call that the Senate approve H.R. 1 without delay \n     so that the House and Senate can expeditiously complete work \n     on a conference report that provides timely, targeted, and \n     temporary economic stimulus.\n       The Chamber recognizes that the evolving legislation is not \n     perfect, but believes that it is vital that Congress quickly \n     approve legislation to assist the crumbling U.S. economy. The \n     Chamber strongly supports cloture on the Collins-Nelson \n     amendment, which will refine H.R. 1 and, most importantly, \n     allow the legislative process to proceed. Overall, the \n     Chamber supports many of the pro-growth tax initiatives in \n     the bill, as well as spending-side provisions to provide \n     stimulus, create jobs and to get Americans back to work.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing more than three million businesses \n     and organizations of every size, sector, and region, looks \n     forward to working with the Senate, House and the \n     Administration to accomplish meaningful economic stimulus \n     legislation that can be signed into law in the coming days.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the millions of Americans who are out of \nwork, struggling to keep their homes and make one paycheck last until \nthe next one comes, deserve to hear five words from Congress: Help is \non the way.\n  Moments from now, we will have the opportunity to vote to move \nforward on President Obama's economic recovery plan and put an end to \nthe filibuster now stopping this legislation from helping the American \npeople. This legislation is not a silver bullet. The economic anguish \nthat President Obama inherited from the previous administration is far \ntoo severe to be solved in 1 day or 1 week or by one piece of \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S2024]]\n\n  Recovery will take time. The American people understand that. They \nhave patience for the long road that lies ahead, but they do not have \npatience for Congress to point fingers, drag its feet, or fail to act.\n  We have already shown the American people we can act on a bipartisan \nbasis, and we have done it this Congress. We worked in a bipartisan \nbasis to pass the Lilly Ledbetter legislation, bipartisan legislation \nthat makes the working place a place where women are treated more \nfairly.\n  We worked on a bipartisan basis to pass the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, legislation that, in Nevada, will give insurance to \n120,000 children who previously had no health insurance. These pieces \nof legislation are already law. They have been signed by President \nObama and are now the law of this country because we worked together to \nget it done.\n  This week Senators from both parties met the seriousness of the \neconomic crisis with an earnest approach to solving this emergency. \nWith the help of the dedicated work of Senators Ben Nelson, Joe \nLieberman, Susan Collins, Olympia Snowe, and Arlen Specter, we now have \nthe opportunity to support legislation that will put America back to \nwork.\n  I appreciate my friend from Maine mentioning the letter from the \nChamber of Commerce. This is a strong letter. You cannot find a company \nanyplace in America that does not support this legislation because they \nknow it is going to create jobs.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers supports this legislation. \nBig business, small business supports this legislation because they \nbelieve help is on the way. At a time of escalating job loss, it will \nsave or create as many as 4 million new American jobs. At a time when \nmiddle-class families are finding it harder to make ends meet, it \nprovides desperately needed tax relief. At a time of crumbling roads \nand ever greater reliance on foreign oil, it invests in infrastructure \nand renewable energy. At a time of deepening complexities in the global \nmarketplace, it better equips our schools to prepare American students \nfor success.\n  But our job does not end here, it begins. In the coming weeks and \nmonths, we will turn to legislation offered by the Obama administration \nto fix our badly broken financial sector and to stabilize the housing \nmarket. As we have with Ledbetter--I talked about that important \nlegislation--Children's Health Insurance Program, and this economic \nrecovery plan, we need to continue to work together to solve the \nproblems our great Nation faces. Nevada and all of America deserves \nnothing less. The time to act is now. Because the American people \nbelieve help is on the way, we must prove it to them.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the vote start now.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am not going to bother with ``how'' we are affected by \n     high energy prices. Just about everyone buys fuel. Just about \n     everyone buys food, and uses electricity or natural gas to \n     heat and cool their homes. It is a given that everyone is \n     affected. It is not the\n\n[[Page S2025]]\n\n     ``how'' that is important; it is the ``why''. I have a firm \n     belief that the crisis is not in energy; it is in government, \n     and monetary policy. The price of fuel and other forms of \n     energy are increasing due to a combination of several things: \n     1) Lack of a truly free market, 2) An excess of government \n     involvement, 3) Greed and a desire for control, and 4) \n     Inflation directly caused by the Federal Reserve. The latter \n     is the most probable cause of the increase. I do not believe \n     for a second that prices have anything to do with supply. I \n     believe we have enough oil within our own borders to easily \n     become energy independent, if only it was allowed (by \n     government) to be tapped. I believe the Federal Reserve (a \n     private entity masquerading as a government entity, \n     completely controlled by private bankers) is one of the main \n     (if not the main) evils in our time. The Federal Reserve \n     should be abolished, and sound money, backed by gold and \n     silver, should be restored. All economies that have ever been \n     based on a flat currency fail, and ours will as well (mark my \n     words, and the words of the Founding Fathers). The Fed has \n     done absolutely nothing to secure the value of the dollar, \n     but instead has done everything possible to erode it. Soon \n     the paper and ink that is used will be worth more than the \n     currency itself, as it is backed only by the people's trust \n     in their government; something that is quickly declining.\n       I do not want the Congress involved in this issue. It is \n     not government's responsibility to be involved, or to ``fix'' \n     anything; it is rather their responsibility to not be \n     involved. Let the free market work. If it was not for the \n     presence of corporatism, several alternative energy sources \n     (such as domestic oil, electric cars, solar power, etc) would \n     have already been developed and be mainstream choices.\n       I would encourage you to read (or listen to) The Proper \n     Role of Government, given by Former Secretary of Agriculture \n     Ezra Taft Benson.

I used to laugh at my mother-in-law when she \n     complained about $1.80 a gallon gas. Dave and I have always \n     tried to plan our trips and walk whenever possible to \n     conserve gas, especially since the ``crisis'' of the 70s, so \n     gas was just a necessity and there was no sense driving all \n     over town looking for the cheapest station. It is really too \n     bad that something was not done then to use our own energy \n     resources, but the environmentalists took over and \n     successfully squelched any progress. Now we are dependent on \n     foreign oil and it will take several years to get our own \n     resources up and running. If our plan was to drain all of the \n     oil out of the Middle East before using our own, it really \n     backfired. I would like a bumper sticker proclaiming, ``Do \n     not like the price of gas? Blame an environmentalist.''\n       That being said, we had better get busy and start drilling \n     in anywhere we can, building refineries where we can (what \n     about President Bush's idea of converting unused military \n     bases?), and developing nuclear power. When the price of gas \n     goes back down, it will all be forgotten if we do not use \n     this crisis to get started!\n     Jacqui, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have read with great interest your articles on the high \n     fuel prices. Sorry, but I believe it is all a load of bull \n     and brain washing!! Listen carefully--The problem is the \n     greed of the oil companies! Pure and simple. There is no \n     reason on earth why they should make billions of dollars per \n     month in profits, by screwing the American people! The cost \n     of a barrel of oil does not equate to the price of the fuel! \n     They have put our entire country into a tail spin! What they \n     are doing is nothing short of criminal. My wife and I are on \n     a fixed income, retired and unable to enjoy any travel! We \n     are only able to see our grandkids once a year from Kuna to \n     Spokane, due to the price of fuel! The electrical has just \n     taken a big jump as well. The government needs to step in and \n     stop these thieves from bilking the American people. Just \n     because they have a product that is required by all, they \n     take advantage of it and are robbing the nation! Drilling for \n     oil is not the problem. We have already proven with ethanol \n     that the price of American produced fuel is even higher! The \n     CEO of Shell Oil on ``The Today Show,'' said we have enough \n     oil for 300 years. Supply is not the problem. Greed of the \n     oil companies is the only problem! Please save our country by \n     forcing them to lower the price!\n     Carl, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am retired from Idaho State Police. I served 18 years. I \n     have lived in Idaho since 1967. Thank you for trying to save \n     our country. As a recently retired public employee, I had \n     dreams of fishing and/or golfing a couple of times a week. \n     Those simple pleasures used to be limited to available time, \n     and not by how much it cost to get there. Now that I have the \n     time to do those things, I have to consider the additional \n     costs fuel has made in getting to those destinations and \n     limit myself to once a week or a couple times a month. This \n     not only dampens the hopes I had for my retirement years, but \n     affects those that would have provided other services to me \n     along the way. Those people that would have sold me ice, \n     lunch, beverages, clothing, equipment, etc. are all losing \n     out on my ability to travel.\n       We live 30 miles from the nearest `large' retail area and \n     have begun to delay trips to the city; combining our shopping \n     needs into one visit rather than three. And, as would be \n     expected, we find all of our required purchases have \n     increased in cost because high fuel prices caused increased \n     shipping expense for the retailer. The presumption that the \n     average person sees $50 more a month increase on fuel is only \n     a drop in the bucket to the true impact to ones' retirement \n     budget. So we tend to stay home, contemplating going back to \n     work. On the positive side, my yard sure looks great because \n     I have so much time to dedicate to it!\n     David, Kendrick.\n                                  ____\n\n       Gas prices are affecting us at home our level pay electric \n     went from $62/month to $87/month and no increase in electric \n     use. We have to drive to Boise from New Plymouth once a month \n     because my husband has Traumatic Brain Injury and requires \n     once a week therapy. The 100% disable pay from the VA that my \n     husband is on is a fixed income; the travel money is not \n     enough to pay for the round trip to Boise along with he does \n     not get the full amount of travel pay for the 3 or 4 visits.\n       He cannot drive himself so I take a half-day to full day \n     off work to drive him and to be a part of his appointments \n     because he is not able to remember what was said by the \n     therapist or the doctors. So our income is hurt with me \n     missing work.\n       Our food budgets support one child full time, another child \n     half the time along with their friends (it is better to open \n     our home to friends to know what they are doing and support \n     them). Not that we have a lot of children coming and going.\n       Luckily my job is here in town, Internet Truckstop, so I \n     can walk most days to work, which I have been doing for many \n     years.\n       I can only imagine what people are going through with \n     smaller incomes. The food prices here in town are \n     considerably higher compared to driving to Ontario, Oregon, \n     or Payette, Idaho. It is still worth grocery shopping across \n     the river if you are already going to be there. Payette \n     County does not have a lot of service-related businesses so \n     there are many times we have to go into Ontario to meet our \n     needs as county residents.\n     Jeannette.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for the opportunity. We own a small residential \n     building company in Boise with a small fleet of pickups. As \n     you know the home market is weak at best and this one more \n     item, higher gas prices, does not help. But in the end, it is \n     the consumer that will pay for my increased cost just as I \n     will pay the increase when any corporation or other entity \n     above me gets a tax increase. We need to drill now, anywhere \n     and everywhere we can and rely on our own resources.\n     Steven.\n                                  ____\n\n       I fully agree with this excerpt from your email letter:\n       ``Congress should not be sitting on the sidelines while \n     Idahoans are paying the price at the pump, and I hope \n     together we can spur some real action on this issue.''\n       Unfortunately, this is exactly what it seems that Congress \n     is doing. As long as the United States' economy is petroleum-\n     based, we will experience increasingly higher fuel costs. \n     Regardless of how many barrels of oil are pumped globally, \n     the refining capacity of this country is at max capacity, or \n     so we are led to believe, therefore gas and diesel prices \n     will continue to remain high. This reality will not change \n     regardless of coastal or Alaskan exploration. The only \n     solution to our situation would seem to be increasing our \n     ability to run our economy on alternative fuels i.e. nuclear, \n     hydro, solar etc. To that end, it would seem that the nation \n     which set a bipartisan goal of putting a man on the moon \n     within a decade--and succeeded, would be able to set a goal \n     of weaning our nation's economy from petroleum within a \n     reasonable period of time. However, given the extreme \n     bipartisanship nature of our Congress and the influence of \n     legacy lobbyists on legislation, I do not see that happening.\n     Fred, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for providing this forum to learn and receive \n     feedback as to how the outrageous fuel price increases are \n     adversely affecting us personally. Sadly, with all of the \n     feedback that you have received, there is no ``quick fix'' or \n     immediate resolution to this issue, unless of course, the \n     major oil producers and suppliers wish to ``pay it forward'' \n     by reducing the price of unleaded regular and diesel by 50%.\n       My fuel costs, like everyone else's, have doubled since \n     2005. We are making every effort to reduce our costs by \n     driving less, even with two diesel powered vehicles. Boise \n     lacks viable and practical public transportation that would \n     further help reduce everyone's costs, so we all continue to \n     struggle with these outrageous price increases.\n       Here are some facts for you, to illustrate these price \n     increases:\n       On July 4, 2005, the price of diesel was $2.43 per gallon. \n     Today, the price is $4.75 per gallon, nearly double in three \n     years!\n\n[[Page S2026]]\n\n       On January 31, 2008, the diesel price hit $3.24 per gallon, \n     and on May 23, 2008, the diesel price hit $4.55 per gallon. \n     Major oil company stations are now selling diesel in excess \n     of $4.89 per gallon, over 200% increase in three years.\n       Since January 31, 2008, diesel prices have increased 67%.\n       In the meantime, as a new and recent retiree now living on \n     Social Security, my benefits increased $50 per month from \n     2007 to 2008, hardly enough to offset these constant rising \n     prices. Tack on the recent increases for Idaho Power (25%), \n     Intermountain Gas (10%), and food costs, senior citizens on \n     fixed incomes are juggling to keep pace, and still pay for \n     their necessary medicines.\n       The major oil companies have all boasted significant \n     profits ranging from $5 billion to $10 billion per fiscal \n     quarter, and some executives have testified that they are \n     paid in excess of $10 million annually. The oil companies \n     have also indicated that profits to shareholders have jumped \n     a whopping 40 cents per share. It is very easy to see that \n     the oil companies, their executives, and the shareholders are \n     becoming very wealthy at the expense of the American \n     consumer. That is simply not right, nor is it fair!! The \n     major oil companies are also exporting large quantities of \n     diesel fuel to European and Asian markets, which have much \n     larger price increases driving their markets.\n       The oil companies, like any other business, needs to focus \n     on providing a quality product, at a fair and reasonable \n     price, to all consumers. Rather, the oil companies are \n     rapidly increasing their profits, holding back on product \n     delivery, speculating on oil futures to further drive up \n     prices, and the American consumer is getting victimized daily \n     by the oil companies actions.\n       Sadly, there is no immediate fix for this problem! Any new \n     drilling will fail to drive down prices for at least five \n     years. New and more efficient vehicles will be expensive such \n     that many Americans will be unable to afford them. (A $45,000 \n     hybrid vehicle would cost consumers over $600 per month in \n     payments and interest.) Production of biodiesel and ethanol \n     is counterproductive if the cost per gallon of these products \n     exceeds the current gas and diesel prices. Consumers clearly \n     need gas and diesel costs lowered.\n       Yet we (America) are spending $150 billion a year on a war \n     in Iraq that has no perceived outcome and that has not \n     positively influenced oil price reductions! NASA is sending a \n     space craft to Mars to investigate planets on which we could \n     never reside or survive! In the last five years, NASA space \n     craft failures have cost American consumers at least $165 \n     million per failure. We simply do not have that luxury to \n     waste money! Cut NASA's budget in half and give that money \n     back to consumers! Stop the war and bring our troops home \n     safely, and give that money back to American consumers! Stop \n     pork barrel spending and give that money back to consumers! \n     We in Idaho do not need to help finance projects in other \n     state's Congressional districts where we fail to realize any \n     benefit, except for loss of revenue.\n       Congress's job is to provide for the American people, not \n     special interests, and operate the government's business \n     successfully, providing any profits to the American consumer. \n     That is not happening.\n       The business of running the federal government is a \n     business, and Congress and the President has failed miserably \n     to provide for the American consumer. With the trillions of \n     dollars racked up in Congressional debt, America could soon \n     be bankrupt. That would be a hard lesson in reality. The gas \n     and diesel fuel crisis is a significant indicator of a \n     failing economy. I will be watching to see what Congress can \n     do. Thanks again for allowing this forum.\n     Jack, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       We should start drilling in ANWR and off our coasts.

Another son \n     drives a Subaru and he is paying $150 a month for gas, just \n     getting to work. Another son drives a semi-truck and cannot \n     take care of his family of eleven, with the cost of fuel \n     being so high. All of these sons are not in high paying jobs, \n     so it is affecting what they can pay for housing, food and \n     other costs. They are all hard-working and do not accept \n     government assistance; they want to stay free of government \n     help.\n       Please consider drilling, we have oil here, why cannot we \n     use it? We feel that as soon as we start drilling the price \n     of oil will go down because of the threat of competition. \n     Thank you for asking for our input; we have sent your message \n     to other people also.\n     Frank and Jo Etta.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would love to share with you the impact that higher gas \n     prices has had on our family. In the past two years, I have \n     suffered horribly with a condition called psoriatic \n     arthritis. It has had some very disabling qualities about it. \n     We have always been a very close family and have followed our \n     children literally around the country with their athletics. \n     My husband and I live in a small rural area of SE Idaho, and \n     our children and grandchildren love to come and visit. With \n     my health problems in the past several years, I am not able \n     to travel and get around like I once did, so our children \n     have been the ones to load up the grandkids and come to \n     Grandma and Grandpa's house. With the rising gas prices, my \n     children are now unable to come up as often, which is tearing \n     me to pieces. I have even offered to help pay for their gas, \n     but with our limited income, and their wonderful sense of \n     pride, they do not want to accept it. There are very few \n     areas they have to cut back from, while trying to raise young \n     families, in order to come up with the extra money to get \n     here on a regular basis. To us, there is nothing more \n     important than family, and our family has been greatly \n     affected by the high costs of gas/fuel.\n       I would love to see us move forward and stop having to rely \n     on other countries (and playing games with the devil to do \n     it) and start utilizing our own resources. That has always \n     been one of the greatest things about our country is our \n     self-reliance and willingness to help others. In order to \n     help others, we must be able to help ourselves and put \n     ourselves in a position to where we do not have to beg, \n     borrow, or steal from other countries when we have the \n     resources here to take care of our needs. I would urge \n     Congress to get on board and start utilizing our resources to \n     save our country. It is only a matter of time before we start \n     having major trucking strikes--can you imagine where we will \n     be if this takes place?\n       Then we do not have to just worry about where we are going \n     to get the money for fuel, but how we are going to eat and \n     survive. Businesses will soon start folding under the extra \n     heavy burden for fuel and gas prices. It really paints an \n     ugly picture of where we might be a year from now.\n       We will be watching this issue very closely and the \n     candidates we select had better have this vision in mind if \n     you are going to earn our vote.\n     Patti, Montpelier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2026-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2026]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING DON ALEXANDER\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, it was with sadness that I \nlearned of the death of Don Alexander. I was honored and fortunate to \nget to know him in the later stages of his distinguished career when I \njoined the Finance Committee. His advice and guidance on a variety of \nmatters, but particularly on issues involving the Internal Revenue \nService, were invaluable to my staff and me. With Don, you knew he was \nalways going to bring to bear the wisdom acquired over years of service \nto his country, and the taxpayers, and do so with the enthusiasm and \nenergy of a person half his age.\n  Throughout his career, Don always stepped forward to answer his \ncountry's call to duty. He took his integrity, thoughtfulness, and \ndecency to the battlefields in World War II, and to the Internal \nRevenue Service where he was Commissioner during some of its most \ntroubling times. Don confronted all challenges with confidence and \ndetermination, never wavering from his principals or strong sense of \nfairness.\n  At a time when our President is calling for all Americans to consider \nthe importance and the need for government service, we need look no \nfarther for a role model than former Commissioner Alexander. I honor \nhim for his service to our country and all that he did to make us a \nstronger Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2026-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2026-S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO MARTHA BRYANT\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish to honor in the Record of \nthe Senate Martha Bryant, a true leader and an excellent businesswoman, \nfor her many years of service to her community.\n  Martha has a long history of service to the communities she has \ncalled home. Born in Waycross, GA, the daughter of Arloa Gerald Morgan \nWood and Joseph Cepheus Wood, she returned to her hometown after \ncollege to teach high school English for 3 years. Following that, she \nwas certified as a professional YMCA director and served as program \ndirector for the State YMCA of Georgia from 1959 through 1962.\n  The citizens of Rome, GA, were lucky that Martha came to their town \nto serve as the program director of the YMCA of Rome/Floyd County in \n1962. During her years in Rome, Martha served two terms on the board of \nthe United Way as well as numerous terms on the Administrative Board of \nFirst Methodist Church, including as chair for 2 years. She also taught \nthe Adult Sunday School class for 35 years, served 2 terms on the \nAlcohol Control Commission for the city of Rome, and was a part of the \norganizational committee that brought Georgia Highlands College to \nRome.\n  Despite her volunteer schedule, she also found time to begin a \nbrandnew business in 1972, Bryant and Garrett\n\n[[Page S2027]]\n\nTravel, which she nurtured to its current status as a thriving, \nrespected company. While she has just sold the business and retired \nfrom full-time service in 2009, I know Romans will still think of her \nfirst when they start to plan their family vacations.\n  Martha also is heavily involved with the Greater Rome Chamber of \nCommerce and has served in many leadership positions there over the \nyears, including the chair of the Small Business Action Council. She is \na graduate of Leadership Rome and became the first woman to serve as \nchair of the chamber in 1993. She continues to serve on the \nGovernmental Affairs Committee and organizes the chamber's official \nvisit to Washington, DC, each spring.\n  I hope Martha knows just what her leadership has meant to the many \norganizations she has touched and that she is able to enjoy a little \nmore time with her grandkids and her beloved dachshunds at \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2027-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MAJOR SHELIA FLOWERS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I wish today to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate MAJ Shelia Flowers of the U.S. Army Reserve on the \neve of her promotion to the rank of lieutenant colonel.\n  Although Major Flowers was born and raised in North Carolina, her \ndedication to her country has ultimately lead her to call the State of \nGeorgia her home as her parent command is the U.S. Army Reserve Command \nHeadquarters in Ft. McPherson, GA.\n  Major Flowers was mobilized in support of Operation Noble Eagle in \n2003 and has spent the last 6 years on Active Duty. In addition to her \nother tours, Major Flowers deployed in support of Operation Iraqi \nFreedom in 2006. Throughout her Active Duty period, she has served in \nthe G-1 Directorate in support of Operation Noble Eagle. Additionally, \nMajor Flowers was assigned to directly support Operation Enduring \nFreedom in November 2007.\n  In keeping with one of the tenets that sustains the Reserve \nComponent, Major Flowers is dedicated to improving her community and \nthe primary means through which she achieves this goal is by her \nmembership in the Alpha Kappa Alpha Sorority, an organization that \nrecently celebrated the 100th anniversary of its establishment.\n  In addition to her service to her country and community, Major \nFlowers is dedicated to her family. Her husband, LTC Eric Flowers, \nshares his wife's sense of duty and is currently deployed to the Horn \nof Africa. Their daughter, Cheyenne, currently resides in Atlanta.\n  I congratulate MAJ Shelia Flowers for her hard work and much-deserved \npromotion to lieutenant colonel, and I extend to her my sincere \ngratitude for her dedication to the defense of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2027-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2027-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting a \nwithdrawal and sundry nominations which were referred to the \nappropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2027-4", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2027]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 4:49 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 352.

INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Alexander, Mr. Bennett, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 395. A bill to direct the Librarian of Congress and the Secretary \nof the Smithsonian Institution to carry out a joint project at the \nLibrary of Congress and the National Museum of African American History \nand Culture to collect video and audio recording of personal histories \nand testimonials of individuals who participated in the Civil Rights \nmovement, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Civil Rights \nHistory Project Act of 2009.\n  This is a bill that is very important to me and to many other Members \nof Congress. It would authorize the Library of Congress and the \nSmithsonian to record and preserve an oral history of the Civil Rights \nMovement.\n  The bill is cosponsored by Senators Alexander, Bennett, Cochran, \nKennedy, and Schumer. In the 110th Congress, then-Senator Clinton \nintroduced it, and I want to thank Secretary Clinton very much for her \nwork on behalf of the bill.\n  Last month, the United States celebrated the inauguration of our \nfirst African-American President. It was a historic event, and it was \none more example that we, the American people, can live up to our \nhighest ideals and aspirations. Although there is much left to be done, \ncritical progress has been made.\n  As we reflect on this historical moment, it is important for us to \nremember that it did not happen all at once. As Senator Robert Kennedy \nonce said, ``It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief \nthat human history is shaped.''\n  Our society today would not be possible without the extraordinary \npeople who dedicated themselves to the Civil Rights Movement.\n  Whether on a bus in Montgomery, at a lunch counter in Greensboro, in \na high school in Little Rock, or on a bridge in Selma, these courageous \nindividuals risked their lives to bring real and necessary change to \nour country.\n  The bill I am introducing today would help to ensure that we never \nforget their stories.\n  The bill would direct the Library of Congress and the Smithsonian's \nNational Museum of African American History to record--in audio and \nvideo--firsthand stories from the Civil Rights Movement. Like the \nVeterans History Project started by the Library of Congress in 2000, \nthese recordings would document the memories of Civil Rights pioneers \nfor generations to come. Students would be able to hear the stories in \ntheir own voices, and historians would have primary sources on which to \ndraw for research.\n  We need to start recording this history as soon as possible. In the \nlast three years alone, we have lost Civil Rights leaders like Rosa \nParks and Coretta Scott King--whose contributions would have been \ninvaluable.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the cost of the \nproject be a maximum of approximately $4 million over 5 years, and that \nmuch of this cost will be offset by private donations. Even at its \nmaximum cost, the project will be well worth it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There beinig no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 395\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Civil Rights History Project \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) A fundamental principle of American democracy is that \n     individuals should stand up for their rights and beliefs and \n     fight for justice.\n       (2) The actions of those who participated in the Civil \n     Rights movement from the 1950s through the 1960s are a \n     shining example of this principle in action, demonstrated in \n     events as varied as the Montgomery Bus Boycott, the sit-ins, \n     the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the drive for \n     voting rights in Mississippi, and the March to Selma.\n       (3) While the Civil Rights movement had many visible \n     leaders, including Thurgood Marshall, Dr. Martin Luther King, \n     Jr., and Rosa Parks, there were many others whose impact and \n     experience were just as important to the cause but who are \n     not as well known.\n       (4) The participants in the Civil Rights movement possess \n     an invaluable resource in their first-hand memories of the \n     movement, and the recording of the retelling of their stories \n     and memories will provide a rich, detailed history of our \n     Nation during an important and tumultuous period.\n       (5) It is in the Nation's interest to undertake a project \n     to collect oral histories of individuals from the Civil \n     Rights movement so future generations will be able to learn \n     of their struggle and sacrifice through primary-source, \n     eyewitness material. A coordinated Federal project would also \n     focus attention on the efforts undertaken by various public \n     and private entities to collect and interpret articles in all \n     formats relating to the Civil Rights movement, and serve as a \n     model for future projects undertaken in museums, libraries, \n     and universities throughout the Nation.\n       (6) The Library of Congress and the Smithsonian Institution \n     are appropriate repositories to collect, preserve, and make \n     available to the public a collection of these oral histories. \n     The Library and Smithsonian have expertise in the management \n     of documentation projects, and experience in the development \n     of cultural and educational programs for the public.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to create a new \n     federally sponsored, authorized, and funded project that will \n     coordinate at a national level the collection of video and \n     audio recordings of personal histories and testimonials of \n     individuals who participated in the American Civil Rights \n     movement that will build upon and complement previous and \n     ongoing documentary work on this subject, and to assist and \n     encourage local efforts to preserve the memories of such \n     individuals so that Americans of all current and future \n     generations may hear from them directly and better appreciate \n     the sacrifices they made.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Madam President, one of the arguments we have heard in \nsupport of the proposed $1 trillion stimulus bill is that our economy \nis performing below its potential. It is argued we have a gap between \nwhat we could produce and what we are producing.\n  There is no question our economy is producing less than it could. It \nis quite obvious we are in a recession. But that does not mean a \nmassive, temporary increase in Government spending can fill the gap and \nthus restore our economy to its full potential. In fact, the opposite \nis true.\n  The proposed $1 trillion increase in Government spending will impede \nrecovery and reduce future growth. The\n\n[[Page S2031]]\n\nCongressional Budget Office--which I want to remind people listening, \nas well as my colleagues who tend to forget it--is a nonpartisan group \nof people who are professionals in making judgments about Government \nprograms and what they cost. The Congressional Budget Office reported \nlast week that the stimulus bill will create temporary jobs that cost \nas much as $300,000 apiece, and then it will reduce jobs permanently \ncompared to no stimulus bill at all.\n  Economists often talk about the economy in terms of a circular flow. \nThe circle assumes a continuous flow between production and \nconsumption. Businesses hire workers who produce goods and earn a \nsalary in order to buy the goods they produce. According to this world \nview, whenever production declines, the solution is to increase demand \nand thereby boost production.\n  In reality, the economy is not a circle. Production involves a series \nof steps in which raw materials are transformed into intermediate goods \nwhich are transformed into finished products. This process takes time \nas value is added at every step. That is what production is all about: \nadding steps to the process until you get to a finished product.\n  For example, to make bread, we need to grow wheat. To grow wheat, we \nneed to work the land. To work the land, we need tractors. To build \ntractors, we need plastic, steel, rubber--and you know all the other \ncomponents. Nearly every step of this process relies on trained \nindividuals with unique skills and unique knowledge, people who utilize \ntools and material designed to meet their very specialized needs.\n  Given the complex structure of production, an increase in the demand \nfor bread cannot instantaneously bring about an increase in the supply \nof all the things needed to produce more bread. Likewise, a reduction \nin the demand for bread cannot instantaneously convert all of the \npeople's places and things previously used to produce bread into some \nother productive alternative.\n  At a given point in time, our economy is comprised of a specific set \nof goods and services, each with its unique factors of supply and \ndemand. When market conditions change--either because of fickle \nconsumers or maybe foreign competition or maybe rising oil prices or \nmaybe a stock market bubble or a housing bubble, which we all know \nabout now--some of the goods and services that existed before the \nchange are no longer suitable to meet the market conditions that exist \nafter that change. Those are some conditions we are in right now.\n  The unemployed workers and idle resources that exist today are \nlargely the result of the decline in home prices and the associated \nturmoil in the financial markets. Most everyone in this body knows \nthat. I think most people at the grassroots know there were problems \nwith housing that brought about our credit crunch and the unemployment \nand recession we have now because our housing market was overleveraged, \noverpriced, and unsustainable, bringing about a great deal of \nunemployment caused by changes in the economy and adjustments to that \neconomy going on and not going on in a very likeable way.\n\n  The bursting of the housing bubble has not only affected \nhomebuilders, realtors, and mortgage brokers, it has also spilled over \ninto other areas of our economy. For example, falling housing prices \nhave reduced the ability of many homeowners to finance nonhousing-\nrelated spending through the use of home equity loans.\n  As workers become unemployed and resources idle, it is said that our \neconomy has fallen below its potential, and we all know that. However, \nthat does not mean a massive temporary increase in Government spending \ncan fill that gap that we all realize exists and, hence, cannot \nnecessarily restore our economy to its full potential because massive \ntemporary increases in Government spending does not have that effect. \nSpending for the sake of spending, then, is not a solution.\n  Every dollar the Government spends does, in fact, have a cost, \nregardless of whether the dollar comes from taxes, from borrowing or \nthrough the printing press. When the Government spends money, what does \nit do? It diverts workers and resources from alternative uses. We may \nnot think about that, but that is the impact of the Government on the \nfree market economy we have. During a recession, when workers are \nunemployed and resources are idle, it is argued that this diversion is \na good thing. However, the stimulus bill is not restricted just to \nunemployed workers and just to idle resources. Moreover, the stimulus \nbill is supposedly temporary.\n  Consider the implications of unrestricted, temporary Government \nspending. I wish to have my colleagues consider those. In one case, \nunemployed workers obtained temporary make-work jobs and, therefore, \ndelay their search for meaningful, long-term employment. In the other \ncase, employed workers are diverted from their current employment into \ntemporary make-work jobs and thereby reduce the output of other goods \nand services. Thus, if you think about temporary make-work jobs, they \nadd little or no value to the economy, while diverting employment from \nother jobs, probably other jobs that are very long term and productive. \nAs a result, the money paid to these workers increases the demand for \ngoods and services while reducing the supply. We know what results \nthen: more inflation and less growth.\n  The only way the Government can increase economic growth is by \nspending other people's money more efficiently than those individuals \nwould. But instead of arguing the Government can spend money better \nthan everyone else, the supporters of the stimulus bill are relying on \nthe argument that Government can spend money faster than everyone else \ncan. As President Obama said last week in Williamsburg, VA:\n\n       So then you get the argument, ``Well, this is not a \n     stimulus bill, this is a spending bill.'' What do you think \n     stimulus is? That is the whole point.\n\n  However, that is not the whole point. What matters is whether we are \nproducing goods and services that people want to buy or whether the \nGovernment is paying people to engage in activities that have less \nvalue than the private sector alternatives.\n  Let me be clear. Not all Government spending is wasteful and \nunnecessary. Government spending designed to meet a critical need can \nbe beneficial, and we can list a lot of things the Government does that \nare beneficial but not necessarily the things that are in this stimulus \nbill or at least not all of them. We could go to building the \ninterstate highway system, for example. It increased our ability to \ntravel and transport goods across the Nation. However, the economic \nbenefit is derived from the transportation services that result from \nthe interstate highway system and not from the jobs that created the \ninterstate highway system.\n  If the goal of infrastructure spending is jobs, then why not give \neveryone a shovel or a spoon or even build roads by our hands. We could \ncreate millions of jobs. Now, no one has proposed that--at least not \nyet--but the point ought to be very clear. When Government spends money \nin order to create as many jobs as possible, as fast as possible, we \nend up with Government boondoggles instead of sound economic policy.\n  As an aside, I would point out that repairing our existing \ninfrastructure is a necessary expense; however, such activity causes \nincreased traffic congestion and delays. The loss in productivity and \noutput due to increased travel time and fuel consumption is an \nunavoidable cost of maintaining an existing benefit, which the \ninterstate highway is or which all our highways and streets and roads \nare. There may be a cost-benefit analysis that shows we would benefit \nfrom spending more to build and maintain our infrastructure; however, \nthis analysis would also show that cost is ongoing over a long period \nof time.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. We should not waste valuable resources on needless, \ntemporary projects, nor should we fool ourselves into believing that \ntruly useful projects can be funded on a temporary basis. Any \nworthwhile investment will involve an ongoing expense.\n  Those who claim all the spending in the stimulus bill will be \ntemporary are essentially admitting it will have no lasting value. \nAlternatively, those who claim it will have a long-term benefit are \nessentially admitting the spending\n\n[[Page S2032]]\n\nwill not be temporary. Clearly, both these claims cannot be true. \nContrary to what some people might have us believe, a massive increase \nin Government spending for the purposes of creating temporary make-work \njobs is not a sound economic recovery plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2032-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2032-S2035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             SMALL BUSINESS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I have a great deal of respect for the \nSenator from Iowa. He has served with such distinction in this body. \nHowever, I have to rise to say that while he is sincere in his opinion, \nI am very proud that 61 Senators cast a vote for the opposite view; \nthat view being that the failed policies of the past were just that, \nfailed, and have left America wanting.\n  We have a very serious economic crisis that is not going to be solved \nby the same old tired, failed, bankrupt policies as part of what the \nSenator expressed continues to want to carry out--policies that give \nuntargeted tax cuts to those at the top of the tax bracket and hope and \npray that it trickles down to everyone else; policies that empower the \nindividual at the expense of the collective effort, and other policies \nthat have left this country wanting. That is why 61 Senators came to \nthe floor of the Senate and rejected those old notions and set a new \ncourse. Our President, with his election and now his leadership since \nthat election, is leading us to adopt new strategies; a collective \nenergy, recognizing that individuals alone cannot, no matter how \nindividually empowered, build the highways and infrastructure necessary \nor transform the economy in a new way that can be invigorating and \nhopeful to the American people who are in desperate need of a new \ncourse.\n  So I wished to come to the floor, though, to briefly speak about some \nof the things that are in the underlying bill we voted on to invoke \ncloture that have to do with small business: expanding it, highlighting \nit, focusing on small business. Before I do that with my colleague, \nSenator Snowe, my good friend from Maine, let me also mention it is my \nhope, as this bill moves through the process of conference, that the \nHouse Members and the Senate Members, along with the President and the \nadministration, can give a bit more focus on the infrastructure \nportions of this bill. It is something I think the Presiding Officer, \nDemocrats, and Republicans have said: If the bill was light in \nanything, it may be light on the infrastructure piece. That is not to \nsay that not a lot of good effort has gone into that, but perhaps we \ncould make the bill stronger, which it has gotten, in my view, stronger \nat every step. Whether it is highways, waterways, high-speed rail, \nflood control, wetlands, coastal restoration, help with sewer and \nwater, broadband, transformation of our electric grid, and, yes, \ninvesting in the infrastructure of science and technology in this \ncountry, we are woefully behind.\n\n  So I am hoping--one final point on that and then I will get to our \ncolloquy on small businesses in a minute--I am hoping our Governors, \nRepublican and Democratic alike, will take this as it is intended: an \nopportunity to help them balance their ships of State as we move \nthrough these rocky and rough waters over the next 12 to 18 months; \nthat they take this money in the spirit it was given: to be a partner \nwith them and the mayors and county commissioners, and in my State, \nparish officials, to help keep people employed, to help target this \neffort to where we can create the kind of jobs people most certainly \nneed.\n  One of the best parts of the debate this weekend and one of the most \nmoving was when Barbara Boxer, and then again today Byron Dorgan, put \nthe picture of the 1,000 people in line for 35 firefighter jobs. I wish \nto remind my friends on the other side that people don't want speeches, \nthey want jobs. If 1,000 people line up for 35 firefighter jobs, that \nis what this bill is intended to do.\n  It leads me to the colloquy Senator Snowe and I wished to come to the \nfloor to engage in about the underlying bill and some of the advantages \nand provisions this bill has for small business.\n  First, let me thank the Senator for her leadership over the years as \na chair and ranking member of this important committee. Let me also \nacknowledge the great leadership in recent years of Senator John Kerry, \nthe chairman of the Small Business Committee. Particularly in regards \nto this particular bill, working out some bipartisan provisions that we \ncould include, I wish to thank Senator Durbin and his staff who worked \nclosely with us.\n  I wish to begin my brief colloquy with a statement that might be \nsurprising to some who are listening, that 40 percent of all the \ncapital in the country for small business, basically, comes through or \ntouches the Small Business Administration. That is how important this \nsmall department of only 2,000--it used to have 3,000 people--it was \nterribly, and unjustifiably, in my view, cut under the previous \nadministration. I wish to acknowledge that Senator Snowe has been a \nfierce and effective advocate. In the case of those cuts, she argued, \nsometimes successfully and sometimes not, those cuts shouldn't take \nplace. Nonetheless, the Presiding Officer has started a small business \nthat turned into a large business, and he knows that one of the great \nchallenges right now is access to capital and affordable capital. We \nare not talking about access to being able to use a credit card at 21 \npercent or 15 percent. That is not affordable capital. We are not \ntalking about mortgaging your house only to watch the value fall by 50 \npercent. We are talking about things that could really spur the flowing \nof the capital markets in this country.\n  Briefly, in the underlying bill we voted cloture on, we have \neliminated the fees associated with the 504 economic development \nprogram, the 7(a) program, and the 504 program.\n  Lending is down by 40 to 60 percent, depending on the State. In \nLouisiana, we are down 60 percent. We think by eliminating these fees, \nit may spur banks to lend money and borrowers to come forward for this \naccess to capital.\n  For over 50 years, the SBA's lending programs provided critical \nfinancing to small business owners who could not get affordable loans \nin the conventional market. In the wake of the financial crisis and \nthis recession/depression, the SBA loan programs have not filled the \nvoid left by increasingly tight markets for conventional bank loans. We \nhope some of the provisions in this bill will help reduce that trend.\n  The fee waivers supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other \nbusiness groups are very encouraging by the results when we did this \nthe last time, after the 9/11 attacks--what that might mean to spur \neconomic growth in this country in the next few months and years to \ncome.\n  Let me also mention that in the underlying bill, we specifically \ntargeted microloans. This might also be surprising to many, but the \nmicroloan program provides very small loans--on average about $13,000 \nper loan. That seems to be very small, but sometimes I think we get \ncaught up in billions and billions and we forget that sometimes $5,000, \nor $10,000, or $20,000 is all it takes to get a good idea off the \nground and to help create jobs in America.\n  I want to say, since so many Government programs get a bad rap and a \nblack eye, this program--in large measure, my colleague from Maine \nhelped to start it in 1992--the microloan program has been one of the \nmost successful programs to date, having just one loss in its 18-year \nhistory, just one loss. Microloans are made to the smallest of \nbusinesses, typically home-based businesses, startups, newly \nestablished or small businesses. The program has always also been a \ngreat way to meet the needs of minority women and rural small business \nowners.\n  The final part of this bill I want to mention before turning it over \nto my colleague is the venture capital funds that will also stimulate \nthe flow of venture capital to emerging small businesses by providing \nflexibility for participants in the SBA's Small Business Investment \nCompany programs, SBIC programs, which have been successful. The \nlanguage in the underlying bill will give them the flexibility to even \nbe more successful. The occupant of the chair knows, Virginia's economy \nis growing and being spurred by new investment in small business. The \nChair has had, as Governor of that State, a\n\n[[Page S2033]]\n\nfront-row seat. These are some of the things we have put in the \nunderlying bill.\n\n  I will mention one final item. The good Senator from Maryland, Ben \nCardin, secured on the floor of the Senate, in addition to the work we \nhad done originally on this proposal, a surety bond amendment, which \nwas passed by a pretty overwhelming vote in the Senate, which will help \nsmall businesses secure--particularly in the areas of construction--\nthose surety bonds that will enable them to be part of this new \nstimulus package.\n  I am proud of the work we have done. Again, if it can be improved in \nconference, I would be open to that.\n  I would like to turn the final part of this presentation over to the \ngood Senator from Maine for comments about the financing portion, as \nwell as some other portions I spoke about.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I commend my colleague, Senator Landrieu, \nfrom Louisiana, the new chair of the Small Business Committee. I am \nconfident that she is going to champion small businesses and the \ncritical role they play in our Nation's economy. I look forward to \njoining forces with the Senator from Louisiana. She is going to be an \neffective and eloquent advocate on behalf of the men and women who make \nup the millions of small businesses across this country, which are the \nlifeblood of our Nation's economy.\n\n  One of the things we learned during the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina is that over 85 percent of businesses in Louisiana were small \nbusinesses. Similarly, in my home state of Maine, over 97 percent of \nall businesses are small businesses. So we understand the imperative of \ndoing everything we can to reinforce and leverage the resources we have \nat the Federal level to support the engine of our economy; and that is, \nof course, America's small businesses. They are too often overlooked, \nMr. President, in the role they play in our Nation's economy and in \ntheir job creation potential--creating two-thirds of all net new jobs \nin America.\n  At a time of cataclysmic job loss, we have to look to small \nbusinesses to spur economic growth. I am concerned because I have taken \nmany street tours across my State, and have seen first hand what we are \nseeing unfold all across America, small businesses closing their doors. \nSo I know that we must do everything conceivable to reinforce, and \nbolster the resources of the Small Business Administration, to help it \nmake a difference in creating jobs.\n  Frankly, all too often small businesses are overlooked, unrecognized, \nand not acknowledged for the indispensable role they play in driving \nour Nation's economy. Nationally, unemployment is at 7.6 percent. In \nthe past 4 weeks, more than 2.3 million people have filed new claims \nfor jobless benefits. Those losses will only cascade even further if \nsmall businesses are unable to access the capital needed to help them \nstart, grow, and expand their operations. It is one of the issues I am \nworking on as we speak. Certainly, through the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram and with the respective Federal agencies, I think we should \nhave a phone line so small businesses can call to find out how we can \nmatch up their needs for lending with banks and financial institutions \nacross this country.\n  As we speak, we are finding that more and more small businesses are \nunable to get the lines of credit they need to continue to carry on \ntheir business. Certainly, in a multiseason State such as Maine, people \ncannot do some things during the course of the winter, but they want to \nmaintain their workforce and are unable to because they cannot access \nthe line of credit that is indispensable to survival. There are a \nnumber of things we can do at the Federal level, much of which is \nincluded in this stimulus plan pending before the Senate.\n\n  I agree with my colleague, Senator Landrieu that we must focus upon \ninitiatives that are crucial to creating jobs. After all, when \neverybody talks about the stimulus plan, how to evaluate it, as I said \nlast week, we need to create a rigorous standard by which we measure \njob creation in this legislation. It is absolutely essential in \nbuilding the confidence that this stimulus plan will work.\n  The way to do that is to look at some of the provisions targeted \ntoward the small businesses, which will play a key role in our economy. \nWhen you realize that firms with fewer than 500 employees comprise 99 \npercent of all businesses in America. And according to the SBA, small \nbusinesses have greater potential to recover faster than larger \nbusinesses during the course of a recession. But small businesses are \nfighting for survival.\n  That is why Senator Landrieu and I worked to ensure that key \ninitiatives were included into this bill, which will be critical for \nsmall business success during these very difficult economic times. We \ncollaborated on these initiatives because we know that they are \nparamount to securing a robust future for small businesses.\n  SBA lending numbers are in a free fall. That is demonstrated in \nseveral of the charts I have here. The 7(a) loan volume has dropped \nfrom over $3.2 billion to under $2 billion, respectfully, compared to \nthe same quarter last year. In terms of percentage impact, that is a \n43-percent decline. For startup 7(a) loans, the numbers are just as \nbad. Nationally, startup loans are down over 40 percent, when compared \nto the first quarter of fiscal year 2008 to the current fiscal period.\n\n  In Maine, for example, if you look at 7(a) lending, it has declined \nby nearly 69 percent for the first quarter of fiscal year 2007, \ncompared to this quarter of fiscal year 2009. That is why it is \nabsolutely urgent that we make sure the initiatives that are included \nin the Senate-passed version of the stimulus plan are maintained and \npreserved in conference. They will go a long way toward addressing and \nminimizing many of the problems small businesses face.\n  For example, Senator Landrieu and I worked in tandem on some of these \nkey initiatives, which include those to reduce or eliminate fees for \n504 and 7(a) loans, for instance. This is a departure from the approach \ntaken in the House but, frankly, reducing these fees will provide a \ngreater incentive for both small businesses and lenders to participate \nin the program, rather than just increasing the guarantee, which is \nreflected in the House-passed version of the stimulus plan.\n  We will also be able, through supporting these programs, to reduce \nthe cost of SBA loans for borrowers. These SBA loans will help to \ncreate or retain 750,000 jobs.\n  Additionally, we have included provisions to increase funding, as \nSenator Landrieu indicated, for the SBA's vital microloan program. \nThese microloans are not only easy to process, they are effective and \naccessible to small businesses. Again, these loans have demonstrated \ntime and again their job creation value and potential. We have improved \nthe venture capital program and increased the size of loans that small \nbusinesses can take under the SBA's 7(a) and 504 lending programs. \nAnother key component is the automation of the SBA's loan processing, \nwhich must be improved. It would be easier for lenders, particularly \nsmall ones and those in rural areas, to participate in the loan \nprograms because, increased automation will result in increased usage \nof these key programs. Most critically, this automation would reduce \nthe regulatory burden on small businesses. In fact, the SBA Office of \nAdvocacy has determined that the cumulative annual cost of Federal \nregulations to small businesses is more than $1 trillion. So automation \nwould take a step toward reducing that burden, and it would make a \ntremendous difference for many in my State, in Louisiana, and across \nthe country.\n\n  As a member of the Finance Committee, I also want to highlight key \ntax provisions in the stimulus plan. Again, I express my gratitude to \nSenator Landrieu for her advocacy of these initiatives because they are \nessential. The first is an extension of Section 179 Small Business \nExpensing at the $250,000 level for 2009 and 2010. That has \ndemonstrated--repeatedly in the past--to create jobs. We need to use \nproven programs, like this, in the stimulus that have job creation \nvalue.\n  I am very pleased that level of $250,000 will be extended both in \n2009 and 2010 so that small businesses can make investments in plant \nand equipment that they can deduct immediately. In 2005, the most \nrecent year\n\n[[Page S2034]]\n\nfor which data was available, according to the IRS, more than 4.5 \nmillion small businesses claimed the section 179 expense deduction. \nThese are 4.5 million job-creating engines, which this provision could \nassist at this difficult time in America.\n  The other provision, of course, is the 5-year net operating carryback \nof losses which will allow companies to use these losses against prior-\nyear profits to gain immediate tax refunds.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, for allowing me to speak about these key \nsmall business provisions in the stimulus bill. As we focus our \nattention on this stimulus package, we have to measure each and every \ninitiative by its job-creation capabilities and as a catalyst for \ncreating those jobs. As Senator Landrieu indicated, there is no greater \ncatalyst for job creation in this country than small businesses. I have \noften stated that we have ignored and overlooked their tremendous \npotential.\n\n  The stimulus package, which is pending before the Senate, will \nbolster small businesses through a variety of initiatives. I am pleased \nwe were able to incorporate these provisions, through the support of \nSenator Landrieu and many members of the Senate Finance and \nAppropriations Committees and particularly Senators Baucus and \nGrassley, Finance Committee chair and ranking member, and Senators \nInouye and Cochran, Senate Appropriations Committee chair and ranking \nmember. Thank you to all of those who realized how vital these \ninitiatives will be to creating jobs. I hope that in the conference \ncommittee these initiatives will be preserved because at the end of the \nday, this package will be measured in terms of its ability to jump-\nstart this economy. And we know that small businesses will be on the \nfront lines of job recovery, if given the resources and the ability to \ndo so.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Louisiana for being such a critical \nadvocate and for her leadership on the Small Business Committee. I am \nlooking forward to working with her in the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield for a moment, \nI want to mention as we close, I am so happy and excited about the \nPresident's nominee for the Small Business Administration. I had the \nopportunity to meet her for the first time today.\n  I ask my colleague from Maine, who is actually very familiar with \nthis nominee, and she is from Maine, if the Senator would share a word \nor two about the particular qualifications of this nominee as we get \nready to start this process. Through the Chair to my friend from Maine, \nit is indicative of the President's focus and his interest and his \nunderstanding by giving us such a quality nominee to consider.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I appreciate that Senator Landrieu has \nraised for discussion the tremendous credentials that are offered by \nKaren Mills. There is no question that she has a tremendous background \nboth in manufacturing and venture capitalism and in understanding the \nrole that small businesses play in our Nation's economy.\n  She has had firsthand experience, not only through her family's \nbusiness endeavors, but also through her work in venture capitalism in \nhelping to shape and rebuild various businesses. She understands and \nappreciates the resources that are necessary and essential to \nrebuilding businesses and the access to capital that is required.\n  Also, she played a pivotal role in Maine's economy, in encouraging \nthe use of cluster development. She has worked extensively with the \nBrookings Institute on how to nurture cluster development in various \nsmall and rural communities, to help rebuild and reshape their local \neconomies.\n  What we have recognized, and what she has certainly demonstrated time \nand again through her own personal firsthand experience, is that it \ndoes not take a lot of resources to nurture and create small businesses \nas a foundation for a local economy. It is that type of experience she \nwill bring to the Small Business Administration.\n  In fact, I had the opportunity to meet with her this afternoon as she \nprepares for the confirmation hearing. There is no question that she \nhas widespread knowledge on what it will take to rebuild the Small \nBusiness Administration helping it to be far more responsive and \nreceptive to small businesses, to understand what they need, to link \nthem up with lenders, to provide the technology required to make the \nagency much more effective and responsive to the needs of small \nbusinesses across the country.\n  I am looking forward to working with Ms. Mills and the chair of the \nSmall Business Committee because I believe that Ms. Mills is \noutstanding in her capabilities and truly appreciates the role small \nbusinesses play in America's economy. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent to have a biography of Ms. Mills printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  Biography of Ms. Karen Gordon Mills\n\n       Ms. Karen Gordon Mills is the President of MMP Group, Inc. \n     Previously, she was the Co-Founder and Managing Director at \n     Solera Capital. Before founding MMP Group, she was the \n     Managing Director and Chief Operating Officer of the \n     Industrial Group for E.S. Jacobs and Co., from December 1983 \n     to January 1993. In this role, Ms. Mills personally led seven \n     leveraged buyout transactions and had an influential or board \n     role in six others: Ms. Mills background includes consulting \n     for McKinsey and Co. both in the U.S. and in Europe, and \n     working as a Product Manager for General Foods. She has been \n     a Director and Member of Audit and Compensation Committees of \n     Arrow Electronics Inc. since 1994 and Director and Member of \n     its Audit Committee of ArmorAll Products Inc. since 1994. Ms. \n     Mills serves as Director of Latina Media Ventures LLC, \n     Triangle Pacific Corp. since 1988, Annie's Homegrown Inc., \n     Scotts Company, and Guardian Insurance Company. Ms. Mills \n     chairs Governor Baldacci's Council on Competitiveness and the \n     Economy. She also sits on the Governor's Council for the \n     Redevelopment of the Brunswick Naval Air Station, which \n     recently went on the BRAC closure list, and serves on the \n     Boards of the Maine Technology Institute and the Maine Nature \n     Conservancy. Ms. Mills is a member of the Council on Foreign \n     Relations and has been Vice Chairman of the Harvard \n     Overseers. Ms. Mills has an A.B. in Economics from Radcliffe \n     College, Magna Cum Laude. She also holds an M.B.A. from \n     Harvard Business School where she was a Baker Scholar.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for her testimony in \nregard to Karen Mills and will commit as the new chair of this \ncommittee to move her nomination through with dispatch.\n  I will say before I give closing remarks, a word to banks and credit \nunions, particularly community banks, that I am intent in a leadership \nposition on this committee to have the SBA be a better partner to \ncommunity banks and credit unions as we really leverage the power of \nthe SBA. Too often in the past, it has been seen as a problem or too \ncomplicated or too bureaucratic. I am looking forward to making that a \nmuch smoother, more powerful, muscular partnership so that our small \nbusinesses in America can have a model, the best in the world. It is \ngoing to be exciting to work on.\n  I thank the Senator from Maine and look forward to having a very \nstrong partnership with her in the months ahead.\n  Is there any further business?\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, one other issue that is critical, which \nSenator Landrieu and I both share, is that of elevating the Small \nBusiness Administration to Cabinet-level status. As I have said before, \nthis will underscore the critical role that small businesses play in \nour economy. I know Chair Landrieu shares and supports such an \ninitiative. It is long overdue and unquestionably should be done. We \nshould elevate the status of the agency to give it the prominence and \nprofile it deserves on behalf of the men and women of our Nation's \nsmall business community. There should be far more focus upon the role \nthat they can serve in not only our domestic marketplace, but the \nglobal marketplace as well.\n  I will continue to call for the elevation of this critical position. \nI have advocated it for years. In light of where we are today in the \neconomy, and the increase in unemployment, it is even more imperative \nthat we increase the prominence of small businesses in the President's \ncabinet because, again, doing so will provide the attention and \nresources they require to survive and be prosperous.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Maine. I \nwas happy to join with her in a letter to the President urging him to \ntake this step. Hopefully, he will consider that request and give it \nevery consideration.\n\n[[Page S2035]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/09/senate-section/article/S2035-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            ORDER FOR RECESS\n\n  Mr. LANDRIEU.
