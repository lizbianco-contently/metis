The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak about the \nvisit this week by Afghan President Karzai and many of his ministers, \nas well as the policy that is unfolding all these many months in \nAfghanistan.\n  I rise in the midst of a debate we are having in the Senate on \nfinancial reform and continuing efforts and strategies to be put in \nplace to create jobs. Even in the midst of all those domestic concerns \nthat are economic in nature--and we are still very concerned about and \nworking on the problems of those who are out of work--we need, in that \ncontext, to also be concerned about what is happening in Afghanistan. \nSo I wish to discuss President Karzai's visit and, as I mentioned, the \nvisit, as well, by other Afghan government officials.\n  The other reason I rise in connection with that topic is to talk \nabout the continuing threat our troops face from improvised explosive \ndevices known by the acronym IEDs. They continue to pose a threat to \nour troops, and we have to continue to be concerned about the nature of \nthat threat.\n  In a broader sense, when it comes to this policy, we have to get this \nright. We have to make sure our government is continually focused on \ngetting this strategy right in Afghanistan, as it relates to security, \ngovernance, and development--all aspects of the strategy, working with \nour coalition partners in doing that.\n\n[[Page S3770]]\n\n  First and foremost, on the question of IEDs, the Los Angeles Times \nreported last week that three-fifths of the 602 combat-related deaths \nof U.S. troops in Afghanistan were due to roadside bombs, the so-called \nIEDs, improvised explosive devices. The primary ingredient in these \nbombs is ammonium nitrate, a fertilizer that can also be used as an \nexplosive. We know this from our recent history.\n  We also know we have some domestic history to consider. Timothy \nMcVeigh used a 4,800-pound ammonium nitrate bomb to attack the Alfred \nMurrah building in Oklahoma City in April of 1995.\n  The Afghan Government has recognized this problem--the use of \nammonium nitrate--and has begun working with coalition troops to crack \ndown on the use of ammonium nitrate. It is no longer legal in \nAfghanistan to use ammonium nitrate in farming, and Afghan farmers \nreceive training on how to use other types of fertilizer.\n  During yesterday's press conference President Karzai had with \nPresident Obama, he discussed the use of ammonium nitrate and, in \nparticular, its impact on U.S. troops. I was glad he did that. I am \nglad President Obama has been focused on this issue as well. I had a \nchance yesterday, in a lunch with a small group of Senators, to ask \nPresident Karzai directly about this issue. So we talked about it \nyesterday at lunch as well.\n  Despite this ban in Afghanistan, ammonium nitrate manages to make its \nway to Afghanistan, reportedly from Pakistan. The Los Angeles Times \nreported that transport routes are lined with corrupt Pakistani police \nofficers--according to the Los Angeles Times--and border officials who \naccept bribes to allow this smuggling to occur. This smuggling is a \nlucrative enterprise. One Pakistani businessman reported making almost \n$950 a month smuggling ammonium nitrate for use in Afghanistan. This is \na country where the monthly average income is $216 a month.\n\n  I urge the Pakistani Government to track and regulate the transport \nof this dangerous material. The government appears to recognize that \nammonium nitrate could also pose a threat to Pakistan's national \nsecurity as extremists across the country step up their activities \nthere as well. As in Afghanistan, it is important for the authorities \nin Pakistan to first show the political will to address this problem, \nand to put in place proper legal mechanisms to diminish its use across \nthe border in Afghanistan.\n  Ammonium nitrate's use in IEDs is the main killer of U.S. troops in \nAfghanistan. We must do all we can--all we can--to limit its use.\n  I understand that if ammonium nitrate did not come from Pakistan, \nsmugglers would identify new sources from other bordering countries. \nWhile this may be the case, it appears as though the primary source \ntoday is Pakistan. In this case, Pakistan is where we should focus our \nattention. So let's get at the supply of ammonium nitrate. Let's make \nit much harder for terrorists to kill U.S. troops.\n  Let me move next to the overall policy in Afghanistan. I was honored \nto be one of seven or eight Senators to have lunch yesterday with \nPresident Karzai. During his time in Washington, we were all pleased--I \nthink both sides of the aisle in the Senate were pleased--that \nPresident Karzai reiterated his commitments to improving governance and \nreducing corruption. They are commitments, but I think the people of \nPennsylvania and the people across America need to see results from \nthose commitments. I also hope President Karzai will restate his \nsupport for NATO efforts to win back the country from the Taliban and \ndrive the insurgents to the negotiating table.\n  In a meeting with Afghan Government ministers on Wednesday, five or \nsix other Senators and I emphasized the importance of women's rights in \nAfghanistan. Afghan women play a key role in the decisionmaking \nprocess. Any peace process or agreement that does not respect and \nuphold the rights of half of the population--the women--of Afghanistan \nwill fail to achieve long-term goals for security and stability.\n  In February, Senator Boxer and I cohosted a Senate Foreign Relations \nSubcommittee hearing on the future of Afghan women and girls. At that \nhearing, Melanne Verveer, the U.S. Ambassador at Large for Women's \nIssues, testified about the challenges Afghan women and girls face. She \nsaid:\n\n       Perhaps the greatest remaining impediment to women's full \n     civic participation is violence against women and girls, \n     which remains endemic in Afghan society. Crimes go unpunished \n     because of anemic rule of law and weak institutions of \n     justice. Approximately 80 percent of crimes and disputes are \n     settled through traditional justice mechanisms.\n\n  So said Melanne Verveer, who knows of what she speaks.\n  This is a continuing problem. It is not just a moral problem. This is \na problem long term for us as well because if the women of \nAfghanistan--women and girls--are not treated with respect, are not \naccorded the kind of rights and being given the benefit of a system of \njustice that will protect them, then our whole strategy in Afghanistan \nis undermined.\n  We cannot just win this on the battlefield. This is not just about \nthe military. There are two other aspects that are so important to this \nstrategy: governance and development. Of course, when you are talking \nabout governance, you are talking about a system of justice. If half \nthe population is the continued target of violence, and if half the \npopulation is not accorded basic rights and given the benefit of a \nfunctioning system of justice, our strategy in Afghanistan will fail.\n  This is a problem, not only because of the current concern we have \nabout how women and girls are treated in Afghanistan and around the \nworld, as well as here in the United States--that is the main reason \nfor our concern--but it is also connected directly, and I think is \ninextricably intertwined, with our strategy as it relates to governance \nin Afghanistan.\n  We know that since the fall of the Taliban, there have been some \nimprovements in women's rights, such as the creation of the Ministry \nfor Women's Affairs and the guarantee of equal rights for men and women \nin the new constitution. Indeed, Afghan women remain among the worst \noff in the world with respect to life expectancy as well as quality of \nlife. So even though progress has been made, we need to see a lot more \nin the way of results.\n  I am encouraged by the recent measures undertaken at the top of \nAfghanistan's Government to include the voices of women in the \nconsultation process leading up to the Peace Jirga. However, I believe \nit is essential the Afghan Government take immediate measures--\nimmediate measures--to include qualified women, who have a record of \npublic service--civic or community service--in meaningful senior roles \nat every level of the government and in the peace process.\n  We were--I know I was; and many of us were--very impressed by the \nwomen we met who are active participants in the Afghan Government. But \nmuch more needs to be done.\n  Let me move next to more of the military aspects of our strategy: \nboth in Marjah--the operation that took place over the last couple of \nmonths--as well as the upcoming operations in Kandahar.\n  On April 29, the Pentagon released its biannual report to Congress on \nthe last 6 months in Afghanistan. By all accounts, it was sobering. The \nreport portrays an Afghan Government with limited credibility among its \npeople. In 92 districts assessed for their support of the Afghan \nGovernment or their antagonism to it, not one supported the government, \nnot one in 92. I realize that sometimes when a report comes out, it is \ndated and it may be that improvements may have been made over the last \ncouple of months, but the most recent report was not good in terms of \nsupport for the Afghan Government.\n  Again, our strategy will not be successful unless the Afghan \nGovernment can improve those numbers of support from its own people. \nThis is an important issue that President Karzai and the rest of the \ngovernment must continue to address. I think they are taking steps to \ndo that but much more needs to be done.\n  The Pentagon report highlights one positive development: The Taliban \nis seen by 52 percent of Afghans as the chief cause of instability. So \nthe message is getting out to the people about the destructive impact \nof the Taliban. This perception provides the Afghan Government with an \nopportunity to show itself as the protector of the people.\n\n[[Page S3771]]\n\n  One area in which ISAF and international aid donors can help build \npublic confidence in their government is food security and \ndistribution. Not only is the agricultural sector critical to the well-\nbeing of all Afghans, both agriculture and food distribution are caught \nup in the problems raised by Afghan dependence on opium cultivation, \nextortion, and corruption in aid and transport operations for that, as \nwell as manipulation by national and local power brokers.\n  The United States has begun shaping operations, mostly political, in \nand around Kandahar to prepare for the next major military campaign. \nWhile we can apply the lessons learned in Marjah, the Kandahar campaign \nwill be a formidable test of our counterinsurgency plan. Kandahar is \nthe second largest city in Afghanistan, the birthplace of the Taliban, \nand the Taliban still has considerable support there.\n  In judging the success of Kandahar from Washington, we should be \naware of the significant political and cultural complexities because of \nthe coalition's need to shift between fighting and outreach in \nAfghanistan. The contest for public sentiment among Afghan civilians \nwill arguably be more important over the long run than the relative \neffectiveness of each side's military skill.\n  A functioning government which maintains credibility in the eyes of \nthe people of Afghanistan will be necessary if civil military strategy \nis going to have any chance of success. We must continually stress the \nmovement toward this goal so as not to lose sight of our objectives in \nAfghanistan. Again, we have to be concerned about three things: first, \nmilitary concerns and the strategy as it relates to the military \ncampaigns; second, governance; and third, development.\n  The ability of nongovernmental organizations and other aid \norganizations to do great work is hampered by corruption and the \nineffectiveness of the government. Militarily removing the Taliban \ninfluence must be accompanied by the timely and effective delivery of \nemergency aid and refugee assistance. It is only when the government \nhas the capacity to operate in an effective manner that all the tools \ncan be applied to increasing the quality of life of local Afghans as \nwell as presenting an alternative to the Taliban's form of rule.\n  The upcoming operations in Kandahar will be the largest to date aimed \nat securing the population through General McChrystal's population \ncentric civil-military strategy. However, if the government is not \ncapable of providing the capacity necessary to follow the military \nclearing operations, the strategy will not succeed.\n  Our brave men and women who serve this country deserve a reliable \npartner in the Afghan Government. We must work assiduously and \ncontinually to realize this vision of a peaceful and stable \nAfghanistan.\n  In conclusion, first of all, I wish to thank President Karzai for \nwhat he said here in the United States, what he did here to reiterate \nthe goals we have, the partnership between our government and his \ngovernment to get this policy right. After my two visits to Afghanistan \nin 2008 and 2009, I have been very critical of President Karzai. I must \nsay, based upon the last couple of months, based upon the work he did \nhere, the statements he made, and some actions he has taken, I have \nmore cautious optimism, I will say, than I had before about his ability \nto move forward, helping us on this strategy; his ability to build \nconfidence, the confidence of his own people; his ability to have a \npositive impact not only as it relates to our military strategy but, of \ncourse, especially governance as well as the development after military \ncampaigns take place. I also appreciate the fact that President Karzai \nshowed great respect not only for our fighting men and women in the \nfield and their families but especially for those who gave, as \nPresident Lincoln said a long time ago in Gettysburg, the last full \nmeasure of devotion to their country when he visited the graves of some \nof those who perished in that conflict.\n  So we have reason to be more optimistic, but the test will be over \ntime and based upon real results, facts on the ground as it relates to \nthe military operations, governance, and development. So this strategy \nbears a lot of scrutiny.\n  In conclusion, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na Los Angeles Times story of May 3, 2010, entitled ``Key Bomb \nIngredient is Smuggled in Freely in Pakistan.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n               [From the Los Angeles Times, May 3, 2010]\n\n         Key Bomb Ingredient Is Smuggled in Freely in Pakistan\n\n                          (By Alex Rodriguez)\n\n       Peshawar, Pakistan.--Twice a week, a caravan of trucks \n     lumbers out of this volatile northwest Pakistan city in the \n     dead of night and makes its way toward Afghanistan, loaded \n     with one of the most coveted substances in a Taliban bomb \n     maker's arsenal: ammonium nitrate fertilizer.\n       Every time the illicit caravan makes its trip, it moves \n     unhindered past a gantlet of Pakistani police checkpoints \n     along the Pak-Afghan Highway. A string of bribes paid out to \n     police, politicians and bureaucrats ensures that the smuggled \n     explosive agent reaches its destination, middlemen on the \n     Afghan side of the border who sell it to insurgents, says the \n     co-owner of a Pakistani trucking firm that dispatches the \n     caravans.\n       Banned in Afghanistan, ammonium nitrate is the basic \n     ingredient of the Taliban's roadside bombs. The amounts \n     ferried into Afghanistan are staggering. Each truck carries \n     130 bags, each of which contains 110 pounds of ammonium \n     nitrate. A caravan typically has at least 12 trucks, which \n     means a single night's shipment can move 85 tons of the \n     fertilizer.\n       The caravans head out every third night.\n       ``I know that it's used to kill American soldiers,'' said \n     the businessman, a lanky, thirty-something Pashtun from the \n     Khyber district in Pakistan's tribal areas, a haven for \n     Taliban militants. He agreed to discuss his company's \n     smuggling on condition of anonymity.\n       ``But people in the tribal areas don't have any choice but \n     to do this,'' he said. ``If they would give us another way to \n     make money, we would take it.''\n       Of all the threats U.S. troops face in Afghanistan, the \n     roadside bomb is the one they dread most. Western forces have \n     suffered 602 combat-related deaths since the beginning of \n     2009, and 361, or three out of five, have been caused by \n     roadside bombs, according to icasualties.org, a website that \n     keeps track of war-related deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n       Ammonium nitrate bombs, often crude wood-and-graphite \n     pressure-plate devices buried in dirt lanes or heaps of \n     trash, are difficult to detect and devastating when they \n     detonate. The fertilizer's might as an explosive agent was \n     witnessed in the United States in 1995, when Timothy \n     McVeigh's 4,800-pound ammonium nitrate bomb killed 168 people \n     at a government building in Oklahoma City.\n       In Afghanistan, a typical homemade bomb weighs about 65 \n     pounds, most of it ammonium nitrate. A shipment of 85 tons of \n     ammonium nitrate could yield more than 2,500 bombs.\n       Made by combining ammonia gas and nitric acid, ammonium \n     nitrate is one of the world's most popular fertilizers. It \n     was used by Afghan farmers, but because of the roadside \n     bombs, the United States persuaded President Hamid Karzai's \n     government to ban the substance in January.\n       But Pakistani smugglers continue to truck massive amounts \n     into Afghanistan. Several other countries in the region, \n     including Uzbekistan and Iran, also manufacture the \n     fertilizer, but almost all that gets into Afghanistan comes \n     from Pakistan, says Kenneth Corner, director of intelligence \n     at the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat Organization, \n     a research arm of the U.S. military that develops ways to \n     detect and withstand roadside bombs.\n       Pakistan makes 496,000 tons of ammonium nitrate fertilizer \n     each year. It also imports ammonium nitrate from several \n     countries, including China, Germany and Sweden, Comer said. \n     The U.S. has begun talks with Pakistani officials to persuade \n     them to ban the manufacture and use of ammonium nitrate and \n     switch to urea as the country's main fertilizer. Unlike \n     ammonium nitrate, urea cannot be readily used as an \n     explosive.\n       ``I can't find anyone who thinks ammonium nitrate makes \n     sense as a fertilizer as opposed to what's more commonly used \n     in both (Pakistan and Afghanistan), which is urea,'' Comer \n     said.\n       Officials in Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, say such a \n     ban would be a hard sell in Pakistan. ``It would cost \n     hundreds of thousands of dollars for the (sole) manufacturer \n     to switch to urea,'' said Qadir Bux Baloch, spokesman for the \n     Agriculture Ministry.\n       As long as ammonium nitrate remains legal in Pakistan, the \n     U.S. will have to rely on Pakistani police and border \n     authorities to curb smuggling. For the time being, however, \n     rampant corruption within the ranks of law enforcement and \n     local government allows ammonium nitrate to be smuggled \n     freely into Afghanistan.\n       The Khyber businessman said his company pays about $830 in \n     bribes for a single truckload of ammonium nitrate. About 40 \n     percent of that goes to local police, he said, and the rest \n     gets paid out to local officials.\n       Middlemen on the other side of the border bribe Afghan \n     authorities so they can transfer the shipments to their own \n     trucks and move the explosive agent through their country, \n     the Khyber businessman said.\n\n[[Page S3772]]\n\n       The businessman said he clears about $950 a month smuggling \n     ammonium nitrate. At least eight trucking firms on the \n     outskirts of Peshawar regularly smuggle the substance into \n     Afghanistan, he said.\n       Peshawar authorities have never raided his warehouse, he \n     said. ``There are only a few police officials in Peshawar who \n     know what we do, and we bribe them.''\n       Peshawar's top administrative official, Commissioner Azam \n     Khan, said no Pakistani court had ever convicted anyone of \n     smuggling ammonium nitrate into Afghanistan. He said he had \n     begun meeting with law enforcement and other officials to \n     find ways to tackle the smuggling of ammonium nitrate and \n     other commodities into Afghanistan.\n       ``We're trying to think out of the box,'' Khan said. \n     ``We're looking at what laws we can use to get at the black \n     market storage of ammonium nitrate, to make it more difficult \n     to store it in bulk.''\n       Some security officials say Pakistan should have ample \n     incentive to better scrutinize the movement of ammonium \n     nitrate, given its own struggle with Islamic militants.\n       In March, police seized 6,600 pounds of ammonium nitrate \n     stashed in a fruit market in Lahore's Allama Iqbal \n     neighborhood. Investigators believe the three men arrested in \n     the seizure were connected to a series of suicide attacks \n     that killed more than 50 people in March.\n       Zulfiqar Hameed, a senior Lahore police official in charge \n     of investigations, said his officers could have tracked down \n     the middlemen who supplied the ammonium nitrate to the \n     militants if Pakistan required manufacturers to put tracking \n     numbers on each fertilizer bag.\n       ``It's a totally undocumented market,'' Hameed said. \n     ``There's no reliable way of finding out who bought those \n     bags. That's a huge problem.''\n       Even if Pakistani authorities took steps to clamp down on \n     ammonium nitrate smuggling, the Khyber businessman said he \n     doubted they would derail his operation. Along Pakistan's \n     tribal belt, where smuggling is a way of life, the policemen \n     and officials accustomed to a steady stream of payoffs aren't \n     likely to turn over a new leaf anytime soon.\n       ``Never have these supplies been interfered with,'' the \n     businessman said, chuckling. ``These shipments always reach \n     their destination.''\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Finally, let me also ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a summary of a ``Report on Progress Toward Security and \nStability in Afghanistan'' issued by the Department of Defense dated \nApril 2010.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Report on Progress Toward Security and Stability in Afghanistan\n\n                     (Issued by the DOD, Apr. 2010)\n\n       The ANP consists of four major categories of police; the \n     Afghan Uniformed Police (AUP), the Afghan Border Police \n     (ABP), the Afghan National Civil Order Police (ANCOP) and \n     Specialized Police.\n       In January 2010, the JCMB, the international community, and \n     the U.S. Government agreed to the Afghan proposal to grow the \n     ANP to 109,000 by October 2010 and 134,000 by October 2011. \n     March goal: 99261. Actual: 102,138.\n       One of the major past weaknesses of the ANP program is the \n     lack of centralized command and control for recruiting and \n     training.\n       A major concern of the international community is the lack \n     of personnel accountability in the ANP force. There have been \n     accounts of ``over-the-tashkil'' police in various districts \n     doing police work while not being paid through LOTF-A, as \n     well as accounts of ``ghost police'' who are on the payroll \n     but are not actually present for duty.\n       Training is a key challenge to building the capacity of the \n     ANP. In recent years, because of the lack of program \n     resourcing, 60-70% of the force was hired and deployed with \n     no formal training (the ``recruit-assign'' model).\n       High levels of corruption persist in the ANP and reports of \n     promotions being sold are common.\n       As with the ANA, the logistics systems in the ANP have been \n     weak. Over the past year, the NTM-A has assisted the \n     Logistics Training and Advisory Group in improving its \n     logistics system to better meet the needs of the ANP. Despite \n     progress, the MoI logistics system is in its early stages of \n     development and lacks automation, infrastructure, and \n     expertise.\n       Establishment of effective rule of law institutions is \n     critical to the sustainment of an effective police force. To \n     date, in the justice sector, there has been little enduring \n     progress despite investment toward reform, infrastructure, \n     and training. Courts are understaffed and chronically \n     corrupt. Corruption can be stemmed by ensuring there are \n     adequate salaries and an adequate number of defense \n     attorneys, and by implementation of a case management system \n     and court watch or court monitoring program. Security for \n     judges and prosecutors continued to be a significant problem, \n     especially in RC-South.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, before I ask a unanimous \nconsent on an amendment, I will comment on Senator Casey's remarks that \nwere just delivered so powerfully and eloquently. He is right on point \nthat the efforts underway in Afghanistan are crucial to our country's \nnational security.\n  It was important, as well, that he talked about the three main \nfactors that are in play there in our ultimate success. This week, we \nhad President Karzai and much of his Cabinet in Washington. I certainly \nappreciate the effort President Karzai made to show his respect for \nthose who have fallen in Afghanistan in the war there. I also note \nGeneral McChrystal was here briefing many of us. I think the Presiding \nOfficer, as well, heard from him on the state of the situation in \nAfghanistan.\n  This isn't going to be easy. I am heartened by what I heard. I \nexpress my appreciation for the valor, commitment, and honor that our \nforces in Afghanistan have displayed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4016 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe pending amendment be set aside, and I call up my amendment No. \n4016.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Colorado [Mr. Udall], for himself, Mr. \n     Lugar, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Bond, and Mr. Begich, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4016 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To improve consumer notification of numerical credit scores \n                 used in certain lending transactions)\n\n       On page 1455, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1077. USE OF CONSUMER REPORTS.\n\n       Section 615 of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. \n     1681m) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraphs (2) and (3) as paragraphs \n     (3) and (4), respectively;\n       (B) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) provide to the consumer written or electronic \n     disclosure--\n       ``(A) of a numerical credit score as defined in section \n     609(f)(2)(A) used by such person in taking any adverse action \n     based in whole or in part on any information in a consumer \n     report; and\n       ``(B) of the information set forth in subparagraphs (B) \n     through (E) of section 609(f)(1);''; and\n       (C) in paragraph (4) (as so redesignated), by striking \n     ``paragraph (2)'' and inserting ``paragraph (3)''; and\n       (2) in subsection (h)(5)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (C), by striking ``; and'' and \n     inserting a semicolon;\n       (B) in subparagraph (D), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by inserting at the end the following:\n       ``(E) include a statement informing the consumer of--\n       ``(i) a numerical credit score as defined in section \n     609(f)(2)(A), used by such person in connection with the \n     credit decision described in paragraph (1) based in whole or \n     in part on any information in a consumer report; and\n       ``(ii) the information set forth in subparagraphs (B) \n     through (E) of section 609(f)(1).''.\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, Senator Lugar and I introduced \nthis modified amendment in working with Senator Dodd, the Treasury \nDepartment, and the Federal Reserve to find a way to increase \nAmericans' access to their credit scores.\n  Before I talk about the amendment, the chairman of the committee, my \nfriend and colleague from Connecticut, is on the floor. I thank him for \nworking with me and a group of about 20 bipartisan Senators to provide \ngreater access to consumer credit scores. Senator Dodd had a \nthoughtful, incisive idea about how we might be able to move this \namendment to the floor, and that was to provide a credit score on a \ntransactional basis.\n\n[[Page S3773]]\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment does. A credit score affects \nconsumers' interest rates and monthly payments on home loans and can \neven influence a consumer's capacity to buy a car or rent an apartment, \neven get phone or Internet service.\n  Our amendment would take the two consumer notices that the Federal \nlaw requires lenders to give consumers and makes sure the credit score \nused to evaluate the consumer is disclosed to that individual.\n  Right now--and I found this out in the process of researching what we \nare trying to do--if you receive a general notice of your credit \napplication being turned down or if you are offered credit at less \nfavorable terms, you don't receive a disclosure of the credit score \nused to determine that outcome.\n  Under our amendment, if you are turned down for a loan or you are \ngiven a higher interest rate because of a low credit score, you now \nhave the right to see the credit score that was used. I know of the \nPresiding Officer's interest and long experience in the world of \nhousing and providing access to people in that way. I know this is \nsomething he has followed with great interest.\n  There is a fundamental principle at stake. If your credit score is \nbeing used against you, you ought to have the right to at least see it.\n  I know every single American would want to improve that credit score \nand understand how they could have a greater financial opportunity, \ngreater financial standing.\n  I thank Chairman Dodd and Senators Lugar, Levin, Bond, Scott Brown, \nSchumer, Begich, Lautenberg, and all the 20-plus Senators who helped \npush for this important issue.\n  I especially thank Senator Pryor for working with us to find \nsomething everyone could agree to in this modified version. I am \nappreciative that we were able to work it out.\n  I understand that the amendment is scheduled to be addressed Monday \nnight. I hope we can perhaps accept it on a voice vote at the proper \ntime as well.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again, I cannot thank our friend and \ncolleague from Colorado enough. He has done a great job. This is a \nterrific idea--one that is long overdue. The Presiding Officer is a \nmember of our Banking Committee. We have talked a lot about these \nissues over the last couple years. We have had hearings and, in fact, \nlegislation dealing with credit scores. A lot of people have had their \ngood names stolen from them, in a sense, as a result of the thievery \nthat goes on with credit cards and the like, and people's credit scores \nhave been manipulated.\n  It is difficult to find out where you are in all this. It is ironic \nthat we are citizens in our country, and other people are determining \nwhether we are creditworthy when we are buying an automobile, \npurchasing a home or getting a student loan. The idea that we as \nconsumers cannot have access to these scores that people are writing \nabout us--it is kind of offensive that we even have to go through this. \nIt is degrading, to put it mildly. I am grateful to the Senator from \nColorado for pursuing this. He would have gone a bit further. I would \nhave, too, but I sense we are going to have a problem here to get \nanything done at all. The fact that are going to have this on a \ntransactional basis is a major step forward and may alleviate 80 to 90 \npercent of the difficulties. That is not to say there isn't room for \nfurther improvement down the road. There will be other steps we can \ntake in the future to make sure people have access to their scores and \nwhere they stand on their ability to afford the things they need as a \nfamily.\n  The Senator from Colorado has made a significant contribution. We are \ngoing to have to vote on it. I am confident we can prevail. I believe \nboth Democrats and Republicans share the concerns the Senator has \nraised. He has made a valuable contribution to this effort. I thank the \nSenator personally for that.\n  I look forward to being supportive of this amendment early next week. \nI thank the Senator.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Let me again thank the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee for his willingness to work with those of us in a bipartisan \ncoalition. His comments are right on point, as always.\n  I think the Senator from Connecticut is right when he suggests that, \nas Americans have access to credit scores, they are going to be more \ninterested, as time goes on, in understanding how to build and \nstrengthen that score and be more financially literate, if you will.\n  The chairman has been remarkable in the time he has spent on the \nfloor and the strength he has shown, with the lack of sleep he has \nendured. His product, which many of us have contributed to, will be \nseen by historians as a seminal moment, when we put Wall Street on a \nmore accountable basis.\n  Under the chairman's leadership, we have also given consumers more \nrecourse and access. In the end, I think that is what the chairman \nwanted to do, and will do, to protect consumers all over our great \nNation. This is one small but important way to do that.\n  Again, I thank the chairman and look forward to the vote on Monday \nnight. I agree this will have widespread support. I will continue to \nask for those votes, and I know we will work to have a successful \noutcome Monday.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor amendment No. \n4016, introduced by Senator Mark Udall and Senator Lugar, to help \nprovide Americans access to their credit score, an essential piece of \npersonal financial information.\n  The way things stand now, the three primary credit bureaus charge \npeople to gain access to their credit scores. Seven years ago, the 2003 \nFair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act took a big step in the right \ndirection by giving Americans access to their credit report once a \nyear, on a no-cost, no-strings-attached basis, at each of the big three \ncredit bureaus. But a credit report only goes so far. It is the credit \nscore itself, not the report, that is so critical to the consumer when \nnavigating our financial system, and free access to credit scores was \nnot included in the 2003 act.\n  Credit score is often the single most important factor in obtaining a \nloan to buy a car or a house or in securing a credit card with a \nreasonable rate of interest. Credit scores can also play a key role in \nfinding an apartment or purchasing a major household appliance. More \nand more, credit scores are also used by employers in the hiring \nprocess.\n  With so much riding on this number, it is essential that Americans be \nable to readily obtain their credit score, so they can evaluate whether \nit accurately reflects their credit risk. If the score is low, a \nconsumer can evaluate the underlying credit information to see if there \nis an error in the data and what, if anything, they should do to \ncorrect an error. Consumers can also evaluate what steps they can take \nto improve their credit score by, for example, paying off debt or \ntearing up a credit card. To make those types of informed decisions, \nhowever, it is only fair for the consumer to know what all their \ncreditors know--the credit score that has been electronically assigned \nto them by an impersonal, computer-driven credit bureau.\n  A credit score is calculated from a person's personal financial \nhistory as that history is captured in specific data points included in \na credit report. We already know that the data in a credit report is \noften incomplete, out of date, or incorrect. We also know that the \nformulas used to produce credit scores from that data are complex, \nunpublished, and of uncertain predictive value.\n  The credit bureaus chum out profits by running people's personal \nfinancial information through their formulas. Then they sell the \ninformation to financial institutions, marketing companies, landlords, \nand others. The companies then turn around and sell the credit scores \nback to the consumers who otherwise can't find out what is being sent \nto multiple third parties about their credit status, without their ever \nhaving been informed about the score.\n  This whole setup is unfair. While credit scores serve a useful \nfunction in our financial system, fundamental fairness requires that \npeople have ready access to this basic information about themselves--\ninformation that is already being sold to their bank, their landlord, \ntheir employer, their government, and any other creditor willing to pay \nfor it.\n  One more point. Right now, despite the efforts of Congress and the \nFederal\n\n[[Page S3774]]\n\nTrade Commission, some credit bureaus continue to engage in deceptive \nadvertising of ostensibly ``free'' credit reports and scores that, in \nfact, require enrollment in a subscription credit monitoring service \nthat charges a monthly fee, often $15. It is astonishing to me that \nsome bureaus fight tooth and nail to avoid straightforward disclosures \nabout the cost of their products and instead try to slip them in with \ndeceptive offers of ``free'' credit scores or reports that are anything \nbut. This is an issue we addressed in the credit card reform bill with \nnew provisions to stop the deceptive advertising, and which the FTC is \nnow working to implement. The credit bureaus have got to clean up their \nact.\n  What we can do today is pass the Udall-Lugar amendment, which would \nrequire that every time a consumer suffers an adverse event--such as a \nrejected loan--or receives materially less favorable terms--such as a \nhigh interest rate on a credit card--due to the consumer's credit \nscore, the lender or potential lender would have to provide that credit \nscore to the consumer. This requirement would enable people to find out \nwhat the credit bureaus are telling their creditors about their credit \nrisk, whenever that information is used against them.\n  This amendment would help Americans take control of their credit \nhistories, help restore fairness in the credit industry, and begin to \nclose a gaping loophole that the credit bureaus have been exploiting \nfor years. I commend Senator Udall for his leadership on this issue and \nencourage my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I support the amendment offered by Senator \nCollins, amendment No. 3879, and thank the Senator from Maine for her \nefforts to protect the financial stability of the United States and \nsafeguard the financial security of families in her State of Maine, my \nState of Connecticut, and all across America. Her amendment complements \nthe provisions in my bill, S. 3217, that strengthen capital standards \nfor large, interconnected financial companies. Under S. 3217, the \nFederal Reserve must impose heightened standards for leverage and risk-\nbased capital on large bank holding companies and on nonbank financial \ncompanies supervised by the Federal Reserve. These tougher standards \nwill serve as speed bumps to keep financial companies from growing too \nlarge and risky and threatening the nation's financial stability.\n  The Collins amendment, endorsed by FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, would \nprevent regulators from weakening risk-based capital and leverage \nstandards now in effect. It effectively sets a floor for such standards \ngoing forward that would apply to all banks, bank holding companies, \nand nonbank financial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve. The \nCollins amendment also reinforces the bill's requirement that capital \nfor large, interconnected financial companies should reflect the risks \nthat their failure may pose to financial stability.\n  As Chairman Bair noted, bank holding companies are supposed to serve \nas a source of strength for the banks they own. But during the \nfinancial crisis, many large bank holding companies became a source of \nweakness and ultimately required Federal support. The crisis also \nrevealed how dangerously overleveraged many large investment banks and \nother nonbank financial companies were. The Collins amendment and \nprovisions of S. 3217 will help to ensure that the largest, most \ninterconnected financial companies maintain a robust level of capital \nand to eliminate gaps in capital standards between banks and other \nfinancial companies that could undermine the financial stability of the \nUnited States.\n  Again, I thank my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, for her \nvaluable contribution to the collective, bipartisan effort here in the \nUnited States Senate to reform Wall Street and protect American \nfamilies.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to share some thoughts, if I can for \na couple of minutes, on one of the proposals that will be coming up, I \nthink, next week on the bill.\n  Again, I want to express my gratitude to all of our colleagues for \nthe way in which this debate has been conducted. Contrary to what many \npeople may think about the Senate, we are capable of having a full-\nthroated debate, one filled with emotion and passion about strongly \nheld views, and yet also respect each other to allow for the debate to \ngo forward and amendments to be considered and voted up and down.\n  I think we have done that now some 33 or 34 times over the last 6 or \n7 legislative days. I know there is much more to be done in the coming \ndays before we conclude our consideration of the Wall Street reform \nbill. But it is a reflection of how this institution can operate and \nhow we should operate, in my view, on a matter of this import.\n  So it is not only important about what we are doing in terms of \nreforming the financial system of our Nation, but I would argue in a \nway history may never record it as such, but also how we conducted this \ndebate on an important issue. It may not make the headlines, but it is \nvery important for the integrity of this institution and as a model for \nhow important comprehensive legislation can be handled.\n  I know it is cumbersome. I know it can take a long time. There are \ndelays that occur during consideration of matters in the Senate. But \nthat is as it was intended by our forefathers, in a sense, to have an \ninstitution where there would be the ample opportunity for debate, \nincluding unlimited debate by any one single Member, contrary to the \nother Chamber that comprises the Congress where they are limited to 5 \nminutes, and the majority rules allow for matters and insists upon the \nmajority prevailing.\n  In this institution the rules favor the minority, including a \nminority of one that can engage in extended debate. So we are different \nin this institution and with good reason. If they had wanted a \nunicameral system of one body, where just majority rules would prevail \nevery time, they would have created it. In fact, they tried to.\n  But I take some pride in the fact that it was two Senators from \nConnecticut, Oliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman, who in the \nconsideration of the Constitutional Convention--when all was about to \nfail over a contest between large States and small States; they were \nfearful that large States, having the dominant number of members in the \nHalls of Congress, would be overwhelmed and their interests be \ndisregarded because they did not have the votes to counter it--so \nOliver Ellsworth and Roger Sherman came up with the idea of creating a \nbicameral system, one wherein one body's membership would be made up \nbased on population, the size of the State, the number of seats it \nwould hold, and this body, regardless of our size, would have equal \nrepresentation.\n  So the smallest of our States, States such as Wyoming with a few \nhundred thousand people, has two Senators. The State of California, \nwith millions of people, has two Senators. So regardless of size, \nregardless of economic influence or other matters, we are all coequals, \nat least as far as our States are represented and the opportunity as \nwell for minority voices to be heard, not overwhelmed with the tyranny \nof the majority which can happen.\n  So there is a value to the existence of the Senate, and we are slower \nto act. It can be frustrating, as my colleague and Presiding Officer \nhas come to appreciate, and as a former Speaker of his own State \nlegislative body, I know he appreciates how difficult that can be as a \nleader in trying to move business and product along so that matters can \nbe considered.\n  So I say all of that as a backdrop because in recent years, recent \nmonths, in fact, we have been bogged down, frustrated. There has been a \nlot of obstructionism that has gone on to prohibit us to move forward \non important matters. But at least in this case, up to now at this \npoint anyway, we have conducted this debate on financial reform in a \nway that I think our forbearers would have appreciated.\n  Members have had ample opportunity. The rules are still there for \nthem to use to make sure they can be\n\n[[Page S3775]]\n\nheard in these matters. But, again, I emphasis that while the subject \nmatter of our consideration certainly is tremendously important, the \nmeans and the manner by which we have conducted debate also has value.\n  It is with that backdrop that I want to again thank my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans. I thank majority leader Harry Reid because \nwithout his insistence as the leader, this could not happen. I think \nthe fact that he has demonstrated as a leader the ability to move this \ninstitution in a way that allows for equal participation and debate is \na great tribute to the leadership he has demonstrated as majority \nleader of the Senate over many years now.\n  This morning I would like to concentrate, if I could, on one subject \nmatter, as I mentioned, that will probably come up in the next few days \nwhen we reconvene at the first part of next week. That has to do with a \nvery important part of this bill, one in which the Presiding Officer \nhas demonstrated great interest, and I have a tremendous amount of \ninterest in as well.\n  It deals with the issue of establishing, for the first time in our \nNation's history, an actual bureau, a division, that is designed \nspecifically to protect individual consumers from what can happen to \nthem when financial matters put them in a desperate condition, whether \nit be on credit cards, home sales, all sorts of other financial \nactivities. There has been no place that actually consumers' interests \nare paramount.\n  There are seven agencies in the Federal Government that have \ndivisions that deal with consumer protection. But the history has been \none of either malfeasance, inaction, uninterest or lack of interest. \nWhat we are creating is a place where the dominant principal, sole \ninterest will be to watch for consumer interests.\n  One of the debates we are going to have is whether a major area of \nfinancial interest will be exempted from the consideration of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, and that is in the area of \nfinancing an automobile.\n  I know this has been one of the most heavily lobbied parts of the \nwhole Wall Street reform bill. I certainly understand that many of us \nknow our auto dealers back home make important contributions to our \ncommunities. I said in my remarks the other day, I have worked very \nclosely with the car dealers of my State over recent past years and \nmonths.\n  We have had major debates about the automobile industry and the \nrights of auto dealers, the cash for clunkers bill, to try to increase \nsales, which is something I was deeply involved in to try to make it \npossible for our automobile dealers and manufacturers to get back on \ntheir feet.\n  So I take a back seat to no one in my concern and care about the work \nthey do, the economic vitality they provide for our community, the jobs \nthat get created as a result of their efforts. My debate and argument \nis not with the auto dealers; it is over the financing of automobiles \nand how that occurs, and whether consumers are going to be protected in \nwhat for most Americans is the second largest purchase any of us ever \nmake.\n  Our home, if we have one, is the most important. Then, secondly, is \nthe purchase of an automobile. Most Americans, other than having a \n401(k) for retirement, do not deal with the stockbrokers every day, are \nnot buying or trading or engaging in sophisticated financial \ninstruments. That is limited to a few of the 300 million in our \npopulation.\n  But you only need to get up in the morning and head off to work, and \nyou know that everybody needs an automobile--one might argue maybe too \nmany. But, nonetheless, that is a separate debate. So that purchase of \nan automobile is critically important to people. It is a critical part \nof our economy.\n  But it is over the financing of automobiles, in certain areas, that I \nhave great concern and do not want to see consumers disadvantaged. So \nit is in that spirit that my support and admiration for people who work \nin that sector of our economy, to say to you today that those \nresponsible corporate citizens, small businesses, have nothing to fear \nfrom this legislation whatsoever.\n  They conduct their business admirably, ethically, morally. They treat \ntheir customers as if they were members of their family. That is the \noverwhelming majority of people who engage in the sale of automobiles. \nBut like all statutes and laws, they are not designed necessarily for \nthe majority of people who operate within the law and act and operate \nethically and morally.\n  We also understand there are those who take advantage of people, and \nso we craft legislation to protect all of us against those abuses that \ncan occur. As President Obama said on April 22:\n\n       Unless your business model depends on bilking people, there \n     is little to fear with this legislation at all.\n\n  In fact, there is nothing to fear. In a challenge to this Congress, \nMichael Hayden, from the Military Officers Association of America, said \nto us the following:\n\n       You have an opportunity to do something about unscrupulous \n     auto dealers. The above-board firms should not have a problem \n     with the Consumer Financial Product Protection Bureau.\n\n  They should not, and let me explain why briefly this morning. First, \nthe Wall Street reform legislation as being considered by the Senate \nhas gone more than halfway to meet the concerns originally raised by \nfinancing of automobiles. The bill, and let me enumerate, eliminates \nassessments on the auto dealers. Unlike other financial \ninstitutions, there are no assessments on auto dealers.\n\n  The Brownback amendment would prohibit assessments. The underlying \nbill already does that. There is no reason for that provision in the \namendment of my colleague from Kansas. The bill further eliminates the \nauthority of the bureau of financial protection to examine and enforce \nnew rules on auto dealers.\n  State authorities and the Federal Trade Commission will continue as \nthey have to perform this role. Thirdly, as a result of our bill, the \nonly impact the consumer bureau will have on auto dealers is through \nrule writing. It is crucial that auto dealers, in the financing of \nautos, play by the same rules as their competitors do in communities \nall across our country.\n  One has to ask: What could be more reasonable than that? There are a \nvariety of places people can go to finance an automobile. You can go to \na credit union; you can go to your community bank. There may be other \nmeans by which you can finance. Why should we disadvantage those \ninstitutions in a community at the expense of one other who is seeking \nexemption from these rules?\n  That brings me to the second point. The legislation we have written \ncreates a level playing field among auto dealers, community banks, \ncredit unions, and others. This will empower consumers to shop \neffectively for the best financing available as they see it. They ought \nto have that opportunity, not fearing that if they go to one financial \nservice provider or another, the rules apply in one case and do not in \nanother. That disadvantages all consumers in this country who want to \nbe able to shop effectively.\n  How many times have we seen that ad: When providers of financial \nservices have to compete, consumers win? If they have to compete on a \nlevel playing field, then we are going to make it possible for people \nto get the best value that is available to them.\n  Consumers should be treated the same regardless of whether they get a \nloan from an auto dealer, a credit union, a community bank, or anyone \nelse for that matter who is engaged in the financial products and \nservice industry.\n  Community banks and credit unions should not be forced to live under \nmore stringent rules for making auto loans than do auto dealers. Just \nimagine, in small communities, where on the same street you might have \na community bank, a credit union, and an automobile dealer that is \nfinancing automobiles.\n  Why should there be a disparity in terms of the protections consumers \nget depending upon which door they walk through on that Main Street: \nwalk into the credit union, walk into the community bank, or walk into \nthe auto dealer who is financing. Why should that last place be treated \ndifferently than the other two when it comes to financing?\n  That is at the heart of what our bill is trying to do. That is what \nmakes it especially important that car salesmen follow the same rules \nand provide customers with clear, transparent, easy-\n\n[[Page S3776]]\n\nto-understand information, so those consumers, those who are also our \nneighbors, are empowered to make smart financial choices for themselves \nand their families without having to worry about hidden markups that \ncan cost them hundreds of dollars over the course of paying off a loan.\n  Let me emphasize again what I said at the outset. The overwhelming \nmajority of auto dealers play by the rules. Again, I am not talking \nabout the vast majority that do this but the unscrupulous ones, those \nwho engage in ripping off people and are doing everything they can to \nget away with it.\n  That is what the legislation is designed to deal with. This is the \nway the marketplace is supposed to work, where people can shop fairly, \nknowing the rules apply to everyone equally, and there is competition \nto provide higher quality products and services and better prices.\n  A strong consumer bureau will be good for responsible auto dealers as \nwell. If the Brownback amendment wins, Wall Street wins, and those \nresponsible dealers will lose. Let me explain why this is true.\n  If auto dealers are carved out of this bill, as the Brownback \namendment would do, it means we are essentially exempting Wall Street-\nfunded auto dealers and putting credit unions and community banks at a \ndisadvantage. It means Wall Street will continue to incentivize auto \ndealers to offer bad, overpriced loans that make it impossible for \nresponsible dealers to compete. We have seen this time and time again \nin every market. The bad money pushes out the good money. The \nresponsible players who play by the rules are undercut by the sharp \ndealers who cut corners.\n  Furthermore, a strong consumer bureau will restore America's faith in \nauto dealers and the loans they make. Responsible auto dealers ought to \nwelcome this. What happens when we have this kind of uneven playing \nfield? Unfortunately, we have seen many cases where people, \nparticularly those serving in the military, have been the victims of \nshady auto dealers' financing practices. Let me share some of the many \nstories I have heard, and I know my colleagues have as well.\n  A recent news story describes five young men and women in uniform at \nFort Riley, KS who were conned into paying for phantom options on \nvehicles they bought from a local auto dealer. In other words, they \nwere charged for options on their cars they never received. According \nto their lawyer, despite having decent credit scores, these young men \nand women in uniform were ending up paying interest on their car loans \naveraging almost 18 percent.\n  Yesterday I told a story that appeared in the New York Times of \nMatthew Garcia, a 25-year-old Army specialist who was recently \nsubjected to a trick called ``yo-yo financing'' by an unscrupulous car \ndealer, just as he was preparing to deploy to Afghanistan. Specialist \nGarcia, stationed at Fort Hood, TX, bought an automobile at a used car \nlot and signed up for a loan at 19.9 percent interest rate. That is not \neven the biggest abuse, however, believe it or not. The problem came \nwhen he drove the car home. The auto dealer called him up several days \nlater to say the financing contract had actually fallen through and \ndemanded an additional $2,500 in cash. To make sure he paid up, the \ndealer blocked the soldier's car so he could not leave.\n  In North Carolina, SGT Diann Traina, who works in military \nintelligence/psychology, purchased a used BMW from a dealership near \nFort Bragg. The dealer who sold Sergeant Traina the car never provided \nher with the registration and, in fact, did not have title to the car. \nSergeant Traina got to drive the BMW for 1 week before she was deployed \nto Iraq. Then it was repossessed. Through no fault of her own, she now \nhas a repossession on her credit rating, her credit. In addition, the \nlender insists she has to pay $10,800 that is still owed on the car. \nShe is married. She and her spouse have been without the use of a \nvehicle for a long time but are still being pressured to pay for it. \nSergeant Traina later learned that the dealer where she brought her \nautomobile had sold numerous cars to military personnel, even though it \ndidn't own them. The North Carolina Attorney General eventually sued \nthe dealership, and it has subsequently gone out of business.\n  This story is a classic example of predatory auto lending, where the \ndealer is clearly culpable and the military member had no way of \nknowing in advance that the dealer was selling automobiles and \noriginating loans for vehicles it did not own. This type of practice is \nactually fairly common among unscrupulous auto dealers who finance, \nparticularly, around military bases. Some go in and out of business \nrepeatedly, reopening under different names each time, leaving many \ncustomers in the lurch. Regrettably, this kind of abuse of lending to \nmembers of the military and their families is far too common.\n  Holly Petraeus, who directs a better business program for military \nfamilies, noted at a press conference yesterday that auto lending to \nthe military needs oversight, because:\n\n       Sadly, many of [those in the military] end up paying far \n     more for those cars than they should.\n\n  That is why The Military Coalition, a consortium of over 30 \nnationally prominent military and veterans organizations representing \nmore than 5.5 million current and former servicemembers and their \nfamilies, opposes the Brownback amendment. We talk all the time about \nprotecting and defending and standing up for our men and women in \nuniform, many of whom are in Iraq and Afghanistan in harm's way. Yet we \nare about to pass legislation that would exempt automobile financing \ndealers from the very people we try to protect. I am not making up \nthese quotes and these numbers. When we have that many organizations \nexpressing their opposition to this amendment, Members ought to take \nnote. Again, I emphasize--I know my language here is talking about auto \ndealers in a generic way. I emphasize over and over, the overwhelming \nmajority do a good job, a fair job, an ethical and moral job, but they \nwould tell us themselves how they can be disadvantaged by those \nunscrupulous dealers who take advantage, particularly of the young men \nand women in the military.\n  The coalition includes such groups as the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nthe National Guard Association, Military Officers Association, the \nMilitary Order of the Purple Heart, and many others which oppose the \nBrownback amendment. I am taking advantage of this time today to tell \nmy colleagues, please pay attention to this. I know we care about our \nauto dealers. I know they have been lobbying heavily. But they should \nnot receive an exemption in the financing area that can put so many \npeople at a disadvantage.\n  The coalition, in fact, sent me a letter. I wish to read a little \nfrom the letter. I quote:\n\n       The most significant financial obligation for the majority \n     of servicemembers is auto financing. Including the auto \n     dealer financing . . . in the financial reform bill will \n     provide greater protections for our servicemembers and their \n     families.\n\n  The letter goes on:\n\n       Providing a carve-out for auto dealers does just the \n     opposite--it will allow unscrupulous dealers to continue to \n     take advantage of servicemembers and their families.\n\n  Clifford Stanley, Under Secretary of Defense, said in a letter to the \nassistant Secretary of the Treasury Michael Barr that the Department of \nDefense ``would welcome and encourage the [Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau] protections provided to Servicemembers and their \nfamilies with regard to unscrupulous automobile . . . financing \npractice.''\n  Secretary Stanley cites the ``bait and switch'' financing, \nfalsification of loan applications, failure to pay off liens on trade-\nin vehicles, ``packing'' loans with items whose price bears little if \nany relationship to the real cost, and discriminatory lending as the \nkinds of problems members of our Armed Forces and their families face \nwhen dealing with financing their automobiles with car dealers. In \nfact, Secretary Stanley reports that 72 percent of counselors and \nattorneys surveyed have cited problems with auto dealer abuses in the \npast 6 months alone.\n  This is not my list of abuses. This is the Under Secretary of Defense \nin a letter.\n  Two days ago Senator Jack Reed and Senator Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts offered an amendment to create an office of military \nliaison within the consumer protection bureau. That amendment carried \n98 to 1. Only one colleague voted against providing an office within \nthe Consumer Financial\n\n[[Page S3777]]\n\nProtection Bureau with the kind of protections the Secretary of Defense \nis talking about in his letter.\n  The amendment carried by a vote of 98 to 1 because Members recognize \nthat our service men and women deserve protection from these shady \nfinancial service providers, including, of course, the major abuser, \nthe very group that our colleague from Kansas wants to exempt from this \nlegislation.\n  A crucial part of providing this protection is coverage of auto \ndealers. Yesterday I received a letter from the Secretary of the Army \nJohn McHugh. Secretary McHugh makes the point that auto dealers are \noften ``the most significant financial obligations of our soldiers--\nparticularly within the junior enlisted grades . . . ''\n  If we carve out auto dealers--the businesses that make the loans that \nare ``the most significant financial obligations of our soldiers,'' in \nthe words of the Secretary of the Army--why did we vote to create the \nmilitary liaison office in the first place?\n  If we pass the Brownback amendment and carve it out of our \nlegislation, we will have gutted the very office of military liaison \nbefore it even gets off the ground.\n  Yesterday the Senator from Kansas made the point that we ought to \nregulate the people who are making the loans, not simply the people who \nare processing the paperwork. I agree. By that standard, we should \ndefeat the Brownback amendment because, in fact, the auto dealers are \nthe legal lenders. It isn't the financing company. The legal lender is \nthe automobile dealer who engages in financing of automobiles. Auto \ndealers finance cars in much the same way mortgage brokers and bankers \nfinance mortgages. They shop among a number of wholesale lenders, often \non Wall Street, and they steer buyers into higher interest rates than \nthose borrowers would otherwise qualify for. In exchange, the auto \ndealers who get this kind of financing get the equivalent of a yield \nspread premium or a backend payment. The higher the interest rate they \ncan get the borrower to agree to, particularly service men and women, \nthe higher the payment the auto dealer receives from the Wall Street \nfinancing firm.\n  The incentive is to get the customer to pay as much as possible. That \nis the way they get rewarded financially. This is not the way the \nmarket should work, whether it is for a young soldier, a first \nresponder, or a single mother working hard to raise her family.\n  Let me read the court testimony of a former auto dealer finance and \ninsurance manager from Tennessee about how the process works. Again, \nthis is a former auto dealer finance and insurance manager in court \ntestimony. I am quoting:\n\n       The standard industry practice is to prepare financing \n     documents so that the customer is not alerted in any manner \n     that the person with whom he is dealing has the ability to \n     control the customer's price of credit.\n\n  Let me explain that. The dealer ``has the ability to control the \ncustomer's price of credit.''\n  He continues:\n\n       This allows the finance arranger to present himself as the \n     ally of the customer, which further relaxes and disarms the \n     customer. . . . The nature of the transaction creates the \n     perfect opportunity for a dealer to obtain a large kickback \n     from an unsuspecting customer by subjectively inflating the \n     interest rates.\n\n  What better evidence could we have than someone in court testimony \nengaged in the very business telling us exactly how it operates? Again, \nthe Brownback amendment would basically exempt that person from the \nrules of consumer financial bureau. What does this remind us of? It \nreminds me exactly of the mortgage broker I described a few days ago, \nwho is taught and encouraged in training sessions to convince the \nborrower that he is their financial adviser while profiting from \nsteering the customer into the more expensive loans.\n  Let me go back and read the quote from the witness, the former auto \ndealer finance manager:\n\n       This allows the finance arranger to present himself as the \n     ally of the customer. . . .\n\n  Tell me what difference there is between that and the unscrupulous \nbroker who tries to convince a borrower that ``I am your financial \nadviser''? It is exactly the same kind of abuse. So the mortgage \nbroker, without any regulations, gets away with it. If we adopt this \namendment, it will allow the automobile finance dealer to get away with \nit as well. We ought not to allow that to happen in this legislation.\n  Moreover, there is a history of discrimination in auto dealer \nfinancing. For example, African-American borrowers were charged more \nthan 2.5 times the amount in subjective rate markups compared to \nmajority White populations, after controlling for creditworthiness. And \nsimilar disparities were found for Hispanics. These abuses have been \ncurbed temporarily as a result of a series of court orders and consent \ndecrees. However, these consent decrees expire, and they will shortly.\n  Finally, the Brownback amendment is simply unworkable and would \ncreate a duplicative bureaucracy. The amendment leaves rule writing \nunder the Truth in Lending Act with the Federal Reserve for auto \ndealers loans only. All other Truth in Lending Act rules will be \nwritten by the consumer bureau. That means the Fed will have to \nmaintain a separate bureaucracy to write rules for this one sector of \nthe lending industry--not the legal, responsible entity, the auto \ndealer--while the consumer bureau writes the Truth in Lending Act rules \nfor everyone else.\n  Frankly, that makes no sense whatsoever. One of the things we are \ntrying to do is to get rid of unnecessary burdensome paperwork and \nduplication.\n  Several weeks ago, when the debate on this Wall Street reform bill \nfirst started, I told my colleagues about the Luntz memo, which lays \nout a strategy for attacking real Wall Street reform. Well, let me read \nto my colleagues one thing from the Luntz memo I happen to agree with, \nand it is the following--I quote from the memo:\n\n       The public is angriest about lobbyist loopholes. Part of \n     the perception that Washington cannot do anything right is \n     the belief that lobbyists write most of the bills. The \n     American people are tired of add-ons, earmarks, and backroom \n     deals--but they are mad as hell at ``lobbyist loopholes.''\n\n  What is one of the loopholes that Mr. Luntz's memo refers to \nspecifically? Car dealers--the very lobbyist loophole the Brownback \namendment would create. The memo, in fact, warns specifically about \nthis amendment we may be asked to vote on because it has been so \nheavily lobbied by those who would take advantage, unfortunately, of \npeople.\n  Finally, I would like to read to my colleagues a statement on this \namendment that the White House released yesterday from the President of \nthe United States. The President says:\n\n       Throughout the debate on Wall Street reform, I have urged \n     members of the Senate to fight the efforts of special \n     interests and their lobbyists to weaken consumer protections. \n     An amendment that the Senate will soon consider would do \n     exactly that, undermining strong consumer protections with a \n     special loophole for auto dealer-lenders. This amendment \n     would carve out a special exemption for these lenders that \n     would allow them to inflate rates, insert hidden fees into \n     the fine print of paperwork, and include expensive add-ons \n     that catch purchasers by surprise. This amendment guts \n     provisions that empower consumers with clear information that \n     allows them to make the financial decisions that work best \n     for them and simply encourages misleading sales tactics that \n     hurt American consumers. Unfortunately, countless families--\n     particularly military families--have been the target of these \n     deceptive practices.\n       Claims by opponents of reform that this legislation \n     unfairly targets auto dealers are simply mistaken. The fact \n     is, auto dealer-lenders make nearly 80 percent of the \n     automobile loans in our country, and these lenders should be \n     subject to the same standards as any local or community bank \n     that provides loans. Auto dealer-lenders offering transparent \n     and fair financing products to their customers should welcome \n     these reforms, which will make their competitors who don't \n     play by the rules compete on a level playing field.\n\n  The President concludes by saying:\n\n       We simply cannot let lobbyist-inspired loopholes and \n     special carve-outs weaken real reform that will empower \n     American families. I urge the Senate to continue to defeat \n     the efforts of special interests to weaken protections for \n     all American consumers.\n\n  I further note that while I have emphasized what happens among the \n5.5 million of our service men and women and how they are treated in \noverwhelming cases and that I do not recall another time the Department \nof Defense and military organizations have gotten involved in a debate \nsuch as this--normally, they get involved in debates involving the \narmed services of our Nation, national security issues,\n\n[[Page S3778]]\n\nbut the fact that they have gone out of their way to communicate to me \nand every other Member of this body about their concerns over the \nBrownback amendment ought to set off alarm bells to each and every one \nof us. Rare is it, indeed, when the Secretary of the Army or the \nSecretary of Defense or military associations, such as the Veterans of \nForeign Wars and others, write to Members of Congress about something \nsuch as this. Yet they feel so strongly about it that they are urging \nus not to succumb to the temptations of carving out this second most \nimportant financial arrangement that most Americans ever engage in: the \npurchase of the automobiles they need.\n  I would also point out that among the Better Business Bureau \nstatistics, the single largest number of complaints--and the number \nhovers around 70 percent nationwide--aside from the military side, come \nin the area of automobile dealer financing arrangements; that is, \nalmost 75 percent of all complaints are in this one area. What more \ninformation do you need to have about whether we ought to keep this \nsection of the bill intact to make sure they are not going to be exempt \nfrom these kinds of activities?\n  So when the amendment comes up, I will speak further about this. But \nI wished to remind my colleagues particularly of the information we are \nreceiving from our military organizations, from the military at the \nPentagon, and others about how important this issue is.\n  I noticed the other day there were votes in the other body to \nincrease the pay of our military men and women and I applaud that and \nagree with that. We have taken steps. Jim Webb, our colleague from \nVirginia, recently got passed a bill of rights for our veterans, which \nwe all applauded and supported.\n  As I said, the other day Jack Reed and Scott Brown of Massachusetts, \nby a vote of 98 to 1, got passed an amendment that creates within this \nbureau the only special section of this bureau designated to protect a \nclass of our citizenry--one designed to protect our men and women in \nuniform. It is the only one. We do not have a section for the elderly \nor for students or for anyone else. The only class we protected by a \nvote of 98 to 1 is our military.\n  For, particularly, our junior age military, they do not own homes \nyet. They are too young. They are 18-, 19-, 20-, 21-year-olds. Their \nlargest purchase is in the automobile area. What an irony it would be \nto have adopted an amendment to create a special division within the \nconsumer protection area to protect our men and women in uniform--we \nare told by the Defense Department the single largest area of abuse of \nthese young men and women is in automobile financing--and yet we are \nabout, next week, to exempt it from this bill.\n  I cannot believe that will happen. I am hopeful my colleagues, as \nmuch as we respect our friend from Kansas--and I do. Senator Brownback \nand I are very good friends. We work together. In fact, on several \nprovisions of the bill, he and I support the same ideas. But on this \none, I passionately disagree with what he is trying to do. I think it \nis a carve-out. It is a loophole.\n  There are 1,000 lobbyists in this town doing everything they can to \ngut one provision after another in this bill. Millions of dollars are \nbeing paid for them to walk the halls of these buildings to do \neverything they can to gut this kind of legislation. What a tragedy it \nwould be that on the cusp of adopting this legislation, for the first \ntime establishing a national Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in \nour Nation, that we would carve out an area that affects the very young \npeople who are sitting in harm's way in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nelsewhere around the world. My hope is we would not let that happen.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this is not a unanimous consent request I am \nmaking, but just based on the conversations we have had between the \nmajority and the minority in preparation for votes next week--I know \nMembers will be interested about possible votes--there will be votes, \nwe are hoping and planning, on Monday evening, I think it is fair to \nsay, at sometime around 5:30 p.m.\n  At least the amendments I think we can have some votes on Monday \nevening involve the amendment of Senator Udall of Colorado, dealing \nwith credit scores; the amendment of Senator Cornyn of Texas, dealing \nwith the International Monetary Fund, the IMF; the amendment of Senator \nRockefeller and Senator Hutchison, dealing with the Federal Trade \nCommission; the amendment of Senator Bond, Senator Warner, and myself, \ndealing with angel investors as well.\n  Those are four amendments we may have recorded votes on. Some may be \nvoice votes, but those are four we think we can have votes on, on \nMonday evening. So we are planning to have votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/14/senate-section/article/S3778-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \nour wounded warriors. This week at the Olympic Training Center in \nColorado Springs, more than 200 wounded warriors from every branch of \nthe military are competing in the inaugural Warrior Games. This event \nis the brainchild of Brigadier General Cheek, with whom I spent the day \nat Fort Carson last week visiting the Warrior Transition Unit there.\n  These soldiers do so much in defense of our country, yet we are not \noften in a position to cheer their performance. This week, we can. \nAlthough I am not able to be in Colorado to cheer them myself, I wanted \nto cheer them on here, from the Senate floor.\n  These games are a partnership between the Department of Defense, the \nU.S. Paralympics, and other organizations that are working together to \ngive our wounded warriors an opportunity to push themselves, set goals, \nand demonstrate their abilities. The Army sent 100 competitors--chosen \nout of a pool of almost 9,000 wounded warriors--the Marine Corps sent \n50, the Air Force 25, and the Navy and Coast Guard 25 combined. These \nmilitary members and veterans have physical injuries as well as mental \nwounds of war, and they are competing in swimming, cycling, wheelchair \nbasketball, archery, track, and sitting volleyball, among other events.\n  This week's Warrior Games is about the abilities of these warriors, \nnot their disabilities. And it is about goal-setting, which can \nexpedite the recovery process.\n  This mindset is important for all our wounded warriors, not just \nthose competing in the Games this week. General Cheek has said that \n``While we've made enormous progress in all the military services in \nour warrior care . . . it's not enough. . . . What we have to do with \nour servicemembers is inspire them to reach for and achieve a rich and \nproductive future, to defeat their illness or injury to maximize their \nabilities and know that they can have a rich and fulfilling life beyond \nwhat has happened to them in service to their nation.''\n  I agree with General Cheek and believe that today the Army is working \nhard to help our wounded warriors in their difficult transition back to \nservice or to life in the civilian world. But the Army acknowledges \nthat it has faced some serious challenges when it comes to caring for \nour injured troops, especially those who have experienced brain \ninjuries and psychological wounds. While I have seen real improvements \nin the quality of care, I also know that many of those same challenges \nstill exist.\n  After my visit to the Warrior Transition Unit at Fort Carson last \nweek, I am especially concerned about reports of overmedication and \nsubstance abuse among injured service members and\n\n[[Page S3779]]\n\nabout delays in the disability evaluation process. I spent a few hours \ntalking with separate groups of WTU soldiers, cadre, and clinicians in \nvery frank discussions about their experiences and concerns. I heard \npositive stories too--of men and women facing life-changing injuries \nwho said they couldn't have gotten back to active duty without the help \nof the WTU.\n  Our young men and women have a heavy burden--they are fighting two \nwars, often serving multiple tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. We \nowe them the best care possible when they are injured, and I know the \nArmy--from General Casey to the youngest privates who are watching out \nfor their team mates--are working hard to provide this care.\n  This will be especially important now at Fort Carson as the 4th \nBrigade Combat Team, 4th ID begins to come home. A few hundred of the \nbrigade's 3800 soldiers have returned so far, with another few hundred \ndue home today and more due home in the coming weeks. These soldiers \nhave been in Afghanistan for the last year, assisting the Afghan \nNational Army with security, governance and peacekeeping operations in \nKunar province, on the Pakistani border.\n  The need to provide resiliency training and specialized care for our \nsoldiers continues before, during, and after deployments. Fort Carson's \nMobile Behavioral Health Teams have already identified about 920 \nsoldiers of the 4th BCT--approximately one-quarter of the brigade--as \nhaving risk factors for depression or anxiety, exacerbated by their \nsustained combat, who will receive additional evaluations after \nreturning home. About 100 of the Brigade's soldiers are expected to \njoin Fort Carson's Warrior Transition Unit upon their return.

Mr. President, I rise today to address some very \nimportant concerns that arise in my mind in the evaluation of the new \nStrategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START, that was submitted yesterday to \nthe Senate for advice and consent to ratification. I do not believe \nthat the Senate must ratify this treaty, as some of my colleagues \nsuggest. But, rather, I begin with the proposition that a new treaty \nwith Russia is not essential for our national security; may well be a \ndistraction from addressing the real threats of nuclear proliferation \nby other nations and nuclear terrorism; and to the extent the President \nputs forth this treaty as a step toward his idea of a world without \nnuclear weapons, it is a naive and potentially risky strategic \napproach.\n  Basically, the purpose of arms control is to reduce the risk of war \nby enhancing strategic stability and security and, if possible, lessen \nthe costs of preparing for war. It is clear that the strategic balance \nbetween the United States and Russia is, for the most part, stable, \nwhile U.S. and Russian nuclear arsenals are already on a downward \nslope.\n  Both sides had made a commitment, under the 2002 Moscow Treaty, to \nreduce deployed nuclear weapons to a range between 2,200 and 1,700 \nwarheads, which was a significant reduction from the START I level of \n6,000 warheads. Furthermore, the United States has no plans to increase \nthe size of its nuclear force, and it appears to most informed \nobservers that Russia, for economic reasons, was headed to even lower \nlevels. Quite simply, there is no responsible prospect of an expanding \nnuclear weapons competition between our two nations. The United States \nand Russian nuclear arsenals are not the real problem today. \nRegrettably, the one category of nuclear weapons in which there is a \ntrue imbalance--tactical nuclear weapons--is not addressed by the new \ntreaty.\n  I would agree with my colleagues, such as Senator Dick Lugar, that \nthe verification provisions under START I should not have been allowed \nto expire with the treaty on December 5, but this could have been dealt \nwith through a simple 5-year extension as permitted by the START I \ntreaty. Instead, the administration was committed to a more ambitious \napproach which it has found to be more challenging than expected, which \nin turn has led to more U.S. concessions.\n  The President wanted to take a significant, tangible step toward his \nvision of a more peaceful world without nuclear weapons--a vision I \nfind naive at best and, if achieved, likely to make the world less \nsafe. As nuclear strategist and Nobel laureate Thomas Schelling has \nrecently observed, a world without nuclear weapons would be one in \nwhich countries would make plans to rearm in order to preempt other \ncountries from going nuclear first. Schelling writes: ``Every crisis \nwould be a nuclear crisis. The urge to preempt would dominate; whoever \ngets the first few weapons will coerce or preempt. It would be a \nnervous world.''\n  So far, at least, nuclear weapons have imposed restraint on world \npowers--what will happen to that restraint in the absence of nuclear \nweapons? What conclusions will the Russians and our allies draw from \nthis vision of nuclear disarmament? Will our allies and partners, who \nhave come to depend on U.S. nuclear security guarantees, pursue their \nown nuclear arms? Will Russia, which is increasing its dependence on \nnuclear weapons, interpret this as a sign of weakness and perhaps \npursue a more muscular foreign policy directed against the west?\n  Additionally, if we draw our weapon numbers too low, the perverse \nresult may be that smaller nations, or rogue states may believe they \ncould become peer competitors.\n  In addition to the dream of nuclear disarmament, the administration's \ncase for the new treaty rests on three\n\n[[Page S3780]]\n\nprincipal arguments: No. 1, that it will improve U.S. and international \nsecurity by reducing U.S. and Russian strategic nuclear forces; No. 2, \nthat it will transform or ``reset'' relations with Russia, such that \nRussia will now become a partner with the United States in addressing \nthe true nuclear dangers of proliferation and terrorism; and No. 3, \nthat it will provide the United States the moral credibility and \nleadership needed to pursue its nonproliferation objectives with the \nrest of the world.\n  First, the current declining stockpile of U.S. and Russian nuclear \nweapons is not a factor contributing to international instability, and \nreducing our current nuclear arsenal to the new START limit of 1,550 \nwarheads will not have any impact on the nuclear or nonproliferation \npolicies of the rest of the world. If reducing U.S. deployed nuclear \nforces from Cold War highs of over 10,000 nuclear warheads to the \ncurrent level of some 2,000 has had no impact, why should the reduction \nof another 500 warheads make a difference?\n  States decide whether to acquire nuclear capabilities not because the \nUnited States and Russia have large nuclear arsenals but because those \nstates believe nuclear weapons will enhance their national security, \npreserve their regimes, enhance their prestige, or further their \nambitions. Likewise, states will determine whether to support U.S. \nnonproliferation efforts on the basis of their national interests, not \non how low Russian and American nuclear stockpiles go.\n  As to the claim that a new START treaty with the Russians will \nimprove relations or secure Russia's assistance in addressing other \nthreats to international stability, there is little evidence to suggest \nthis is the case. To the contrary, these negotiations have provided the \nRussians leverage over missile defense, prompt global strike, and \nverification issues that have marred the final agreement.\n  Finally, I don't see any significant cooperation from Russia in \nsecuring meaningful sanctions against Iran. To be sure, if we had any \nexpectation that the new START treaty would secure Russian assistance \nin dealing with Iran, we should have drawn a more explicit linkage \nbetween the two. In other words: no new START treaty without concrete \nRussian assistance in obtaining a United Nations Security Council \nresolution imposing real, crippling sanctions on Iran. This may have \nbeen a missed opportunity.\n  Thus far, my remarks suggest I don't see decisive reasons to vote for \nthe new START treaty--but are there reasons to vote against the treaty? \nThe ratification process can help us examine several concerns.\n  As I evaluate the treaty, I will take a broad view that examines not \nonly the implications for U.S. strategic nuclear forces but how this \ntreaty impacts our relationship with allies and other military \ncapabilities important to our national security. I will want to know \nwhether this treaty disadvantages the United States in any way or makes \nus less safe or constrains our ability to extend nuclear security \nguarantees to our allies.\n  Finally, my decision whether to support this treaty will depend on \nthe administration's firm commitment to a serious nuclear modernization \neffort for our weapons, nuclear laboratories, and delivery systems--for \nas we go to lower numbers of nuclear weapons, it becomes increasingly \nimportant that those remaining weapons be safe, secure, and reliable.\n  The central consideration in evaluating this treaty is the impact the \nproposed numerical limitations will have on U.S. nuclear forces and in \nparticular our ability to extend the nuclear umbrella to our allies and \npartners.\n  The administration will have to provide additional details regarding \nthe number of ICBMs, SLBMs, and heavy bombers the United States will \nfield under the 700 strategic delivery system limitation--and how it \nplans to modernize those forces.\n  Last year, we were told by Admiral Mullen and General Cartwright that \nreductions below 800 delivery systems may be cause for some concern, \nwhile former Secretary James Schlesinger, in testifying on the new \nSTART treaty before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, recently \nnoted that the ``numbers specified are adequate, though barely so.''\n  We need to understand, therefore, the implications of this \nlimitation, which requires a reduction of about 180 in the number of \ncurrently deployed U.S. delivery systems. In fact, the reduction in \nnuclear capability will be larger for the United States since the \ntreaty requires that conventionally-armed--nonnuclear--ballistic \nmissiles, in the case of prompt global strike, be counted against the \n700 total.\n  Likewise, we need to understand how the Russians might configure \ntheir nuclear forces under the treaty and then conduct a net assessment \nto appreciate the true implications of the new START treaty for U.S. \nnational security.\n  Perhaps the greatest deficiency of the new START agreement is that it \ndoes not address the 10-to-1 disparity between Russia and the United \nStates in the area of tactical nuclear weapons. As Secretary \nSchlesinger recently testified, ``the significance of tactical nuclear \nweapons rises steadily as strategic nuclear arms are reduced.''\n  Russia simply refused to allow these into the negotiations. So the \nadministration has left this for the ``next agreement,'' though I am \nnot sure what leverage the United States will have over a Russia that \nhas become more, not less, dependent on its tactical nuclear weapons.\n  An irony of this is that Russian tactical nuclear weapons, because \nthey are more widely dispersed and greater in number, pose a greater \nrisk of contributing to nuclear proliferation and terrorism which, \naccording to the administration, this treaty is supposed to help us \navert.\n  The Strategic Posture Commission estimates Russia may have \napproximately 3,800 operational tactical nuclear warheads and that the \ncombination of new warhead designs and precision delivery systems \n``open up new possibilities for Russian efforts to threaten to use \nnuclear weapons to influence regional conflicts.''\n  Likewise, Under Secretary of Defense for Policy Michele Flournoy has \nobserved that the Russians are ``actually increasing their reliance on \nnuclear weapons and the role of nuclear weapons in their strategy.''\n  What if you are one of the 31 countries dependent on the United \nStates for nuclear security guarantees? How would you interpret the \nfact that the United States is going down to 1,550 strategic warheads \nwhile the Russians maintain at least twice that number of shorter range \nnuclear warheads that in most cases are able to reach your country? \nWhat impact will this have on the credibility of U.S. nuclear \nguarantees and upon the incentives other countries may have to acquire \ntheir own nuclear capabilities?\n  One final point on this issue: It disturbs me that Russian tactical \nnuclear weapons were not addressed in this treaty, yet the United \nStates conceded to Russian demands to place limits on conventional \nprompt global strike capabilities by counting conventional ICBMs under \nthe limits for delivery systems.\n  It is striking, moreover, that the preamble would be ``mindful of the \nimpact of conventionally armed ICBMs and SLBMs on strategic \nstability,'' yet be silent on the impact of tactical nuclear weapons on \nthis very same strategic stability. What is more destabilizing: \nconventionally armed ICBMs or thousands of tactical nuclear weapons?\n  Despite being told consistently from the very beginning of \nnegotiations that missile defense will be addressed only in the \npreamble of the treaty, we now discover that article V contains a \ndirect restriction on U.S. missile defense activities (i.e., cannot \nconvert ICBM or SLBM launchers into launchers for missile defense \ninterceptors). Will this establish a dangerous precedent with respect \nto including missile defense limitations in future offensive arms \ncontrol agreements? Why did the U.S. side feel it necessary to concede \nthis point?\n  What raises concern, with respect to article V, are other efforts by \nthe Russians to create a linkage between U.S. missile defense \nactivities and Russian adherence to the new START treaty. When viewed \ntogether, the treaty's preamble, the Russian unilateral statement on \nmissile defense, and remarks by senior Russian officials provide the \npotential for Russia to threaten or blackmail the United States against \nincreasing its missile defense capabilities by threatening to withdraw \nfrom the treaty:\n\n[[Page S3781]]\n\n  When the preamble states that ``current strategic defensive arms do \nnot undermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic \noffensive arms of the parties,'' does this not suggest that moving \nbeyond ``current'' systems could provide grounds for withdrawal?\n  When the Russian's note in their unilateral statement that the treaty \ncan operate and be viable only if the United States of America refrains \nfrom developing its missile defense capabilities quantitatively or \nqualitatively, and then links American missile defense capabilities to \nthe treaty's withdrawal clause, should we not read this as an attempt \nto exert political pressure to forestall continued development and \ndeployment of U.S. missile defenses?\n  Finally, what are we to make of Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov's \nwarning on March 28 that ``the treaty and all the obligations it \ncontains are valid only within the context of the levels which are now \npresent in the sphere of strategic defensive systems''? Does this mean \nthe Russians will pull out of START if we deploy additional ground-\nbased interceptors in Alaska or if we deploy the SM-3 block IIB missile \nin Europe?\n  Despite the administration's assurances that none of this is legally \nbinding, and that the U.S. unilateral statement counters this by \nexpressing our intent to continue to deploy missile defenses, I can not \nhelp but worry that these provisions will have a negative impact on \nU.S. decisionmaking with respect to missile defense. After all, the \nadministration did abandon plans to deploy ground-based interceptors in \nEurope--an action most believe was an irritant in United States-Russian \nrelations.\n  There is something fundamentally disturbing about entering into a \ntreaty with the Russians when we have such a divergence in view over a \nsubstantial issue like missile defense. To be sure, the Russian side \nhas already expressed displeasure with U.S. plans to deploy missile \ndefenses in Europe and to enhance the capability of the SM-3 missile to \nintercept long-range missiles launched from the Middle East.\n  Adding to my apprehension is recent testimony before the House Armed \nServices Committee by a senior Department of Defense official, who \nstated that the United States has not yet even approached the Russians \nto determine whether the SM-3 IIB is, will cause them to withdraw from \nthe treaty. They can withdraw for any reason.\n  This likely sets the stage for misunderstanding and confrontation as \nthe United States continues its missile defense activities, \nparticularly in Europe.\n  Clarifying this ambiguity, coupled with affirmation by the \nadministration that it intends to improve the defense of our homeland \nand go forward with all phases of its planned missile defense \ndeployments in Europe, is a prerequisite for ratification of the new \nSTART treaty.\n  Our ability to verify Russian compliance with the new agreement is \nalso important. One could even argue that as we go to lower levels of \nnuclear weapons, verification becomes more important, as the \nconsequences of cheating become more profound. But the standard should \nnot be whether we can verify Russian compliance with the terms of the \ntreaty per se--though this is important--but whether we maintain \nsufficient confidence in our national ability to monitor developments \nin Russian strategic forces that, if gone undetected, could alter the \nstrategic balance.\n  So when the administration argues that ``verification procedures in \nthis Treaty will be simpler and less costly to implement than the old \nSTART treaty,'' I am inclined to ask why verification procedures have \nbecome less stringent and whether such procedures make it harder for \nthe United States to fully account for Russian strategic forces. \nSpecifically:\n\n  Will we be able to determine whether the Russians are developing new, \nmore powerful missiles capable of carrying multiple warheads?\n  Are the Russians capable of secretly producing and storing missiles \nand warheads that could afford them a military advantage?\n  While we may have confidence in the number of missiles deployed by \nRussia today, can we maintain this confidence over the life of the \ntreaty?\n\n  Ultimately, it falls upon our intelligence community to monitor \nRussian strategic force developments. Thus it is important for the \nSenate, as part of its advice and consent responsibilities, to review \ncarefully the National Intelligence Estimate on our ability to \neffectively verify the treaty that normally accompanies arms control \nagreements. I don't believe we have seen that document yet.\n  I have identified just a few important issues the Senate will \nconsider as we move forward, and it is likely there will be others as \nwe continue to examine the treaty text, protocol, and annexes. \nParticularly troubling at this time is the disparity in tactical \nnuclear weapons which are not addressed in this treaty, and the \nconstraints on missile defense and conventional prompt global strike in \na treaty intended only to limit offensive nuclear weapons. At the very \nleast this is a bad precedent, and I have no doubt Russia is attempting \nto revive the ABM Treaty regime and forestall U.S. prompt global strike \ncapabilities.\n  This was a treaty that Russia needed more than the United States. Not \nonly were Russian strategic nuclear forces headed to lower numbers for \neconomic reasons, Russia wants an arms control agreement with the \nUnited States. Such a binational agreement validates its superpower \nstatus. The United States therefore had an opportunity to leverage \nRussian desire for an agreement to obtain Russian cooperation on a host \nof issues, starting with Iran. But the administration missed this \nopportunity because it was so anxious to advance its vision of a world \nwithout nuclear weapons that it failed to see how START could help \naddress the more immediate threat of nuclear proliferation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/14/senate-section/article/S3781-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3781-S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             TRIBUTE TO GENERAL VICTOR EUGENE RENUART, JR.\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to a \ngreat American who I have had the great pleasure of knowing and working \nwith for a number of years. General Victor Eugene Renuart, Jr., is \npreparing to retire from the U.S. Air Force after nearly 39 years of \ndistinguished military service, and it is fitting that we should honor \nhis achievements.\n  Through peacetime and multiple armed conflicts and operations, \nGeneral Renuart has embodied the core values of the Air Force: \nintegrity, service, and excellence. He courageously demonstrated his \ndedication to our Nation and served us honorably as a leader, warrior, \nand teacher. I want to also express our deepest thanks to his wife \nJill, and their sons Ryan and Andrew, for serving as the epitome of a \ndedicated military family. As you know, military families like the \nRenuarts are America's unsung heroes, and we owe them a tremendous \ndebt.\n  Gene Renuart enlisted in the Air Force while our Nation was still \nengaged in the Vietnam war and received his commission from the Officer \nTraining School in 1972. In the four decades since that day, he has \namassed nearly 4,000 flying hours in seven aircraft types and piloted \n69 combat missions in major operations. The call to service has led \nGene and his family all over the world, and he has commanded units at \nevery level through conflicts in Iraq, Bosnia, and Afghanistan. The \nlong list of awards and decorations that General Renuart has earned \nduring his career are a testament to his years of exemplary leadership \nand unrelenting focus on mission accomplishment.\n  As a lieutenant colonel during Operation DESERT STORM, General \nRenuart commanded the 76th Fighter Squadron ``Vanguards,'' who were \ntrusted with a mission critical to the safety of the entire region. \nThey hunted the Iraqi landscape in search of SCUD missile sites and \nprotected Coalition troops from attack. General Renuart's squadron flew \nhundreds of combat missions and fought at the famed ``Highway of \nDeath,'' leading to the liberation of Kuwait and defeat of the Iraqi \nRepublican Guard.\n  It was clear to everyone who knew him that Gene Renuart was a leader \nof the highest caliber, and he quickly rose through the ranks. On \nSeptember 11, 2001, then-Major General Renuart was serving as the \nDirector of Operations for United States Central Command, and his \nleadership and experience were instrumental as our nation rapidly\n\n[[Page S3782]]\n\ntransitioned from peace to war. General Renuart was soon providing \noperational orchestration for the invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq as \nour armed forces quickly eliminated those repressive regimes.\n  In March 2007, General Renuart was promoted to the rank of four-star \ngeneral and appointed Commander of the North American Aerospace Defense \nCommand and U.S. Northern Command. The general and his command were \ngiven the no-fail responsibility of protecting the United States and \nCanada against all threats in the air and on the seas, while leading \nthe Department of Defense's support of civil authorities to save lives \nduring both natural and manmade disasters.\n  With General Renuart's leadership, NORAD and USNORTHCOM widened its \nfocus to anticipate threats to the United States and respond where \nnecessary. The significant improvements of the unified national \nresponse to Hurricane Ike were born from the lessons learned from \nHurricane Katrina and were a direct result of General Renuart's \nemphasis on anticipating our Nation's needs in times of disaster.\n  For this effort and many others, General Renuart and his team \ncollaborated with over 120 mission partners representing Federal, \nState, and local governments, nongovernmental organizations, and \nprivate industry to quickly and responsibly execute key Department of \nDefense responsibilities in the National Response Framework.\n  He fostered synergy with the interagency community and collaborated \nwith the militaries of Mexico and Canada to ensure North America's \nsecurity. Whether expediting the transfer of helicopters and equipment \nto the Mexican military for counternarcotic operations or partnering \nwith our northern neighbors under the Canada-United States Civil \nAssistance Plan to support the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver, General \nRenuart set and achieved tremendous goals for theater security \ncooperation.\n  Working together to defend the homeland, NORAD and USNORTHCOM have \ndelivered unparalleled security for our Nation. Not only did NORAD \nachieve a huge milestone--surpassing 55,000 accident-free sorties flown \ndefending our homeland under Operation NOBLE EAGLE--but more \nimportantly, there has not been a single successful foreign terrorist \nattack on American soil. That success has been the result of the \nextraordinary diligence, cooperation, and dedication that have \nexemplified General Renuart's leadership.\n  On behalf of Congress and the United States of America, I thank \nGeneral Renuart, Jill, Ryan, and Andrew for their commitment, \nsacrifice, and contributions to this great Nation. I am also especially \npleased to say that General Renuart and Jill will be calling Colorado \nSprings home for many years to come. We Coloradans are honored to have \nthem as neighbors and friends. I congratulate him on a truly remarkable \ncareer and wish him nothing but the best as he transitions from decades \nof service into his truly well-earned retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/14/senate-section/article/S3782-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     REPORT ON THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY THAT WAS \n  ORIGINALLY DECLARED IN EXECUTIVE ORDER 13047 OF MAY 20, 1997, WITH \n                        RESPECT TO BURMA--PM 56\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nmultifamily transitional housing loan program of the Department of \nVeterans Affairs by requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nissue loans for the construction of, rehabilitation of, or acquisition \nof land for multifamily transitional housing projects instead of \nguaranteeing loans for such purposes, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that would \nimprove the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA, Multifamily \nTransitional Housing Loan program. This program, established in 1998 \nand supported with a $48 million appropriation in 1999, was intended to \nencourage additional development of transitional housing units for \nhomeless veterans. Despite the good intention, the program was viewed \nas too rigid by community providers who turned elsewhere for \nassistance. In fact, only one loan was ever guaranteed under the \nprogram until VA discontinued it 2 years ago. The legislation I am \nintroducing today would modify the program to give it the flexibility \nthat community providers say is needed. The bill is cost neutral, \nrelying only on money that Congress already has appropriated.\n  According to VA more than 107,000 veterans are homeless on any given \nnight, including an estimated 1,589 in my home state of North Carolina. \nMany veterans are considered homeless or at risk due to their poverty, \nlack of support systems, and poor living conditions.\n  Even though we have seen a decrease in the number of homeless \nveterans from previous years, there is still work to be done. Make no \nmistake; the goal is not only to end homelessness but provide \nsustainable solutions to prevent veterans from, again, falling through \nthe cracks. One area that will continue to play an important role in \nkeeping veterans off the streets is the provision of transitional \nhousing units coupled with onsite supportive services.\n  There are a number of VA programs that encourage the development of \ntransitional housing units for homeless veterans. One such program, as \nI previously mentioned, was established by Congress in 1998--the \nMultifamily Transitional Housing Loan Guarantee Program. It was \ndesigned to encourage lenders to make low-interest loans, backed by a \nVA guaranty, available to homeless providers for the acquisition, \nconstruction, and improvement of transitional housing units. One \nprovider, the St. Leo Campus for Veterans in Chicago, IL, operated by \nCatholic Charities, availed themselves of a VA-backed housing loan. \nHowever, St. Leo's experience is illustrative of why no other provider \nwas able to secure a\n\n[[Page S3784]]\n\nloan and why the program was ultimately discontinued.\n  The St. Leo Campus for Veterans provides 141 studio units, each \ncontaining its own kitchen and full bathroom, to formerly homeless \nveterans as well as supportive services to help them become self-\nsufficient. On the St. Leo Campus, VA operates a clinic to provide \noutpatient services. In order to get financing for the St. Leo Campus, \nCatholic Charities obtained funding from ten sources, to include the \nVA-backed loan, various state-supported tax credits, and other creative \nfunding sources.\n  Needless to say, the St. Leo Campus has been faced with numerous \noperational challenges that are typical of a provider servicing the \nhomeless population. What exacerbates the challenge is the rigidity of \nthe original VA loan program. Without flexibility in loan terms and \nconditions, St. Leo Campus struggles to make ends meet, bringing into \nquestion the sustainability of the project. To provide the necessary \nservices to homeless veterans, St. Leo Campus has relied on one-time \ngrants and donations which, in a difficult economy, are a highly \nvolatile source of revenue. Flexibility in the terms of its VA-loan, as \nmy bill would provide, would give St. Leo Campus and other homeless \nproviders a chance to weather some of these cyclical funding \nchallenges.\n  Recognizing the financing challenges many have in serving this unique \npopulation, my bill provides VA with the authority to issue loans under \nterms that are far more flexible than the original program. The \nlegislation tracks each of the recommendations made in a report to VA \nregarding how the Multi-Family Transitional Housing Loan Program could \nbe improved.\n  Specifically, the legislation would give VA greater flexibility in \nthe types of loans it may offer and the conditions attached to \nrepayment, including payment deferral, interest only payments, and debt \nforgiveness. It would give VA the authority to sell, lease, or operate \na multifamily transitional housing project in the event of default. It \nwould preempt any Federal, State, or local housing statute that limits \na project from offering preferential treatment to veterans. Lastly, it \nwould clarify that projects financed with a VA loan may include space \nfor job training programs, other types of residential units, or other \nuses that the Secretary determines necessary for the sustainability of \nthe multifamily transitional housing projects.\n  Transitional housing developed using VA-issued loans under my bill \nwould still come with a requirement that a provider make available \nsupportive services to reduce the likelihood of veterans again becoming \nhomeless. These would include health care services; daily living \nservices; personal financial planning; transportation services; income \nsupport services; fiduciary and representative payee services; legal \nservices; child care; housing counseling; and other services necessary \nfor maintaining independent living.\n  Finally, I again reiterate that this legislation calls for no new \nappropriation. It relies exclusively on $48 million appropriated, (but \nunspent), in 1999 to meet the administrative expenses and initial \nlending capital VA will require. As homeless providers make payments to \nextinguish any loan balance, VA will have the Opportunity to make \nadditional loans.\n  I am committed to doing all we can to end homelessness among \nveterans. But I am also committed to doing it in a way that is not \nduplicative and fully utilizes money the American people have already \nput forward. I ask my colleagues for their support of my bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3377\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 528\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') are a group of genetically determined \n     lysosomal storage diseases that render the human body \n     incapable of producing certain enzymes needed to break down \n     complex carbohydrates;\n       Whereas MPS diseases cause complex carbohydrates to be \n     stored in almost every cell in the body and progressively \n     cause cellular damage;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS--\n       (1) adversely affects the human body by damaging the heart, \n     respiratory system, bones, internal organs, and central \n     nervous system; and\n       (2) often results in mental retardation, short stature, \n     corneal damage, joint stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and \n     hearing impairment, heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic \n     respiratory problems, and, most importantly, a drastically \n     shortened life span;\n       Whereas symptoms of MPS are usually not apparent at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas research has resulted in the development of limited \n     treatments for some MPS diseases;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS diseases are underway as of the date of \n     agreement to this resolution;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of new remedies, the blood-\n     brain barrier continues to be\n\n[[Page S3786]]\n\n     a significant impediment to effectively treating the brain, \n     which prevents the treatment of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life of the individuals afflicted \n     with MPS, and the treatments available to those individuals, \n     will be enhanced through the development of early detection \n     techniques and early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS diseases;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS diseases extends to \n     individuals within the medical community;\n       Whereas the cellular damage that is caused by MPS makes MPS \n     a model for the study of many other degenerative genetic \n     diseases;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS diseases can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that has the ability--\n       (1) to raise public awareness about MPS; and\n       (2) to encourage and facilitate increased public and \n     private sector research for the early diagnosis and treatment \n     of MPS diseases: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2010, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/14/senate-section/article/S3786-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 529--CELEBRATING THE LIFE AND ACHIEVEMENTS OF LENA \n  MARY CALHOUN HORNE AND HONORING HER FOR HER TRIUMPHS AGAINST RACIAL \n                              DISCRIMINA-\n  TION AND HER STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS OF ALL PEOPLE\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself, Mr. Burris, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of \nOhio, Mr. Casey, Mr. Levin, Mr. Brownback, Mr. Menendez, Mr. Nelson of \nFlorida, Mr. Schumer, and Ms. Collins) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 529\n\n       Whereas Lena Mary Calhoun Horne was a trail-blazing \n     performing artist whose life exemplified her commitment to \n     social justice, peace, and civil rights;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne was born in Brooklyn, New York on June \n     30, 1917, and joined the chorus of the famed Cotton Club in \n     Harlem at the age of 16 and debuted on Broadway one year \n     later in the musical ``Dance With Your Gods'' (1934);\n       Whereas during the 1940s, Ms. Horne was one of the first \n     African American women to perform with a white band ensemble, \n     the first black performer to play the Copacabana nightclub, \n     and among the first African Americans to sign a long-term \n     Hollywood film studio contract, garnering her roles in a host \n     of films, including ``Thousands Cheer'' (1943), ``Broadway \n     Rhythm'' (1944), ``Two Girls and a Sailor'' (1944), and \n     ``Ziegfeld Follies'' (1946);\n       Whereas her rendition of the title song to the 1943 film \n     ``Stormy Weather'' became a major hit and among her signature \n     pieces, which also included ``Deed I Do'', ``As Long As I \n     Live'', and Cole Porter's ``Just One of Those Things'';\n       Whereas Ms. Horne recorded prolifically into the 1990s and \n     the record ``Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria'' became the \n     best-selling album by a female singer in RCA Victor's \n     history;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne earned four Grammy Awards during the \n     course of her career, including the Recording Academy's \n     Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People Image Award in 1999, \n     and a Kennedy Center Honor in 1984;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne appeared extensively on television, \n     including specials with Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, \n     numerous musical reviews and variety shows, and appearances \n     on programs like ``Sesame Street'' and ``The Cosby Show'';\n       Whereas she was nominated for her first Tony Award in 1957 \n     for her role in the musical ``Jamaica'', and her 1981 one-\n     woman Broadway show, ``Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music'', \n     earned her a Tony Award, a Grammy Award, and ran for more \n     than 300 performances;\n       Whereas despite Ms. Horne's pioneering contract with MGM \n     studios, she was never featured in a leading role during the \n     1940s and 50s because her films had to be reedited for \n     theaters in Southern States that proscribed films with black \n     performers;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne was outspoken in her fight for racial \n     equality;\n       Whereas during World War II, she used her own money to \n     travel and entertain the troops;\n       Whereas while Ms. Horne performed at Army camps for the \n     U.S.O., she became an outspoken critic of the treatment of \n     African American servicemen and refused to sing before \n     segregated audiences and at venues in which German Prisoners \n     of War were seated in front of black soldiers;\n       Whereas during the late 1940s, Ms. Horne sued a number of \n     restaurants and theaters for racial discrimination;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne was only two years old when her \n     grandmother, suffragette, and civil rights activist Cora \n     Calhoun enrolled her as a member of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People, and she was an \n     honorary member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and worked \n     for years with the Urban League;\n       Whereas she participated in numerous civil rights rallies \n     and demonstrations--marching with Medgar Evers in \n     Mississippi, performing at rallies throughout the Nation for \n     the National Council of Negro Women, and taking part in the \n     March on Washington in August 1963 at which the Rev.

Res. 531\n\n       Whereas infection with the hepatitis B and C viruses and \n     the incidence of liver disease\n\n[[Page S3787]]\n\n     and cancer caused by the hepatitis B and C viruses have \n     become urgent problems of global proportions;\n       Whereas an estimated 2,000,000,000 people worldwide have \n     been infected with the hepatitis B virus, and as many as \n     400,000,000 people worldwide live with chronic hepatitis B \n     infection;\n       Whereas an estimated 600,000 people worldwide die each year \n     due to a hepatitis B infection;\n       Whereas an estimated 170,000,000 people worldwide live with \n     chronic hepatitis C infection, and an estimated 3,500,000 \n     people are newly infected with hepatitis C each year;\n       Whereas an estimated 1,700,000 people worldwide die each \n     year due to liver failure or primary liver cancer from \n     chronic hepatitis C infection;\n       Whereas infection with the hepatitis B and C viruses is a \n     growing health crisis in the United States, and an estimated \n     5,300,000 people in the United States are chronically \n     infected with the hepatitis B or C virus;\n       Whereas each year in the United States, an estimated 43,000 \n     people are newly infected with the hepatitis B virus and \n     17,000 people are newly infected with the hepatitis C virus;\n       Whereas approximately 65 percent and 75 percent of the \n     people infected with hepatitis B and hepatitis C virus, \n     respectively, are unaware of the infection;\n       Whereas, because of the asymptomatic nature of the \n     hepatitis B and C viruses, a person who has become \n     chronically infected with 1 of the viruses may not have \n     symptoms for up to 40 years after the initial infection has \n     occurred;\n       Whereas many people are unaware that they have been \n     infected with the hepatitis B or C virus until years later, \n     when symptoms of liver cancer or liver disease develop;\n       Whereas, as a result of late diagnosis, approximately \n     15,000 people die each year from liver disease or liver \n     cancer related to chronic viral hepatitis;\n       Whereas hepatitis C claims roughly 12,000 lives each year \n     in the United States, and the overall rate of hepatitis C-\n     related deaths in the United States is expected to triple by \n     2019;\n       Whereas, in the United States, African-Americans, Asian \n     Americans, Pacific Islanders, Latinos, Native Americans, \n     Alaskan Natives, gay and bisexual men, and persons who inject \n     drugs have higher rates of chronic viral hepatitis infection;\n       Whereas 1/3 of HIV-positive people in the United States are \n     co-infected with the hepatitis C virus, and 1/10 of HIV-\n     positive people in the United States are co-infected with the \n     hepatitis B virus;\n       Whereas, although life expectancies for HIV-positive \n     persons have increased with therapy, liver disease, mostly \n     related to hepatitis B or C infections, has become the most \n     common non-AIDS-related cause of death among HIV-positive \n     persons;\n       Whereas chronic hepatitis B and C infections cost the \n     United States $16,000,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas, despite the fact that chronic viral hepatitis is \n     the most common blood-borne infection in the United States, \n     no routine or universal screening is in place for early \n     detection as of the date of the agreement to this resolution;\n       Whereas, in 2010, the Institute of Medicine issued a report \n     on chronic viral hepatitis, which attributed the lack of \n     knowledge and awareness among the public and health providers \n     of the United States of chronic viral hepatitis, the large \n     health disparities for people infected with chronic viral \n     hepatitis, and the current morbidity and mortality rate for \n     people infected with chronic viral hepatitis, to the lack of \n     dedicated resources for chronic viral hepatitis;\n       Whereas the first World Hepatitis Day on May 19, 2008, \n     raised awareness about the need for action, compassion, and \n     understanding about chronic viral hepatitis around the world; \n     and\n       Whereas the goals of World Hepatitis Day and National \n     Hepatitis Awareness Month are--\n       (1) to highlight the global nature of the chronic viral \n     hepatitis epidemic;\n       (2) to recognize the need for a comprehensive public \n     education and awareness campaign designed to help infected \n     patients and the physicians of patients to identify and \n     manage the secondary consequences of the disease; and\n       (3) to help increase the length and quality of life for \n     individuals diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B or C \n     infections: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Hepatitis Day \n     and National Hepatitis Awareness Month;\n       (2) promotes raising awareness of the risks and \n     consequences of undiagnosed chronic hepatitis B or hepatitis \n     C infections; and\n       (3) urges a robust governmental and public health response \n     to protect the health of the more than 5,000,000 people in \n     the United States and nearly 600,000,000 people worldwide who \n     suffer from chronic viral hepatitis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/14/senate-section/article/S3787-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4042.

Res. 539; and S. \nRes. 530.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolutions en bloc.\n\n\n                    National Search and Rescue Week\n\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a resolution \nto honor our Nation's search and rescue personnel by designating May 16 \nthrough May 22, 2010, as National Search and Rescue Week.\n  As many of my colleagues know, I am an avid hiker and mountaineer. \nOver the years, I have scaled several of Washington State's majestic \npeaks and hiked many of our backcountry trails. Whenever I load my pack \nfor another trip--whether for a day hike or a trip up Mt. Rainier--I, \nlike all people who enjoy the great outdoors, take steps to prepare \nmyself and minimize my risk. I bring my essential gear, extra food and \nwater, and make sure someone knows my trip plan. But no amount of \npreparation can protect you from a misstep or unforeseen circumstance.\n  In such instances, it is often the swift response of trained search \nand rescue personnel that makes the difference between tragedy and \nsurvival. These heroes come from a broad range of agencies and \norganizations, including sheriff offices, police departments, national \nand State parks, private corporations, and all branches of the \nmilitary, including the U.S. Coast Guard. All of them--whether \nvolunteer or salaried, military or civilian--exemplify courage, \ncommitment, and compassion in performing their duties.\n  Whether it is an accident in the wilderness or a natural disaster in \na major city, search and rescue personnel are always ready to respond. \nAll across our country, when people find themselves in danger, they can \nbe thankful for the bravery and willingness to serve exhibited by these \ndedicated individuals.\n  Every day, men, women, pack animals, and search dogs put themselves \nin harm's way to ensure the safety and security of citizens in need. \nTheir territory knows no bounds. Wherever the mission is, they go, \nsometimes for weeks at a time.\n  Search and rescue teams are relentless in their training. They go to \ngreat lengths to ensure they are physically and mentally fit and well \nversed in the newest search and rescue techniques. This preparation \nenables them to approach complex search and rescue situations with \nconfidence and skill.\n  Their selfless dedication does not stop at our Nation's borders. \nCivilian search and rescue teams are ready at a moment's notice to \nrespond to international disasters, too, including the recent \nearthquake in Haiti and the tsunami in Indonesia. By extending their \nreach around the globe to wherever there is need, search and rescue \npersonnel have saved lives, reunited families, and boosted America's \nreputation abroad.\n  In the simplest terms, search and rescue personnel take great \npersonal risks to come to the aid of others. Carrying out their mission \noften demands great personal discipline and sacrifice, and some even \npay the ultimate price. This selfless commitment to others is embodied \nin the Search and Rescue motto: ``So that others may live.''\n  I ask my colleagues to stand with me today to honor the members of \nthe search and rescue community across our Nation. Their dedication to \nsaving the lives of citizens who are lost or injured does not waver, \nand neither should we in adopting this small act of recognition for \ntheir heroic efforts.\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolutions \nbe agreed to en bloc, the preambles be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements \nrelated to the resolutions be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Res. 527\n\n       Whereas a stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, \n     is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when the blood \n     supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in the \n     artery or a burst of the artery;\n       Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause \n     permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly \n     diagnosed and treated;\n       Whereas 1 out of every 4,000 live births, and 11 out of \n     every 100,000 children overall, have a stroke each year;\n       Whereas an individual can have a stroke before birth;\n       Whereas a stroke is among the top 10 causes of death for \n     children in the United States;\n       Whereas 20 to 40 percent of children who experience a \n     stroke die as a result;\n       Whereas stroke may recur in 20 percent of children;\n       Whereas the average time from onset of symptoms to \n     diagnosis of a child having had a stroke is 72 hours;\n       Whereas no medication has been Federally approved for \n     pediatric stroke treatment;\n       Whereas many children who experience a stroke will suffer \n     serious, long-term neurological disabilities, including \n     hemiplegia (which is paralysis of 1 side of the body) \n     seizures, speech and vision problems, and learning \n     difficulties;\n       Whereas such disabilities may require ongoing physical, \n     occupational, and speech therapies, as well as surgeries;\n       Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments \n     resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young \n     adulthood have a considerable impact on children, families, \n     and society;\n       Whereas very little is known about the cause, treatment, \n     and prevention of childhood stroke;\n       Whereas medical research is the only means by which the \n     people of the United States can identify and develop \n     effective treatment and prevention strategies for childhood \n     stroke;\n       Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of childhood stroke \n     greatly improves the chances that the affected child will \n     recover and not experience a recurrence; and\n       Whereas the Pediatric Stroke Network, Inc. should be \n     commended for being the first online support group for \n     families affected by pediatric stroke to be registered with \n     the American Heart Association and for the ongoing \n     legislative and awareness endeavors of the group: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of an appropriate date as \n     ``National Childhood Stroke Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to support the \n     efforts, programs, services, and advocacy of organizations \n     that work to enhance public awareness of childhood stroke.\n\n                              S. Res. 528\n\n       Whereas mucopolysaccharidosis (referred to in this \n     resolution as ``MPS'') are a group of genetically determined \n     lysosomal storage diseases that render the human body \n     incapable of producing certain enzymes needed to break down \n     complex carbohydrates;\n       Whereas MPS diseases cause complex carbohydrates to be \n     stored in almost every cell in the body and progressively \n     cause cellular damage;\n       Whereas the cellular damage caused by MPS--\n       (1) adversely affects the human body by damaging the heart, \n     respiratory system, bones, internal organs, and central \n     nervous system; and\n       (2) often results in mental retardation, short stature, \n     corneal damage, joint stiffness, loss of mobility, speech and \n     hearing impairment, heart disease, hyperactivity, chronic \n     respiratory problems, and, most importantly, a drastically \n     shortened life span;\n       Whereas symptoms of MPS are usually not apparent at birth;\n       Whereas, without treatment, the life expectancy of an \n     individual afflicted with MPS begins to decrease at a very \n     early stage in the life of the individual;\n       Whereas research has resulted in the development of limited \n     treatments for some MPS diseases;\n       Whereas promising advancements in the pursuit of treatments \n     for additional MPS diseases are underway as of the date of \n     agreement to this resolution;\n       Whereas, despite the creation of new remedies, the blood-\n     brain barrier continues to be a significant impediment to \n     effectively treating the brain, which prevents the treatment \n     of many of the symptoms of MPS;\n       Whereas treatments for MPS will be greatly enhanced with \n     continued public funding;\n       Whereas the quality of life of the individuals afflicted \n     with MPS, and the treatments available to those individuals, \n     will be enhanced through the development of early detection \n     techniques and early intervention;\n       Whereas treatments and research advancements for MPS are \n     limited by a lack of awareness about MPS diseases;\n       Whereas the lack of awareness about MPS diseases extends to \n     individuals within the medical community;\n       Whereas the cellular damage that is caused by MPS makes MPS \n     a model for the study of many other degenerative genetic \n     diseases;\n       Whereas the development of effective therapies and a \n     potential cure for MPS diseases can be accomplished by \n     increased awareness, research, data collection, and \n     information distribution; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that has the ability--\n       (1) to raise public awareness about MPS; and\n       (2) to encourage and facilitate increased public and \n     private sector research for the early diagnosis and treatment \n     of MPS diseases: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates May 15, 2010, as ``National MPS Awareness \n     Day''; and\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National MPS \n     Awareness Day''.\n\n                              S. Res. 529\n\n       Whereas Lena Mary Calhoun Horne was a trail-blazing \n     performing artist whose life exemplified her commitment to \n     social justice, peace, and civil rights;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne was born in Brooklyn, New York on June \n     30, 1917, and joined the chorus of the famed Cotton Club in \n     Harlem at the age of 16 and debuted on Broadway one year \n     later in the musical ``Dance With Your Gods'' (1934);\n       Whereas during the 1940s, Ms. Horne was one of the first \n     African American women to perform with a white band ensemble, \n     the first black performer to play the Copacabana nightclub, \n     and among the first African Americans to sign a long-term \n     Hollywood film studio contract, garnering her roles in a host \n     of films, including ``Thousands Cheer'' (1943), ``Broadway \n     Rhythm'' (1944), ``Two Girls and a Sailor'' (1944), and \n     ``Ziegfeld Follies'' (1946);\n       Whereas her rendition of the title song to the 1943 film \n     ``Stormy Weather'' became a major hit and among her signature \n     pieces, which also included ``Deed I Do'', ``As Long As I \n     Live'', and Cole Porter's ``Just One of Those Things'';\n       Whereas Ms. Horne recorded prolifically into the 1990s and \n     the record ``Lena Horne at the Waldorf-Astoria'' became the \n     best-selling album by a female singer in RCA Victor's \n     history;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne earned four Grammy Awards during the \n     course of her career, including the Recording Academy's \n     Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989, a National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People Image Award in 1999, \n     and a Kennedy Center Honor in 1984;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne appeared extensively on television, \n     including specials with Harry Belafonte, Tony Bennett, \n     numerous musical reviews and variety shows, and appearances \n     on programs like ``Sesame Street'' and ``The Cosby Show'';\n       Whereas she was nominated for her first Tony Award in 1957 \n     for her role in the musical ``Jamaica'', and her 1981 one-\n     woman Broadway show, ``Lena Horne: The Lady and Her Music'', \n     earned her a Tony Award, a Grammy Award, and ran for more \n     than 300 performances;\n       Whereas despite Ms. Horne's pioneering contract with MGM \n     studios, she was never featured in a leading role during the \n     1940s and 50s because her films had to be reedited for \n     theaters in Southern States that proscribed films with black \n     performers;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne was outspoken in her fight for racial \n     equality;\n       Whereas during World War II, she used her own money to \n     travel and entertain the troops;\n       Whereas while Ms. Horne performed at Army camps for the \n     U.S.O., she became an outspoken critic of the treatment of \n     African American servicemen and refused to sing before \n     segregated audiences and at venues in which German Prisoners \n     of War were seated in front of black soldiers;\n       Whereas during the late 1940s, Ms. Horne sued a number of \n     restaurants and theaters for racial discrimination;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne was only two years old when her \n     grandmother, suffragette, and civil rights activist Cora \n     Calhoun enrolled her as a member of the National Association \n     for the Advancement of Colored People, and she was an \n     honorary member of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority and worked \n     for years with the Urban League;\n       Whereas she participated in numerous civil rights rallies \n     and demonstrations - marching with Medgar Evers in \n     Mississippi, performing at rallies throughout the Nation for \n     the National Council of Negro Women, and\n\n[[Page S3792]]\n\n     taking part in the March on Washington in August 1963 at \n     which the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., delivered his ``I \n     Have a Dream'' speech;\n       Whereas her commitment to civil rights and political views \n     may have resulted in her appearance on Hollywood \n     ``blacklists'' during the 1950s;\n       Whereas Ms. Horne worked with Eleanor Roosevelt to pass \n     antilynching legislation;\n       Whereas with her wide musical range and consummate \n     professionalism, she rose beyond Hollywood's stereotypical \n     portrayals of African American as maids, butlers, and African \n     natives; and\n       Whereas her poise, grace, and courage paved the way for \n     generations of women and African Americans: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate celebrates the life and \n     achievements of Lena Mary Calhoun Horne and honors her for \n     her triumphs against racial discrimination and her steadfast \n     commitment to the civil rights of all people.\n\n                              S. Res. 530\n\n       Whereas women of all backgrounds should be encouraged to \n     greatly reduce their risk of common diseases through \n     preventive measures such as a healthy lifestyle, by engaging \n     in regular physical activity, eating a nutritious diet, and \n     visiting a healthcare provider to receive regular check-ups, \n     and preventative screenings;\n       Whereas significant disparities exist in the prevalence of \n     disease among women of different backgrounds, including women \n     with disabilities, African American women, Asian and Pacific \n     Islander women, Latinas, and American Indian and Alaska \n     Native women;\n       Whereas healthy habits should begin at a young age;\n       Whereas it is important to educate women and girls about \n     the significance of awareness of key female health issues;\n       Whereas it is recognized that the offices of women's health \n     within the Department of Health and Human Services, the Food \n     and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, the Health Resources and Services Administration, \n     the National Institutes of Health, and the Agency for \n     Healthcare Research and Quality are vital to providing \n     critical services in supporting women's health research, \n     education, and other necessary services that benefit women of \n     any age, race, or ethnicity;\n       Whereas annually, National Women's Health Week begins on \n     Mother's Day and celebrates the efforts of national and \n     community organizations working with partners and volunteers \n     to improve awareness of key women's health issues; and\n       Whereas in 2010, the week of May 9 through May 15 is \n     dedicated as ``National Women's Health Week 2010'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the importance of preventing diseases that \n     commonly affect women;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of ``National Women's \n     Health Week 2010'';\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to use the \n     start of ``National Women's Health Week 2010'', on May 9, \n     2010, as an opportunity to learn about health issues that \n     face women;\n       (4) calls on the women of the United States to observe \n     National Women's Check-Up Day by receiving preventive \n     screenings from their health care providers; and\n       (5) recognizes the importance of federally funded programs \n     that provide research and collect data on common diseases in \n     women.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/14/senate-section/article/S3792-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3792]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDER FOR RECORD TO REMAIN OPEN\n\n  Mr. DODD.
