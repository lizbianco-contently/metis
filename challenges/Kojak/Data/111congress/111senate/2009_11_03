Mr. President, Americans have always had a healthy \nskepticism about government. But the health care bill that Democrats in \nCongress have put together this year would surprise even the wariest of \ncitizens about government's potential to misread its mandate.\n  At a time of near 10-percent unemployment and a staggering $12 \ntrillion Federal debt, this bill proposes to spend at least another \ntrillion dollars to extend the reach of government in the health care \ndecisions of every single American.\n  What's worse, a bill that was meant to control costs is expected to \nincrease them. One independent study after another has shown that the \nbills we have seen wouldn't make health insurance premiums go down, \nthey would actually drive them up.\n  You would think this would be enough to send the bill writers back to \nthe drawing board. After all, the primary argument that was used to \nmarshal support for these bills was the unsustainable cost of health \ncare. Unfortunately, it hasn't. Frankly, it is an absurd spot in which \nwe now find ourselves.\n  For months and months, we heard that certain reforms were needed to \ndrive down costs. Yet now, after analysts have concluded that these \nproposals would actually increase costs, the people who were arguing \nfor them are trying harder than ever to get these proposals approved, \nas quickly as possible.\n  The irreducible fact is this: while Americans have been saying we \nneed more affordable health care, the Democrat plan makes it more \nexpensive--and that is not reform.\n  We have the testimony of the Joint Committee on Taxation, the \nCongressional Budget Office, the administration's own Office of the \nActuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and separate \nanalyses by many others that say so. Each has said that the proposals \nwe have seen would lead to higher premiums. And these higher premiums \nwould especially hit the young, the healthy, and small businesses \nowners.\n\n[[Page S11008]]\n\n  Here is the breakdown. Premiums for young people could go up nearly \n70 percent, and even more than that in places such as Kentucky. And \nmillions of Americans who have chosen a plan that fits their needs and \ntheir budgets will be forced to buy more insurance, at a significant \ncost. Like most of my colleagues, I am particularly concerned about \nwhat these plans will mean for the families I represent. And what I \nhave seen so far from these reports is disturbing.\n  As a result of all the various new rules, regulations, and tax \nincreases that would come about as a result of the Democrat health care \nplan, a family of four in Kentucky that earns $66,000 a year is \nestimated to see their insurance premium double--from $355 to $787 a \nmonth.\n  The other side will say that they intend to provide subsidies for \nfamilies like these, and they do. But those subsidies would only cover \nabout half the increase. So even after these subsidies are applied, \nthis family ends up paying an extra $180 a month. As any family will \ntell you, that's $180 that will not go to the college fund, to the \nretirement account, or toward a family vacation.\n  New taxes on medical devices would also contribute to higher \npremiums.\n  Same goes for new taxes on life-saving prescription drugs and new \ntaxes on insurance providers. One independent study shows that the new \ntaxes and fees would add nearly $500 a year to the cost of insurance \nfor American families.\n  The Congressional Budget Office also predicts that a new charge to \nparticipate in so-called exchanges would lead private health plans to \nincrease their premiums by about three percent. That is on top of all \nthe other forces in this bill that work to drive up Americans' health \ninsurance premiums.\n  The testimony of these groups is clear: the Democrat plan would not \nonly raise taxes and slash Medicare, it would also raise health \ninsurance premiums. This is not reform, and it's certainly not what the \nAmerican people were told they could expect.\n  Republicans have proposed a different approach, one that responds to \ntoday's needs and one that respects the challenging economic \nenvironment we're in.\n  We are for helping small businesses find affordable health insurance \noptions for their employees. We are for providing individuals the same \ntax benefits for purchasing insurance that businesses get.\n  We are for protecting doctors from frivolous lawsuits, so they can \nfocus on treating patients--and lower their costs. We are for cracking \ndown on the rampant waste and fraud that drive up the cost of care. And \nwe are for the kind of wellness and prevention programs that have \nworked at places like the Safeway grocery chain.\n  Contrast that with the other side's plan. A reform that was meant to \ncut costs has been shown to increase them. As I said, that is not \nreform. But it is also not too late. It is not too late for the parties \nto get together and deliver the reforms Americans really want.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11008-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, we have had, during the last 6 months, \nextended hearings on the need for health care reform. Every Member in \nthe Democratic caucus believes the present system of delivering health \ncare in America is in trouble. It is not fair to patients or to \nphysicians. Certain classes of people are being damaged. Medicare \nrecipients are hammered every day.\n  What we are doing is presenting to the American people alternatives \nto the insurance industry running the world of health care. We cannot \ncontinue the way we have been going. That is what the Republican plan \nis--to continue more of the same, with the health insurance industry \ncontrolling everything, not professionals.\n  We are going to continue working on this with the CBO, which now has \nthe plan we have sent to them with different alternatives, and they \nwill report back as to the numbers on that. We will have in the near \nfuture a program that will be open to the American people that will \nshow that is what we are doing. We are returning the health care to the \npeople who can do the best job in health care. Rather than the doctor \nhaving to go through some bureaucrat working for an insurance company, \nhe or she can make a decision on their own. This is what the nurses \nwant, this is what the physicians want, this is what the patients want, \nthis is what the hospital administrators want, and this is what the \nteaching hospitals want.\n  Health care in America is not in good shape. All you need to do is \nread any fair discussion of the health care system, recognizing now \nthat one-sixth of every dollar is spent on health care in America \ntoday. If we don't bend that curve, it will be up to 35 cents of every \ndollar. America cannot continue this. We are lagging behind the rest of \nthe world, and that needs to change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11008-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3548, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3548) to amend the Supplemental Appropriations \n     Act, 2008, to provide for the temporary availability of \n     certain additional emergency unemployment compensation, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Baucus-Reid) amendment No. 2712, in the nature of \n     a substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 2713 (to amendment No. 2712), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2714 (to amendment No. 2713), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 2715 (to the language proposed to be \n     stricken by amendment No. 2712), to change the enactment \n     date.\n       Reid amendment No. 2716 (to amendment No. 2715), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, shortly, we are going to be voting on \nthe unemployment compensation bill. I have already taken to the floor \nto urge my colleagues to pass the underlying bill, which provides 14 \nweeks of additional benefits to those who will exhaust their \nunemployment compensation. This is an insurance program. The funds are \nthere, assessed through the compensation system of our country in order \nthat we have money available for those who have lost their jobs during \na recession, and that is exactly what has happened.\n  These are extraordinary times. I know the Presiding Officer will \nagree with me that we have been to our States, and we know there are \npeople who are unable to find jobs. This past week, I was at the \nemployment office in Baltimore and saw people coming into that office \nin large numbers and asking for jobs. I talked to individuals, saw the \nfaces of people who want to work but who can't find jobs. So it is \ncritically important for the system to work, and that means we need to \nprovide the safety net of unemployment compensation during these times, \nand we need to extend it to all States.\n  The bill before us will provide those additional 14 weeks in every \nState. In my own State of Maryland, we have many counties that have \nunemployment rates far in excess of the 8\\1/2\\ percent, which was the \ntrigger number used in the House bill. So it is appropriate we pass \nthis bill for the people who will benefit by it, and it is also \nappropriate we pass it to help our economy. We know the dollars that \nare provided through unemployment compensation work their way back into \nour economy, very quickly helping our economy.\n  I wish to talk also about the leader's amendment that will extend to \nfirst-time home buyers a tax credit that would expire at the end of \nthis month. I had introduced legislation, along with Senator Isakson, \nto extend the credit for an additional 6 months, and I am pleased that \nprovision is included in the leader's amendment that also expands the \ncredit for an additional 6 months.\n  According to the IRS, 1.4 million people used the credit as of \nSeptember 2009. As many as 40 percent of all home buyers this year will \nqualify for the credit. It has clearly worked according to its intended \npurpose; that is, to get potential home buyers off the sidelines and \ninto the market and buying a home. It is estimated that the credit is \ndirectly responsible for 200,000 to 400,000 purchases this year. \nAccording to the National Association of Realtors, those additional \nsales have pumped approximately $22 billion into the economy. It is \ngetting our economy back on line.\n  The credit has succeeded in reducing the glut of homes for sale, but \nit needs to be extended. We still have too much inventory that is out \nthere, and it is affecting new home starts, which are critically \nimportant for our economy. We know the real estate market was the spark \nthat put us into this recession. We know that. We know what happened to \nhome values. We know what happened to people who were unable to sell \ntheir homes. We know what happened with foreclosures. We know we need a \nhealthy real estate market to get us out of this recession.\n  We have seen some signs of improvement and stabilization in the \nmarket, but we are certainly not out of the woods yet. Inventories are \nstill way too high. Dean Baker, codirector for the Center for Economic \nand Policy Research, notes that price declines could resume later this \nfall.\n  Quoting Mr. Baker:\n\n       The uptick in sales driven by the credit has led to a \n     substantial increase in the number of homes offered for sale \n     at just the time that the boost from the credit is dwindling. \n     The inventory will also be a much larger drag in the slow-\n     selling winter months.\n\n  We know winter is notoriously a slow season, but we have too much \ninventory that is out there. This would be the wrong time for Congress \nto allow this credit to expire.\n  Other economists, such as Mark Zandi of Moody's, and James Glassman \nof JPMorgan Chase, support extending the credit.\n  The substitute amendment, which I have cosponsored and which is \nsimilar to the bill I introduced--S. 1678--extends and expands the \ncredit to April 30, 2010, for binding contracts and then allows 60 more \ndays to close. I think that makes sense. The closing period sometimes \nhampers the use of the credit. For example, if someone was to enter \ninto a contract today, even though the credit is there, it is highly \nunlikely they could settle by the end of the month, taking advantage of \nthe $8,000 credit. It makes sense to say that as long as you have a \nbinding contract by April, you have 2 months later to close in order to \nget the credit.\n  The amendment keeps the $8,000 credit for the first-time home buyer \nand then provides a $6,500 credit available to other home buyers who \nhave lived in their current homes for at least 5 years. These are the \nstep-up sales. These are people who currently own homes, who have lived \nin their home for 5 years, and are now trying to buy another home. You \ncan't buy a house and try to flip it to take advantage of the $6,500 \ncredit. It is a smaller credit than the first-time home buyers', but it \nis still a significant credit and it is available for homes costing up \nto $800,000.\n  I don't think there are many homes in the area that will qualify \nunder the income limits, but it does allow those to qualify. The income \nlimits have been lifted slightly from $75,000 to $125,000 for an \nindividual and from $150,000 to $225,000 for joint filers.\n  So it takes care of where the market needs help, where there is too \nmuch inventory, and will allow the credit to, again, tell people: Look, \nthe economy needs your help. This is a good time to buy. The government \nis going to be your partner with this $8,000 credit for the first-time \nhome buyer and a $6,500 credit for the person who has lived in their \nhouse for 5 years.\n  There are a couple more points that I think need to be underscored. \nThe credit is fully paid for. It will not add to the deficit. That is \nan important point, but I would also point out that this credit will \nhelp stimulate our economy, which will generate economic activity, \nwhich will help us on our budget deficit. It really does help our \neconomy, and it is fully paid for, so it doesn't add to the deficit, \nand that is one of the points I mentioned when I first introduced this \nbill with Senator Isakson--we were going to look for a way to make sure \nit is paid for.\n  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, for \ncoming forward with an amendment that is fully paid for, that is \noffset. I believe that is the way it should be.\n  The second point I want to bring up is it includes tough antifraud \nlanguage and ``math error'' authority for the IRS to ensure that only \nthose individuals and families who qualify for the credit take \nadvantage of it. I know we are all concerned about reports we read in \nthe paper about potential fraud on this credit. Any fraud is wrong, but \nwe know if we set up a new credit there are those who will press the \npoint more than they should. We have to make sure the antifraud \nprovisions are in this bill so those entitled to this credit are those \nwho take advantage of it and it is not used inappropriately. Language \nis included in this amendment to\n\n[[Page S11010]]\n\nmake sure that, in fact, happens. It is a bill that is properly \nbalanced.\n  I wish to make one other point. I heard the chairman of the Senate \nFinance Committee said this, and I agree completely. Senator Isakson \nand I talked about this. The credit will end. This is not an extension \nbecause we believe this is a credit that should be there indefinitely. \nWe do not. This credit is to help bring real estate back to where it \nneeds to be for our economy to recover. We give until April so that \npeople can take advantage of this credit during this tough economic \ntime, knowing full well that the winter is going to be a slow season, \nnormally, for home sales and in the spring people are more likely to \nstart again looking at home sales. We want people to take advantage of \nthis now, recognizing that come April this credit will not be extended. \nThis is the time to take advantage of this government credit that helps \nyou in buying a home.\n  As I said earlier, the slump in housing led us into this recession. A \nrebound in the market will lead us out of this recession. Extending the \ncredit is a prudent and fiscally responsible measure.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the leader's amendment, and I hope we \nwill shortly have an opportunity not only to pass this amendment but to \npass the underlying bill that will extend unemployment compensation to \nliterally, in my State, the tens of thousands of people who otherwise \nwill lose their benefits by the end of this month and the 1.4 million \nAmericans who will lose their unemployment compensation benefits by the \nend of this year if we do not act.\n  For all those reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, any day now the Senate will begin to \ndebate a single bill affecting the lives, the wallets, and the health \nof all Americans. Three Senators from the other side of the aisle have \nbeen working behind closed doors, trying to stitch together yet another \nhealth reform bill--a bill that will restructure 17 percent of the \nAmerican economy. It is unclear when the other 97 Senators will get to \nsee the majority leader's bill.\n  As we wait for the opportunity to read the bill, to examine the bill, \nto see what is in it--and the American people are waiting as well--I am \nreminded of a book that I believe still has much to teach us, ``The \nFederalist Papers,'' particularly Federalist 62 authored by James \nMadison. He says this:\n\n       The internal effects of a mutable policy are still more \n     calamitous. It poisons the blessings of liberty. It will be \n     of little avail to the people that the laws are made by men \n     of their own choice--\n\n  Let's get that over again.\n\n       It will be of little avail to the people that the laws are \n     made by men of their own choice if the laws be so \n     voluminous--\n\n  You have seen this 1900-page House bill--\n\n       That they cannot be read, or so incoherent that they cannot \n     be understood; if they be repealed or revised before they are \n     promulgated, or undergo such incessant changes that no man \n     knows what the law is today, can guess what it will be \n     tomorrow.\n\n  That is what we are looking at. The quote strikes a chord with \neveryone who hears it because it summarizes so very well what we are \nfacing today in the Congress--in the Senate, in the House--as we are \ndealing with health care and health reform. The House health reform \nbill is nearly 2,000 pages long. The Finance Committee bill is over \n1,500 pages. The HELP Committee bill is over 1,000 pages.\n  Some in Washington may believe that drafting a bill in secret and \nthen rushing to enact it into law with little debate is the perfect way \nto avoid tough questions and public scrutiny. That plan has not gone as \nintended. The American people are much too smart. As the American \npeople began to understand the details, they began to ask the tough \nquestions. They know what the Democrats in Congress and the \nadministration are trying to do. The American people are not buying it. \nThey are not convinced that we should turn over the Nation's private \nhealth care system to Washington, to bureaucrats, and to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Of course the American people want reasonable, commonsense health \ninsurance reform. We need that. But the American people do not want a \nbill that limits their freedom and bankrupts the country. Fortunately, \nthe American people see that the numbers simply do not add up. They \nknow that if the reform bills we are debating become law, the health \ncare costs are going to go up.\n  I go home to Wyoming every weekend. I was there yesterday. People \ncontinue to ask me: How will all of these health care bills affect me \nand affect my family? Inevitably, the question is followed by a \nstatement. It says: Tell those people back in Washington that I want \nthem to fix what is wrong with our health care system, but whatever \nthey do, that should not make things worse for me and worse for my \nfamily. I can't afford to pay more for my family's health care.\n  I agree completely with the people of Wyoming. Health care costs \ntoday are rising three times faster than inflation. Especially during \nthese economic times, rising health care costs stretch family budgets \nto the limit. It also makes it harder for employers to keep offering \nhealth benefits to their employees.\n  Now the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on Taxation, \nand the Health and Human Services Office of the Actuary are all telling \nus what the American people already know. They are telling us that if \nwe pass the health reform bill that is coming before us, we are going \nto make things worse.\n  What exactly did all of these nonpartisan organizations say? On \nSeptember 22 of this year, the Congressional Budget Office sent a \nletter to the Finance Committee chairman, to Chairman Baucus. In the \nletter, the CBO said two important things. No. 1, premiums in the new \ninsurance exchanges would tend to be higher than the average premiums \nin the current individual market. This was a bill that was supposed to \nlower costs. No. 2, people with low expected costs for health care \nwould generally end up paying higher premiums. Again, that is not where \nwe are supposed to be heading. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the Baucus bill actually causes many individuals and families \nstruggling today to afford health insurance to end up paying more.\n  In the same letter, the CBO also indicated that tax increases in the \nBaucus bill will make monthly health insurance bills go up, not down.\n  During the Finance Committee debate, my friend from Texas, Senator \nCornyn, asked CBO Director Doug Elmendorf a specific question. He said: \n``Would the new fees on health insurers be passed along to health \nconsumers?''\n  Dr. Elmendorf responded. ``Our judgment,'' he said, ``is that the new \nfees would raise insurance premiums''--make them go up.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed exactly what the CBO \nDirector had said because during the same Finance Committee debate, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation Chief of Staff said:\n\n       Basic economics is that the fee will be reflected in higher \n     premium costs.\n\n  Who pays the premiums? Obviously the people who are being insured or \ntheir employees.\n  I wish to point out that, like many things in this Baucus bill, this \nnew insurance tax system, the new taxes begin in the year 2010--next \nyear--a full 3 years before Americans see any benefits, any coverage \nbenefits. So they are going to start paying for this years before the \nbenefits actually arrive. I thought the goal of health reform was to \nlower the cost for hard-working Americans, not to raise the costs. \nInstead, the respected economists who looked at this are telling us \nthat monthly health insurance costs will go up for every single \nAmerican starting next year.\n  Next, the Health and Human Services Office of the Actuary, which is \nanother nonpartisan, highly respected scorekeeper, took a look at this \nDemocratic health reform bill. On October 21, they released a memo \nanalyzing the House bill, at the time H.R. 3200. Unfortunately for the \nDemocratic leadership and the White House, the news was not good. The \nHouse bill bends the cost curve up. The expenses go up. According to \ntheir memo, health care spending will increase if the House bill \nbecomes law.\n  Here is what they said:\n\n\n[[Page S11011]]\n\n\n       In aggregate, we estimate that for calendar years 2010-\n     2019, National Health Expenditures would increase by $750 \n     billion or 2.1 percent over the updated baseline projection.\n\n  Often the government uses fancy, complex language, so let me be very \nclear about this. They are saying that as national spending on health \ncare increases, American families will see their monthly health \ninsurance premiums go up.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle will try to tell you the \ndata is meaningless. They will try to tell you the taxpayer-funded \nsubsidies included in the bill will make the health care premiums more \naffordable. It is fascinating to me that the Democrats do not even try \nto deny that premiums will go up. They admit it. Instead, they tell us \nnot to worry about it.\n  We should worry about it. The people of Wyoming worry about it. The \npeople of America are worried about it. Why? Because hard-working \nAmerican taxpayers and the generations to follow will be forced to pick \nup the tab. I want everyone who is listening to know that the American \npeople are not being fooled. They understand that subsidizing something \ndoes not make it cheaper.\n  Not only do the proposals in front of us raise taxes, they slash \nnearly $500 billion from Medicare, from the hard-working Americans who \nhave given and sacrificed and who rely on Medicare for their health \ncare, and they raise premiums, they raise the cost for people who have \ninsurance. They are doing it not to save Medicare but to create an \nentirely new entitlement program.\n  Again, my friends on the other side never seem to mention that most \nAmericans will not even qualify for these subsidies that are being \npromised. About 160 million Americans get their health insurance \nthrough an employer. Under the Democratic health reform plans, they \nwill not qualify for a Federal Government subsidy. You have to take the \nhealth insurance your employer gives or buy a policy on your own, \nwhether you can afford it or not. That is going to be the law. Either \nway, it will cost you more if this bill becomes law.\n  We have not even gotten into the issue of the quality of the care you \nwill receive under this new government-run system. The Congressional \nBudget Office also confirmed that almost 5 million American people who \nbuy insurance through this new government exchange will not receive any \nhelp to pay for their insurance. What good are taxpayer-funded \nsubsidies to help pay for premium increases when most people don't \nactually qualify for the promised help?\n  It sounds to me as if the Baucus bill will stick people with higher \ntaxes, will take away their choices, will remove personal freedom, and \nwill implement changes that increase their monthly health care costs. \nThis is not reform; it is a blatant effort by Washington to take over \nhealth care in America.\n  It is important that Members of Congress and the American people \nfully understand how the Democratic health bills will increase costs, \nso let's go through the list one by one.\n  We have already talked about the new tax on health insurance \nproviders. Experts tell us this tax will be passed on to patients. \nBlueCross BlueShield of Wyoming tells me this tax will raise monthly \npremiums of families in my State by $500 a year.\n  Then there are the new requirements. The Democratic bills all have \nthe Federal Government defining what kind of insurance can be sold and \nmust be purchased. Well, this makes it illegal for insurers to sell \ncertain policies that many people have today, that many people like, \nand that many people want to keep.\n  How do they accomplish this? The Democratic bills require most health \nplans to offer products that meet new, higher, specified what are \ncalled actuarial values and cover an exhaustive list of mandated \nbenefits. If you do not know what the term ``actuarial values'' means, \nyou are not alone. I have been in the practice of medicine for 25 years \ntaking care of families all across Wyoming. I had never heard of it.\n  ``Actuarial values'' is a technical term. It stands for the total \namount of health spending paid for by an insurance plan. In other \nwords, the actuarial value of a health plan depends on all of the \nbenefits, on any cost sharing that the health plan covers. Actuarial \nvalues are represented by a percentage. In insurance plans, they can \nrange anywhere from 55 percent to 90 percent. Typically, as these \nvalues increase, the cost increases.\n  Well, the health care bill raised this so called actuarial value \nminimum to a standard of 65 percent, which actually is much higher than \nmany policies that are sold on the market today. As a result, experts \ntell us that people who buy insurance will pay at least 10 percent more \njust to meet the new standard.\n  I am sure the other side of the aisle will try to say: Do not worry. \nWe will protect you.\n  You know, the idea was that you should be able to keep the insurance \nyou have so that your premiums will not go up. But what they do not \ntell you is that you are out of luck if your insurer stops offering \ncoverage or if you want to change your policy in any way.\n  How might you change your policy? Well, you might add dental care or \nvision benefits. If you want to do any of those changes, you are out of \nluck. Any change to your current insurance policy and the promise that \n``you get to keep what you have if you like it,'' well, that promise \nwill not come true.\n  Finally, there are some new rules called age rating. They are going \nto drive up the premiums specifically for younger folks. The age rating \nrules limit the amount premiums can vary between healthy younger \nAmericans and older individuals. Experts tell us that the Finance \nCommittee bill, for example, will cause monthly insurance premiums for \nyounger, healthier people who are then going to be subsidizing older \nfolks who are sicker--to drive up the premiums of younger folks by 69 \npercent. These extreme price increases will force young healthy people \nout of the market. A young person will see that it is cheaper to pay a \n$750 fine annually, what they call a tax penalty, and forget about \nhaving health insurance than it is to pay $5,000 a year for health \ninsurance when, as many young people believe, they will never need it. \nBesides, if this young person does get sick, he or she can always buy \nhealth insurance later without facing a penalty.\n  That is exactly how this bill is written. Without a doubt, the \npolicies I have described will cause health insurance costs to go up \nfor millions and millions of Americans, and specifically so very much \nfor young Americans.\n  Plans that the President promised the American people that they could \nkeep if they liked, well, we all know the President cannot and will not \nkeep that promise. I will give a specific example. In Wyoming, a \nhealthy 35-year-old man can go out today and buy a high-deductible \nhealth insurance policy for about $90 a month.\n  Scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office estimate this level \nplan in the Finance Committee bill will cost $392 a month. That is a \nhuge increase because that is what they are going to be mandated to \nbuy. Not one of my constituents can afford to pay 329 percent more for \ntheir health insurance than they can pay today.\n  We can solve the problem of rising medical costs without a government \ntakeover of health care. I struggle with the assumption that people \ngenerally can be trusted to do the right thing and society prospers \nwhen government has less to say about how people run their lives. \nOthers start by assuming that Washington knows best and should take \nmore authority over all of us.\n  There are better ideas that improve our Nation's health care system, \ncommonsense reforms on which all of us can agree. Having practiced \nmedicine, taken care of families in Wyoming for 25 years, I would \nprefer a step-by-step approach to reform--simple, commonsense, \naffordable changes that we can implement right away. And all of those \nought to be centered on the patient, patient centered, not government \ncentered: Giving people incentives such as lower costs when they engage \nin healthy behaviors; prohibiting the use of preexisting condition \nclauses; allowing people to take their health insurance with them if \nthey change jobs; allowing Americans to buy insurance across State \nlines, to shop for a policy that is best for them, best for their \nfamily; giving people the same tax breaks that big companies get when\n\n[[Page S11012]]\n\npeople buy their insurance policies individually; dealing with abusive \nlawsuits and the situation there that involves doctors ordering many \ntests that do not necessarily help the patient stay healthy but help \nprotect the doctor in case of a suit; and allowing small businesses to \npool together in order to offer health insurance to their employees at \na more reasonable cost to the employees as well as to the business.\n  The time has come to work together for meaningful reform. I think \nmost Americans would prefer that we get these reforms right than pass a \n2,000-page bill--a bill that raises taxes, a bill that cuts Medicare, a \nbill that costs $1 trillion, and a bill that represents a Washington \ntakeover of health care.\n  The American people want better. The American people deserve better. \nThe American people deserve nothing less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I would like to talk about health care as \nwell, and I brought a few pages that the American people would be \ninterested in. This stack closest to the podium is actually the House \nbill, the 2,000-page House bill. On this side is what we are working \noff of so far on the Senate side because what has been put together has \nbeen put together behind closed doors, and it has not been released \nyet. I assume that is because they do not know the cost and what \nadjustments will have to be made in order to meet the cost \nrequirements, although it is an extension of cost of probably $1 \ntrillion.\n  I wonder if there is anybody in America who believes we can expand \nprograms by $1 trillion and it will not cost a dime for the rest of us. \nBut at any rate, the stacks over here are the ones from the Senate \nside. The little bottom stack down there is the Senate HELP bill. Then \nthis is the Senate Finance bill, the 1,600-page bill, although when we \nwere actually debating this bill in committee, we did not know how big \nthe bill would be because we worked off a 220-page summary and did \nsummary amendments.\n  So this is the first time we have actually got to look at a final \nproduct. What is interesting about doing a summary bill is that the \namendments are done in summary. If an amendment does happen to pass by \nthe minority, then it is written by the majority, and the devil is \nalways in the details. So we are very anxious to see, although there \nwere not a lot of amendments that we got passed there.\n\n  What I mostly want to talk about today is the impact on small \nbusiness. The status quo in health care is unacceptable. Health care \ncosts are skyrocketing, insurance premiums are increasing, and too many \nsmall businesses can no longer afford to offer health insurance to \ntheir workers.\n  While I agree we need to change our current system, the approach \nreflected in the current health reform bills is the wrong answer. That \nis these bills. Quite a stack of papers. Very encompassing. Very \ncomprehensive. This is going to affect every single American. We have \nnever had a bill that affected every single American, and that is why \nit is so complicated. That is why it is so large. That is why it is so \nhard to deal with. That is why there will be so many mistakes as we go \nthrough a pile like that trying to make a few amendments that will \nimprove the bill. They need a lot of amendments that will improve the \nbill.\n  So while I agree we need to change our current system, the approach \nreflected in the current health reform bills is the wrong answer. I \nobject to the current health care reform bills not because I support \nthe status quo but because the bills do nothing to address the problems \nof increasing costs and premiums. These bills will not reduce health \ncare costs and will actually increase insurance premiums for most \nAmericans.\n  I have fought for years to enact commonsense reforms that would help \nslow health care cost growth and make the insurance market work better, \nparticularly for small businesses. Before I entered politics, my wife \nand I ran a small business. We had shoe stores. We know firsthand how \nhard it is to meet payroll and provide meaningful benefits to \nemployees. I understand how the current insurance market fails to meet \nthe needs of many small businesses.\n  That is why I fought for real reforms that will actually help small \nbusinesses. In 2006, I introduced a small business health plan bill \nthat would have saved the taxpayers about $1 billion and would have \nprovided health insurance to almost 1 million people.\n  The bill would have made commonsense reforms to the insurance market \nand given more leverage to small businesses to help them negotiate \nlower insurance premiums. The insurance industry, working closely with \nmany of my Democratic colleagues fought to defeat my bill. \nUnfortunately, they were successful. We could not pass the cloture \nmotion to proceed; we were short about three votes. Had we been able to \nget those three votes, we would have been able, with one amendment, to \nclear up the objections that were made during the cloture debate.\n  Since 2006, little has changed in the insurance marketplace. Health \ncare costs and premiums continue to spiral upwards. The Kaiser Family \nFoundation reports that costs for small businesses with less than 200 \nemployees--I consider that to be a pretty big business--rose by 4.7 \npercent from 2006 to 2007, 2.2 percent from 2007 to 2008, 5 percent \nfrom 2008 to 2009, and they are expected to rise next year.\n  Small businesses cannot continue to sustain these types of price \nincreases. They need and want reform and Congress should deliver \nreform. Congress should pass a bill that decreases the cost of health \ncare and reduces insurance premiums across the board, not just for the \npoor, not just for the uninsured.\n  Unfortunately, the bills that Speaker Pelosi and Leader Reid and \nPresident Obama are pushing through Congress will do little to address \nspiraling health care costs and will actually increase the insurance \npremiums most Americans pay for their health care.\n  Even worse, increases in premiums will come at a time of rising \nunemployment. The 2,000-page Pelosi bill and the 1,500-page Senate \nFinance bill will drive up costs, increase taxes, and expand the size \nof government. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the \nadministration's own official actuaries, the National Association of \nState Insurance Commissioners, and at least six other private studies \nhave all reported that the Democratic leadership bills will drive up \ncosts.\n  Actuaries at the consulting firm, Oliver Wyman, which did one of the \nstudies, estimated these bills will increase premiums for small \nbusiness by at least 20 percent. WellPoint, the largest Blue Cross Blue \nShield plan in the Nation, looked at their actual claims experience in \nthe 14 States in which they operate and concluded that premiums for \nhealthier small businesses will increase in all 14 States; in Nevada by \nas much as 108 percent.\n  Even the Congressional Budget Office has said:\n\n       Premiums in the new insurance exchanges would tend to be \n     higher than the average premiums in the current-law \n     individual market.\n\n  Let me say again what the Congressional Budget Office said:\n\n       Premiums in the new insurance exchanges would tend to be \n     higher than the average premiums in the current-law \n     individual market\n\n  When the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance \nhear the term ``health care reform,'' they want Washington to do \nsomething that lowers the cost of their health insurance premiums.\n  Unfortunately, the bills Congress has developed will do the exact \nopposite. Our economy can't take the higher taxes, higher unemployment, \nand higher mandates these bills impose. Taken together, the new taxes, \nmandates, and regulations in these bills will cumulatively increase \nhealth insurance premiums for millions of Americans who currently have \nhealth insurance. These higher taxes, higher premiums, and higher costs \nare not the change the American people voted for. Unemployment is \nhigher than it has been in decades. The housing market is in distress, \nand more and more middle-class Americans are feeling squeezed by \nirresponsible decisions being made in Washington. We all agree the \nhealth insurance market is broken and needs to be fixed. Everyone who \nwants health\n\n[[Page S11013]]\n\ninsurance should be able to get it. They should not have to spend all \nof their hard-earned savings to do so. No American should be denied \nhealth insurance because they have cancer, diabetes, or some other \npreexisting condition. No one should be denied health insurance, \nperiod. These reforms are very important and long overdue.\n  We also need to enact commonsense reforms similar to the reforms I \nadvocated in 2006 with small business health plans and then in 2007 and \n2008 with my plan for 10 steps to transform health care in America. \nThat was a step-by-step process that would get us to where all the \npromises are being made. It is on my Web site.\n  I urge the Democratic leadership to go back to the drawing board to \ndevelop bipartisan health care solutions that will actually reduce \ncosts and make health insurance more affordable for small businesses \nand most Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n\n\n            national Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2009\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I rise to give my colleagues a progress \nreport on the National Criminal Justice Commission Act of 2009, the \ngoal of which is to create a blue ribbon national commission to take a \nlong overdue and comprehensive look at our criminal justice system. \nThis week the full Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider this \nbill, and the markup would not have taken place without the strong \nsupport of Chairman Leahy and Senators Hatch, Graham, Durbin, and \nSpecter, all of whom have championed this bill. I express my \nappreciation to them and to other Members for all of the input and \ncooperation they have given.\n  I wish to begin by revisiting the problem that drove this \nlegislation. This is a chart that shows the incarceration rate in the \nUnited States compared to other countries. I don't think a lot of \nAmericans are aware that we have 5 percent of the world's population \nbut 25 percent of the world's known prison population. When I wrote \nabout the Japanese prison system as a journalist 25 years ago, Japan, \nwith half our population, had only 40,000 people in prison. At that \ntime, we had 580,000. Today we have more than 2.38 million prisoners in \nour criminal justice system and another 5 million involved in the \nprocess either on probation or parole. That is 7 million Americans \ninvolved in the criminal justice process.\n  It is important for us to understand, as we think about a way to fix \nit, that this is a relatively recent phenomenon in American history. We \nhave not always had this type of incarceration rate. It stems from \nabout 1980. Before that time--this chart goes all the way back to \n1925--we had a fairly consistent incarceration rate. In this period, \nfor a number of reasons--one of them being the fact that as we changed \na lot of our policies toward mandatory confinement of the mentally ill; \nour prisons have absorbed a tremendous population of mentally ill--we \nhave four times as many people in prison in the United States who are \nmentally ill than we do in mental institutions today. They are not \ngetting the care they need, and they are also clogging up the prison \nsystem. Also if we go back to 1980, when I showed on the chart the \nbeginning of this dramatic escalation of people in prison, we only had \n41,000 people in our prison system for drug offenses. Today that number \nis up to 500,000. This is State prisons, a comparison from 1980 to \ntoday. These are local jails, and these are Federal prisons.\n  At the same time--and it is important for us to say this--as we look \nat our criminal justice system, people don't feel any safer. This chart \nshows the percentage of Americans who believe crime is more prevalent \nthan a year ago. In 2009, more than 70 percent in this country believe \ncrime is more prevalent than it was a year ago. We have two phenomena \nhere. We are locking up more people on a percentage basis than anyone \nelse in the world. We have 7 million Americans involved in the criminal \njustice process, yet we don't feel any safer.\n  I have two theories about why this fear is prevalent in America's \nneighborhoods. Both of them speak for the need for this type of \ncommission. The first is that we have been locking up far too many \npeople, people whose transgressions could have been dealt with in more \ncreative ways. As a result, we have hundreds of thousands of people who \nhave been released from prison each year and are reentering American \nsociety hardened by their prison experience and without the kind of \nstructured programs that would allow them to become productive \ncitizens. They become recidivists. So we have more people involved in \nthe criminal process than we would otherwise, and they are threatening \nour neighborhoods.\n  The second is that gangs have grown in size and impact, including \nsophisticated transnational drug cartels operating in cities across \nAmerica. It is estimated that Mexican drug cartels alone are operating \nin at least 230 American cities and not simply along the border. \nIncidents on the border illuminate the severity of the problem, but \nclearly it is not a border problem. It is a national problem, and it is \nnot simply a problem with Mexican gangs. In northern Virginia alone, it \nis estimated there are 4,000 members of MS-13, a Central American gang; \n4,000 members is about 3 battalions of marines. Gangs are estimated to \ncommit 80 percent of the crime in some locations. They are in many \ncases the primary retail distributors of drugs. Gang violence that \naffects so many of our communities speaks to the need to make sure our \nlaw enforcement officials have the time and the energy to dedicate to \ngoing after the major problems that threaten communities--resources and \nthe policies they need to go after violent crime.\n  The hundreds of thousands of men and women leaving prisons and jails \ntoday to return to our communities speaks volumes about the need to \nreexamine the availability of and the support for community corrections \nprograms, including reentry programs, probation, and parole policies.\n  Once we started talking about these issues on my staff, as part of \nthe Joint Economic Committee, holding hearings over the past more than \n2 years, we began receiving messages, communications, and having \ncontact with people from all across the country, people from every \ndifferent aspect of the political and philosophical arenas that come \ninto play wherever we talk about criminal justice and incarceration. It \nis an emotional issue from across the philosophical spectrum. I heard \npersonally from Justice Kennedy of the Supreme Court, from prosecutors, \njudges, defense lawyers, former offenders, people in prison, police on \nthe street. All of them agree we need an interrelated examination, a \nnational commission to examine the criminal justice system and to come \nup with different types of approaches.\n  As former Los Angeles Police Chief William Bratton noted in his \ntestimony in support of the commission:\n\n       We cannot use arrests as our only tool to deal with the \n     crime problem . . . our problems are systemic, widespread, \n     and growing, and only a singularly focused blue ribbon \n     commission comprised of informed practitioners, scholars, \n     policymakers and civil rights activists can adequately \n     address the calculated formation of intervention and \n     prevention strategies. Formation of this important commission \n     is a major and essential step in the right direction.\n\n  That was from Los Angeles police chief and one of the most highly \nrespected law enforcement officials in the country, William Bratton.\n  I introduced the National Criminal Justice Commission Act in March. \nThe criminal justice commission would examine all of the elements \ninvolved in criminal justice in those specified areas which could then \nbe voted on by the Congress. When this legislation becomes law, the \nfirst step for the commission will be to address a series of specific \nfindings and to recommend policy changes. The commission will bring the \ngreatest minds in the country together with a specific timeline to make \nspecific findings and then give those recommendations regarding the \nentire gamut of the criminal justice system.\n\n  Since I have introduced the bill, we have gained the support of 35 \nMembers of this body. We have also engaged in a dialog with more than \n100 organizations across the political and philosophical spectrum, as \ndiverse as the Heritage Foundation, the Sentencing Project, the \nFraternal Order of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, \nthe Cato Institute, the\n\n[[Page S11014]]\n\nNAACP, the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Correctional \nAssociation, the Prison Fellowship, the American Probation and Parole \nAssociation, and many others across the entire political spectrum. We \nhave listened. We have learned. We have incorporated many suggestions \nand modifications to the bill.\n  For example, in the initial findings of the bill, we incorporated \nsuggestions that we include the number of crime victims, advances in \npolicing policies, decreases in violent crime and property crime, and \nthe protection of civil rights and liberties. We added an examination \nof changes in policing as a result of 9/11, the cost and benefits of \nprevention and diversion programs, and an examination of the \navailability of reentry programs. We also added requests that the \ncommission identify effective practices in reducing crime and assisting \nvictims; that it decrease, where possible, racial, ethnic, and gender \ndisparities; and that it help law enforcement address the challenges \nstemming from combating terrorism and promoting homeland security.\n  We also expanded, importantly, the number of commission members to \nensure better representation of State and local government. I wish to \nspend a minute on this for the understanding of my colleagues. This \ncommission is designed to be bipartisan. It is to be composed of 13 \nmembers: the chairman, appointed by the President; four members coming \nfrom State and local governments, appointed by the President in \nagreement with the minority and majority leader and the Speaker of the \nHouse; 2 members appointed by the majority leader of the Senate, in \nconsultation with the chairman of the Committee on the Judiciary; 2 \nmembers appointed by the Speaker of the House with the same process; 2 \nmembers appointed by the minority leader of the Senate; 2 members \nappointed by the minority leader of the House. It will be a 7-6 \ncommission.\n  Through the course of many meetings, we found a solid consensus in \nsupport of a comprehensive review of the system. This represents our \nbest effort to set politics aside and to find solutions that will allow \nus to ensure the safety of our communities while being smart about how \nwe deal with crime in America.\n  Again, I appreciate the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nscheduling a markup on this bill. I commend it to my colleagues and \nhope we can all join together in passing it this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n10 minutes in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, yesterday Afghanistan's Independent \nElection Committee announced that a runoff election is no longer \nnecessary, which means Afghan President Hamid Karzai has secured a \nsecond term.\n  Whatever your feelings about President Karzai, this peaceful \nresolution of Afghanistan's electoral mess should have brought a sigh \nof relief for anyone waiting with bated breath for our own \nadministration's decision on whether to support General McChrystal's \ntroop request, whether to support the President's plan for Afghanistan.\n  After all, according to the White House, President Obama's decision \nwas ``weeks away'' because he was waiting to announce a decision until \nafter the Afghan election was decided. But yesterday I read in the New \nYork Times that the White House Press Secretary said the President's \nannouncement was, once again, ``weeks away.'' This is beginning to \nsound a little bit like Charlie Brown and the football, only the game \nthe White House is playing has deadly consequences.\n  While the White House continues to dither and delay in Washington, \nAmerican heroes and our Afghan allies are dying on the battlefield.\n  Last month was the bloodiest month in Afghanistan since the war \nstarted. As the people of Afghanistan see America's will waiver in \nWashington, the terrorists gain strength.\n  General McChrystal said last July we have only about 12 months to get \nin the troops necessary to reverse the momentum the Taliban has gained \nbecause their forces overwhelm the number of ISAF and trained Afghan \ntroops we have on the field.\n  It is going to take some time, once a decision is made, to get the \ntroops we need there to support General McChrystal's implementation of \nthe President's plan.\n  So I call on President Obama to end this deadly indecision. Mr. \nPresident, please recommit to the very strategy you announced in March. \nRecommit to the ``war of necessity,'' as you so eloquently--and \nrightly--called by name the conflict our troops are engaged in, in the \nvillages and mountains of Afghanistan.\n  In addition to calling on the President to end the delay, I call on \nthe pundits here in Washington to abandon their excuses to justify \nfurther delay. We have heard excuse after excuse, constant attempts to \njustify delay by some in the media and some on the far left. The latest \nred herring was the Afghan elections. Now that the election is \nresolved, the next excuse is corruption in Kabul.\n  Don't get me wrong. I agree that corruption must be tackled. In fact, \nI outlined the need to take on corruption in the ``Roadmap to Success'' \nfor the region that I sent to then President-elect Obama, the Defense \nDepartment and the intelligence agencies and his national security team \nlast November. But don't forget this critical truth: ``All politics is \nlocal,'' and so is security.\n  Everyone in Washington is all too familiar with that truth, but it is \nundeniable in the mountains and villages in Afghanistan. The Taliban is \nnot waiting for a Jeffersonian democracy to flourish in Kabul as they \ncontinue to kill our troops and attack the people of Afghanistan.\n  Yes, we must tackle corruption at every level. There are lots of \nother challenges we must take. But security in Afghanistan will not \ncome from Kabul. It has to be built village by village, valley by \nvalley. The knowledgeable professionals who advise us in public and in \nclassified sessions have told me, time and time again, that security \nmust come first.\n  I have spoken on this floor many times about the need for smart \npower. That is military power backed by economic development, better \ngovernance, the provision of basic services. But that additional \nelement--all the other things besides military force--awaits the \nestablishment of security so the people we are working with can feel \nsecure and not be subject to intimidation by the Taliban.\n  For too long, the international community has been too fixated on the \nmachinations of Kabul and questions about various leaders who have been \nelected by the people of Afghanistan and not focused enough on the \nfights in the villages and the valleys.\n  I am proud to say our brave American National Guard units in \nprovinces in Afghanistan are showing what can be done when you provide \nsecurity, along with the economic development tools to provide a better \nlife and a way forward without the Taliban control over their \ncommunities.\n  We will only succeed when the people of Afghanistan feel secure from \nthe intimidation and violence of the Taliban, when Afghan forces can be \ndeveloped to the point where they can protect the population for good, \nwhen local governance begins to deliver schools, wells, and fundamental \ninstitutions for economic development and justice.\n  These institutions, from national security forces to economic \ndevelopment, to the institutions of justice--courts, jails, cops--will \nonly stay if Kabul organizes itself to support them. But the progress \nwe must commit to now is a necessary precondition. It is imperative in \nthe rural areas now and all the regions to establish that security. \nThen it is important for them to work from the bottom up to secure the \ngovernment they want in the capital.\n  The time for excuses is over. Every day we delay, the enemy grows \nstronger. Our troops and allies, who are beginning to be dispirited by \nour delay, are essentially being told: Wait. We are not sure what you \nare doing is worthwhile. The people of Afghanistan whom we are counting \non to side with us rather than the Taliban are beginning to wonder: Is \nthe United States going to pull out again, like we have done too often \nin the past?\n  The President and this Congress need to send a signal today to the \nAfghan people that America will not abandon them in this critical fight \nagainst terrorism. Our allies need to know we will remain by their \nsides to defeat this\n\n[[Page S11015]]\n\nenemy together. Our enemies need to know they cannot wait us out, that \nAmerica will be strong.\n  If we fail to deliver this message and to commit the troops General \nMcChrystal has asked for, the dangers are very real. Let there be no \ndoubt, from everything we have heard, everything we have learned, if we \ndo not send the additional troops, if we try to stand off and use a \nfire-and-fallback policy--that failed in Iraq until we brought in the \ncounterinsurgency strategy that our NATO allies tried without success \nin Afghanistan--not only will the Taliban come back in, they will come \nover the mountains, and Taliban rule will be established in \nAfghanistan. With Taliban rule comes their sometimes witting, sometimes \nunwitting allies--al-Qaida--which will use it to establish the same \nkind of base they had in Afghanistan prior to the 9/11 attacks. Failure \nwill embolden the enemies of freedom who launched the attacks of 9/11 \nfrom Afghanistan.\n  I call on President Obama to end this indecision, commit to his own \nstrategy--which he announced so powerfully last March and which I was \nproud to support on the floor--and show the American people and our \nallies the same resolve and determination I heard in his words this \npast spring. He said:\n\n       Our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot \n     outlast us, and we will defeat you.\n\n  It is time we delivered on that promise.\n\n\n                       Czech and Slovak Republics\n\n  Madam President, I also have a statement in recognition of the \ntremendous success that has occurred in the Czech Republic and the \nSlovak Republic since 1989. When the Soviet Union dissolved in 1989, \nthe people of Czechoslovakia joined together to oust communism and \nadopt democracy.\n  We have seen tremendous success in the past 20 years. Remarkable \nchanges have taken place, as both the Czech Republic and the Slovak \nRepublic have sought and achieved membership in NATO and moved to the \nkind of progress and peace we expected for them.\n  In 1989 the former Soviet Union was in the final throes of a slow \ndemise which concluded in 1991. Many of the former Soviet republics \nwere in a state of uncertainty as the situation deteriorated further.\n  In the fall and winter of 1989, the people of Czechoslovakia joined \nmany other recently separated republics and chose to oust communism and \nadopt democracy through the Velvet Revolution. Twenty years ago the \ncountry then known as Czechoslovakia freed itself of communist control, \ninstituted democratic elections, and set out to adapt its command \neconomy to the free market.\n  The remarkable swiftness which ushered out the former government \nwhile maintaining relative order and peace was inspiring to the world \nas we watched apprehensively the events unfolding. Czechoslovakia's \nmove away from communism and toward greater political independence, led \nto the eventual separation of the country into the current Czech \nRepublic and Slovak Republic.\n  During the past 20 years, remarkable change has taken place as both \nthe Czech Republic and Slovak Republic have sought and achieved \nmembership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. The Czech \nRepublic was accepted as a member of NATO in 1999, as was the Slovak \nRepublic in 2004. Both nations are now formal members of both NATO and \nthe United Nations, and their military units now contribute to \nimportant missions throughout the globe and continue to play a \nstrategic role in the region.\n  Furthermore, the Czech Republic has a local tie near to my heart \nassociated with its NATO admission. The documents of admission were \nsigned at the Presidential library of Missouri's own President Truman \nin Independence, MO. As we work to pursue our mutual interests, I wish \nboth the Czech Republic and the Slovak Republic continued success and \nprosperity as we work toward mutual goals.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11015-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11015]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak both about the substance \nof the amendment in front of us that I understand Senator Reid and the \ndistinguished chair of the Finance Committee, Senator Baucus, have put \nforward, the substance of it and supporting it, and also on the time it \nhas taken us to get to this point, which is of tremendous concern to \nme. I know it is also to many other people, certainly people in the \ngreat State of Michigan, which I represent.\n  I believe we are on week 5 of trying to extend unemployment benefits \nfor people who, through no fault of their own, have lost their jobs, \nare looking for work, trying to hold things together, trying to keep a \nroof over their families' heads and keep food on the table, and \nMichigan is getting cold, so the heat is coming on. They are trying to \ndo that while looking for a job.\n  People want to work. People in Michigan work and they want to work. \nThey are skilled and they are ready to work. We know that for every one \njob available, there are six people trying to get that job. So we are \nin an extremely difficult time. That is why we extended unemployment \nbenefits in the Recovery Act. I thank our President. We had challenges \nunder the previous President in being able to do that. President Obama \nput that forward, and I am grateful for his continual support and all \nof our colleagues who supported that.\n  But now we find that even as things very slowly begin to turn in the \neconomy, every day we still have 70,000 people who are going off of \ntheir unemployment insurance benefits and they still cannot find a job. \nThese are middle-class Americans who have played by the rules, and what \nis happening is not their fault. They are trying to keep things going \nuntil they can find a job.\n  We have now spent weeks and weeks trying to get to this bill. Since \nwe started debating this on the Senate floor, as of today, 186,000 more \npeople have lost their benefits and are trying to figure out what in \nthe world they are going to do for their families. That is the \nsituation we are in.\n  We have in front of us a very important amendment that has been \nworked on on a bipartisan basis. I congratulate everyone who worked on \nthis together. I hope we will pass this quickly and move on and send \nthe right message to people in this country that we get it, that we \nunderstand what is going on for families.\n  Let me speak about the amendment, and then I will speak about the \nprocess.\n  The amendment would allow an extension of 14 weeks for anyone who is \ncurrently unemployed in their State and qualifies for unemployment \ninsurance and an additional 6 weeks, totaling 20 weeks, for people in \nmy great State who have been hit too hard for too long. So we need to \nget this passed.\n  There are other provisions that have been combined with this. One of \nthe other successes--in fact, I am proud, as the original author of \ncash for clunkers, to have Congress talk about that and the first-time \nhome buyers tax credit. That has helped the economy. We know there is \nan expiration of the first-time home buyers $8,000 tax credit, so we \nextend that. There are other provisions in there as well.\n  There is another provision I am proud to have helped champion in the \nFinance Committee and now in this legislation, which is to allow \ncompanies that are struggling in this economy to keep themselves going, \nto keep people employed, to keep their lights on, and to be able to get \nimmediate help with the net operating loss carryback--it is the way \nthey calculate their losses--which will allow capital to immediately \nflow for small, medium, and large companies that are cash-strapped. \nThat capital will help businesses be able to hire people, purchase \nequipment, or to turn their businesses around to be able to keep things \ngoing and keep their businesses going. That is in this provision as \nwell. It is an important bipartisan effort.\n\n[[Page S11016]]\n\n  According to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, the \nexpansion we are talking about would inject $34 billion into businesses \nand our economy immediately.\n  This is about jobs. This is about supporting our small businesses \nthat are having a very tough time getting capital. The CEO of the Home \nBuilders Association claims that tax credits from the tax provisions \nwould provide midsize and larger homebuilders enough funding to save \n30,000 jobs that would have been lost without this change. So we have \nan important provision that has been worked on in a bipartisan way.\n  These items were something that we as a majority--our leader had come \nto the floor to support now for some time, to say let's get on with it; \nwe need to support these provisions for homeowners, businesses, and \nhelp those who are currently unemployed. Let's get on with it. We are \nnow at a point to vote on this amendment. What concerns me is the time \nit has taken us to be able to do that.\n  Over and over again, we have seen a pattern this year. In fact, we \nhave seen 85 different times that the party of no has objected over and \nover to bringing up legislation--to even bringing up the unemployment \nlegislation. It is a very simple thing for the leader to come to the \nfloor to ask unanimous consent to go to a bill. But we are seeing \nobjections over and over. Every time there is an objection, we are \nrequired to go through our own process. We find we have to file a \nmotion called a cloture motion. You have to wait 2 days, and at the end \nof that 2 days, you vote. If there are 60 people who vote to proceed, \nyou do that. We are finding over and over that we are getting \noverwhelming support to proceed.\n  At different times, we object to things with which we substantively \ndisagree. That is our right as Senators. But we got to this cloture \nvote, and 87 people voted to go to the unemployment benefits \nlegislation and to this amendment. So there is not an objection. This \nis about winding out the hours on the clock so we cannot get to health \ncare, we cannot get to other jobs measures. And health care is about \njobs, certainly in my State. When you lose your job, you lose your \nhealth care. We have seen that over and over.\n  Now we are in the process of this 30 hours. We voted to bring the \ndebate to closure on this amendment we have, which is bipartisan, \ndealing with housing and support for businesses and the unemployed. Yet \nwe have to go another 30 hours, which won't end until about midnight \ntonight, before we can actually vote. Then we will turn around and \nagain there will be something else. The next move the leader tries to \nmake, there will be an objection and we will have to wait 2 more days. \nWe will vote on whether to proceed. Most of the time, everybody votes \nto proceed. Then we start a 30-hour clock, and then we vote on it. It \ngoes over and over. Eighty-five different times, we have either had \nthis process or an objection.\n  Mr. President, I just wanted to raise this for the American people as \nwe move forward now. Everyone knows we have big problems. We can have \nhonest differences about how to address those. That is our job. But we \nare seeing over and over a party of no, no, no stopping things. Heaven \nforbid that this President be successful or this Congress be \nsuccessful. That is of great concern to me, in a State with the highest \nunemployment in the country, where every day we have people saying: Why \nin the world can't you act? Why can't you get things done?\n  The reason we are finding ourselves in this position now is an effort \nto slow-walk the entire year. It is amazing. We have actually gotten \nmore done in this year than at any other time since FDR and the Great \nDepression despite all of this. Now we have come to a point where, by \nthe end of the year, we want to have something extremely important \naccomplished on health care, and that relates to jobs and the economy. \nWe are seeing objection after objection.\n  I am hopeful there will be a willingness to step up and debate our \ndifferences and have a vote. Let's just have a vote and work together \nto be able to solve problems. The American people are very tired of \nthis. They want us to get something done. We want to get something \ndone. We are committed to it whether it takes 30 hours and days and \nobjections or whether we can just do this and come together. Either \nway, we are going to get this done. It is important to understand that \nreal people are being impacted every single time there is an objection. \nRight now in this economy, the American people deserve better than what \nhas been happening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n     HEALTH CARE REFORM\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I wish to talk this afternoon about health \ncare and specifically the impact of some of the proposals we have on \nthe cost of health care insurance. Before I do so, I think I must \nrespond to some of the comments that were just made by the Senator from \nMichigan accusing the Republican Party of being the party of no. It \nseems we are starting to get to a point here where bipartisanship is \nnot being achieved. But it seems the definition of bipartisanship is \nbecoming ``either do it our way or you are the party of no.''\n  It seems to me what we need to really do is step back and take a \ncouple of deep breaths and start working together on legislation. I \nwill use the example the Senator from Michigan used, the unemployment \ninsurance compensation legislation. As she correctly indicated, there \nwere 87 votes to move forward with this legislation. This is not an \neffort to obstruct the legislation. The effort that caused us to slow \ndown a couple of days on this legislation was an effort to improve it. \nIn fact, had we not slowed down a couple days, the bill would have gone \nthrough and would have been passed, but it would not have the home \nbuyer tax credit in it for the purchase of homes. It wouldn't have the \nnet operating loss carryback provisions in it. They are both important \nprovisions for creating jobs rather than just providing a safety net \nfor those who lost jobs. The bill has been improved, and I think it \nwill be further improved by the time we have the final vote.\n  It is that process of give-and-take, trying to work on and improve \nthe legislation, that occasionally causes the Republican side to say: \nNo, we are not going to move forward until we have an opportunity to \npresent some amendments and until we have bipartisan work to help \nimprove the legislation. That is what happened in this case.\n  In reality, the majority party has 60 votes. If they want to proceed \non anything, they can do so. In this case, on the unemployment \ninsurance bill, they did stop and allow us another couple of days to \nwork on it and improve it with the home buyer tax credit and the \noperating net loss carryback provisions.\n  Mr. President, I will now address the question of health care. It is \ninteresting. One of the comments the Senator from Michigan also made \nwas that we cannot get to the health care bill because we are spending \nour time on the unemployment compensation bill. The reality is that we \ndon't even know what the health care bill is yet. The bill was crafted \nbehind closed doors in the Capitol Building, and it is being scored by \nCBO. We don't know when CBO will have the full bill to score or whether \nthe full bill has even been drafted. We don't know what it contains.\n  That is in stark contrast to the President's commitment on how this \nprocess would proceed. The President stated in the San Francisco \nChronicle in January of last year:\n\n       These negotiations will be on C-SPAN . . . and the public \n     will be part of the conversation and we will see the choices \n     that are being made.\n\n  He indicated that everybody should be in the room and it should be \nbroadcast on C-SPAN. Instead, there is a very small group of people \nfrom the White House and the majority leader's office and probably a \ncouple of senior Senators he is working with who know what is in the \nbill. The rest of us don't know.\n  Frankly, the reason we are not moving to the bill has nothing to do \nwith procedural maneuvers on the floor. It has to do with the fact that \nthe bill is not drafted yet or prepared and ready to bring forward.\n  Let me move to the actual bill itself. In this context, I have great \nconcerns\n\n[[Page S11017]]\n\nwith the legislation that is being brought forward on many different \nfronts. It expands the Federal Government by about $1.2 trillion, \ndepending on how you count it; some say up to $1.8 trillion. It imposes \nmassive new taxes and cuts in Medicare of equal amounts to balance it \noff and make it appear it is not increasing the deficit. By cutting \nMedicare, it seriously jeopardizes the quality of health care we \nprovide to our seniors in this Nation and, as I indicated, the massive \nnew taxes that are involved, which fall squarely on the backs of the \nmiddle class, violating another one of the promises President Obama \nmade. In doing so, it does not achieve the very objectives our citizens \nin the United States ask of us in health care reform.\n  What am I talking about? That is what I want to focus the rest of my \nremarks on today.\n  When you ask most Americans, Do we need to reform health care in the \nUnited States, they will say yes. What they mean when they say that is \nthey are tired of the double-digit, skyrocketing inflation of the cost \nof their health insurance and the cost of medical care in the United \nStates, and they think Congress should do something about it, that \nCongress should ``bend the cost curve down''--that is the phrase that \nhas been made popular--and they believe Congress can do something about \nit and help control these skyrocketing costs of health care.\n  They also believe we should try to find a way to get access to those \nwho are needy and unable to purchase their own insurance. They know we \nare providing for the cost of health care for those who do not have \ninsurance and they do get it in a much more expensive way and in a way \nthat does not give them the quality of health care they should get. \nThat is what Americans think of when they are asking for health care \nreform. But center in the focus of the American people out of what they \nwant out of health care reform is control of the costs of health care \nand control of the skyrocketing costs of the insurance they pay.\n  On that issue, the bills before us fail dramatically because not only \ndo they grow the Federal Government, not only do they increase taxes, \nand not only do they deeply cut Medicare, they will increase the cost \nof health care insurance and increase the cost of medical services in \nour country beyond what growth they would have seen without the \nlegislation.\n  I will go through a couple of examples, focusing on the bill that \nwent through the Senate Finance Committee. It includes, as I have \nindicated, significant amounts of taxes and different kinds of taxes on \ndifferent parts of the economy. Both the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have stated that a \nnumber of the taxes included in the Senate Finance Committee bill will \nbe passed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, CBO Director Douglas Elmendorf \nstated:\n\n       Our judgment is that that piece of legislation--\n\n  Referring to the provisions increasing taxes in this legislation--\n\n     would raise insurance premiums by roughly the amount of the \n     money collected.\n\n  Meaning in one of the particular cases there is a $6.7 billion tax \nimposed on insurance companies. His point is that $6.7 billion tax is \ngoing to raise the cost of insurance.\n  Another example in the bill, there is a tax on medical devices. Both \nCBO and JCT have said this tax on medical devices will be passed on to \npatients, increasing their health insurance premiums and increasing the \nprices on everything from powered wheelchairs to pacemakers.\n  Another example is the tax on insurers. I mentioned the tax on \ninsurers is what generated this answer. CBO and Joint Tax have said \nthis tax will be passed through, and some estimates on this passthrough \nshow this tax on insurers could raise premiums for American families by \nas much as $500 a year.\n  The Congressional Budget Office sent a letter to Senator Grassley \nlast week in response to his inquiry about this provision and stated:\n\n       While uncertainty exists, we assume that a very large \n     portion of this excise tax on purchased insurance will be \n     borne by consumers in most markets, including in some markets \n     with a high level of concentration among market participants \n     covered by the proposed excise tax.\n\n  Still quoting the letter:\n\n       While consumers or employers may respond by changing their \n     insurance coverage from more expensive coverage to less \n     expensive plans to offset any potential price increase, this \n     behavior, too, is properly characterized as the consumers \n     bearing the burden of the excise tax by accepting lower \n     quality (for example, a more restricted physician network) \n     for the same price rather than paying a higher price for the \n     quality [that they would have had had there been] no tax.\n\n  Again, still quoting from the letter:\n\n       Our estimate is that the premiums for purchased health \n     insurance policies, including the tax liability, would be \n     between 1.0 and 1.5 percent greater than they otherwise would \n     be as a consequence of the industry fee for calendar years \n     2010, 2011, and 2012.\n\n  Joint Tax did not estimate the years beyond that and were not able to \ndo a distributional analysis based on income as to where those with \nhigher premiums would most likely fall. But we know, again, it is \nalmost certain it will hit those in the middle class.\n  Premiums are also going to rise because of the new excise tax on so-\ncalled Cadillac health plans. Many believe that companies will respond \nto this new tax by either passing the costs on to consumers or cutting \nbenefits so the plan can avoid the tax. Inevitably, like the AMT, the \nalternative minimum tax, the impact of this tax will be passed along to \nmore and more people, not just those with Cadillac plans, either in the \nform of higher costs or lower benefits.\n  That is how the tax-and-fee provisions portion of the bill impact \nhealth insurance. And there are many more. But what other provisions in \nthe bill impact the cost of insurance? The insurance mandates in the \nbill will have similar impacts on raising the cost of health care \ninsurance for Americans.\n  The Finance Committee bill also contains a number of market reforms \nthat will result in these higher premiums. For example, the new \nfederally mandated rating rules will result in a huge premiums increase \nfor younger and healthier individuals.\n  In my home State of Idaho, studies have shown that a 20-year-old male \ncan go out today and buy a policy in the individual market for $67.63 a \nmonth. A 20-year-old female can buy a policy for $94.35 a month. If the \ninsurance rating reforms in the Finance Committee bill are enacted, \nthose exact same policies would rise to a level of $166.75 per month. \nThat is a 147-percent increase for a 20-year-old male and a 77-percent \nincrease for a 20-year-old female.\n  These figures, frankly, are optimistic for several reasons. They \nassume that the young and healthy will continue to purchase insurance. \nIf they do not continue to buy insurance, the premiums would likely be \neven higher than those which were shown in the studies.\n  In addition, these rate estimates assume a 4-to 1 age rating band. \nThe House bill introduced last week contains a 2-to-1 age rating band \nmandate, meaning that the rates for the young and healthy, again, would \nbe made significantly worse.\n  In addition, many of the proposals in Congress contain mandates about \nwhat an insurance policy must include. Here is an example of what we \ncan see in that context: An older gentleman wanting to purchase \ninsurance in the new exchange to be created may not be able to save \nmoney by enrolling in a more basic plan. Instead, it would not be \npossible for him to enroll in a policy that does not include maternity \ncare and newborn care, something he may not want or need to purchase.\n  The actuary firm of Oliver Wyman, in a study commissioned by Blue \nCross/Blue Shield, concluded that insurance reforms in the bill and the \nminimum required benefit levels in the Baucus bill could drive up \nfamily premiums for new coverage by as much as $3,024.\n\n  My point is, both the taxes and fees and the insurance mandates will \ngenerate higher premiums, not lower premiums, for Americans, exactly \nthe opposite of what Americans are asking for in health care reform.\n  Similarly, both the House bill and the Baucus bill, and what we \nexpect to see in the Senate bill when it finally comes out, will have a \nsignificant expansion of moving those in lower income categories into \nMedicaid rather than providing a way for them to obtain insurance.\n  The Baucus bill contains an enormous expansion of Medicaid, up to 133\n\n[[Page S11018]]\n\npercent of poverty. That means 14 million more people are going to be \nenrolled in the Medicaid Program, the largest expansion since it was \ncreated in 1965, a program that financially is going to hit the cliff \nsoon. We know we are undercompensating for medical services in \nMedicaid, which ultimately results in those undercompensated costs of \nhealth care being borne by the rest of the insuring population in the \nUnited States with higher premiums.\n  So what are we going to do? We are going to expand a program that \ndrives a lot of its costs off onto the private sector so we can avoid \nthe need to identify the way to move forward and develop a true reform \nthat will enable those who are needy and uninsured to be able to obtain \ninsurance. Instead, we are going to push them onto the Medicaid system \nand, again, drive up premiums.\n  Those who are pushing this legislation have responded to some of \nthese arguments by saying: The subsidies we are providing in the bill \nfor those with lower incomes will help to reduce insurance costs. If \nyou focus on those who receive the subsidies, of course, their \ninsurance costs may go down. But this is true for only a very small \nnumber of Americans.\n  The reforms in the Finance bill will raise health care costs for most \nAmericans while lowering them for some through subsidies. But there are \nseveral important points to make on the subsidy argument.\n  First, the credits and subsidies are only available for those who \nreceive insurance through the new exchange. In other words, if you get \nyour insurance through your employer, which most Americans do, you do \nnot qualify for any subsidy support.\n  CBO has estimated that only 23 million Americans will receive \ninsurance in that fashion. If you do the math, that represents 8 \npercent of the 282 million nonelderly Americans. Why do we take the \nnonelderly number? Because elderly Americans are covered by Medicare.\n  Let's put up a chart. The subsidies are not available for individuals \nwho get insurance through their employer and, instead, those \nindividuals will pay higher premiums for those who receive the \nsubsidies. Here is the way it works out. You have about 185 million \nAmericans who will be paying more taxes and higher health care \npremiums, and about 18 million Americans who will actually see their \nhealth care premiums go down because they will receive a Federal \nsubsidy.\n  While it is true that the subsidy will help reduce the health care \ncosts of those who receive it, it is not true that the health care \ncosts for every other American are going to go up, again I want to \npoint out, in two significant ways. The 185 million Americans who are \nnot participating in the subsidy will pay more in taxes--and \nsignificantly more in taxes--and will pay more in their health care \ninsurance premiums. That is not the kind of reform, again, that the \npeople of the United States are asking for.\n  One last point, and that is about this proposal to have the Federal \nGovernment step in and create a government health care company. A \ngovernment-run health care insurance company is promoted by saying we \nneed a competitor for the private sector. I think most Americans see \nthrough that. But last week, CBO released their score of the House bill \nwhich creates just such a government-run health care company. Their \nscore shows that the new government plan would typically have premiums \nthat are higher than the average premiums for private plans.\n  What is CBO saying? The CBO letter then states that although the \ngovernment plan would likely have lower administrative costs than the \nprivate plans--which is one of the key arguments that is often made--\nthe government plan would--and I am quoting from CBO--``probably engage \nin less management of utilization by its enrollees and attract a less \nhealthy pool of enrollees,'' resulting in higher premium costs in the \ngovernment plan.\n  So now what do we have? We have a government plan into which we are \ngoing to push a lot of Americans, unwillingly, which will charge higher \npremiums than the private sector. We have taxes, penalties, fees, and \nmandates being imposed on the private sector that are going to drive up \ntheir premiums as well. It is all justified by the argument that we \nneed to somehow create a government control of health care so we can \nreduce the costs. There are other ways to reduce the costs. I don't \nhave time in my remarks today to get into those, but there are a number \nof proposals we do know about for which we have bipartisan support that \nwill help us address that cost curve.\n  It is my hope we will reject these proposals that take us down the \nwrong path and result in the wrong solutions for Americans in health \ncare reform and begin focusing on what I started out with--that cost \ncurve about which most Americans are so concerned. We can drive down \nthat cost curve without raising taxes, and that is where this Congress \nought to be spending its attention.\n\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is no order on time, so the Senator is \nfree to proceed.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I noticed the Senator from Michigan was on the floor earlier, and she \nhad a chart which said: ``85 Times No.'' I think she should have turned \nit around and faced it toward the Democratic leader. That means that 85 \ntimes the Democratic leader has said no to Republicans: No, you can't \noffer amendments and we are going to cut off debate. We have had this \ndiscussion many times. The Senator from West Virginia, Mr. Byrd, is the \nexpert on this. There are two things that make the Senate unique. One \nis virtually unlimited debate and virtually unlimited amendments. So if \nyou are from a smaller State, such as Tennessee or Delaware or anywhere \nin this country, your citizens can send you here and, even if you are \nin the minority, you are allowed to speak. Your voice can be heard and \nyou are allowed to offer amendments.\n  We have procedures for cutting that off, but we only do it on rare \noccasions. So what the Senator from Michigan is basically saying is--\nand I don't believe I would bring this up, if I were she--that 85 times \nthe majority leader has cut us off and said: We are not going to hear \nfrom you. So I think that argument is an argument we should have at the \nappropriate time, but I have a different point I would like to make.\n  I would like to continue the health care discussion because I think \nwe are making some progress. One of the most eloquent and effective \nspeakers on the Democratic side of the aisle is the assistant \nDemocratic leader, the Senator from Illinois, who is a good friend and \na person I admire a great deal. Yesterday, he came to the floor and \nasked: Where is the Republican alternative on health care and how many \npages does it have? He heard me say the other day that the era of the \n1,000-page bill is over because we have a 2,000-page bill from the \nHouse of Representatives on health care. So he says: Well, where is the \nRepublican health care plan? How many pages in it?\n  The Senator from Illinois was quite proud of the fact that I couldn't \nsay how many pages were in the Senate Democratic plan, but of course I \nhaven't seen it. Almost no one has seen it. It is being written behind \nclosed doors. This was supposed to be the era of great transparency; \nthat we would all know what was going on. President Obama, to his great \ncredit, said: We will have all this on C-SPAN so you will know if the \ndrug companies or if the insurance companies or if the lobbyists are in \nthere writing the bill. So what do we have? We have the majority leader \nand two Democratic Senators and some people from the White House behind \nclosed doors writing the health care bill.\n  Of course, we don't know exactly how many pages it will have because \nwe aren't let in the room. We can't see the bill. We can't count the \nlobbyists, if they are there; we can't count the companies with which \ndeals might be made, if they are there. We don't know. But here is what \nwe do know. We do know the HELP Committee, on which I serve, passed an \n839-page health care bill. We do know the Senate Finance Committee \npassed a 1,502-page bill, and we know the House of Representatives is \nworking on a 1,990-page bill, not counting the physicians reimbursement \nfix, which is bound to push it over 2,000 pages.\n\n[[Page S11019]]\n\n  The pages in these bills are going up faster than the national debt, \nand it is an issue with the American people. So until the various \nwriters emerge from behind closed doors, we are going to have to go \nwith what we have, which is a 2,000-page congressional Democratic \nhealth care bill, of which the Wall Street Journal editorial said \nyesterday, when fully implemented, would cost $2 trillion over a 10-\nyear period of time.\n  Here is what else we know about the 2,000-page bill. It will raise \npremiums. The Senator from Idaho just spoke to that. It will cut more \nthan $500 billion in Medicare, and it will cut it from Medicare to \nspend it on a new entitlement program, even though the Medicare \ntrustees say Medicare is going broke in 2015 to 2017. The Senator from \nKansas said it is akin to writing a check on an overdrawn bank account \nto buy a big, new car. The banker wouldn't let you do it, and the \nAmerican people shouldn't let us do it.\n  There will be higher taxes. Everyone understands that the $1 \ntrillion, fully implemented over 10 years, will mean higher taxes. Who \nis going to pay those? Not the medical device companies, not the \ninsurance companies. They are going to pass them right on to whom? The \nAmerican people--the 250 million of us who have health insurance \npremiums. So our premiums are going to go up.\n  There will be more debt. Fortunately, on the first vote we had on \nhealth care the other day, 13 Democrats, with all 40 Republicans, said: \nNo, we are not going to start off this debate by adding $\\1/4\\ trillion \nto the national debt, even for the worthy purpose of fixing the \nphysicians reimbursement problem, which we all want to fix. We are \ngoing to have to find some way to pay for that within the health care \nbill, within the spending we have.\n  We now have a government-run plan. I have always thought that was a \nlittle like President Obama saying: In order to keep Ford Motor Company \nhonest, I am going to put the government into the car business. Well, \nwe nearly have, but that usually isn't the way we do things in the \nUnited States. But we are going to have a government-owned, government-\nrun health care plan. Of course, we already have two--one is Medicare \nfor seniors, and we have a government-run plan that States can ``opt \nout of'' called Medicaid.\n  The Presiding Officer, the former Governor of Delaware, and I both \nknow from our previous experience it is a big problem. Medicaid and \nMedicare have been going up at the rate of 8 or 9 percent a year for \nmany years. State budgets dealing with Medicaid only go up 2 or 3 \npercent for schools and roads and universities. So what happens is, \nwhen the Governor of Delaware or the Governor of Tennessee or the \nGovernor of California sit and make up the budget, you get to the end \nof the line and there is no money left for higher education because we \nput it all into Medicaid. That means tuition goes up or services go \ndown.\n  With a government-run plan--and this is something the American people \nare just now beginning to realize--millions of people who now get their \ninsurance from their employers are going to lose it. They are going to \nlose it because their employer is going to look at this big, new bill \nand say: I can't afford this. I am going to pay the penalty. I am out \nof the health care business, and you can go into the government plan. \nSo all 177 million people who have employer health care insurance run a \nrisk with a government plan--under this framework we are discussing, \nthat we haven't been able to see yet--that an increasing number of \nemployers will say: I am out of here. We will let the government \nprovide the insurance. Suddenly, you will find yourself in the \ngovernment-run plan.\n  What happens in the government-run plan? Some things are good about \nMedicare--the government-run plan for seniors--and some things are bad \nabout Medicaid, which is the largest government-run plan. One thing bad \nabout it is, 50 percent of doctors will not see new patients because \ntheir physician reimbursement is at about 60 percent of what physicians \nmake when they go to a private insurance company. In Medicare, it is \nnot as bad as that. It is about 83 or 84 percent of doctors are paid \nwhat they would get paid if they saw a patient with private insurance. \nSo if you lose your insurance and you end up in the government-run \nplan, you may end up in a plan such as the Medicaid plan, a government-\nrun plan where 50 percent of the doctors will not see new patients.\n  The Governors of the States are in a state of apoplexy--would be \nabout the only word to describe it--because they are in the worst shape \nthey have been in dozens of years. I know in the State of Tennessee \nthere are $1 billion in just cuts. Everything has been cut, prices are \ngoing up, and people are being laid off, even though we have a very \nconservative, well-managed State. Yet one of the ways being proposed to \npay for this bill is to shift some of the cost--about $34 billion at \nleast--to States. Governors--both Democratic and Republican--are \nsaying: Please don't do that to us. We can't afford that. We don't have \nthe money for it. We have to balance our budget. If Washington wants to \nexpand Medicaid, Washington should pay for Medicaid.\n  Higher premiums, Medicare cuts, higher taxes, more debt, government-\nrun plan, millions losing coverage, inevitable rationing, States \ncomplaining, some going bankrupt, and a $2 trillion cost is not health \ncare reform. But the assistant Democratic leader asked a good question. \nHe asked: What is the Republican plan? If our plan has 2,000 pages, how \nmany pages does your plan have? Well, I would say, with all respect for \nhim, that if he is looking for someone with a wheelbarrow to wheel into \nthe Senate Chamber a competing 2,000-page Republican bill costing $2 \ntrillion, he is never going to see it. He will be looking in vain \nbecause that is not what we propose. We have been saying, over and over \nagain on the Senate Floor and in other places, we are going in the \nwrong direction; we need to start over; our goal should be to reduce \ncosts--the cost to each of us who pay premiums, the cost to all of us \nwho have to pay the Federal Government debt. We should set a clear goal \nof reducing costs and move step by step toward that goal of reducing \ncosts to re-earn the trust of the American people.\n\n  Americans instinctively distrust these comprehensive, change-the-\nworld, never-mind-the-cost, 2,000-page risky schemes, one of which is \nthe health care plan that is coming toward us. We have proven in this \nChamber we don't do comprehensive well. We had our best Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle working hard on immigration--Senator Kennedy, \nSenator McCain, Senator Kyl, Senator Martinez--and what happened? It \nfell of its own weight. We bit off more than we could chew. The \neconomy-wide cap and trade is running into the same problem. So is \nhealth care.\n  With taxes, mandates, surprises, debt, and more Washington takeover, \nwe are scaring the daylights out of the American people with these \nproposals. Instead of that, we on the Republican side believe we should \nhave health care reform, but its goal should be reducing costs, and we \nshould go step by step toward that goal. Going step by step in the \nright direction is one good way to get our country where it needs to \ngo.\n  So instead of a 2,000-page congressional Democrats' health care plan, \nhere is the Republican plan, and I have counted the pages. No. 1, small \nbusiness health care plans. This leverages the number of small \nbusinesses and allows them to pool their resources and offer health \ncare to more Americans. That is 88 pages, proposed by Senator Enzi. No. \n2, allow Americans to purchase health care across State lines to \nencourage competition--30 pages, proposed by Senator DeMint. No. 3, \nreduce junk lawsuits. Medical malpractice lawsuits drive up the cost of \nhealth care. There is some question how much it drives it up, but there \nis no question it drives up the cost. That is Senator Gregg's bill on \nthat, and it is 19 pages. No. 4, equal tax treatment for health care. \nThat is Senator Bennett's bill, which is 21 pages. No. 5, health \ninformation technology--a subject we should be able to agree on in a \nbipartisan way--is 13 pages, by Senators Coburn, Burr, and Enzi. No. 6, \nhealth care exchanges, creating more of those for people to look for \nthe lowest cost insurance. That takes eight pages in the bill, proposed \nby Senators Coburn and Burr. No. 7, Senator LeMieux, one of our newest \nSenators, proposed a bill on the subject of waste, fraud, and abuse. We \nknow that is a scandal, particularly with Medicaid and Medicare.\n\n[[Page S11020]]\n\nThe Government Accountability Office has said that $1 out of $10 in \nMedicaid is waste, fraud, and abuse, accounting for $32 billion a year, \nwhich is $320 billion over 10 years.\n  So there are seven steps in the right direction of reducing cost. \nTaking just one of those steps--the small business health care plans, \nS. 2818, leveraging strength in numbers--here is what the Congressional \nBudget Office says about the small business health care plan: 750,000 \nmore Americans would be covered. These would be people working for \nsmall businesses. It would lower the premium costs for three out of \nfour employees. It would reduce Medicaid spending--and that is the \nprogram that is causing the States so many problems--by $1.4 billion.\n  So why don't we pass that? Why don't we pass it? Why don't we take \nthat one step toward reducing costs and then take a second step and a \nthird step and a fourth step? Gradually, as we reduce costs, as the \nsmall business health care plans will do, we can add uninsured people \nto the rolls. That would reearn the trust of the American people. That \nwould be something we could actually get done. That would be something \nthat would be bipartisan, would create confidence, and help us reach \nthe goal we have set for ourselves.\n  We have clear choices. We have 2,000-page bills or the bills I just \nadded up--those seven steps proposed by Republicans, many of which have \nDemocratic support as well--that would be 200. So 2,000 pages or 200 \npages; reduce premiums or increase premiums; reduce debt or increase \nthe debt; reduce Medicare or make Medicare solvent; higher taxes or no \ntax increase.\n  The American people want real health care reform. They want to reduce \ncosts and add coverage, as we can afford it. They are properly \nskeptical of grand and risky schemes that claim we in the Senate and \nthe House are wise enough to solve everything at once. They know if we \ntry to do that, we are more likely to mess up everything at once. They \nknow about the law of unintended consequences.\n  To re-earn the trust of the American people, we should set a clear \ngoal. That goal should be reducing the cost of health care; the cost of \nhealth care when you pay your premium and the cost to your government, \nthe cost of its debt. We should move step by step in that direction. \nThat is the Republican health care plan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I again rise to urge my colleagues, \nparticularly from the other side, to join us in passing the extension \nof unemployment insurance, without delaying action through more \nprocedural votes. We are in the midst of a very complicated and \nimportant debate on health care and we are being urged to move forward \non that. But something that is pressing, in my view, is the need to \nextend benefits to the people who are running out of the ability to \nsupport their families. By my count we on this side of the aisle have \nbeen trying for days to do something that the other body did, with \nbipartisan cooperation, in a vote of 331 to 83 under Suspension of the \nRules.\n  As the President of the Senate knows, this is the way the House moves \nnoncontroversial legislation forward without any delay. It is not used \nfor major legislation such as this, typically, so that underscores the \nbipartisan solution the House proposed to us more than 25 days ago.\n  To compound matters, the other side is now doing more than just \ndelaying unemployment benefits for millions; they are also needlessly \ndelaying tax cuts for small businesses and first-time home buyers. This \nis a very disturbing precedent. The American people, as my colleague \nwas talking about, want to see some results. They want to see us move \non issues that are critically important to them. What could be more \ncritical and more important than extending unemployment benefits to \nthose who have lost their jobs and are in a very difficult economy? \nWhat could be more important to our economy, and to so many people, \nthan extending the further benefits of the tax treatment of new home \nbuyers, which has produced an increase in sales and investment? This is \nthe time to move forward and to also help small businesses. The \nlegislation before us includes not only the extension of unemployment \nbenefits and the tax break for home buyers, but also the preferential \ntax treatment for small businesses in terms of their ability to access \nlosses in the past.\n  With the winter and the holidays approaching, this legislation cannot \ncome soon enough for millions of Americans who are feeling the effects, \nnot of the last 8 months but of the last 8 years, of the Bush economy. \nThis legislation will help people literally put food on the table. It \nwill give them a sense of support and substance as they go forward. It \nwill also help continue the expansion of the economy we have seen. Last \nquarter for the first time in a year we saw growth in the American \neconomy--3.5 percent GDP. To sustain that we have to keep incentivizing \nour economy in many different ways. Two of the provisions included--\nagain with bipartisan support--provide those incentives. Small business \nwill get relief in terms of net operating losses. Individual purchasers \nin the real estate market will get the stimulus of the addition and \nextension of the tax treatment of purchase of homes.\n  But we could anticipate another cloture vote this week, another \nprocedural burden to do something that everybody says we should have \ndone weeks ago. My colleagues on this side have suggested amendments \nthat are not germane--some that we have repeatedly taken up already, \nindeed have passed. But this should be something more than about \nmessaging. This should be about helping the American people. We have \nlegislation before us which incorporates, as mentioned, not just \nunemployment extension but two other benefits, for small businesses and \nfor new home buyers. This compromise before us should not face these \ndelaying tactics. The reality is that 4,000 people in my State need \nthis help right away. They need the unemployment benefit extension. \nThere are thousands more Rhode Islanders who will exhaust their \nbenefits in the next several weeks. Indeed, 3,000 Rhode Islanders are \nreceiving extended benefits, which is the final tranche of unemployment \nbenefits for most. They will be without any real support if we do not \nmove this week, if we do not move promptly, in a timely fashion.\n  The latest compromise provides 14 weeks of unemployment insurance for \njobless Americans in all States, and 20 weeks in those States that have \nthe highest unemployment rates, above 8.5 percent. As I mentioned \nbefore, it also provides help to the home market and help to the small \nbusiness community.\n  These are amendments that are important. They are important to all of \nus. We can look back with some sense of progress on our recent GDP \nnumbers. But you cannot feed your family on GDP. When you are \nunemployed, looking for work, not finding it, you need unemployment \ncompensation benefits. You cannot keep this recovery in the housing \nmarket going, as robust as it has been, without some further \nassistance. You have to create further benefits for small business so \nthey can begin once again to hire Americans. The key to our economic \ncrisis is not growing GDP, it is growing employment. These latter \nefforts will be pointed in that direction as we help people who are \nwithout jobs today.\n  This crisis is nationwide. It is not a red State, blue State problem. \nIt is our problem. Too many Americans will exhaust their benefits by \nthe end of the year. Hundreds of thousands have already exhausted \nbenefits. So this delay has real consequences in the lives of all of \nour constituents in every part of this country. It has already been \nover a month since the House passed their legislation. We could have \npassed this promptly. In fact, if you look at the record, the number of \ncloture votes and everything else, we passed yesterday a cloture vote \non a substitute amendment by 85 to 2. Typically when we have 85 votes \nwe do not go through further procedural amendments. We, by unanimous \nconsent, take up the measure and pass it routinely. What is lacking \nhere is not the 60 votes for cloture, it is unanimous consent; i.e., \nthe consent of our Republican colleagues to move forward.\n  They are not denying us, they are denying the American people. We \nshould take this measure up immediately. With 85-to-2 cloture votes, 85 \npeople\n\n[[Page S11021]]\n\nwill come down, perhaps even all 100, and vote for this bill. But it \nwill be a month after we should have accomplished this task.\n  While we wait, our economy suffers and thousands of Americans do. So \nI urge passage as quickly as possible. I hope Leader Reid would propose \nthat we move to the measure as quickly as possible, that we could avoid \nanother cloture vote, another 85-to-2 vote confirming what we all know, \nthat eventually when we are allowed to vote on final passage, this \nmeasure will pass overwhelmingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Ensign pertaining to the introduction of S. 2724 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions''.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Alaska Native People\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to honor thousands of our \nfellow citizens who do not receive adequate recognition for their \nenormous contributions to our nation, Alaska Natives and Native \nAmericans.\n  President Obama has declared this month Native American Heritage \nMonth. He also hosts an important summit Thursday with our Nation's \ntribal leaders.\n  I salute the President's initiative, which is designed to strengthen \nthe special relationship between the Federal and tribal governments.\n  This week, many Alaska Native leaders have traveled long distances to \nparticipate in this summit because they recognize the great \nsignificance of the Obama administration's historic initiative.\n  These events are especially important to Alaska because we proudly \nclaim the highest per person number of Native Americans in the Nation.\n  Nearly 20 percent of Alaska's population, about 120,000 Alaskans, are \nAlaska Natives.\n  From time immemorial, Alaska's Native people have developed a rich \ncultural heritage and sustained themselves by living close to the land \nin some of the most challenging geography and climate on Earth.\n  Today, the diversity in Alaska's Native community is broad.\n  In scores of tiny villages in some of the most remote regions of our \nNation, Alaska Native people feed their families with subsistence \nhunting, fishing and gathering. This is a way of life practiced by \ntheir ancestors for generations.\n  At the same time in downtown Anchorage, prosperous Alaska Native \ncorporations help fuel our State's economy and employ thousands of \nAlaskans and other Americans from gleaming modern office buildings.\n  This is thanks, at least in part, to actions taken by Congress to \nhelp lay a foundation for success by America's first people and to \nprovide the opportunity for self-determination.\n  The story of Alaska's Native people is one of great success against \nenormous odds.\n  For me, this story is also personal because I was born in Anchorage \nbarely 3 years after Alaska became a State in 1959.\n  In that era, the status of Alaska Natives was bleak. Fewer than 20 \npercent had a high school diploma; less than 1 percent a college \ndegree.\n  Half lived below the poverty line. Fifty percent of Alaska Natives \nlived without indoor plumbing, collecting their waste in what we call a \n``honey bucket.''\n  And nearly two-thirds lacked what we define today as a job. Most \nhunted, fished and lived off Alaska's land and waters to feed their \nfamilies.\n  Today, the lives and achievements of Alaska Native people have \nimproved dramatically. The 1971 Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act was \na completely different model than the reservation system of the lower \n48.\n  It established 13 regional for-profit Native corporations, hundreds \nof village non-profit corporations and empowered Alaska's Native people \nto take their destiny into their own hands.\n  Subsequent amendments to the act, such as those permitting Alaska \nNative corporations to participate in the SBA's minority business 8(a) \nprogram, helped even more.\n  I am proud to note that the Settlement Act was among my dad's \nproudest accomplishments during his single term in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Now, educational attainment is growing, with about half of Alaska \nNatives earning high school diplomas and nearly one-third with at least \nsome college.\n  Less than 25 percent now live below the poverty line. Three-quarters \nlive in homes with the basic clean water and sewer facilities we all \ntake for granted.\n  What is most impressive to me is the success of Alaska Native \ncorporations and tribes. They were formed to help fulfill the Federal \nGovernment's obligation to Alaska's indigenous people.\n  After struggling in their early years, all 12 of Alaska's in-state \nregional profit corporations are profitable, generating about $4 \nbillion in revenues for their Native shareholders.\n  ANCSA corporations are among our State's top employers, providing \njobs for more than 30,000 people. And I submit that these companies are \namong the most socially conscious in the world.\n  Alaska's Native non-profits and tribal organizations partner to \nenrich our State and their members in many ways.\n  They provide the resources that help schools, families and \nindividuals preserve 10,000-year-old languages, values and ways of \nlife.\n  They help address the health needs of Alaska Natives through local \nclinics and hospitals, research centers and by building coalitions with \nlocal, State and Federal partners.\n  They empower self-sufficiency with short-term financial assistance \nwhen it is needed, helping low-income families afford heating fuel and \nelectricity, nutrition services for elders and even burial assistance \nso that family members are treated with dignity and respect.\n  Through increased self-governance, Native tribal organizations in \nAlaska can provide even more essential services, from law enforcement \nto tackling crippling social problems.\n  One of my most rewarding moments so far as a member of this body was \nmaking sure that two dozen brave members of the Alaska Territorial \nGuard all distinguished Alaska Native elders, finally got the \nrecognition they earned for their courageous service to this Nation \nmore than a half century ago.\n  Long before Alaska was a State and our country was engaged in World \nWar II, men like Wendell Booth of Noatak, Paul Kiunya, Sr. of Kipnuk, \nand Victor George of Nulato answered their Nation's call on America's \nmost remote front lines.\n  Last month, the Senate approved an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act of 2010 I sponsored with my colleague, Senator Lisa \nMurkowski.\n  With President Obama signing that bill into law last week, these 25 \nsurviving Territorial Guardsmen finally will receive the retirement pay \nand recognition they earned so many years ago.\n  Great progress has been made over the years in helping establish the \nmeans for rural and Native Alaskans to succeed. Yet much work remains \nto be done.\n  At the top of my Senate agenda are three specific areas of focus to \nensure Alaska's Native people continue to flourish.\n  First, we must make energy affordable for rural Alaskans.\n  Some residents of my State pay the highest energy prices in the \nNation. Electricity in some Alaska villages exceeds $1 a kilowatt hour, \ncompared to just a dime here in Washington.\n  When east coast residents complain about high gas prices, consider \nthat a gallon costs $11 in Noatak, one of Alaska's villages.\n  This is a bitter irony when you consider that Alaska has long prided \nitself as America's energy storehouse, providing the lower 48 States up \nto a quarter of their domestic oil production.\n  We are working to address these problems here in Washington.\n  My off-shore oil development legislation is unique by providing that \nlocal governments and tribes get a share of any revenues from Federal \nOuter Continental Shelf Development. Also try-\n\n[[Page S11022]]\n\ning to kick-start the Alaska natural gas pipeline with Federal loan \nguarantees and other provisions in the Senate energy bill.\n\n  Fortunately, local Alaska leaders are not waiting around for \nWashington to act.\n  Regional leaders like Ralph Anderson of Bristol Bay Native \nAssociation, Tim Towarak through his position with the Bering Straits \nNative Corporation, and Michelle Anderson of Ahtna Development \nCorporation, already are developing comprehensive, regional tribal \nenergy plans.\n  A second major issue facing Alaska's Native people is subsistence, \nthe time-honored practice of harvesting Alaska's rich fish and wildlife \nresources to put food on the table.\n  For the last 10,000-plus years, Alaska's Native people implemented a \nsubsistence model that worked to create abundance for subsistence \nusers. That system is now in disarray.\n  The Obama administration announced plans just last month to revamp \nthat system and I welcome their initiative.\n  We must preserve the rural subsistence priority in Alaska at all \ncosts.\n  Finally, a continuing major issue in rural Alaska is the lack of \nbasic infrastructure. This includes water and sewer systems, so \nAlaskans don't have to live in Third World conditions.\n  It includes expanded broadband technology, so all Alaska children \nhave equal access to the educational wonders of the Internet.\n  We are working to address these needs in Congress. One model for \neconomic development in rural Alaska is the Denali Commission.\n  For more than a decade, this innovative agency has been addressing \nvital needs from health facilities and energy to roads and water and \nsewer systems.\n  I will be seeking the continued support of my colleagues for the \nDenali Commission.\n  Mr. President, the largest annual gathering of Alaska Native people \nconvened in Anchorage just last month as the Alaska Federation of \nNatives convention.\n  Thousands of Alaska Natives from across our State met in Anchorage's \nnew Dena'ina Civic and Convention Center, named in honor of the first \npeople of that region.\n  Their theme spoke to the historic journey of Alaska's Native peoples. \nA journey of overcoming enormous obstacles; a journey full of \naccomplishment and pride.\n  I am honored to join my fellow Alaskans on that journey, and to \nsalute the enormous contributions of Alaska's Native people on this, \nthe first week of Native American and Alaska Native Heritage Month.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly to the issue of the \nunemployment extension, the benefits that would be provided to those \nwho find themselves unemployed today. I note that as we speak, the rate \nnow stands at 9.8 percent and climbing toward 10 percent or double \ndigits.\n  Those are the latest numbers we have in September, and it is pretty \nclear there have been more people laid off since the end of September. \nThere were about 15.1 million unemployed persons in September, and that \nnumber has risen by 7.6 million since the start of the recession.\n  In Arizona, my own State, 77,300 jobs have been lost just since the \nso-called stimulus package was passed. Overall about 2.7 million jobs \nhave been lost in the United States since the stimulus bill. Yet Dr. \nChristina Romer, the Chair of the President's Council on Economic \nAdvisers, predicted with the stimulus bill unemployment would never \nexceed 8.1 percent; and, further, that without the stimulus bill \nunemployment would reach a peak high of 9.1 percent in the first \nquarter of 2010.\n  Obviously, unfortunately, both predictions were far too rosy. As \nRobert Samuelson wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       The rap on stimulus one is that it hasn't yet, as promised, \n     reduced unemployment.\n\n  I found it interesting that President Clinton's Labor Secretary, \nRobert Reich, recently wrote:\n\n       Obama's focus on health care, when the economy is still so \n     fragile and unemployment is moving toward double digits, \n     could make it appear that the administration has its \n     priorities confused.\n\n  That is precisely what public opinion surveys show, as the majority \nof Americans wish that we would address the problem of joblessness and \nthe economy first and worry about doing something about health care \nafter that is fixed.\n  It is interesting that one of the President's economic advisers, \nJared Bernstein, was asked recently on ``The Early Show'' on CBS by \nHarry Smith:\n\n       When does this country start to create jobs on its own?\n\n  Here is what he replied:\n\n       As far as the overall economy is concerned, private sector \n     forecasters tell us that by the second half of next year, net \n     job growth should be positive. Unemployment should be coming \n     down.\n\n  I hope this is ``expectations management'' because the beginning of \nthe second half of next year is still 8 months away. So this is one of \nthe reasons I support the extension of unemployment benefits. We are \ngoing to continue to see unemployment increase, as I said, undoubtedly \nto get above the single digits up into the double-digit atmosphere.\n  There is a problem that makes this worse, and it is one of the \nreasons Republicans have been seeking to have the authority, the \nability to offer an amendment to this legislation. So far, even though \nthis is supposed to be the world's greatest deliberative body, a body \nin which members of both parties get to offer amendments to \nlegislation, not one Republican amendment has been allowed on this \nlegislation.\n  The majority leader makes the call. He says no, I guess; I do not \nwant to hear any Republican ideas on how to deal with the problem. The \nreason this bothers me is because I think at least one of those \namendments is a very good Republican idea on how to deal with the \nproblem.\n  The problem is doing something about unemployment. How could we best \ndeal with the problem of unemployment? Obviously, put people back to \nwork. What are some of the reasons it is hard for businesses to put \npeople back to work? One of them is that we have a tax on an employer \nputting people back to work. It is the unemployment tax itself. How do \nwe pay for the extension of benefits in this legislation? We extend \nthat tax. So what we are doing is, in order to pay for the extension of \nunemployment benefits, we tax the very employers when they hire someone \nand tax them for keeping on their rolls the workers they currently \nhave. We continue that tax in existence in order to pay for the \nextension of benefits.\n  Republicans had a better idea. Let's find another mechanism to pay \nfor an extension of benefits. But no, the majority leader says, you \ncannot offer that amendment.\n  This hurts workers in a variety of ways. Let me explain briefly how \nthe FUTA surtax actually works. This is a $2.6 billion extension that \nis used to pay for the extension of unemployment benefits. It is a tax \namounting to 0.8 percent of payroll that applies to the first $7,000 of \na worker's wages. It is a direct payroll tax. The revenues are then \ndeposited into the Federal unemployment trust fund. It is composed of \ntwo parts: a 0.6-percent permanent tax rate and a 0.2-percent temporary \ntax rate. FUTA only hurts unemployment and job creation since it taxes \nemployers for each employee they hire.\n  According to Mark Wilson of the Heritage Foundation:\n\n       Legally mandated benefits like unemployment insurance are \n     not ``free'' to workers.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Studies indicate that, on average, over 80 percent of the \n     cost of all employer-paid payroll taxes is shifted to workers \n     in the form of lower real paychecks.\n\n  So who is going to pay for the cost of extending the unemployment \nbenefits? The workers themselves.\n  Republicans had a better idea, but we have been prevented from \noffering that idea in the form of an amendment.\n  When we take into account the other mandated requirements on \nemployers, the other private sector mandates such as increasing the \nminimum wage, the resulting higher labor costs will affect an \nemployer's decision about whether and when to hire workers, which \nworker to hire, how much cash to pay the worker, and how long to keep \nthat worker on the payroll. This rise in mandated labor costs paid by \nemployers is one of the most important forces leading companies to lay \noff workers or use part-time or temporary workers or\n\n[[Page S11023]]\n\ncontract labor instead of full-time employees.\n  As I said, while I support extending the benefits, I believe it is \nessential that we address the underlying problems of job creation and \nunemployment. The FUTA tax only makes those problems worse, especially \nfor small businesses. This is why Republicans wanted to offer an \namendment that paid for the benefits extension without the FUTA tax on \njob creation. Why would the majority leader be frightened of this? Why \nwould he not want to even debate this obviously legitimate question? \nThat is one of the reasons action on this bill has been delayed. This \nbill could have been completed 2 weeks ago.\n  I have heard some of my colleagues from the other side come down and \nsay: Why are Republicans holding up the extension of unemployment \nbenefits? I voted for cloture to proceed. I voted for cloture to \nproceed to the substitute. I am not holding up anything. But the \nmajority leader is not holding up his part of the bargain, which is to \nat least allow some amendments--three or four--that Republicans have \noffered. We can't even offer this amendment to offer an alternative way \nto pay for what almost all of us want to do and will end up voting to \ndo.\n  I find it disappointing that a very good Republican idea, an \nobviously legitimate debate to have, whether workers themselves should \nhave to pay for the extension of these benefits and whether that puts \nmore people on the unemployment rolls, to have to pay for the extension \nof benefits as time goes on here--I am very disappointed that not only \nhave we not had the opportunity to offer that amendment but colleagues \nfrom the other side have actually come to the floor and complained that \nRepublicans are somehow to blame for the extension of unemployment \nbenefits not being permitted. When Republicans are not allowed to offer \nthese kinds of amendments, then, yes, we will insist upon a debate \nwhich points out a better idea for solving a problem that every one of \nus wants to solve, the fact that we are not even being allowed to offer \nthe amendment in order to have that debate and challenge our colleagues \nfrom the other side to see whether they want to continue to support \nthis program with a tax on workers or they would like to find a better \nway, the way the Republican Party has proposed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11023-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11023-S11045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       VA HOSPITAL IN MARION, IL\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I will respond to the Senator from Arizona \nafter I speak to an important issue in my home State.\n  My first comment relates to an important VA hospital in Marion, IL. \nIn the fall of 2007, there was an alarming number of deaths at the \nMarion VA hospital, causing a thorough investigation to be initiated in \nWashington. At the end of the investigation, they found that nine \nveterans who had gone into this hospital for surgery had died under \nwhat were considered extraordinary circumstances. The investigation \nwent deeper. As it went deeper, they found clear evidence of \nmalpractice on the part of doctors at this veterans hospital and \nmismanagement by those who brought these doctors to the hospital and by \nthose responsible for supervising them in their activities.\n  As a result of that startling and shameful disclosure in the \ntreatment of the veterans, the surgical unit was basically closed--at \nleast inpatient surgery and many other medical activities were \nrestricted until the investigation was complete, changes were made, and \nnew personnel were brought in so that veterans receive the kind of \nprotection and care they deserve.\n  That investigation resulted in several doctors being dismissed. After \nthe most cursory examination, we found that doctors had been brought to \nthis hospital--at least a particular doctor who had been the subject of \nmalpractice complaints in another State had not been thoroughly \nreviewed in terms of his background before he was brought into this \nveterans hospital, and he, in fact, was performing surgeries at this \nhospital beyond his competency and beyond his authority. That was a \nfact.\n  We started this thorough review with new people at the Marion VA \nCenter.\n  I might say to the Presiding Officer and those following this debate, \nsouthern Illinois is a long way from Chicago. It is 400-plus miles away \nfrom Chicago. It is an area I know well. It is where my family roots \nare. It is an area once represented in Congress by Paul Simon, when he \nwas a Member of the House, and then, of course, he later served in the \nSenate. Paul Simon used to say southern Illinois is the land of grits \nand gospel music. There are parts of southern Illinois that are south \nof Richmond, VA, in terms of latitude, to give an idea. It is the \nSouth.\n  I say that because I want to let people know, in following this \nparticular development, that for many of the people who live in \nsouthern Illinois, in small towns in southern Illinois, in northern \nKentucky, and in eastern Missouri, the Marion VA Medical Center is \ncritically important. It is a long drive from where they live to St. \nLouis or to Indianapolis or some other place. They count on the Marion \nVA hospital. We told these veterans they could count on it, that it \nwould be there to help them when they needed it. So this scandal which \ncame out 2 years ago caught everyone's attention and focused all of us \non solving this problem as quickly as possible.\n  We responded in the Senate. I had a colleague in the Senate then, a \nfellow Senator by the name of Barack Obama. He and I introduced a bill \nthat went after the systemic weaknesses at the VA medical center \nstructure that allowed these deaths to occur. Our bill imposed an \naccountable quality management system on VA medical centers, \non regional networks that monitor and manage the medical centers, and \nthe VA health care system as a whole. We proposed designating a person \nat each level who would be directly responsible for quality management \nand only quality management of health care for veterans. The Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Akaka of Hawaii and \nSenator Richard Burr, a Republican, approved the legislation last \nCongress and reported it out of committee and to the full Senate, where \nit died on the floor.\n\n  Yesterday, I was shocked to learn that a new inspector general's \ninvestigation of the Marion VA Center in August of this year by a \nmedical doctor and his team found that problems identified 2 years ago \nhave not been addressed at the Marion VA Medical Center. Despite this \nnational scandal and the concern we all had about the treatment of \nveterans, many of the concerns and many of the issues that led to the \ndeaths of these innocent veterans have still gone unheeded. In 2 years' \ntime, the medical center responsible for treating veterans living in \nsouthern Illinois has not been able to meet the required standards in \nfacilities safety, patient safety, peer review treatments, and, yes, \nlimiting surgeries to those surgeons who are only approved and licensed \nto perform them. These continued failures are shocking and inexcusable.\n  I and my staff and my colleagues in the House have pressed the VA and \nthe medical center itself repeatedly about bringing this center up to \nthe highest standards. We have visited the facility, convened meetings \nwith employees, administrators, and written letters. We have done all \nwe can think of to make sure our veterans have access to the highest \nlevels of medical care in Marion, IL. We have been told time and time \nagain that Marion's quality of care is being closely monitored and all \nappropriate steps are being taken to rectify the problem. I don't know \nwhat went wrong here, but I know now that these efforts have failed.\n  The inspector general's report of this August is an indictment of all \nof the efforts undertaken by the previous administration and this \nadministration to remedy the problem. I am deeply disappointed that yet \nanother report identifies entrenched and serious problems at Marion.\n  In the report finally released yesterday, the inspector general \ndetails appalling failures of quality management and patient safety \nstandards. I have read the report. Some failures they found are the \nsame ones they found 2 years ago: physicians performing procedures \nwithout required privileges and authority; review of treatment records\n\n[[Page S11024]]\n\nthat is not regular or systematic; where there were reviews of \ntreatment records, no one followed up on questionable treatment \ndecisions as they were made; and, in fact, substandard, unacceptable \nrecord keeping of the deaths after treatment.\n  Other failures in patient care the inspector general found: not \ncomplying with guidelines for patients with a history of methicillin-\nresistant staff infection, known as MRSA. It is a deadly infection that \ncan claim lives. They found an example where an individual who had a \nhistory of this infection was left in an environment where he was \nexposed to other innocent patients. Totally unacceptable. Not grounding \nelectrical equipment in bathrooms, raising the danger of patient \nelectrocutions at one of our veterans hospitals. That is what the \ninspector general found.\n  After 2 years to focus on bringing the Marion VA Center up to the \nbasic standards we should expect of every VA facility, those in the \ndirect line of command at Marion have violated the public trust and \nshould be relieved of their duties until serious questions about this \nmanagement have been answered and resolved.\n  Secretary Shinseki called me on the phone last night, and we had a \nlengthy conversation about Marion. When I first met the general and \ntold him I would support him because of his service to our country and \nhis obvious leadership skills, I talked about the Marion center. I told \nhim it had to be high on his priority list. He said he would take the \ninitial step of removing the Marion director and naming a replacement \nwith a long and respected record of leadership.\n  I wish this new director the best and offer all the help I can to \nprovide and assure veterans in southern Illinois they will receive the \nbest possible care. However, since the problems at Marion have not been \nfixed, more comprehensive and immediate action is required.\n  Yesterday's inspector general report is only one of several \nrevelations of quality-of-care issues in VA facilities to gain notice \nthis year. In June, the inspector general reported that several VA \nfacilities were not properly cleaning endoscopy equipment, potentially \nexposing veterans to infection. In July, weak oversight led to errors \nin cancer treatments at the Philadelphia Veterans Affairs Medical \nCenter, resulting in mistreatment of several veterans. Taken together, \nthe series of problems raise serious questions about how quality of \ncare in the veterans health system is monitored and enforced.\n\n  Since that initial, awful discovery of these unnecessary, shameful \ndeaths in Marion, IL, 2 years ago, we have asked a lot of questions \nabout quality of care that have gone unanswered. We have learned some \nthings. We have learned that VA health care quality assurance programs \nat every level--Federal, regional, and local--could be better. Where \ngood policy is in place, not all health care officials and \npractitioners are following the guidance fully. The shortage of health \ncare professionals means VA hospitals are not doing all they can to \nweed out mistake-prone doctors.\n  I wish to go back to the legislation Senator Obama and I introduced \nin the last Congress. This bill would create a network of health \nquality assurance officers. The idea is we need one designated person \nat each VA facility, in their VISNs and in VA's headquarters, to pay \nattention, strictly, to quality and patient safety issues.\n  So the bill establishes quality management officers at the national, \nVISN, and medical center levels. These officers would be responsible \nfor peer-review mechanisms and for confidential reporting systems, so \nVA employees can literally blow the whistle when they see things happen \nthat endanger the lives and treatment of our veterans.\n  The bill also requires potential VA physicians to disclose their \nemployment history--that is not too much to ask--including negative \nelements in their resume, before they are hired.\n  It also mandates that directors of the regional Veterans Integrated \nService Networks--or VISNs--investigate and personally approve the \ncandidates.\n  Again, this year, as it did in the previous Congress, the Senate \nVeterans' Affairs Committee has reported the bill. They agree with me. \nThey know it is a bipartisan bill, and they support it on a bipartisan \nbasis. This year it is part of the Caregiver and Veterans Omnibus \nHealth Services Act of 2009.\n  Where is this bill? Why wasn't it passed before this inspector \ngeneral came and found the same problems at Marion VA today that led to \nthe deaths of nine innocent veterans 2 years ago? What happened to the \nbill after it was reported to the Veterans' Committee?\n  Well, I can tell you. The bill is sitting on the Senate calendar. It \nis being held by one Senator who opposes moving to the veterans bills. \nHe says it costs too much money. Well, what is a veteran's life worth? \nWe lost nine 2 years ago. The latest report is that there is another \none whose death has not been investigated, which has not had the \nappropriate level of review we would expect in a veterans facility, and \nthis Senator says it is too much to ask that we would put someone in \nplace at that Marion VA, and every VA facility, who would focus on \npatient safety.\n  I want to tell you, that is unacceptable. Putting a hold on a bill \nthat, if it is not passed, could endanger the lives of veterans is \nabsolutely unacceptable. I hope this Senator will have second thoughts \nnow that this inspector general's report is out. We need this quality \nmanagement network in the veterans health system. If this were in place \nand working properly, we could catch those who are taking shortcuts and \ncompromising the quality of care our veterans deserve.\n  But we also have to acknowledge that policies are only as effective \nas the people who implement them. Good practices depend on the \nprofessionals on the ground, so we have to educate and hold \nprofessionals accountable, as well as enacting appropriate quality \ncontrol measures. We have to make veterans hospitals attractive \nemployers so the scarcity of doctors does not create a perverse \nincentive to overlook potential shortcuts.\n  In the overwhelming majority of cases, the Veterans' Administration \nof the United States of America provides veterans with care of the \nhighest quality. VA personnel--and I have met hundreds of them--similar \nto all health care workers, enter their professions because of a \ngenuine personal desire to heal the sick and mend the wounded, \nparticularly those women and men who have served our country. They do \noutstanding work for our veterans every single day, and they deserve \nour gratitude for that effort. We want to help them provide the very \nbest care for veterans everywhere in America.\n  I wish to thank Chairman Akaka and Senator Burr for noting that \nquality management in the VA needs to be restructured to ensure \naccountability. I agree with them completely. But despite the good work \nof the VA, and the wonderful people involved in the VA, clearly, at the \nMarion VA Center our veterans deserve better.\n  I hope we can pass this bill and put in place the kind of safeguards \nthat are needed so we will never have to face another inspector \ngeneral's report such as this. You would think after nine veterans have \nlost their lives, and all the effort that has gone in to understand \nwhy--and stop it from occurring--that we would not be facing an \ninspector general's report that says we are still harboring people who \nare not of the highest quality, in terms of their talents, and \nprotecting procedures and approaches which jeopardize the lives of many \nof these veterans.\n  This bill should be removed from the calendar, brought to the floor, \nand passed immediately. I hope it will pass in an overwhelming fashion \nwith bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, as to the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act, I \nheard the Senator from Arizona come out and talk about the \nunwillingness of the Democratic majority to allow the Republicans to \noffer amendments. He used that as his reason to explain why, for 26 \ndays, the Republicans have held up the extension of unemployment \nbenefits to thousands of people across this country.\n  During that 26-day period of time the Republicans have stopped us \nfrom extending unemployment benefits, 180,000 Americans have seen their \nunemployment benefits end. We know because many of us have heard from \nthem. They are people who have been out of work for a long time and \nlooking for a job without luck. When the unemployment check ends, they \nknow it because that is the check that puts bread on the table. That is \nthe check that pays\n\n[[Page S11025]]\n\nthe mortgage and the utility bills. It keeps their family together.\n  So for almost one calendar month, the Republicans in the Senate have \nstopped the extension of unemployment benefits. Why? The Senator from \nArizona said: Well, because we had some amendments we wanted to offer.\n  Well, this is a legislative body. It is not unreasonable to offer an \namendment. But what he did not say is that some of the amendments had \nnothing to do with unemployment or the state of the economy. Some \npeople may have heard of this organization ACORN. They have been in a \nlot of news recently--videotapes of ACORN employees doing bad things. \nThey were fired. Some are being investigated.\n  We have had about four or five amendments on the floor about ACORN. \nAre we going to investigate them? I am for that. I put an amendment in \nto do that. Are we going to cut off all their government contracts? Are \nwe going to limit the work they can do on this agency or that agency? \nAmendment after amendment after amendment. At a time when we are in the \nmidst of a deep recession, with high unemployment, fighting two wars, \ndebating health care, some Senator thinks this is all about ACORN.\n  So one of the Senators from Louisiana said: I am going to hold up \nunemployment benefits for people across America until I can have \nanother chance to have another debate on another ACORN amendment. Well, \nforgive me, but I think the majority leader was right. That does not \nrelate to unemployment. It does not relate to the state of the economy. \nIt is simply one Senator who is stuck on one theme that has nothing to \ndo with the economy and that Senator was insisting on his amendment or \nunemployment benefits would not move forward.\n  So when the Senator from Arizona talks about the decision of the \nmajority not to allow every amendment to be offered and tie up the \nSenate for days or weeks at a time, it is understandable. I do have to \ntake exception to remarks that were made by my minority whip and friend \nfrom Arizona when he said we are not offering amendments to the \nRepublicans on the unemployment compensation benefits bill.\n  I call his attention to the amendment he voted for yesterday. It was \na cloture motion, which means ending debate on a substitute known as \nthe Reid-Baucus substitute. The Reid-Baucus substitute, which is being \nadded to this unemployment benefits bill, includes, within its pages, \ntwo Republican amendments, the major Republican amendments that have \nbeen offered; one by Senator Johnny Isakson of Georgia about the home \nbuyers credit. It is in here. A Republican amendment is in here. He and \nSenator Dodd have worked out the details. It is included. The second is \nan amendment by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, and it relates \nto some net operating loss tax treatment, which we think may help some \nbusinesses hire people back. Senator Bunning is a Republican. The \namendment was incorporated as a part of it.\n\n  So for the Senator from Arizona to argue that we are not allowing any \namendments is to ignore the very amendment we voted for yesterday. \nThere are Republican amendments here, and they were worked out, as they \nshould be.\n  Does that explain why we have waited almost 4 weeks to extend \nunemployment benefits? The Senator from Arizona takes exception to the \nidea that we would use the insurance fund that is collected from \nemployers and employees across America for unemployment to extend \nunemployment benefits. Well, this is an insurance fund we all pay into, \nin the unlikely event we lose our job, so we can get unemployment \ninsurance.\n  The Senator from Arizona says we should not do that. It is unfair to \ncollect that tax--or FUTA tax, as they call it--to fund unemployment \nbenefits. I think it is perfectly fair. I have never used it once in my \nlife. I do not mind paying into it. I think it is reasonable. If the \nday comes when I need it, it is there. So to say we should stop funding \nthis kind of unemployment insurance benefit is, in my mind, to \njeopardize a safety net many people count on across America.\n  I have received calls from people in my State telling their stories. \nI hope the Senator from Arizona can receive a few of those calls, too, \nfrom his State. I am sure there are people who would contact him on \nthis issue.\n  One lady wrote me and she said:\n\n       I am a 57 year old professional woman [with a masters \n     degree] who was laid off in November 2007, before things got \n     really bad. My unemployment ran out in mid September.\n\n  When this debate had not started, but it was beginning here in the \nSenate. She said:\n\n       I have closed my 401K, my retirement accounts and have \n     spent all my savings to survive thus far--and without having \n     had the help of unemployment benefits, I would have lost \n     everything I have long ago.\n       And don't get me started on my health insurance issues.\n       As Congress debates, people lose everything. Good people \n     who worked their whole lives. Please help pass this bill. It \n     will be too late for me, I am totally tapped out next month, \n     but it will save others.\n\n  A man writes me:\n\n       I am 60 years old. My wife is 56. We were both laid off. Me \n     first, then her.\n       We have worked all our lives. Our unemployment benefits \n     have expired.\n       We were unable to continue paying for Cobra--\n\n  Which is a health insurance option for those who are out of work--\n\n       so we lost that. So now we have no health coverage for the \n     first time in our lives and no benefits.\n       We try to stay optimistic, but the reality is things are \n     tough. We look for work, to no avail. What will happen?\n       Benefits should be extended indefinitely until the job \n     situation improves to the point where people can get a job. \n     In the meantime we'll take what we can get, and hope \n     something good happens.\n\n  This woman, who has never contacted a public official before, writes \nme and says:\n\n       This is my first time writing to any political figure. I \n     will keep my thoughts and concerns short and sweet.\n       I am currently unemployed, a mother of 3 and live in a \n     suburb in Illinois. I have been looking for work for over 1 \n     year now to no avail.\n       It is my hope that you will vote YES in the Senate this \n     week to pass the unemployment extension and hopefully there \n     will be no more delays.\n       My husband and I have been struggling to make ends meet for \n     months now and with the money I would collect from \n     unemployment, my family would be able to stay afloat [until I \n     can get another job].\n       My son has some major medical issues at this time and even \n     though we carry insurance, it's just not enough to pay the \n     bills.\n       I pray the Senate makes a positive and quick decision about \n     extending unemployment benefits.\n       I appreciate your time.\n\n  How do you explain to this woman, and others who wrote to me, what we \nare doing right now on the floor of the Senate? Are we debating a bill \non the floor of the Senate? No. We are burning 30 hours off the clock \nbecause the Republicans insist we delay this as long as the Senate \nrules will allow. They do not want us to extend unemployment benefits 1 \nminute sooner than they can extend this debate. Under the Senate rules, \nthey have extended it now for 26 days. So another 2, 3 or 4 days are \nnecessary before the Republicans use up all the time they could \npossibly use.\n  What happens in the meantime? Well, for the three people who wrote me \nfrom Illinois, I am not sure. I do not know how they will get by in the \nmeantime. I hope they will. But for them, it must be hard to understand \nwhy they have to be held captive to the procedural rules of the Senate \nthat I think, in this case, are being clearly abused.\n  We have adopted now Republican amendments that they have asked for. \nAt least we have cleared them to be adopted. The vote last night had \nonly two dissenters. Two Republican Senators dissented. Everyone else \nvoted for it. This is now, apparently, a wildly popular bill but not \npopular enough for us to vote on it and get it done. No, we are going \nto have to wait for another day or two or three under the scenario that \nhas been created on the Republican side.\n  Last week, one of my Republican colleagues was talking on the floor \nabout how we should be in no rush to do anything on unemployment \ninsurance. He said:\n\n       The benefits haven't run out yet. We're going to pass this \n     before the benefits run out. That's not the question.\n\n  Well, unfortunately, that is not true. When you hear statements such \nas that, the Republican delays start to make a little more sense. \nAmericans need help right now, but some Republican Senators do not \nunderstand that.\n\n[[Page S11026]]\n\nSome Republicans, apparently, do not know that 600,000 Americans have \nalready lost their unemployment insurance benefits--Americans who would \nbe benefited if this bill passed--extending the coverage for an \nadditional 14 weeks across the country and for 20 weeks in areas of \nhigher unemployment.\n  These 600,000 families have no place to turn. Their benefits are \nexhausted. The job market is still weak and the Senate talks and talks \nand talks and, even worse, goes into these quorum calls, where people \ndo not even talk.\n  We sit in our offices waiting to reach a point where we can take the \nnext vote the Republicans will allow. We finally managed to make a \nlittle progress last night to move the bill forward. Now Republicans \nhave said let's wait another 30 hours before we consider what we even \npassed last night. We have to wait so the Republicans can talk more \nabout whatever it is they think is more important than helping the \nvictims of this recession and dealing with the safety net we \ndesperately need. So America waits and waits some more.\n  I hope the Senate can finally provide the assistance that hundreds of \nthousands of Americans are waiting for. There is no excuse for us not \nto do it right now--today.\n\n\n                 Major Opposition to Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. President, the Senator from Tennessee was here earlier. It \nappears now that the major Republican opposition to health care reform \ncomes down to something very basic, which I never would have guessed.\n  It turns out the Republicans object to the length of the bill. It \nturns out they are offended, and are carrying that offense to an \nextreme, because they believe the Senate bill for health care reform is \nover 1,000 pages long. I don't know if the Republicans can help me \nunderstand this. Maybe there are a number of pages that they think \nwould be appropriate. I don't know if it is 900 or 500. But, \napparently, in their mind there is an appropriate number of pages for a \nbill. When the bill goes beyond a certain number of pages, whatever it \nsays is unacceptable. That, apparently, is the new approach being taken \nby the Republicans.\n  Last week, I asked one of the Republican Senators how many pages the \nSenate Republican health care reform bill comprised. He didn't answer \nme, because he knows, and I know, that no such bill exists. There is no \nSenate Republican health care reform bill. Maybe some day there will \nbe. I hope so.\n  We have taken two major committees of the Senate and put them to work \nfor weeks to devise health care reform bills. Now we are trying to \nblend those bills into a final product, which is in the works. Yet they \ncome to the floor and complain it is too long. It turns out that one of \nthe committee bills they are objecting to for being too long contained \n150 Republican amendments. Guess what. Those amendments comprised 300 \npages.\n  Am I supposed to be outraged that we would have 300 pages of \nRepublican amendments and say they should not be considered because I \nhave in my mind a number I cannot quite disclose to you as to what a \nmaximum number of pages might be for a bill? In a debate as serious as \nhealth care reform, have we reached these depths, where the only \ncomplaint we can find from the Republican side is that the bill has too \nmany pages in it? I think that is a sad state of affairs.\n  People across this country, and family after family, know the cost of \nhealth care is out of control for businesses, families, individuals, \nand governments. We cannot sustain it. Health insurance companies will \nkeep piling on premiums and raising costs beyond the reach of families \nevery single day. We have to do something about it now. If it takes 100 \npages, good. If it takes 1,000 pages, that is fine, too. Let's get it \ndone.\n  I keep waiting for the first Republican Senator to stand up and say \nwe are going to join with Democrats in fighting the abuses of health \ninsurance companies, which deny people coverage because of preexisting \nconditions, which bail out on those who are insured once they get sick, \nwhich won't allow you to take your insurance from one job to another, \nwhich say that your son or daughter at age 23 is cut off from the \nfamily plan.\n  When will Republicans join us in pushing for real health insurance \nreform, which gives peace of mind to families across this country? I \ndon't care if that takes 1,000 pages to do it. Let's do it and get it \ndone.\n  Finally, let's make sure that we push prevention and wellness, so \npeople will have better health outcomes at lower costs, so that more \npeople can qualify for health insurance, so that fewer people turn up \nin the emergency room without health insurance, or with poor health \ninsurance, desperate for care.\n  Again, how many pages are acceptable to the Republican side of the \naisle? I am waiting to hear.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I am very pleased to be able to speak \nthis afternoon about the health care bill that we all in this country \nare concerned is coming through Congress at a very rapid pace.\n  I heard the distinguished Senator from Illinois saying the Republican \ncomplaint is how long the bill is. Well, of course, he acknowledged \nthat there is no bill, that we actually don't have a bill that has been \nintroduced yet in the Senate. So I think what we are talking about is \nthe length of the bills that have been put forward by the two \ncommittees and will be put together, and it could be 3,000 pages long, \nif that is what it takes to cover this issue.\n  The concern Republicans have is, are we going to have time to read \nit? Are we going to have time for the public to read it, so that we \nunderstand fully, before we start debating, before we start amending, \nwhat is in every line of the bill?\n  The American people expect that we will know what we are voting on \nwhen we are talking about taking over one-sixth of our economy in this \ncountry. We are talking about the health care industry jobs--doctors, \nnurses, nurses' aides, hospital personnel, and the doctors' office \npersonnel. We are talking about a lot of the economy of our country. \nMost importantly, we are talking about the relationship between a \npatient and a doctor, which is the most personal, most important health \ncare relationship you can possibly have in every family.\n  I think maybe the distinguished deputy leader on the Democratic side \nhas mistaken the complaints about how big the bill is with how long we \nhave to read the big bill. That is the issue. That is why we want to \nsee the bill in the writing that is going to become law before we are \nasked to debate it, before we are asked to offer amendments. And we \nwant the public to see it, too.\n  In fact, there was an amendment offered in the Senate Finance \nCommittee by Senator Bunning to reassure the American people that there \nwould be 72 hours for this bill to be in the public domain before it \nwould come to the floor. That amendment was defeated.\n  It is very important to us that we have ample time to determine every \npart of this bill and how it will affect every American, every American \nfamily, and for all of the many people in the health care industry--the \ndoctors, nurses, and all the people who provide health care in our \ncountry--to know how it will affect them, too. That is the complaint, \nfor sure.\n  Today I want to talk about the rising health care costs. We know that \ntoday, without any new bill, premiums are going up and Americans are \nbeing squeezed. Rising premiums are causing them to be very concerned \nabout how much this health care coverage they have is costing. It is \nalso squeezing small businesses, because their premiums are rising, and \nit is beginning to be a choice in some American businesses whether they \ncan offer health care coverage anymore.\n  We do need health care reform because of these rising premiums. You \nwould think that, with the premiums going up and costs going up, and \nAmericans being squeezed in a tough economic time, and employers being \nsqueezed, that the position we would be taking in the Senate regarding \nhealth care reform would be to bring down costs. That would be what you \nwould think we would be addressing. You would think we would be talking \nabout offering more affordable coverage to more people.\n  Texas, unfortunately, has the highest percentage of people today \nwithout health insurance coverage in the Nation. So I am very concerned \nabout this issue. Unfortunately, 5.8 million uninsured Texans is the \nnumber we have\n\n[[Page S11027]]\n\nreached. So this is a huge issue for my State.\n  Let's look at the health care reform and how it is going to affect \nthe rising premium costs. Inflation causes the premiums to go up every \nyear. So what we should be looking for is a way to cut back on those \ncosts that are hurting people so much.\n  Here is an example: Individuals and families buying their own \ninsurance could see premiums increase as much as 73 percent under the \nnew Democratic proposals that are being written right now. One study \nprojects premium increases of roughly $1,500 a year for individuals, \nand $3,300 a year for family coverage, in addition to the natural rise \nin inflation and premiums that would be ongoing anyway. This was from a \nstudy delivered by Oliver Wyman. Think about it. All of the taxes on \ninsurance companies, the taxes on an American individual or a family \nthat decides not to take the coverage would add to the cost as well. \nThen you have the cuts in Medicare that are proposed and the increase \nin Medicaid that is proposed, which will cost every State and every \ntaxpayer. So you have all these increases in costs, mandates, and \ntaxes.\n\n  More alarming is, if you do have insurance today, you may not even be \nable to keep what you have. The President said if you like what you \nhave, you can keep it. But under the Democrats' proposal that is going \nthrough, all plans include a long list of benefits that are required to \nbe in every plan. Some of these may be benefits your family doesn't \nneed or you would not choose as a priority, but they are there. So that \nwill have a cost impact. Millions of Americans will be forced to buy \nmore expensive plans in order to comply with these new Federal laws \nthat are going to reform health care.\n  When it comes to a small business, you might think: What is this \ngoing to do to a small business? Small businesses are now having a hard \ntime because they don't have the big risk pool. So their costs are \nhigher anyway. A small business with 20 employees is going to have \nhigher premiums anyway, and their margins are generally less because \nthey don't have the advantage of having big risk pools and the things \nthat can bring down costs in a bigger business. Small businesses are \ngoing to look at these rising costs and probably say, you know, I now \nhave to decide, do I continue to offer health care coverage to my \nemployees or do I back off? And if I back off, of course, people will \nhave to buy their own insurance or pay a fine if they don't.\n  That is what is going through Congress right now. The Joint Committee \non Taxation stated that ``the imposition of the excise tax on insurers \ncan be expected to lead health insurance providers and consumers to \ntake measures to minimize their burden from the tax. As insurers pass \nalong the cost to the consumer by increasing prices, the cost of \nemployer-provided insurance will increase.''\n  In the House bill, employers will be penalized if they don't pay for \na specific percentage of employee premiums. So even if you are offering \nhealth insurance to your employees, you may still be penalized if the \nHouse bill prevails, if you don't pay the right percentage of coverage \nfor employees. The Kaiser Family Foundation did a research study and \nsaid three out of five businesses in America that offer insurance would \nstill have to pay the 8-percent payroll tax, because their percentages \nwould not meet the Federal standard that would be in the House \nbill. That is just counterintuitive. It is counterintuitive to say if \nyou are doing the right thing and you are offering health insurance to \nyour employees--you are struggling to do it, but you are doing it--but \nif it is not the right percentage, if it is not 72.5 percent or 65 \npercent, then you are not going to qualify anyway, so you are going to \nhave to pay an 8-percent fine of the entire payroll of your company.\n\n  This is not the reform we should be going after. What we should be \ndoing is trying to have more affordable health care access for \nindividuals and small businesses. That should be our primary objective.\n  Here are the principles the Republicans would put forward for health \ncare reform.\n  Small business pooling: We have offered time and time again on the \nfloor of this Senate the small business health plan that would allow \nsmall businesses to pool, to be able to offer their employees a bigger \nrisk pool and, therefore, lower premiums for the employee and the \nemployer. We have offered plans that would allow a State organization \nor a national organization--the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the NFIB, the \nAmerican Institute of Architects, whatever association that you might \njoin as a small business person--to offer all of their members \ninsurance plans that would have a big risk pool so that if you work for \na small business, a small architecture firm, you would be able to offer \nthis in the same basic amounts that if you worked for a big \narchitecture firm or big corporation. But that would not cost the \ngovernment anything, and it would not change anyone's coverage if they \nlike what they have. It would offer more affordable access to more \npeople.\n  If the Republicans had the ability to offer amendments to the health \ncare bill or to offer a substitute, we would reduce frivolous lawsuits. \nIn States where there are limits on noneconomic damages or you have an \narbitration requirement before you go to a lawsuit, we have lowered the \ncost of medical malpractice insurance to the doctors by as much as 25 \npercent. Doctors have come back to practicing medicine again because \nthese premiums have been lowered just by reducing frivolous lawsuits. \nThis has been done in my State of Texas, California, and other States \nhave followed suit and, no pun intended, have lowered the number of \nlawsuits. It has lowered the cost of the medical malpractice insurance \npremiums, and doctors have been able to do their work with their \npatients with much more freedom, knowing they do not need to order \nunnecessary tests just to cover themselves in case they get sued.\n  No. 3, why not offer tax incentives? I am a cosponsor of a bill with \nSenator Jim DeMint that would offer tax incentives for individuals. \nThere are small businesses and individuals who have no access to \naffordable coverage. It is just way too expensive. Why not give every \nindividual who purchases their own insurance the same tax break that a \ncorporation gets for offering health insurance to the employees? It is \na nontaxable benefit to the employee. Why shouldn't the individual get \nthat same break? Why don't we have a $5,0000-per-family tax credit if \nyou buy your own health insurance for your family, or $2,000-per-person \ntax credit so that everyone is on a level playing field? That would be \na huge incentive. It is a tax credit, so it would be much less \nexpensive than what we are talking about in this government takeover of \nhealth care.\n  How about creating a transparent, online marketplace for consumers to \ncompare and purchase plans? That is something on which I think we could \nall agree. I think we could agree that if you had a health exchange \nwhere you could go online and companies would offer different kinds of \nplans, any company that wanted to come in with a credible plan for \ninsurance coverage--again, a bigger risk pool so the company would have \nto be competitive, and it would have that lower cost--that would be a \ngreat boon for consumers and it would not cost the government anything \nto do that. It would just be a marketplace, a transparent place where \npeople could shop for their plans and get a better deal because there \nwould be more competition.\n  We should allow the purchase of insurance across State lines. Why \ndon't we allow the insurance companies the ability to pool States and \noffer individuals better prices for health care coverage? We have \noptions that would be good options for American consumers and would \ngive more access to affordable health care. The more people who have \naffordable health care, the lower cost to everyone who has health care \nbecause when people are covered, they don't go to the emergency room \nfor a fever or a common cold. They go to a doctor's office. They have \ncheckups so they have ongoing care to detect something before its gets \nso bad that it is more serious, more expensive to treat, and certainly \nmore life-threatening.\n  Those are the principles the Republicans would put forward. But to \nhave a government takeover that is going to increase costs to everyone \nwho has insurance and cause many people to lose their insurance because \nthe employers back out is not the answer. It is not\n\n[[Page S11028]]\n\nthe answer. We can do something that would give affordable access to \nmore individuals and their families. That should be the goal of this \nhealth care reform. We need health care reform. We do. We don't need a \ngovernment takeover of our health care system. That is the debate we \nought to be having right now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week families and businesses across \nour country finally got some good news. We found out that initial \nestimates show that our GDP grew at a 3.5-percent rate last quarter and \nthat the Recovery Act created or saved over 1 million jobs across the \ncountry, including over 30,000 in my home State of Washington, making \nus third in the country for job creation.\n  Those are hopeful signs. But I know many families and many businesses \nand communities still need help. We have a long way to go before we \nhave fully recovered from the worst economic condition since the Great \nDepression.\n  I came out on the floor and spoke twice last week about the urgent \nneed to pass an extension of unemployment insurance that would help \nover 18,000 people in my home State and millions of Americans across \nthe country. I told the stories about five individuals who had lost \ntheir jobs and whose families are now in desperate need of support that \nthe extension would give them to help them stay on their feet--families \nwho right now, as we sit out here and debate this bill, wait for hours \nand hours for us to get to a final vote, even though we know we have \nthe votes, families who are sitting at the kitchen tables across this \ncountry having a very agonizing debate about how to make next month's \nrent or how to get next week's groceries if their unemployment benefits \nrun out.\n  Those families do not understand why some of our colleagues are \ndelaying and obstructing our efforts to offer this small measure of \nfinancial stability to those families who need it most. These families \nhave been coming to me with their stories, and I am committed to \nfighting to make sure they have every opportunity to get back on their \nfeet. That is why I am here today to urge my colleagues to support and \npass the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009.\n  I am very proud to be a cosponsor of this bill because it will give \nour families and businesses in Washington State and across the country \nthe support they need today. This bill will be a lifeline to millions \nof families, and it will provide tax relief to help our businesses \ncreate and save jobs. And it will help extend and expand the homeowners \ntax credit to continue a badly needed boost to help stabilizing the \nhousing market.\n  This legislation will help families who need it most by providing \nevery single unemployed worker who has exhausted his or her benefits an \nadditional 14 weeks of support, regardless of what State they live in, \nand it would extend unemployment to laid-off workers in States that \nhave been hardest hit by the job losses, including Washington State, by \n6 weeks.\n  Last week I told some of the stories that are pouring into my office \nfrom unemployed workers. These are workers who are not asking for a \nhandout. They just need a small measure of support as they work to get \nback on their feet. These stories have continued to come in this week, \nand I wish to share a couple excerpts from letters people sent me \nurging me to do everything I can to make sure this bill finally passes.\n  Bill and Patricia Profitt from Littlerock, WA, e-mailed me saying:\n\n       Please act quickly to pass another extension \n     of unemployment benefits. My wife and I are in danger of \n     losing our house and have run out of unemployment. Please \n     help us.\n\n  Donna Dettling from Olympia, WA, said:\n\n       My extended benefits will run out in 7 weeks. I am a single \n     mother with three boys and I have been trying for months to \n     get work but have been unsuccessful. If the Senate does not \n     come to an agreement soon, we may end up homeless. Can you \n     please do what you can to push this forward?\n\n  Then there is Barbara Headrick from Monroe, WA. She wrote to me and \nsaid:\n\n       Dear Patty, I am desperate for the Senate to pass the \n     emergency unemployment benefits legislation. I cannot find a \n     job, have no income, and am in danger of losing my house as \n     well as my utilities. Please, please, please urge all the \n     Senators to pass this emergency legislation as soon as \n     possible.\n\n  Those are just three quick e-mails from thousands of letters I have \nreceived from across my home State of Washington. We owe it to these \nworkers, to their families, and to millions more like them to pass this \nlegislation and not continue to delay it so that they can get the \nsupport they need.\n  These men and women who are writing me and stopping me when I am home \ndid not expect to have to ask for help. They had jobs. They felt \nsecure. But now they are spending their days desperately looking for \nwork that is not available. They are worrying about what will happen to \nthem, and they are worrying about their families when their savings are \nexhausted and their credit cards are maxed out and the bank will not \nwait any longer for a mortgage payment.\n  We cannot continue to go hour after hour after hour delaying this \nwhen our working families are pushed to the brink by a financial crisis \nthat they did not create but for which they are paying. We need to pass \nthis legislation.\n  By the way, this bill is going to do a lot more for our families, \nbusinesses, and communities. It will expand and extend the successful \nhome buyers tax credit that will allow our families the opportunity to \nmove into homes and make sure that our weakened housing market \ncontinues on the road to recovery.\n  This is a program that has already helped many families purchase \ntheir first homes. This bill will extend the $8,000 credit to first-\ntime homebuyers through the end of April 2010 and expand the program \nproviding a $6,500 credit to new purchasers who have lived in their \ncurrent home for 5 years or more.\n  These programs will not only help families move into new homes; they \nwill also increase liquidity and provide a shot in the arm to housing \nmarkets that still need a lot of support.\n  I have heard from real estate agents, from homebuilders, from \nfamilies from every corner of Washington State, and they all tell me \nthey have to have this extension. I received letters from families \ntelling me they want to buy a new home but they cannot close in time to \nget this credit and they would not be able to afford a new home without \nit.\n  Thousands of homebuilders, construction workers, and real estate \nagents have contacted me telling me how successful this credit has been \nand how an extension and expansion would create jobs and give the \nhousing market another strong push forward.\n  This bill will also provide a critical boost to businesses in \nWashington State by extending their ability to carry back losses they \nsuffered in 2008 or 2009. That is a tax provision that will provide \nbadly needed capital to help our companies avoid layoffs, expand their \noperations, and create jobs.\n  We have heard a lot today about this concept of too big to fail. \nWell, in this time of nationwide economic uncertainty, I believe the \nmillions of families and Main Street businesses that are on the brink \nare certainly too important to fail, and they deserve every bit of \nsupport we can give them to allow them to get back on their feet. So \nthe Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009 will \nhelp bring these families, businesses, and communities back from the \nprecipice.\n  I urge our colleagues to support and pass this critical legislation. \nIt is surprising to me that we have to wait hour after hour after hour \nafter hour, when we know the votes are there, simply because somehow \ndelaying this bill is some kind of win for whoever is delaying it. It \nis not a win for Washington families who have to stay awake one more \nnight worrying about how they are going to buy food or pay their \nmortgages or keep their families intact.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop the delaying tactics and allow this bill \nto come to a vote.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I would echo the words of Senator Murray, \nwho has worked perhaps harder than anyone in this institution to extend \nunemployment benefits.\n  I don't get it. Sometimes around here politics has a role. Certainly \nwe have\n\n[[Page S11029]]\n\ntwo political parties, and we have a couple of Independents. In both \nthe House of Representatives and in the Senate that happens. But on \nthis one, on extending unemployment benefits, 90 percent of the country \nagrees on that. It is not a welfare program, it is unemployment \ninsurance. People pay into it. It is to help people who want to work, \nwho have lost their jobs, and would like to get back into the \nworkplace.\n  We have been trying to get this passed for 3 weeks, and the fact that \nthis has not passed, I guess, indicates there are some Republicans who, \nfrankly, don't much like unemployment insurance. It is a government \nprogram, so they do not like it--just as some number of Republicans \ndon't like minimum wage or they don't like workers compensation or \nMedicare. They don't believe government has a role in some of these \nthings. That is particularly difficult to swallow when it comes to \nunemployment insurance.\n  Senator Murray mentioned the number of e-mails she has received from \npeople in her State. I get e-mails and letters from Ohioans--from Lima, \nXenia, Springfield, Zanesville, Bellaire, and Ravenna--all the time, \nfrom people who didn't know they were going to be unemployed. They have \nworked hard, played by the rules, paid their taxes, kept their houses \nnice, kept their neighborhoods strong, and they lost their jobs. They \nare looking and looking and looking and can't find a job.\n  With an unemployment rate that is more than 10 percent in my State, \nall we are saying is give them an extension of unemployment so they can \nkeep looking and keep putting food on the table. Unfortunately, some \nRepublicans--not a majority of Republicans but some number of \nRepublicans--think there is no role for government. They don't like \nMedicare, they don't like minimum wage or workers compensation, and \nthey don't like unemployment compensation. It is a tragedy because, \nfrankly, I don't think they are representing the people in their States \nvery well.\n  Almost nobody--almost no real people except for a bunch of people who \ndress like this and hang around this Chamber and down the hall in the \nHouse of Representatives--thinks that way. There are not many people \nwho think unemployment shouldn't be extended.\n  An hour or so ago, Senator Harkin had a hearing in the HELP Committee \nabout the increasing health costs facing small businesses. We had a \npanel of five people who spoke, a couple of them small business owners \nwho have been victimized by these huge health care costs.\n  I want to start with this--the business model of an insurance company \nand a health insurance company. Not all of our problems with health \ninsurance in this country--but a big part of our problems--are due to \nthe behavior of the insurance industry. Think of it this way. The \nbottom line for the insurance companies is money. They need to make \nmoney. They want to make money. They should make money. But their \nbusiness model is this: Hire a bunch of bureaucrats to figure out how \nto refuse to sell insurance to people who have preexisting conditions; \nand on the other end, hire a bunch of bureaucrats to stop from paying \nclaims for people they are insuring when they get sick. That is how \nthey make their money. They do not insure people with preexisting \nconditions, and then they sometimes do not pay up on claims when people \nget sick.\n  Something like 30 percent of health insurance claims on the first \nround are denied--30 percent. That is almost one in three. Sometimes \npeople fight with their insurance companies and end up getting their \nclaims paid, but why should they have to do that? They pay for \ninsurance year after year after year, and the insurance company makes \nmoney on them year after year after year. Then, after they get sick, \nsometimes their claims aren't paid. Sometimes when they get really \nsick, the insurance companies do something called rescission--they cut \nthem out and take their insurance away from them.\n  So when we start with that business model, it is obvious what \nhappens. The CEO of Aetna made $24 million last year. Insurance company \nprofits over the last 7 years have gone up 400 percent. The salaries of \nthe executives, the CEOs, of the top 10 largest insurance companies in \nthis country average $11 million. So in order to make that kind of \nprofit, in order to make that kind of CEO salary--not to mention the \nsalaries of other vice presidents and top executives--I guess that is \nthe business model they need. They need to deny people with a \npreexisting condition from even getting insurance; then, on the other \nend, hire a bunch of bureaucrats to keep people from getting their \nclaims paid for. That is why insurance reform is so very important. \nThat is why this legislation is so very important.\n  So today, in our committee--the committee on which Senator Sanders \nalso sits, who joins me now on the Senate floor--we had this hearing on \nthe increasing health care costs facing small businesses because this \nwhole insurance company model of denying coverage because of \npreexisting conditions and then denying claims when people file them \nparticularly hurts small businesses. When the insurance companies do \nthat, small businesses in particular are victimized by it. Small \nbusinesses pay more for their insurance. If they have 10 employees and \none gets very sick, the prices for the whole insurance plan for that \nsmall business get so out of whack they often have to cancel coverage \nor they simply can't afford it.\n  So what is coming out of this health care hearing and what we are \ndoing in our legislation that is so important. We have worked on \ncreating this health insurance exchange which will allow small \nbusinesses to pool their risks and leverage better deals from insurers. \nSo instead of a small business of 12 people trying to buy insurance, \nthey get to join a health insurance exchange with millions of \ncustomers, millions of individuals, tens of thousands of small \nbusinesses. Then, if a few people get sick in one small business, their \nrates don't spike up; they have a much larger pool to keep prices in \ncheck.\n  Small businesses pay about 18 percent more than large companies per \ncapita for their insurance. They pay higher broker fees, higher \nadministrative costs. They have the high cost of medical underwriting. \nSo the result is an unfair competitive disadvantage for small \nbusinesses.\n  One of the other things we do for small businesses in this \nlegislation is to give tax breaks so a small business can take its 20 \nemployees and they can go into the insurance exchange and, if they \nchoose to, they can go into the public option. The public option is \nthere for several good reasons. The public option is just an option. It \ndoesn't mean they can't go into Cigna, Aetna, Blue Cross, or Wellpoint. \nThey can choose Medical Mutual, a not-for-profit in Ohio, or they can \nchoose the public option. The public option will mean competition for \ninsurance companies in southwest Ohio, where two companies have 85 \npercent of the insurance in that part of Ohio--the Cincinnati area.\n\n  When two companies have 85 percent, you can bet they are getting \nlower quality and they are paying higher cost. If we put the public \noption in there to compete with them, it will help to drive down cost, \nstabilize cost, and it will mean better quality insurance. They don't \nhave to choose the public option, but the fact it exists helps.\n  The other thing the public option will do is to keep these insurance \ncompanies much more honest. We are going to outlaw denying coverage due \nto preexisting conditions. No more discrimination based on disability, \non geography, on gender, or any of that.\n  The pages sitting in front of us--these young men and young women who \naren't paying for their insurance yet--if we don't change anything, \nwhen the young women finish school and go out into the insurance \nmarket, they will pay higher rates than the young men will. So there \nare all kinds of discrimination that we are going to outlaw in this \nbill, but we need the public option to make sure these insurance \nconsumer protection reforms are actually in force.\n  Let me close. Attending today's committee hearing was a businesswoman \nfrom Ohio whom I met. Her name is Liz Coriell. She owns a business in \nCleves, OH, outside Cincinnati, in the southwestern part of the State. \nShe owns a medical gas servicing company, but she\n\n[[Page S11030]]\n\ncan't afford health insurance for her workers. Her sons were going to \ncome and work in the business, as her husband does--her husband is 65 \nand has Medicare, so not a problem for him. She is not 65. Her sons \nwould like to join the business, but they can't get insurance because \nshe can't afford it for this small business.\n  Why do we have a health insurance system that says to her sons: You \ncan't come and work in your parents' family business because you can't \nget insurance, so it is not going to work out? Why do we allow that? \nWhy don't we encourage these families to stick together--you know, \nfamily values--to help them go into the family business, if they want \nto, and not be denied.\n  I come to the floor of the Senate many times--I will not today \nbecause Senator Sanders is waiting to speak--and I share letters I \nreceive from people in Ohio. This one is from Cleveland. This one is \nfrom Mansfield where I grew up. Others are from Springfield, Dayton, \nand all over.\n  Two things come through in these letters. One is that people thought \nthey had good insurance until they got sick. Then they found out, well, \nmaybe they lost their insurance because they got really sick or maybe \nthey had a baby born with a preexisting condition, and then their \ninsurance was canceled.\n  The other thing I find is that it is affecting people like Liz from \nCleves, OH, in southwestern Ohio. Liz is several years away from \nMedicare, but she is thinking about several years from now being \neligible for Medicare, when she wouldn't have to worry about this. I \nget letters from people in their early sixties and late fifties who are \njust anxious and thinking: I am only 2 or 3 or 6 years away from \nMedicare, and then I will not have these problems with insurance. Then \nit will be predictable, and it will be stable.\n  Why can't we do that for everybody now? So whether they are 26 or 46 \nor 64--not quite eligible--why can't we take away that anxiety and \nbuild peace of mind for people so they don't have to worry about \nwhether they can get insurance or whether they are going to be denied \nor going to have to fight insurance companies to get doctor bills paid? \nLet's take that anxiety off the table so Americans can concentrate on \ntheir small businesses and raising their kids and fixing up their \nneighborhoods. Let's let them concentrate on giving something back to \nthis society and not always worrying about their health insurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by congratulating my friend, \nSenator Brown of Ohio, for his leadership in this struggle for \nfundamental reform of the American health care system. He understands, \nas I do, that there is something absurd about a situation in which we \nas a nation end up spending almost twice as much per person on health \ncare as any other nation on Earth; yet we end up with tens of millions \nof people who are uninsured, people who are underinsured, and we have \nalmost 1 million Americans this year who are facing bankruptcy because \nof medically related illnesses.\n  As Senator Brown just talked about, understanding that small \nbusinesses are the economic engine of this country, there is something \nabsurd when we have small businesses desperately trying to provide \nhealth insurance for their employees but are finding it harder and \nharder to do so. So I want to congratulate Senator Brown for the work \nhe is doing on health care.\n  As I think every American understands, we are in the midst of the \nworst economic crisis since the Great Depression. I find it interesting \nthat there are some people out there, some economists, including the \nChairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke, who have told us ``the \nrecession is very likely over.'' I suggest to Mr. Bernanke, come to the \nState of Vermont, go to California, go to Nevada, go to Ohio, go to any \nState in the country and go out on the street and ask people whether \nthey think this recession is over. They will say it may be over for the \nlarge banks that were bailed out by taxpayers but it is not over for \nworking families. In fact, according to the latest Washington Post/ABC \nNews poll, 82 percent of Americans disagree with Mr. Bernanke. The \noverwhelming majority of the American people do not believe the \nrecession is over. Of course, they are right. The recession may be over \nfor banks that are now starting to be profitable, for Goldman Sachs, \nwhich is paying out huge bonuses to its top executives, but trust me, \non Main Street, on family farms all over this country, in factories all \nover this country, this recession most certainly is not over.\n\n  Since the beginning of this recession in December of 2007, 7.6 \nmillion Americans have lost their jobs. The official unemployment rate \nhas doubled, going from 4.9 percent to 9.8 percent. But what is \nextremely important to understand when we look at the economy today is \nthat the official unemployment statistics do not reflect the reality of \nwhat is going on in our economy. Official statistics do not include \npeople who have given up looking for work. If you are in a community \nwhere 15 or 20 percent of the people are unemployed, you have given up \nlooking for work, but you are not part of the official unemployment \nstatistics. What happens if you want to work 40 hours a week but you \ncan only find a job for 20 hours a week or 25 hours a week? You are \nalso not in the statistics.\n  The reality is, if you add all those factors together, people who are \nofficially unemployed, people who have given up looking for work, \npeople who are working part time when they want to work full time, what \nyou are looking at is 17 percent of working-age Americans today are in \nthat category, which adds up to 27 million Americans--an astronomical \nnumber. That is an indication of a real catastrophe in our economy.\n  Mr. Bernanke, I am sorry to disagree with you, but in my view and in \nthe view of the vast majority of the American people, this recession is \nnot over. In fact, in terms of unemployment numbers, it may, in fact, \neven be getting worse.\n  On the issue we are dealing with right now, we have to address long-\nterm unemployment. It is one thing to lose your job and get another job \na few weeks later. It is another thing not to be able to find a job \nmonth after month, and there are millions of Americans in that \ncategory.\n  Today, 5.4 million Americans have been unemployed for over 6 months--\nthe highest on record. Long-term unemployment is a major crisis in this \ncountry. It is one we have to address. It is one we have to deal with \nin terms of extending unemployment benefits. The average length of \nunemployment is now 27 weeks. That is over 6 months. That is over half \na year. That is the longest since the end of World War II.\n  There are fewer jobs in America today than there were in the year \n2000, even though the workforce has grown by 12 million since then. \nThis is a shrinking workforce. We now have the fewest manufacturing \njobs than at any time since April of 1941, 8 months before the start of \nWorld War II. The importance of that is that manufacturing was the \nmechanism by which working families were able to carve out a middle-\nclass existence. They had decent wages, decent benefits. They had a \nunion. They may have had a pension program. But today we have the \nfewest manufacturing jobs since April of 1941.\n  Home foreclosures are the highest on record, turning the American \ndream of home ownership into an American nightmare for millions of \npeople.\n  There is nothing we should be proud of in saying this: Today, in the \nindustrialized world, the United States has the highest rate of \nchildhood poverty. We have the highest infant mortality rate. We have \nthe highest overall poverty rate. At the same time, we have the largest \ngap between the wealthy and everybody else. What we have seen for a \nnumber of years is a collapse in the middle class. It has certainly \ngone on a lot longer than since the financial collapse. But we have \nalso seen an increase in wealth amongst the top 1 percent. That gap \nbetween the very rich and everybody else is growing wider and wider. \nFrom a moral perspective, not to mention an economic perspective, we \nhave to address the reality that the top 1 percent today earns more \nincome than the bottom 50 percent. The top 1 percent owns more wealth \nthan the bottom 90 percent. We are becoming two very different \ncountries: people on top with incredible wealth--CEOs on Wall Street \nmaking hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of \ndollars in a hedge\n\n[[Page S11031]]\n\nfund--yet working people seeing their incomes decline, working longer \nhours for low wages. Actually, today a two-income family has less \ndisposable income than a one-income family did 30 years ago. That is \nwhat is going on in America--poverty increasing, middle-class \nshrinking, the gap between the very richest and everybody else growing \nwider.\n  This is an important point to make. We know what happened on Wall \nStreet a little over a year ago. We know what that collapse has done. \nWe know that the outrageous behavior on Wall Street has precipitated us \ninto this very severe recession. But we should not kid ourselves. If by \nsome miracle tomorrow we manage to go back to where we were before the \nfinancial collapse on Wall Street, we would still be in very bad shape. \nIt isn't a question of, weren't things great before the collapse on \nWall Street and the development of this major recession--no, things \nwere not great back then.\n  Let me just mention what happened during the Presidency of George \nBush. Let me talk a little bit about what happened during that 8-year \nperiod.\n  When President Bush was in office from the year 2000 to 2008, 8.2 \nmillion more Americans slipped out of the middle class and into \npoverty. That is what happened during that period. I might mention, you \nmay recall--it is really frightening to think about it--how during much \nof that period the Secretary of Treasury and the President were saying \nthe economy is robust, the gross national product is expanding. But \nthat was the reality for working families--people slipping out of the \nmiddle class and into poverty.\n  During that same period--we are dealing with health care right now. \nOne of the reasons we need a national health care program guaranteeing \nhealth care to all people is during that same period, 7.8 million more \nAmericans were uninsured; they lost their health insurance. We are now \nup to about 46 million people without any health insurance. That number \nis going up every single day. During the Bush era, close to 8 million \nAmericans lost their health insurance.\n  During the years 2000 to 2008, 4.5 million manufacturing jobs \ndisappeared. I talked a moment ago about the importance of \nmanufacturing. I know it is not a sexy job, but it was a means by which \nmillions of Americans went to work every day, they produced real \nproducts, they had real income. It was a vehicle--manufacturing was and \nis a vehicle by which working Americans could make it into the middle \nclass.\n  During the Bush tenure, 3.2 million workers lost their pensions, with \nthe result that about half of American workers in the private sector \ntoday have no pension whatsoever. There was a time--I know it is a \nradical idea to even think about--there was a time when millions of \nAmericans who worked had a defined pension plan, a defined benefit \npension plan. They actually knew they were going to have a pension. \nBoy, what a radical idea. That does not exist anymore.\n  During the Bush era, median household income declined by over $2,100, \nfrom $52,500 to $50,303. According to an article that appeared a couple \nof months ago in USA TODAY, from 2000 to 2008 middle-class men \nexperienced an 11.2-percent drop in their incomes, a reduction of \n$7,700 adjusting for inflation. That is unbelievable. During that \nperiod, middle-class men saw an 11-percent drop in their income. \nMiddle-class women in this age group saw a 4.8-percent decline in their \nincomes as well.\n\n  The important point to be made here is when you hear economists \ntalking about the economy in abstract ways--we have 3 percent growth in \nthis quarter; isn't that great? Yes, that is an important fact, but it \nis not the most important fact. The most important fact is what happens \nto ordinary people. This is what happens to ordinary people. People who \nwere 45 to 54 years of age lost $7,700 in the Bush economy. That is \ntrue today, it was true then. Focus on what is happening to ordinary \npeople.\n  With all of that, with the long-term trends in which the middle class \nhas declined, with the fact that since the greed and illegal behavior \nof Wall Street has gotten us into the deep recession we are in right \nnow, working families all over this country are desperately in need of \nhelp, and they are looking to their Federal Government to provide that \nhelp. That is why it is so important that we pass an extension in \nunemployment benefits. I find it hard to understand, why my Republican \ncolleagues continue to delay this legislation being implemented.\n  We have to do more than that. We have to extend unemployment--that \ngoes without saying--but we have to do more than that. We have to ask \nourselves why our economy is in the shape it is right now. That will \nprecipitate a major debate and major discussion, something we as a \nnation have to have. We have to ask ourselves not just the causation of \nthe recession we are in right now, the role Wall Street has played, \nbut, long term, why since the early 1970s has the middle class \ncontinued to shrink? What are the causes of that? Why do we have the \nhighest rate of poverty of any major nation on Earth? Why is it today \nthat people are losing their homes and their pensions and their life \nsavings and their ability to send their kids to college?\n  Clearly, short term it is imperative that we investigate thoroughly \nand that we hold accountable those crooks on Wall Street who have done \nso much damage to the American people. It is simply not acceptable that \nthey be allowed to continue the behavior that drove this country into \nthe severe recession. We need to understand how it happened, we need to \nhold accountable those people who caused this crisis, and where there \nis illegal behavior, those people should learn what the penal system of \nthis country is about.\n  One of the things that really amazes me is that I have yet to see, \nnor have the American people yet seen, one of those folks on Wall \nStreet whose greed and recklessness has caused this recession, has \ncaused this intense suffering all over this country--have you seen one \nof those guys go before television, get on TV and say to the American \npeople: I apologize. I am sorry for our greed. I am sorry for the fact \nthat we cost millions of people their jobs and their health care and \ntheir savings and their pensions. We are sorry.\n  I have not seen that. In fact, what we are seeing is these guys on \nWall Street spending millions of dollars every day, every week, every \nmonth on lobbying in order to make sure we do not bring about the \nreforms to prevent them from continuing to do what they did, which \ncaused this recession. These guys live in a world of their own, a world \nof entitlement. They do not seem to understand their actions have \nwidespread consequences in terms of destroying the economic well-being \nof millions of people. All they seem to think about is, I only made \n$100 million last year. I can't get by on that. I need my 18th home or \n16th car and 18th country club membership. For them, enough is never \nenough--more and more greed and more and more selfishness. That is an \nissue we have to deal with.\n  It only took a couple of weeks for Congress to give Wall Street the \nlargest bailout in history, some $700 billion. But the truth is, up \nuntil this point we have done very little to make sure this financial \ncrisis does not occur again. These guys want to go right back to where \nthey were. They want the freedom to speculate, the freedom to convert \ntheir financial institutions into large gambling casinos. The Federal \nGovernment has provided $182 billion to AIG, $50 billion to Citigroup, \n$50 billion to Bank of America, a $25 billion bailout to Wells Fargo, a \n$25 billion bailout to JPMorgan Chase, and on and on it goes. Yet we \nhave asked them for nothing in return. Here are tens of billions of \ndollars. What are you going to do? What are you going to do for the \nAmerican people who have bailed you out?\n  I know reforming the banking sector is not going to be easy. After \nall, the banking and insurance lobbyists have spent over $5 billion on \ncampaign contributions and lobbying activity over the past decade in \nsupport of deregulation. They were all over this place telling us, \ntelling the Congress: Just trust us. Deregulate us. Let us do what we \nwant to do. We are going to create wealth for all the American people.\n  There were some of my colleagues who actually believed that. I \nhappened not to be one of them, but some of them did, and we \nderegulated and we let them do whatever they wanted to do and we are \nwhere we are today.\n\n[[Page S11032]]\n\n  In 2007 alone, if you can believe this--this is what goes on--the \nfinancial sector employed nearly 3,000 separate lobbyists to influence \nFederal policymakers. Got that. There are 100 Members of the Senate, \n435 in the House--that equals 535 Members of Congress--and they had \nnearly 3,000 individual lobbyists to influence Federal policymaking. \nOver a 10-year period, they spent $5 billion.\n  And that, my friends, is why the rich get richer and almost everybody \nelse gets poorer. We have to address the issue of Wall Street. Let me \nmake some suggestions as to what we have to do.\n  We need, in fact, a thorough investigation as to how this happened \nand we need to hold those people accountable. I hope we can do that. I \nthink the American people are asking questions, and they are right to \ndemand answers. But what we also have to do is to deal with this issue \nof ``too big to fail.'' What I have said ever since this financial \ncrisis began is: If a financial institution is too big to fail, that \nfinancial institution is too big to exist.\n  We need to do exactly what Teddy Roosevelt did back in the trust-\nbusting days, and we need to start to break up these huge financial \ninstitutions. We cannot continue to be held hostage by them such that \nif they fail, they take down the entire system with them so we have to \nprop them up and bail them out.\n  I would mention, interestingly enough, that is exactly what they are \ndoing right now in the United Kingdom. Let me quote from the Washington \nPost:\n\n       The British government announced Tuesday that it will break \n     up parts of major financial institutions bailed out by \n     taxpayers. The British government, spurred on by European \n     regulators, is set to force the Royal Bank of Scotland, \n     Lloyds Banking Group and Northern Rock to sell off parts of \n     their operations. The Europeans are calling for more and \n     smaller banks to increase competition and eliminate the \n     threat posed by banks so large that they must be rescued by \n     taxpayers no matter how they conducted their business, in \n     order to avoid damaging the global financial system.\n\n  And you know what. Our friends in the U.K. are doing exactly the \nright thing. That is what we should be doing. But that is not just my \nopinion. A growing number of experts, both on the left and on the \nright, are coming to the same conclusion.\n  On October 15, Alan Greenspan, probably the man more than any other \nindividual responsible for the deregulatory efforts which led to this \nfinancial crisis, admitted last year that his views on deregulation \nwere wrong. He was quoted in Bloomberg News as saying:\n\n       If they are too big to fail, they are too big. In 1911 we \n     broke up Standard Oil--so what happened? The individual parts \n     became more valuable than the whole. Maybe that's what we \n     need to do.\n\n  Alan Greenspan, the man whose deregulatory leadership helped create \nthis disaster, now perhaps understands that that whole philosophy of \nderegulation, letting big banks do whatever they want, letting them \nmerge with insurance companies, maybe was not quite right.\n  Former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, who has advised the Obama \nadministration, supports breaking up big banks so that they no longer \npose systemic risks to the entire economy. During a recent article in \nthe New York Times, Volcker says:\n\n       People say I'm old fashioned and banks can no longer be \n     separated from nonbank activity. That argument brought us to \n     where we are today.\n\n  Absolutely right. The New York Times said that under Volcker's plan:\n\n       JPMorgan Chase would have to give up the trading operations \n     acquired from Bear Stearns. Bank of America and Merrill Lynch \n     would go back to being separate companies. Goldman Sachs \n     could no longer be a bank holding company.\n\n  In my view, that is exactly what needs to happen. What insanity that \nwhen individuals lose their health insurance, tough luck; small \nbusinesses go bankrupt, tough luck; but if you are a large financial \ninstitution and you acted in a legal greedy way, we say: Hey, no \nproblem. Taxpayers of this country are here to bail you out, because if \nwe don't bail you out, you are going to bring down the entire economy. \nThat is absurd. We have got to end that.\n  Robert Reich, President Clinton's former Labor Secretary, said:\n\n       No important public interest is served by allowing giant \n     banks to grow too big to fail. Wall Street giants should be \n     split up--and soon.\n\n  I agree with former Secretary Reich.\n  Let me touch on a few other issues we have to have the courage to \ndeal with. I get calls all the time. I do a national radio show--get it \non the radio show, get it from Vermont. People are saying, We bailed \nout these large financial institutions and what they then do is say \n``thank you'' and they raised my interest rates on my credit card to 25 \nor 30 percent.\n  That is outrageous. That is usury. We need to pass national usury \nlaws. The truth is, today one out of four credit card holders in this \ncountry is paying interest rates above 20 percent, as high as 41 \npercent, more than double what they paid in interest in 1990.\n  What we need to do is pass national usury legislation. I have \nintroduced legislation that would mandate that the maximum interest \nrates that could be charged would be 15 percent. The reason I came up \nwith that number is that is exactly what credit unions are doing today, \n15 percent, except under unusual circumstances.\n  I am proud that on that bill we have as cosponsors Senators Durbin, \nLeahy, Levin, Harkin, and Whitehouse. That is what we have to do. It is \nimmoral. It is wrong for these large companies to be charging 25 or 30 \npercent interest rates.\n  It goes without saying that as we take a look at Wall Street, we have \nto reregulate those institutions. We have to take a hard look at \nbringing back Glass-Steagall in one form or another.\n  Lastly, we also need more transparency at the Federal Reserve. Last \nyear when Secretary Bernanke came before the Budget Committee, I asked \nhim a very simple question. I said: Mr. Chairman, my understanding is \nthat you have lent out over $2 trillion at zero interest to some of the \nlargest financial institutions in America. Can you tell me who got the \nmoney? I mean, you are putting taxpayer money at risk. Who received \nthis $2 trillion-plus dollars? And, amazingly enough, what Mr. Bernanke \nsaid is: No, I am not going to tell you. It is a big secret. I cannot \ntell you.\n  Well, on that day we introduced legislation that would mandate that \nhe tell us, and also we would bring about a GAO audit of the Fed. The \nFed, especially since the financial collapse, has assumed an enormous \namount of power, and the American people have a right to have more \ntransparency there.\n  Let me conclude by saying that anybody who thinks this recession is \nover has obviously not talked to real people. Millions of people are \nhurting. Millions of people are frightened. They are looking to us for \nsome help in terms of extending unemployment benefits, but they are \nalso looking to us to understand the causation of this problem, and to \nwork on economic ideas which will prevent a continued collapse of the \nmiddle class in this country.\n  We have got a lot of work on our hands, and I look forward to working \nwith you.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                        Employment Disincentives\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, first, let me take this opportunity to \ncommend the chairman and the other members of the Finance Committee on \ntheir collective efforts to extend benefits to those unemployed \nAmericans who still face a tough job market in this difficult \nrecession. Second, I would like to engage my good friend and colleague, \nthe Senator from Montana and the chairman of the Committee on Finance, \nin a colloquy on a subject of utmost importance to the men and women \nwho are currently unemployed. Specifically, I am concerned that under \nthe current unemployment insurance, UI, extensions there may be \ndisincentives for unemployed Americans to seek reemployment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I believe we can agree that unemployed adults who want \nto return to work should be given every incentive to return to work \neven if they accept part-time jobs or lower wages. This benefits not \nonly those individuals and their families but also strengthens our \nnational economy. However, it has come to my attention that many \nAmericans who knew they were doing the right thing by accepting a job, \neven at greatly reduced wages from their previous employment, would\n\n[[Page S11033]]\n\nhave been better off turning down meaningful work.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, for \nbringing this matter to my attention. We certainly want to avoid a \npolicy that inadvertently discourages Americans from returning to work.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I became aware earlier this year that \nsome of my constituents in Connecticut are being penalized for working \neither part time or temporarily after first receiving emergency \nbenefits. Further investigation shows that this problem is becoming \nmore prevalent to varying degrees in many States and possibly all 50 \nStates. Under current EUC extensions, if one receives emergency \ncompensation and a year passes with no recorded work history, those \nbenefits can continue uninterrupted while that person seeks employment. \nThe problem often occurs, however, when a person takes a job, either \npart-time or short-term work, at much reduced wages compared to their \nprevious employment. Because this lower wage work automatically \nqualifies them for reduced State benefits, Federal law now requires \nthat they can no longer receive the much needed emergency extended \ncompensation.\n  In a particular case, one of my constituents, a woman who worked on \nbehalf of Connecticut children for 28 years before losing her job, was \nreceiving the Federal benefits she was entitled to. But when this \nwoman, who is the sole caregiver of her 88-year-old father, took a \nminimum-wage job 2 days a week, her benefits dropped from $483 per week \nto $38 per week. She would have been better off financially had she not \nreturned to work and instead stayed home to care for her ailing father.\n  I am also advised by my State's labor department that many other \nconstituents are becoming aware that taking employment at this time may \ndisadvantage them, and some are therefore less inclined to accept \nemployment. I also am told that more and more States are facing this \nproblem and that the problem will grow as this recession continues. I \nhope the Finance Committee will look into this issue and consider \nlegislative language which I have suggested to address this problem.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Again, I thank my colleague for bringing this matter to \nmy attention. You raise a serious concern, and I can assure you my \ncommittee will take a look at the issues you raise.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n\n\n                            vote explanation\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I was unavoidably detained during \nrollcall vote No. 332 on the motion to invoke cloture on the Reid/\nBaucus substitute amendment No. 2712 to the unemployment insurance \nextension bill H.R. 3548.\n  Had I been present I would have voted yea for rollcall vote No. 332 \nand ask that the Record reflect that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 306(f) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels in the resolution for \nlegislation that reduces the unemployment rate or provides assistance \nto the unemployed, particularly in the States and localities with the \nhighest rates of unemployment, or improves the implementation of the \nunemployment compensation program. In addition, section 306(b) permits \nthe chairman to adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels for legislation providing tax \nrelief or refundable tax relief. These adjustments to S. Con. Res. 13 \nare contingent on the legislation not increasing the deficit over \neither the period of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the \nperiod of the total of fiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n  I find that S.A. 2712, an amendment in the nature of a substitute to \nH.R. 3548, the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2009, \nfulfills the conditions of the deficit-neutral reserve fund for \nunemployment mitigation. Therefore, pursuant to sections 306(f) and \n306(b), I am adjusting the aggregates in the 2010 budget resolution, as \nwell as the allocation to the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n13 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S.

Mr. President, I support the substitute amendment before \nus.\n  The national unemployment rate is now 9.8 percent. In Kentucky, the \nunemployment rate is 10.9 percent. Millions of Americans are searching \nfor work, and too many families are struggling and uncertain about \ntheir future. This is unacceptable.\n  When Congress passed the so-called stimulus bill earlier this year \nthat cost $787 billion, not counting increased interest payments on the \nnational debt, our national unemployment rate was 8.1 percent. Clearly, \nthis costly legislation has failed to stop the bleeding of jobs from \nthe American economy.\n  The bleak job picture makes it necessary to consider another \nextension of unemployment benefits. But if you talk to Americans who \nare searching for work, the best unemployment benefit we could extend \nto them is a high-quality job.\n  That is why I believe it is so important to include provisions in \nthis bill that will actually create jobs and reduce unemployment. Over \n2 weeks ago, I proposed an amendment that would provide net operating \nloss relief to businesses so they can hire and retain workers.\n  I also strongly supported Senator Isakson's efforts to extend the \nhome buyer tax credit, which is critical for the millions of jobs that \ndepend on the housing industry.\n\n[[Page S11034]]\n\n  On October 27, I voted against cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthis bill because there was no guarantee that a vote would be allowed \non these two crucial provisions to improve the job situation for \nAmericans.\n  Today, this substitute amendment includes both of these job-creating \nprovisions.\n  Regarding net operating losses, businesses are generally allowed to \noffset their income with losses. Under current law, they can carry \nthese losses back for 2 years and carry them forward for 20 years. In a \ndifficult economy where businesses have experienced devastating losses, \nthey may go out of business before they can recover their own money, or \nthey may hang on and gradually recover their money when they return to \nprofitability.\n  During tough economic times, Congress has extended the net operating \nloss carryback from 2 to 5 years so businesses can apply for immediate \nrefunds. The logic behind this is that businesses should have access to \ntheir own money when it can do the most good and prevent massive \nlayoffs. In an economic crisis, it makes no sense to delay tax refunds \nuntil some uncertain, distant point in the future. Businesses may not \nsurvive in the future if they do not have access to their own money \ntoday.\n  This relief is especially important in today's climate, where \nbusinesses find it increasingly difficult to get credit from banks.\n  That is why I am pleased that this substitute amendment responded to \nmy call for substantial net operating loss relief, which will allow \nbusinesses to create and keep jobs. It also includes Senator Isakson's \nextension and expansion of the home buyer credit, which will stimulate \njobs in the housing industry. The crisis in the housing market was a \nroot cause of our economic crisis and it is essential to extend this \ntemporary tax credit to help stabilize the market.\n  This amendment is not perfect. It is unfortunate that the \nunemployment benefit extension is financed by imposing taxes on \nbusinesses, and the net operating loss and home buyer provisions are \noffset by delaying tax relief that would make American businesses more \ncompetitive internationally. I had proposed an offset to my net \noperating loss amendment that would not have raised taxes or delayed \ntax relief, and my amendment would have provided more relief for job \ncreation. However, legislation is rarely perfect, and on balance this \namendment provides substantial tax relief and will spur job creation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this substitute amendment, which will \nboth extend unemployment benefits and extend tax relief that will \nreduce the number of unemployed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 45 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about health reform. \nThis is my first speech from the floor on this subject. I have a lot to \nsay.\n  By now, we have all heard the stories--at least those of us who have \nbeen listening--of those who have fallen through the cracks or, more \naccurately, the gaping holes. We know why those stories are important. \nThey remind us that there are human beings behind these awful \nstatistics.\n  Since 2001, 6.6 million Americans have lost their health insurance, \nand many millions more are underinsured. They have seen their health \ncoverage become more and more expensive and less and less adequate. \nPeople suffer because of this. They lose their homes. They go bankrupt. \nThey do not get the health care they need. They get sicker. They \nexperience pain, physical and emotional. And they cannot care for their \nchildren. They suffer because of this.\n  During my campaign for the Senate, I did an event in Fergus Falls, \nthe lovely town in Otter Tail County in west central Minnesota. A woman \ncame up to me. She had a story to tell. She told me her father had \ngotten diabetes and died pretty quickly. But that was not the worst \npart of the story. She told me her dad received a lot of supplies from \nMedicare he had not used. She knew of a woman in town who had diabetes, \nso she decided to drive these supplies that her dad got for diabetes \nfrom Medicare to this woman's house. She did. She asked the woman if \nshe could use any of the test strips and orthopedic shoes and other \nitems. The woman said: Yes, I could use them.\n  Then this woman, the woman with diabetes, told this other woman that \nher 24-year-old son had diabetes too. He had had juvenile diabetes as a \nkid, and now he could not afford insurance because he had a preexisting \ncondition. So this woman from Fergus Falls, this woman with diabetes, \nshares her insulin with her son, a diabetic mother and a diabetic son \nsharing insulin because he cannot afford health insurance in our \ncountry. Is this the kind of country we want to be? Well, the answer \ndepends on what we do right here right now.\n  As we talk about reforming our health care system, I wanted to break \nthat phrase ``health care system'' apart for a second, because we are \ntalking about two things. The truth is we have some great health care \nin this country and a terrible system. We have dedicated, smart doctors \nand nurses and researchers and health professionals in this country. \nThey do amazing things.\n  If you are a member of the Saudi royal family, you can get on your \nprivate jet and come to my State for the best health care in the world. \nThe Saudi royal family is willing to travel 7,500 miles to Rochester, \nMN, for great care from the Mayo Clinic. For a woman in Fergus Falls, \nMN, and her adult son, both with diabetes, the same great care is less \nthan 300 miles away, but it is really a world away. That is because if \nyou are an American, you can get great health care too, but only if you \nmake it through the terrible system, and only if you can afford it.\n  As I travel around Minnesota, when someone comes up to talk to me, I \nusually hear about three things. First, they say: Health insurance \ncosts too much. What are we going to do about that? Second, they ask: \nWhat am I going to do if I get sick or my kid gets sick or my spouse \ngets sick? And then: Someone in our family has a preexisting condition. \nThen I lose my job or I want to change my job or I want to start a \nsmall business. How am I going to get health insurance then? And, \nthird, if anything happens to me, something bad, am I going to lose \neverything? Am I going to go bankrupt?\n\n  In my view, the answer to those three questions comes down to two \nmajor changes. First, we need to reform our health insurance system so \nit provides security for every American. Secondly, we need to reform \nour health care system by putting more focus on prevention and by \nchanging the way health care providers deliver health care so they \nprovide high quality at a lower cost. We can do this. We know we can do \nthis.\n  Let me take a moment to talk to the skeptics. One of the arguments I \noften hear from opponents of health care reform is that the majority of \nAmericans are happy with the health care they have, and they are. \nBecause the majority of Americans are healthy right now. The truth is, \nthough, that even those who are happy with their coverage are not going \nto be happy for so long. Right now the average cost of family health \ninsurance payments, including both the employer's and the family's \nshare, is $13,375. That is double what it was 10 years ago. If we do \nnothing, those premiums will double again in the next 10 years, which \nmeans a family could be paying more than $30,000 per year for health \ninsurance. As premiums rise, businesses are forced to drop employees, \ndrop wages or drop coverage to keep up with cost. So even if you are \nhappy with the coverage you have, it may suddenly be the coverage you \nno longer have because your employer can no longer provide it.\n  That is exactly what has happened. As premiums go up, so do the \nnumber of uninsured Americans. In my State, 355,000 Minnesotans lost \nemployer-based coverage between 2001 and 2008.\n  There is another problem with the coverage you have. Often you can \nonly find out what is actually covered when you get sick. You can only \nfind out how hard it is to switch or get new coverage once you have \nbeen sick. That is why we need health insurance reform that provides \ntrue security. It is at those difficult times, when you are nervous and \nvulnerable and want to focus on dealing with your health\n\n[[Page S11035]]\n\nissues, that you realize how little security you have under this \ncurrent system.\n  Let me tell you about Liz MacCaskie, who lives in Minneapolis. Liz \nlost her job in September. She is 58 years old, my exact age. She has \nbeen living with diabetes and was just diagnosed with kidney failure. \nLiz was denied private coverage because of her preexisting condition. \nThe only insurance she can get now comes with a $5,000 deductible and \nan $8 to $900 monthly charge to maintain coverage. How does paying \nclose to $20,000 a year for insurance count as insurance? It doesn't. \nEspecially when Liz is trying to live on $1,000 a month while she takes \njob training courses and does part-time domestic work. As a result, Liz \nand her husband have been borrowing money from Liz's brother-in-law to \nmake payments on their house. This is unconscionable.\n  Right now, if you have been sick, insurance companies can refuse to \ncover you--or charge you exorbitant premiums.\n  As an older woman told me at the State fair this summer: At my age, \neverything is preexisting.\n  Under our health care reform bill, we will stop insurance companies \nfrom denying you coverage or charging you more because of a preexisting \ncondition. That is a very important, very good thing. Right now, if you \nare a woman who has had a C-section or you have been a survivor of \ndomestic violence, health insurance companies can deny you coverage \nbecause having had a C-section or being the survivor of domestic \nviolence is considered by some insurance companies to be a preexisting \ncondition. Isn't that amazing? Is this the kind of country we want to \nbe? The answer depends on what we do right here and right now.\n  Under our health care reform bill, we will end discrimination against \nsurvivors of domestic violence and stop insurance companies from \ncharging women more for their health coverage just because they happen \nto be women, which health insurance companies are allowed to do now. \nRight now, if you get sick, your insurance benefits can run out when \nyou need them the most.\n  Recently, I was contacted by a Minnesotan named Kathy. A few years \nago, she was laid off and had to buy her own insurance. She was able to \nkeep up with the cost until October of 2005, when she was diagnosed \nwith Hodgkin's lymphoma. To pay her medical bills, Kathy exhausted her \nIRA and then had to file for bankruptcy. Kathy's cancer is under \ncontrol, but her medical costs are over $10,000 each year. She makes \n$22,000 working part-time in a small CPA firm.\n  This isn't just an individual tragedy, it is a national travesty. \nFifty percent of personal bankruptcies in this country are the result \nof a health care crisis, and 80 percent of those health care \nbankruptcies are people who have health insurance. I know people are \nsometimes surprised to find out that Europe has been doing this better \nthan we have. I have to ask: Do you know how many personal bankruptcies \nthere have been in Germany and in France and in Switzerland because of \nhealth care? The answer is zero. Under our health care reform bill, we \nwill eliminate annual and lifetime caps on benefits. Americans will be \nable to access affordable health care and avoid going bankrupt when \nthey get very sick. That is important. It is very good.\n  This bill guarantees secure coverage that will be there for all \nAmericans and stay there when people need it. I know you might be \nthinking: Gee, covering every American, isn't that going to be \nexpensive? Consider this: We already pay for the health care of \nAmericans who don't have insurance. We just pay for it in the most \ninefficient way possible. Right now people without insurance go to the \nemergency room for health care, the most expensive possible way to \ndeliver care. Those of us who do have insurance pay for it because it \ncosts every insured family more than $1,100 a year in additional \npremiums. This cost shift occurs for two reasons. People are using the \nemergency room for primary care, meaning they are going whenever they \nget a cold or an ear infection, which is ridiculously inefficient, or, \nmore likely, they are waiting until they get very sick, in which case \nit often means their health condition has progressed to a point that is \nvery expensive to treat or maybe ultimately tragic.\n  According to a Harvard study, nearly 45,000 Americans die because \nthey don't have health insurance. Is this the kind of country we want \nto be? The answer depends on what we do right here, right now.\n  The fact is, our irrational health insurance industry not only hurts \nour families, it also hurts our economy in so many different ways. I \nrecently received a letter from James Solie from Moorhead, MN. He was \nan Air National Guard member for 32 years. During that time, his \ndaughter was covered under TRICARE, the Department of Defense health \ncare program for members of the uniformed services, their families, and \nsurvivors. Now that she is on her own, his daughter gets health care \nthrough her employer, one of the big-box stores. Her children were born \nwith cystic fibrosis. Because of their significant health care needs, \nshe can't leave her job.\n  As James wrote to me:\n\n       My daughter is presently a hostage of her family's health \n     insurance needs. She will keep working at that same store \n     until the law is changed.\n\n  This is so common, there is actually a term for it. It is called job \nlock. If this woman had a brilliant idea for a new business or even \njust wanted to move to a better job, her need for health coverage would \nprevent her from doing so. That is not only bad for her, multiply it \nacross millions of people and you see how bad it is for our economy.\n  We are supposed to be the most entrepreneurial society in the world, \nbut because of our health care system, innovators are prevented from \nstarting their own business. Talented or ambitious workers are \nprevented from moving on to more satisfying, more challenging, more \nproductive jobs. We put at risk the very entrepreneurial spirit that \ndefines us.\n  German Chancellor Angela Merkel spoke today for a joint session of \nCongress. She was born in East Germany. When she was a kid, people \nwould smuggle American books and American films into East Germany. \nToday she spoke on what inspired her the most about it. She said: the \nAmerican dream.\n\n  We are denying millions of Americans their shot at the American dream \nbecause of our irrational health insurance system. This bill guarantees \nthat you and your family always have access to stable, portable health \ninsurance, even if you lose your job or get sick or both. It will end \nthe job lock that handcuffs so many Americans.\n  Of course, guarantees of coverage and portability are hollow promises \nif they are not accompanied by something else: affordability. Over the \nlast decade, the average health insurance premium for American \nfamilies, including both the employer's share and the worker's share, \nhas risen from just under $5,800 to nearly $13,400. That is an increase \nof $7,600 or 131 percent over the last decade. That is more than three \ntimes faster than Americans' average wages rose in that same period. \nEven if you stay healthy, these trajectories are unsustainable. Even if \nyou have coverage, you could still be just a diagnosis or an accident \naway from bankruptcy.\n  This has to change right now. If your work-based health plan is \nexpensive, you have no other option, unless you qualify for Medicaid. \nUnder this bill, you will be able to get subsidized insurance if your \ncoverage through work costs you more than a certain percentage of your \nincome. Right now, if your employer doesn't offer you a health plan or \nyou are unemployed, it is prohibitively expensive to buy it on your \nown. Under this bill, you will be able to access a range of affordable \ninsurance options through a health insurance exchange. This exchange \nwill be similar to a Travelocity for health insurance. All the plans \nhave to meet basic standards, and you can match them up and compare \nthem side by side so you can pick the one best for you and your family.\n  This isn't going to only help individual Americans. It will help \nbusinesses, small businesses. Right now, if you are a business with, \nsay, 11 employees and one of your employees gets sick or pregnant, your \npremiums are going to go up dramatically. That is because your risk \npool is 11 people. But when you choose a policy from the exchange, your \nrisk pool can be a million or two. That is the point of insurance,\n\n[[Page S11036]]\n\nto spread the risk over as many people as possible.\n  In addition, small businesses will also be eligible to receive tax \ncredits to help them purchase coverage for their workers. In Minnesota \nalone, over 72,000 businesses would be eligible for this assistance. \nThat is what the subsidies and the exchange are all about: increasing \nthe availability of insurance and making it affordable for families and \nsmall businesses.\n  That is also what so much of the debate surrounding a public \ninsurance option is about. A public option creates more choice for \nconsumers and more competition in the marketplace. People who are happy \nwith their current plans would not need to change them. But millions of \npeople who did not have health care options before would finally have \nan affordable choice. This is what the overwhelming majority of \nAmericans want. It is the right thing to do. I would say to anyone who \nis against the public option, do not choose it for yourself, but do not \ndeny other Americans that choice.\n  I remain steadfast in my support for a public option. But we should \nalso recognize a public option is just one of several ways this bill \nseeks to control health care costs. All these changes, which will \ncreate security and promote affordability, will provide necessary and \nmeaningful reforms to the health insurance system. But we need to \nremember the goal is not just a better insurance system; it is better, \nmore affordable care. That requires not only changing the way insurers \nbehave, it also involves the way we behave and the way our health care \nproviders behave.\n  Total spending on health care in the economy has doubled over the \npast 30 years and now is about 16 percent of our GDP. That is almost \ndouble the average for western industrialized nations, which are at 8.9 \npercent. The CBO estimates that the percentage of our GDP spent on \nhealth care will double over the next 25 years to 31 percent of GDP if \nwe do nothing.\n  Fortunately, we have the opportunity right now to act, and we know \nhow to do it. We need to look no further than Minnesota. If my \ncolleagues will indulge me for a bit of some home State pride, \nMinnesota has taken a national lead in many areas, including cost \ncontainment and community health. Part of it is because 90 percent of \nMinnesotans are covered by nonprofit health plans. It is also because \nwe have models such as the Mayo Clinic, Allina, and HealthPartners, \nwhere physicians are paid to be part of a team, providing integrated \ncare, centered on the patient as a patient, not as a profit center.\n  Patient-centered care is the key. The point is not just better, more \nefficient treatment for patients, it is that people do not want to be \npatients at all. The goal of health care is to prevent illness and \nthen, if people get sick, to actually make people who are sick \nhealthier, and then to keep them healthy.\n  To those ends, we need to see reform in three areas: incentives for \nbetter care, more focus on prevention, and a real commitment to contain \ncosts. Let's start with incentives.\n  Right now, Minnesota providers are punished--punished--under Medicare \nfor providing high-quality care at a low cost. According to the most \nrecent data, Minnesota receives $6,600 per Medicare beneficiary per \nyear and is second in the country for quality of care.\n  Texas averages more than $9,300 per beneficiary, with some of the \nworst health outcomes in the country. So Minnesotans are effectively \npaying doctors in Texas for excessive treatments and lousy outcomes.\n  Now, consider an innovative program I have seen in my home State: the \nCardiac Care Program at Duluth St. Mary's Hospital. They aggressively \nmanage patients with heart disease by helping people make lifestyle \nchanges and making sure people get the followup attention they need. As \na result, they have reduced hospitalizations by 80 percent and saved $1 \nmillion in 1 year.\n  But because the current system does not incentivize value, Duluth St. \nMary's received no reward for these cost savings. In fact, a hospital \nthat lets its cardiac care patients go unchecked until they need \nanother procedure gets paid a lot for performing that procedure, even \nthough their patients are less healthy.\n  Under the current Medicare reimbursement system, the good care gets \npunished and the less effective, more expensive care gets rewarded. We \nare not providing health care in this country; we are providing sick \ncare. We need incentives for providers to reduce hospitalizations and \ncommit time and resources to prevention. That starts with Medicare \npayment reform.\n  This is not an issue of State versus State. If we can get better \noutcomes at lower costs, it will be better for the entire country \nbecause it is the only way we will finally be getting a handle on the \nrunaway cost of health care.\n  That is why I am so thrilled this health reform bill includes a \nprovision to fundamentally improve the way we pay doctors. Thanks to \nthe efforts of Maria Cantwell and my colleague, Amy Klobuchar, and \nothers, for the first time ever we will include what is called the \nvalue index in the Medicare payment structure. Doctors who provide \nhigh-quality care at a reasonable cost will no longer be punished. \nInstead, they will be rewarded for being effective partners in their \npatients' care.\n  That brings me to lifestyle and prevention. One of the most \ndisturbing trends, for our health and our health care system, is the \nmassive increase in obesity in this country. We know this increase in \nobesity will lead to increased heart disease and diabetes and increased \nhealth care costs for our country. But that future is not inevitable.\n  Today, Minnesota spends $1.7 billion per year on hospital costs for \nheart disease. But the residents of New Ulm, MN, have decided they are \nnot going to contribute to those statistics anymore. New Ulm is a \nbeautiful town in the heart of the Minnesota River Valley, about 90 \nmiles southwest of the Twin Cities. The town is partnering with Allina \nHospitals & Clinics and has made a commitment to reduce heart attacks \nby 25 percent over the next 10 years. To do this, the residents of New \nUlm are working to bring down their high blood pressure and \ncholesterol, manage their diabetes, stop smoking, and start exercising. \nThey have community cooking classes, workplace wellness initiatives, \nand free health screenings.\n  I visited New Ulm during the recess to see what these folks are doing \nand how determined they are to make changes in their lifestyles. This \ndedication to prevention and wellness will keep individuals in New Ulm \nliving longer and living healthier. It will also save the health care \nsystem about $10 million over the next 10 years. When it comes to \nwellness, self-interest and the national interest are aligned.\n  This bill we are debating right now guarantees that routine checkups \nand preventive care, such as colonoscopies and mammograms, are covered \nby all insurance plans at no cost. We need to invest in those things \nthat sometimes seem peripheral to good health but are essential to it: \naccess to healthy foods and a safe environment for physical and social \nactivity to address the alarming rise of obesity and the epidemics of \ndiabetes and heart disease.\n  I thank my friend Tom Harkin for his leadership in making sure the \nPrevention and Public Health Investment Fund is in the health reform \nbill. This fund will help Americans make the lifestyle choices that \nlead to better health. These investments will help Americans stay \nhealthier and save money in the long run.\n  Another way to improve care and bring down its cost is to make sure a \ngreater percentage of every health care dollar actually goes to health \ncare, not wasteful administrative costs or advertising and profit.\n  While national health care plans spend less than 87 cents of the \nhealth care premium dollar on health care, Minnesota's nonprofit plans \nlead the Nation in keeping administrative costs low, spending 91 \ncents--91 cents--of every premium dollar on health care. Four cents may \nnot seem like a lot until you remember that is 4 percent of $775 \nbillion in private health insurance premiums a year.\n  This percentage--the 91 percent I was talking about--is called the \nmedical loss ratio. It is a measure of how much of each health care \ndollar actually goes to health care. The medical loss ratio\n\n[[Page S11037]]\n\nfor insurance plans in Minnesota is 91. Many individual and small \nhealth group plans across the country are closer to 60--meaning that 40 \ncents of every health care dollar goes to administration, advertising, \nand profits--all things that do not make people healthier.\n  That is why I have introduced legislation, the Fairness in Health \nInsurance Act, to mandate that 90 cents of every premium dollar must go \nto health services, not to unnecessary administrative costs or \nadvertising or bloated executive salaries.\n\n  This builds upon the important work of my colleague, Jack Reed, who \npushed for disclosure of this information in the HELP Committee bill.\n  My house colleague, Keith Ellison, from Minnesota's Fifth District, \nhas introduced similar legislation. The House has made progress on this \nissue by requiring a medical loss ratio of at least 85 percent for the \nsmall and large group insurance markets. And because administrative \ncosts constitute such a high percentage of health costs, I want to go \neven further. Right now, there are hundreds of different private \ninsurers that have hundreds of different claim forms and codes. Why so \nmany different forms? Because the more complicated it is, the more \ndifferent each form is, the more likely it will be filled out with an \nerror.\n  Remember, a form filled out with an error allows the insurer to deny \nthe claim. That is why I have called for every insurer to use a \nstandard form for claims. Minnesota has done this on the State level \nand is saving money and preventing the headaches that providers have in \ntrying to navigate these hundreds of different forms. Nationally, this \nis a great way to save a lot of money and a lot of paperwork.\n  You know who will like this? Doctors. Physicians reported spending \nthe equivalent of 3 work weeks each year dealing with health care plans \nand having to devote additional resources to hire extra staff, not to \nprovide care for patients but to do extra, endless paperwork.\n  When time is converted to dollars, the national cost to physician \npractices of dealing with health plans is between $23 billion and $31 \nbillion each year. If we had a uniform billing and claims system, we \ncould save up to $70 billion per year. Wow.\n  By moving to electronic medical records, we will reduce the number of \nduplicated tests. We would make it cheaper and easier for people to \nstay healthy and out of the emergency room. We would be on a path to \nlower costs for everyone by making health care patient-centered, not \nprofit-centered.\n  I am proud of what we are doing in Minnesota--with institutions that \nare delivering care efficiently and effectively. But I recognize the \ntruth of something one health care economist said to me at a health \ncare roundtable I held in Minneapolis a couple months ago. He said:\n\n       Minnesota gets an ``A'' . . . but only because we're \n     grading on a curve.\n\n  There is huge room for improvement all across America. That is why \nthis is an incredible moment of opportunity for those of us in this \nChamber and for the entire Nation.\n  As I said when I rose, we have great health care in this country but \na lousy system. If we do not fix the system, millions more Americans \nwill lose the care. Yes, this is complex stuff. That is why it is \nparticularly important that nobody here injects into this debate \nmisinformation that engenders fear. There has been too much of that \nalready, and it has not resulted in anybody getting better care or \nmoving us closer to a consensus.\n  So let's remember that behind the numbers we talk about are real \npeople--real people who urgently need our help. As the saying goes: \nStatistics are people with the tears wiped off.\n\n  This is our chance to confront the biggest single threat to America's \nfuture and the greatest unmet moral obligation in our history all \nrolled up into one. That is what health care is. This is our chance to \nanswer those questions Americans are asking, our chance to make life \nbetter for Liz MacCaskie and James Solie's daughter and Kathy and a \nmother and her son from Fergus Fall, MN. We have a chance to keep costs \ndown for people who have insurance and finally provide coverage for \nthose who don't. This is our moment to meet this great moral and \neconomic challenge. So let's finish our work and overcome whatever \nlegislative challenges remain.\n  We all want to look back on this day from an America in which \neveryone has stable, secure, affordable health care and say it wasn't \nthe easiest thing, but it was the right thing, and together we were \nable to get it done.\n  There is so much more to say on health disparities, on fraud, abuse \nin the system, on mental health parity, on chemical dependency \ntreatment, on chronic care, on rural health, on workforce issues such \nas the need for more primary care physicians, and so many other \nimportant topics. This is just a start, and I will certainly be back to \nsay more.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Tribute to Federal Employee Dr. Stephen Andersen\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to honor the service of \none of our country's great Federal employees. Today, during these \nuncertain times, the American people face many challenges--one of them \nwe share in common with all people throughout the world. What I speak \nof is the threat posed by climate change.\n  Just this morning, in a special joint session, we heard German \nChancellor Angela Merkel on the importance of working together \ninternationally to address climate change. We have come so far in the \npast three decades but much more needs to be done. So much depends on \nour ability to address this problem, including the long-term stability \nof our economy and our national security.\n  Since its creation in 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency has \nbeen at the forefront of reversing climate change. This week's great \nFederal employee not only spent over 20 years at the Agency, he is also \nsomeone we can thank for his leadership in implementing a landmark \nagreement that has already helped slow down climate change.\n  When Dr. Stephen Andersen first came to the EPA in 1986, he already \nhad over a decade of experience in the field of climate and ozone \nprotection. During his first year as part of the EPA's Stratospheric \nProtection Team, he worked with Soviet scientists to negotiate a joint \neffort to map the ozone by satellite. This was the first-ever United \nStates-Soviet joint mission in space.\n  The following year saw the adoption of the Montreal Protocol in 1987. \nThis crucial international agreement led to dramatic reductions in the \nchemicals that contribute to ozone depletion.\n  Stephen began serving as cochair of the Montreal Protocol Technology \nand Economic Assessment Panel in 1988. He worked tirelessly to convince \nhundreds of military and industrial experts to phase out the use of \nozone-depleting chemicals on a voluntary basis. Over the course of 20 \nyears, the Montreal Protocol was so successful that it helped prevent \nannual emissions of 11 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide. According \nto a crucial study by a team of environmental scientists Stephen \nhimself led, the Montreal Protocol may have delayed the impact of \nclimate change by 7 to 12 years. That doesn't even count the effects of \nother reductions made as a result of the treaty's influence.\n  Stephen led an effort a few years ago to encourage several of the \nworld's highest emitting nations to strengthen the original treaty. His \nleadership led to nine countries agreeing to speed up the elimination \nof hydrofluorocarbons.\n  Today, Stephen continues to work on the science of combating climate \nchange. He has focused much of his energy on helping to create \nvoluntary partnerships between the EPA and the business community in \norder to promote green practices.\n  Stephen won a Service to America Medal last year for his long and \ndistinguished career as an outstanding public\n\n[[Page S11038]]\n\nservant. I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Dr. Stephen \nAndersen's service and that of all the dedicated employees of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency. I know that as we continue making \nprogress on this front, they will play an important role in America's \nglobal environmental leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time--and will share it with \nthe Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and the Senator from \nDelaware, Mr. Kaufman--to talk a little bit about health care reform, \nhealth insurance reform, and the need for us to act.\n  Quite frankly, on behalf of middle-income families of America, the \nvery worst option we could do is allow the status quo to continue.\n  During this time, I am going to be quoting from some letters I \nreceived from Maryland families who are hurting today. These are \nfamilies, some of whom have health insurance but they cannot afford it \nor they are not certain they are going to have adequate coverage to \ndeal with the needs of their families. They are looking to us to help \nthem deal with the problem of health insurance today.\n  The first problem, quite frankly, is the fact that it is too \nexpensive. Health insurance in America is too expensive for so many \nfamilies. As the Senator from Minnesota knows, I use the numbers 6, 12, \n23 frequently: $6,000 is what it cost a family in Maryland 10 years ago \nfor a family health insurance policy. Maybe their employer paid part of \nit. Maybe they paid part of it. Then, it was $6,000 for adequate \ncoverage. Today, that number is $12,000 a family. Many families in \nMaryland have a hard time affording $12,000 of their compensation going \nto pay for their health insurance. By 2016, it is going to be $23,000 \nfor a family, if we don't do anything about health insurance reform.\n  Today, of that money families are spending, $1,100 represents what \ninsured families are paying for people who don't have health insurance. \nI am frequently asked: What about these 46 million or 47 million \nAmericans who have no health insurance, shouldn't they take care of \nthemselves? I say: Yes, we should have personal responsibility, but \ntoday those who have insurance are paying extra costs for those who \ndon't have insurance.\n  One of the most important points of health insurance reform is to \nmake sure everybody pays their fair load to reduce the cost of those \nwho currently have health insurance.\n  (Mr. TESTER assumed the chair.)\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Yes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. That is a very important point about the hidden tax. \nWhen I was county attorney in Minnesota, representing one of our \nbiggest hospitals in the State, a lot of people came in who didn't have \na doctor. Their doctor was the emergency room. Their doctor still is \nthe emergency room, and it is incredibly expensive. If you could \nexplain that a little more because many people don't understand that \nwhen people don't have insurance, we are still paying for them. They \ncall it the hidden tax.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my colleague for the question. The Senator is \nright. People who have no health insurance do what they can do. They \nuse the emergency room as their doctor. They use the emergency room \nwhen they should not be using it. It is very expensive; it costs a lot \nof money. By the way, they don't pay their bills. It becomes part of \nwhat is known as uncompensated care in our hospitals. What is more \nserious is, they don't get the preventive health care they need. They \nget the more intense services than if they had access to our health \ncare system from the beginning. They use the emergency room, as the \nSenator from Minnesota is referring to, and they don't pay their bills, \nand that becomes uncompensated care. All of us who pay the hospital \nbills and pay for our services also pay for what the uninsured are \nusing in the emergency rooms, which adds to the cost of hospital care \nand adds to the cost of our insurance premiums that we pay for family \npolicies. In Maryland, that amounts to $1,100 a year. That is what you \nand I are paying for those who don't have health insurance because they \nare using the health care system and not paying their bills.\n  Part of health care reform is that everyone should have access to \naffordable, quality health care and health insurance.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Yes.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Isn't it true that when these people don't get \nprevention, don't have a doctor, don't get the vaccines and the shots \nthey need and they don't go to the emergency room until they are very \nsick, what happens is they go to intensive care or something or they \nhave a much more serious illness that can go on for weeks and months \nunder intensive care and the price goes up and up?\n  Mr. CARDIN. The Senator from Delaware is absolutely right. There have \nbeen studies done comparing two individuals with the same health care \ncondition, one with insurance and one without insurance. The person who \ndoesn't have insurance uses more health care services than the one who \nhas health insurance, and it is for the reason the Senator said. The \nperson with health insurance will have a much earlier intervention or \ngets preventive health care, will take blood pressure medicine or \ncholesterol medicine or will have tests that discover illness at an \nearly stage or prevents an illness; for example, with colon cancer, a \npolyp can be discovered before it becomes cancerous. A person without \ninsurance doesn't get those services. They enter the system in a much \nmore costly way, which may lead to hospitalization that wouldn't have \nbeen necessary if they entered the system at an earlier stage, but they \ncannot because they have no health insurance. So the Senator is right.\n  One of the things we do is try to help the families who have health \ninsurance. We can end insurance company abuses. That is a very \nimportant point. The health insurance reform package we are looking at \nwill end health insurance company abuses. All the bills reported out of \nthe committees do that. You cannot be denied coverage due to \npreexisting conditions. There will be no more annual or lifetime caps \non benefits. They cannot charge more or drop your coverage if you get \nsick. It requires them to fully cover preventive care and checkups.\n  I have received--and my colleagues have, I am sure--letters from \npeople in my State. I wish to tell you how important these health \ninsurance reforms will be in helping middle-income families. I have one \nexample, and I am sure my colleagues can cite others. Here is a letter \nI received last month from Kevin, who lives in Kensington, Montgomery \nCounty.\n  Kevin is a healthy, nonsmoking, 54-year-old father who was laid off \nand has recently started his own company. He has two high school-aged \nchildren. He recently completed the Marine Corps marathon and has been \nan avid runner and swimmer all his life. I daresay most of us could not \ndo that.\n  After Kevin was laid off, all four family members applied for \ncoverage in the individual market. However, Kevin and his two children \nwere denied access to comprehensive coverage because of preexisting \nconditions. Listen to this. Kevin was denied coverage because the \ninsurance company said he had a history of upper respiratory symptoms. \nActually, he has only had two chest colds in the last 6 years. Five \nyears ago, tests showed a very small amount of scar tissue in his \nlungs, but doctors have concluded this is not a health issue or risk. \nYet he was denied coverage because of a preexisting condition. It is \nimportant to get health insurance reform passed because insurance \ncompanies will not be able to discriminate based on preexisting \nconditions--that don't even exist, in Kevin's case.\n  Kevin's daughter's coverage excludes benefits related to any injury \nto any part of her back. This is because she once had a minor slipped \ndisc, which has not caused her pain in more than 2\\1/2\\ years. This is \na common condition among teenage girls, but the insurance company is \nrefusing to cover back injury. Her doctor has written to the insurance \ncompany stating that she ``has no more likelihood of needing medical \nservices than any other patient her age.'' Yet today, Kevin is denied \nfull coverage for his daughter.\n\n[[Page S11039]]\n\n  It gets even worse. Kevin's son was also refused coverage for his \nknee because he was diagnosed with growing pains that required no \ntreatment. This means Kevin's son will not be covered for any injury to \nhis knees at any time in the future.\n\n  Kevin writes:\n\n       We have a healthy, physically active family. No doubt \n     healthier and in better shape than 98 percent of the families \n     in this country. And we're told that 3 of the 4 of us are too \n     great a risk to be fully covered. . . .\n       We are victims of a health care system that is horribly \n     broken, and our experience in trying to get health insurance \n     for our family--a family that has no chronic health \n     conditions requiring medical treatment--has turned us into \n     strong supporters of health care reform.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Yes, I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. This thing with preexisting conditions is incredible. \nYou hear this everywhere you go. In Dover, DE, we have Angela Austin, a \nrecent mother. She works as a bartender. Most of her earnings come from \ntips. She doesn't get health insurance from her employer.\n  When Angela became pregnant, she tried to find private health \ninsurance, but she was repeatedly denied coverage because her pregnancy \nwas considered a preexisting condition. She applied for Medicaid--to \nfind prenatal care for her and the baby--but was denied coverage \nbecause she earned $200 more than the monthly limit allowed.\n  She called organizations and clinics and was unable to find a payment \nplan she could afford. Midway through her pregnancy, Angela decided to \ncut back her work hours so she could qualify for Medicaid. She worked \nall 9 months of the pregnancy and delivered the baby on May 27.\n  The Medicaid coverage she got was especially crucial because she had \ncomplications from hyperthyroidism and was able to get the necessary \nprescriptions to control the condition.\n  The story gets even worse. Angela was so anxious that everything \npossible be done to ensure a healthy baby, the system threw up \nroadblocks.\n  Pregnancy should not be considered a preexisting condition. What is \nmore, no one should be denied coverage because of a preexisting \ncondition. There are many cases where people are totally healthy, and \nthey have been denied coverage because of preexisting conditions. We \nare going to pass a bill that eliminates not being acceptable for \npreexisting conditions.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I think people in this Nation would be shocked to hear \nabout that situation and for someone who is totally healthy being \ndenied full coverage because the insurance company just wants to deny \ncoverage, just wants to pay less claims in the future, so it finds \nreasons to restrict coverage, even though that person is as healthy as \nanybody in the general public but is being denied coverage today.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Yes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I also was listening to this and thinking, about a \nweek ago, I was at an event that Mrs. Obama, the First Lady, put on for \nbreast cancer in honor of Breast Cancer Awareness Month. There were \nthree women there who all had breast cancer. They were all survivors, \nand they had incredibly low rates of possibly getting breast cancer \nagain because of advances in science. I was stunned to hear of their \ndifficulty. Even though their possibilities of getting breast cancer \nagain were so low, it was still considered a preexisting condition for \nan insurance policy. A recent example, when you think about it hitting \nmiddle-class families--and some of the people watching this on C-SPAN \nmay have seen this on television--a little boy named Alex was denied \ncoverage by his family's health plan. Alex's parents have coverage \nthrough their employers, similar to so many middle-class Americans. But \ntheir 4-month-old son Alex, who weighed 17 pounds--and my daughter was \none of those low percentages when she was born. He weighed 17 pounds at \n4 months old, so he was denied coverage. The insurance company claims \nthis was a preexisting condition for the otherwise healthy baby because \nof his weight.\n  Here is the interesting part--and I know the Presiding Officer from \nMontana will appreciate this. After his family went on TV with the \nlittle boy, then the insurance company changed its mind and, suddenly, \ndecided to cover him. I guess the lesson is that middle-class families \nhave to go on TV to make their case in order to get coverage or when a \nwoman who has been a victim of domestic abuse is denied coverage--which \nis considered to be a preexisting condition in eight States--maybe if \nshe was willing to talk about her domestic abuse on TV, there would be \na change of heart. That is not good enough--coverage by cable TV--for \nthe majority of Americans. They need stability in the system. They need \na guarantee that they are going to have coverage. I thank the Senator \nfrom Maryland for raising this important issue.\n  Mr. CARDIN. If I might mention another family in Maryland, a typical \nfamily--Marvin and Lillian, who live in Chevy Chase, who are \ngrandparents. I can relate to that, having two wonderful \ngranddaughters. Marvin is a retired Federal Government employee. Both \nhe and his wife Lillian have Medicare. They are in pretty good shape. \nHowever, they are worried about their grandchildren.\n  They have a grandson who is 14 years old. He has Crohn's disease and \ndwarfism. He currently has coverage through his parents, but his family \nis petrified that he will be denied coverage when he is no longer able \nto receive insurance through his parents. Because of his preexisting \nconditions, it will be extremely hard for him to find individual \ncoverage while job hunting or adequate coverage while at school. \nWithout reform, high health care costs will preclude him from starting \nhis own business or working for a small business owner.\n  Marvin writes:\n\n       My grandson's future employment prospects will be limited \n     because he will need an employer with a large group plan to \n     ensure good coverage. If he gets sick without coverage, or \n     very limited coverage, it would be a disaster.\n\n  It is truly unacceptable that in America today, because of the way \nour health insurance system operates, that a person's future and what \ntype of job that person can seek is limited because of a preexisting \ncondition. That does not make this Nation as competitive as we need to \nbe. We can certainly do a much better job on that now.\n  There are two good points here. One is that we eliminate preexisting \nconditions. That would be taken care of. We also provide coverage \nthrough the age of 26 so that you can keep a child on your family plan \ncoverage through the age of 26. I think this is going to be a very \npopular issue. This is one area that does not cost a lot of money. \nChildren in their early twenties are not at high risk. It is unlikely \nthis will add greatly to the insurance premium cost--in fact, it will \nnot--but it does give greater assurances for those children who are not \nyet fully in the workplace--so they do not have the opportunity to get \nan affordable health insurance product--that they can stay on their \nparents' policy until age 26. That is another way we are going to help \nfamilies.\n  Lastly, the other area we want to be sure is done is when people \nchange jobs. We know this is a very mobile workforce; people change \njobs much more frequently today than they did 10 years ago. This bill \nwill make sure you always have health insurance, even if you lose or \nchange your job. You are not going to be locked into a company because \nyou don't want to lose your health benefits. I must tell you, I hear \nthat frequently from people in Maryland. I am sure my colleagues hear \nit in Minnesota and Delaware. People say: I want to change jobs, but I \ncan't because I don't want to lose my health benefits. That should not \nbe a reason someone shouldn't be able to look for other opportunities. \nWhen we get health insurance done, people will be able to get insurance \nregardless of where they work. There will be affordable coverage for \nall Americans. That will help middle-income families. That is our \nobjective. That is what we are trying to do.\n  Another area I want to mention briefly is small businesses. We hear \nfrequently that small business owners have a hard time finding \naffordable insurance. I will give a couple examples of people from \nMaryland.\n  Steven from Annapolis is a self-employed small business owner. \nSteven's health care premiums have increased by unmanageable amounts. \nSteven is currently paying 55 percent more for\n\n[[Page S11040]]\n\nhis family health insurance than he was 14 months ago--a 55-percent \nincrease in 14 months. The premiums for Steven and his family, all of \nwhom are healthy, are approaching $10,000 annually. In August, his \npremiums increased 24 percent, after having increased 25 percent in \n2008. He wakes up in cold sweats worried about how he can afford such \nhigh costs. Steven sent me his most recent health insurance bill, which \nshowed the 24.1-percent increase.\n  Steven writes:\n\n       We are worrying about these problems 24 hours a day. That \n     is no exaggeration.\n       Small business people wake up in a cold sweat, as I have \n     done many times through the course of this difficult \n     recession, wondering how we are going to meet our client \n     deadlines, pay our bills, and be a good father and husband \n     all at the same time.\n\n  For small businesses, if you have one bad experience with health care \nduring the year, you can expect a large premium increase the next year. \nIt is one thing about health insurance being expensive as it is, but if \nyou are a business owner, how can you plan your company budget when you \ndon't know what your health premiums are going to be the next year?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I will be glad to yield to my friend from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. One of the things I have learned in the past year \nmeeting with small business owners is this huge disparity. Small \nbusinesses pay 20 percent more. The ones that are the bedrock of our \nentrepreneurial system in this country pay 20 percent more than big \nbusinesses for health care. Their employees are in a small business, \nbut the ones who need it the most, the ones who probably make less \nincome, pay 20 percent more for health insurance.\n  I was up in Two Harbors, MN, visiting a little backpack company that \nhas done such a good job. They now make backpacks for our troops \nbecause they are lighter weight and better for their backs. This little \ncompany started with a few employees; it now has 15, 20 employees.\n  When the owner of that company started it, he didn't have kids. He \nnow has two kids--four in their family. He is paying $24,000 a year for \nhis health insurance. This is a little tiny backpack company in Two \nHarbors, MN. When the Senator from Maryland was telling us about people \nhaving to adjust, they cannot plan, he told me if he had known when he \nstarted that much of his profits were going to go into his health \ninsurance, he would not even have started the company to begin with.\n  This not only hurts our employees, it actually stops small businesses \nfrom starting--the incubator of so many of our great ideas in this \ncountry and jobs in this country. This is truly something that needs to \nbe solved because it is hurting jobs in this country, the fact that it \nis so difficult for small business owners to afford health care.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Will the Senator yield for a minute?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield to the Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. This is another example. It is not just Delaware, \nMaryland, Minnesota, California, or New York. On the same subject, Ian \nKaufman--no relation--moved to Delaware right out of college in 1990. \nUnfortunately, like far too many Americans today, he got laid off from \nhis job. To get back on his feet, he wanted to start his own business. \nIn the process, Ian picked up COBRA coverage to ensure his family \nmaintained health care insurance. When he first signed up for COBRA \ncoverage, his monthly premium was $1,800--a lot of money each month. \nThanks to the COBRA provisions, however, in the stimulus bill, Ian saw \nhis payments reduced by 66 percent, which made his monthly premiums \nmuch more manageable. However, this premium assistance will soon run \nout, and then he will be back once more to paying $1,800 a month. In \nanticipation of higher COBRA payments, Ian applied for coverage at \nBlueCross BlueShield but was turned down. They never gave him a reason. \nHe suspects--what we were talking about earlier--that there was a \npreexisting condition of one of his daughters.\n  Ian worries, like so many Americans, that the high cost of providing \nhealth care to his family, in addition to the difficulty of finding a \nwilling policy provider, will affect his ability to stick with his \nstartup business--the point my colleagues were making of starting up a \nbusiness and being worried about health care.\n  Unfortunately, Ian's health insurance predicament as a self-employed \nbusinessman is not uncommon. There are entirely too many sole \nproprietors and small businesses that cannot afford health policies for \nthemselves, their families, and any employees they might have, thereby \nkilling the innovators of our system, the people who create the jobs, \nthe people who made America great, the small businesspeople. They \ncannot go into business because they are worried about health care not \njust for their employees, but they have to worry about health care for \nthemselves and their families. We have to change that if we are going \nto get innovation back in the country and small businesses up and \nrunning.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Small businesses are clearly the driving force behind job \ncreation in America. The Senator from Delaware is absolutely right. \nInnovation comes from small business. They are so discriminated against \nunder our current health care system. Middle-income families, in large \nmeasure, work for small businesses, and they are absolutely \ndisadvantaged today because of the system.\n  The status quo is unacceptable. We need to enact insurance reforms \nunder what we have here. Small companies can benefit the same as large \ncompanies, with much larger pools, much more affordable plans, more \nchoices.\n  There are really no options for small businesses today. They do not \nhave a lot of companies willing to write the policies. It is \ninteresting, in my State of Maryland, two insurance companies write 71 \npercent of the private insurance business. If you are a small business \nowner, you are either going to be with one of those companies or you \nare not going to be able to find insurance. They can pretty much \ndictate.\n  One more example. Robert, who lives in Baltimore, is a married \narchitect who has health insurance with one of our large insurance \ncompanies. His insurance for himself and his wife is $20,000 a year--\n$20,000 a year. As a small businessperson--listen to this--not only \ndoes he have to pay these high premiums, but if he needs to find a \ngastroenterologist in order to do a test, there are plenty of \ngastroenterologists in his neighborhood, but the insurance company will \nnot cover a doctor in that area. He has to travel all the way across \ntown. He says he spends more time finding out who will treat him \nbecause he doesn't have a choice of plan. He has to be in this plan. So \nthere is a lot of wasted money in the system he has to go through.\n  By the way, if you are in a small business, running a small business, \nyou have to spend time on your business. If you don't spend time on \nyour business, you are not going to make it. If you have to spend time \nto figure out what doctor you can see under the small print in your \ninsurance plan, you are not going to succeed as a businessperson.\n  There are a lot of good reasons why we need health insurance reform \nin America. There are a lot of good reasons we need to act, a lot of \ngood reasons middle-income families are depending on us to fix this \nbroken system--it is too expensive, not enough choice. The health \ninsurance reforms coming out of our committees all provide much more \nchoice and option and protection to the people in our communities.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. One of the great ironies in this whole health care \ndebate, which is full of ironies, is I talk to so many small \nbusinesspeople, and they are scared of the public option. They have \nbeen scared by the ads and things on television. As you say, for a \nsmall businessperson, the public option is going to be their choice to \nget the health care they need, simple health care that is laid out for \nthem that makes a lot of sense.\n  One of the big things we have to get through to people is exactly \nwhat the story is here and what really will help them get their health \ninsurance so we can have small businesses built up, get more employees, \ncreate more jobs, and create the jobs we need for the country.\n  Mr. CARDIN. The public insurance option is another choice. There is \nmore competition. It brings down costs. That\n\n[[Page S11041]]\n\nis why we support a public option. It is a reliable product you know is \ngoing to be there.\n  If you are living in western Maryland--and there are not a lot of \ninsurance companies there--you know there is a public option, that plan \nwill be there for you. You know it is going to be affordable. You know \nit is not going to leave town, as some of the private insurance \ncompanies did that used to insure Medicare. These plans will be there.\n  It is also going to act as strong competition for the private \ninsurance companies so they know they have to be competitive. Today, \nagain, it is not competitive. There are not enough companies there.\n  The private insurance option will offer people, such as Robert whom I \nmentioned, another option, another choice, an affordable plan. That is \nwhat he is looking for. He cannot afford $20,000 a year. He is looking \nfor a premium much more affordable than $20,000 a year, and the public \ninsurance option gives him that choice.\n  One other thing about the public option that needs to be clarified. \nThere are those who say: This is a government takeover. Is Medicare a \ngovernment takeover? The answer is no. There has not been one Senator \ncome to this floor to say we should repeal Medicare. Medicare has been \na very successful program.\n  By the way, health insurance reform will strengthen Medicare. Why? \nBecause the way to bring down Medicare costs is to bring down health \ncare costs. What we have been doing year after year is picking on \nMedicare, saying we are going to control health care costs by reducing \nMedicare. We cannot do it. You have to bring down health care costs to \nbring down Medicare costs. And what we do is strengthen the Medicare \nbenefits by giving additional benefits, starting to fill that doughnut \nhole under the prescription drug plan, offering preventive care to our \nseniors. So we are strengthening the Medicare Program. The doctors and \nthe hospitals are all private, as they would be under a public option. \nThis is a way of providing more competition, quite frankly, keeping the \nprivate insurance companies a little bit more competitive and honest as \nthey do their marketing, to make sure we get value for the dollars we \nare paying for our health insurance premiums.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Again, once more, the irony. Isn't it an incredible \nirony that people come to the floor and talk about reducing the \ndeficits, reducing the deficits, reducing the deficits, but they don't \nhave health care reform. We know the major cause for the increase in \ndeficits is Medicare and Medicaid, not because they are bad programs \nbut because health care costs explode. There is no way they cannot get \ngreater. That is our biggest challenge in terms of deficit reduction. \nWe have to do something about Medicare and Medicaid costs.\n  People talk about deficits and then say we don't need health care \nreform, why don't we slow down, we don't need it now, this is not \nimportant. We cannot deal with our deficits if we don't deal with \nhealth care costs because without dealing with health care costs, we \ncannot deal with Medicare and Medicaid. The Senator is absolutely \nright.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Health care costs are growing about three times what \nwages are growing in America today. That means a government that pays \nfor Medicaid and Medicare will continue to pay a larger amount of the \nbudget for health care unless we can get health care costs under \ncontrol. It also means American families are going to be paying more of \ntheir income for health care unless we get health costs under control.\n  So how do we get health care costs under control? We do it by \nprevention and we do it by wellness and by streamlining the \nbureaucratic system, by using health information technology more \neffectively and by managing diseases. We do it in a way that brings \ndown health care costs and improves access and quality, and that is \nwhat we are doing.\n  The Senator from Delaware is absolutely right. Our goal is quite \nsimple: bring down the escalating cost of health care, provide access \nto affordable quality health care for every American family, and do it \nin a fiscally responsible way.\n  The Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Well, I thank Senator Cardin. As I was listening, I \nwas thinking about how I first got involved in this whole debate. My \nstory is like so many moms and middle-class parents. It involved rules, \nrules that made no sense when it is your family's health at stake.\n  When my daughter was born, she was very sick. She couldn't swallow. \nThey thought she had a tumor. She was in intensive care overnight. Back \nthen, the insurance companies had a rule that you could only stay in \nthe hospital 24 hours--new moms and their babies. For some people, when \nyou have been in labor for 24 hours and you think your daughter might \ndie for 24 hours, it doesn't make sense. So 24 hours after giving \nbirth, I was kicked out of the hospital. I was wheeled out of the \nhospital while my daughter was there in intensive care.\n  I thought to myself: This is never going to happen to anyone again. I \nwent to the legislature with a number of other moms and got one of the \nfirst bills passed in the country guaranteeing new moms and babies a \n48-hour hospital stay. I still remember the conference committee where \nwe had a number of lobbyists who couldn't say they were against the \nbill, but they were trying to delay the implementation. They were \ntrying to make it so that it wouldn't take effect for years and years \nand years.\n  I finally decided to bring my pregnant friends to that conference \ncommittee so they outnumbered the insurance company lobbyists 2 to 1. \nWhen the legislators said: When should this bill take effect, all the \npregnant moms raised their hands and said: Now. And that is what was \nhappening.\n  I can tell Senator Cardin, this is what the American people are \nsaying. They are saying: Now. They need reform now because of what you \nhave just talked about--the fact that costs have been escalating and \nescalating, and it is becoming more and more unaffordable for so many \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  In 2008, employer health insurance premiums increased by 5 percent, \ntwo times the rate of inflation. Everyone feels it. Everyone knows what \nI am talking about.\n  When people throw out all these numbers--and we hear all these \nnumbers from the other side--I believe you only have to know three \nnumbers. Senator Cardin brought them up before, three simple numbers. \nThey are easy to remember: 6, 12, and 24.\n  What do the numbers 6, 12, and 24 represent? Well, $6,000 was the \ncost of insurance for the average American family 10 years ago. They \nwere paying that in their premiums. They are now paying $12,000. Some \npeople are paying a lot more, such as the small business owner I talked \nabout in Two Harbors, MN. But the average is $12,000.\n  What do the studies show? They show that in 10 years people in \nBillings, MT, people in Delaware, people in Baltimore, people in the \ntiniest towns in this country will be paying an average of $24,000 a \nyear. Do you think they are going to be able to afford that, the \naverage middle-class family, $24,000 a year? I think every family can \nlook at their own checkbook and figure out that answer. That is why we \nneed health care reform now.\n  I think of the people I have heard from in my State, such as Jan in \nPlymouth who wrote the other day about her 20-year-old daughter \nJennifer. Jennifer was diagnosed almost a year ago with Hodgkin's \nlymphoma. She made it through chemotherapy but is still being \nmonitored. She had to continue going to college to keep her health care \ncoverage. Despite having good health care insurance, Jan and her \nhusband had to use their retirement fund to cover the out-of-pocket \nexpenses of Jennifer's chemotherapy. Jennifer has since taken some time \noff from school to recover and is going to be transferring to a new \nschool soon. Her parents don't know how they are going to keep her \ninsured.\n  That is why the point was made about this plan allowing parents to \nkeep their kids on their insurance until they are 26 years old. I can't \ntell you what good news that is to the parents of America who are \nstruggling and who are thinking: Once my kid goes to college, what is \ngoing to happen because they would not have a job? How are they going \nto get insurance?\n  Now, until they are 26 years old, they are going to get insurance. \nThat would\n\n[[Page S11042]]\n\nhelp this family in Minnesota tremendously.\n  The preexisting conditions--I talked about three women with breast \ncancer who were there with the First Lady--unbelievable stories of \npeople who, through no fault of their own, get a disease, they are not \nsick anymore but they get thrown off their insurance policies; kids who \nare a little overweight or a little underweight--the only way they can \nget rid of this thing off their backs and get health insurance is by \ngoing on TV? I think we would have to have permanent TV stations going \naround the clock to cover all these families who want to get their \npreexisting conditions off their backs. That is not going to work in \nthis country. The better way is to pass health care reform.\n  The Senator from Maryland brought up the cost, and I can tell you \nthat for a lot of people in Minnesota, that is the No. 1 issue I hear: \nHow can we afford this? What can we do about it? Well, I can tell the \nSenator from Delaware--and I see the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, \nis here, and he has been working hard on the Medicare fraud issue on \nthe Judiciary Committee, as well as the Senator from Maryland--that 3 \nto 10 percent of our health care dollars go down the tube to crooks, to \ncon men, and we are not doing anything about this. There is money in \nthe system, and it is just going to the wrong places.\n  Another way to solve this is with trying to put more quality measures \ninto our system, trying to have high quality care at the lowest cost. \nPeople understand if you go to a hotel and you spend more money on a \nroom, you tend to get a better room, a bigger room, with a nicer view. \nWith health care, it is not the case. With health care, some of the \nhighest cost places have the lowest quality care. So one of the things \nthat health reform allows us to do is to put in those high-quality \nmeasures.\n  So we start having incentives. We say to hospitals: If you have less \ninfections in your hospital, which means more people live, you will be \ntreated better in the system. So we will put in incentives so that \ndoctors treat their patients better and, believe it or not, that is the \nway we are going to save money.\n  Why is that? So many times the way the system operates, it is about \nreimbursing for every little test, every little thing you do, instead \nof looking at the rules or looking at the quality of care that you can \nget at the end of the road. And that is what we want to do with this \nlegislation. There is a value index in this legislation.\n  The bill that came out of the Finance Committee, which Senator \nCantwell and I have worked hard on, let's us look at the value to the \npatient. Let's put patients in the driver's seat so they can get the \nvalue, so middle-class families can get the same kind of health care \nthat Members of Congress get, so they can get the kind of value they \nwant out of their health care.\n  So when we look at how we can pay for this, there are so many ways. \nWe can not only save some money, such as plug that doughnut hole so \nthat seniors can get better deals on their prescription drugs, but we \ncan do it so we can give people higher quality care. We are going to \nlink rewards to outcomes to create the incentives for doctors and \nhospitals to work together to improve quality and efficiency. That is \nwhat we are trying to do.\n  So I thank Senator Cardin for bringing up this issue of cost because \nfor so many middle-class families in my State, they understand we want \nto have not only more affordable care but also high-quality care. They \ndo not like these kinds of mistakes that go on, and there are some \nthings we can do by creating incentives for safer procedures and for \nbetter standards for hospitals and for doctors that I think could go a \nlong way toward paying for a lot of what we need to do.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my colleague from Minnesota. She has been a real \nfighter for middle-income families and working families in America and \nin Minnesota and has brought out these issues of how we can improve the \nstandard of living.\n  I think the point the Senator raises is one that needs to be \nunderscored. Today, working families, middle-income families are seeing \nan erosion of their income. They are seeing more and more of their \ncompensation going to pay for health benefits. If their employers are \npaying for it, it means less take-home money for them in their \npaychecks. If they have to pay the cost, they are seeing more and more \nof an increase. Again, health care costs are going up three times what \nwages are going up in America. So middle-income families are falling \nbehind every year, and they are depending on us to speak up for them.\n  They are also paying a hidden tax--a hidden tax. Middle-income \nfamilies today are spending $1,100 a year paying for those who don't \nhave health insurance. We talked about that earlier. That is a hidden \ntax. We have to get rid of that tax.\n  One of the things we do in our health insurance reform is to get rid \nof that tax by saying that everyone has to be responsible for their own \nhealth care costs. Why should I pay for someone who today could have \nhealth insurance but chooses not to have health insurance?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the Senator will yield, I think it is unfair to \nmiddle-class families who are trying to save every penny so they can \nsend their kids to college--and those costs are going up--and to put \nfood on the table and fill their car with gas, to have this hidden tax \nwhere they are paying for people who aren't getting health insurance or \ncan't afford health insurance. That is why I think one of the most \nimportant things for people to understand about this bill is that we \nare already paying for these people who don't have health insurance. So \nlet's make it more efficient and work for everyone so you can get some \nbenefit out of this yourself.\n  Mr. CARDIN. It is interesting that one of the ways we can save money \nfrom the Medicare system is to get everybody to pay their health care \nbills. Our seniors are paying higher costs under the Medicare system \nbecause people use the system who are not Medicare beneficiaries and \ndon't pay for it. So Medicare, every year, pays a premium to our \nhospitals called DIS--the disproportionate share--for the uncompensated \ncare in the hospitals. The Medicare system is paying for that. Our \nseniors could be getting better benefits if everyone paid their own way \nrather than having our seniors subsidize those who have no health \ninsurance.\n  So these are ways in which we do help middle-income families in \nAmerica.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I was just with a group of seniors this past weekend \nin Richfield, MN, and they are worried because they hear about these \nnumbers--that by 2017, if we don't do something, Medicare will go in \nthe red. Those seniors are living longer and longer lives, which is a \ngreat thing. Hopefully, my mom is watching right now; she is 82 years \nold. But those who are 65 want to have Medicare when they are 95 years \nold, and those who are 65 want to make sure Medicare is there for them \nwhen they are 90 years old. That is why it is so important to look at \nthis reform and make sure this is working for the seniors.\n  The doughnut hole, I am so tired of worrying about that problem. \nThese seniors have their health care coverage for their drugs, and then \nit vanishes and goes down the doughnut hole. One of the great things I \nlike about this health care reform is that it will help them pay for \nthe doughnut hole. I think 50 percent of those costs they will not have \nto worry about anymore.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Not only will we be able to help them with the doughnut \nhole on prescription drugs, we will be able to provide them better \nhealth care services with lower copayments and deductibility, and we \nare providing a stronger system.\n  Look, I think we all have a common interest. If you are a family that \ncurrently has health insurance, if you are a small business owner who \nis covering your employees, if you are covered under the Medicare \nsystem today, you all have an interest in making sure we pass the \nhealth insurance reform that is being debated now in the Congress.\n  For those who have insurance, it will make your coverage more \naffordable in the future. It will eliminate this hidden tax, and it \nwill enact significant health insurance reforms to protect you against \nthe arbitrary practices of private insurance companies.\n  If you are a small business owner, it will give you more competition, \nmore reliable premiums without being increased radically on a yearly \nbasis. It\n\n[[Page S11043]]\n\nwill provide competition so that you can get the same benefits a large \ncompany can get with larger pools.\n  If you are in the Medicare system, it takes some of the cost out of \nMedicare that you are currently subsidizing for people who are \nuninsured. It firms up our health care system, which is good for \nMedicare in the future as far as keeping it safe and sound, and it \nallows us to expand benefits, such as the prescription drug benefit, \nand get rid of that doughnut hole.\n  So we are all in this together. But the only option that we cannot \nafford to have is the status quo. The letters we have read on the \nSenate floor from people who are literally being forced out of their \ncurrent coverage, who are being discriminated against by insurance \ncompanies because of preexisting conditions that don't even exist, they \nare depending upon us to act.\n  I see the assistant majority leader is here, and I mention that \nbecause Senator Durbin has been one of the real leaders in taking on \nsome of the tough interests in our country--taking on the tobacco \ncompanies and dealing with tobacco and children, taking on prescription \ndrugs to make sure we have affordable drugs in America. So I thank him \nfor his leadership because I know he has been one of the real leaders \non this issue in the Senate.\n  I know all of us will do everything we can to help middle-income \nfamilies. We have worked hard to strengthen Medicare over the years, \nfought the efforts by those who wanted to privatize Medicare, who \nwanted to weaken Medicare, and we are committed to making sure that \nthese programs are strengthened, are continued, and that is why we are \nso passionate about the need for us to take up health insurance reform, \nfor us to make sure we protect middle-income families.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield for a question?\n  Mr. CARDIN. I am glad to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and \nSenator Cardin from Maryland for their leadership coming to the floor. \nI have been following the floor all day.\n  I heard from the other side of the aisle a litany of complaints that \nthey have about health care reform. Leading off in the complaints about \nhealth care reform is the number of pages in the bill. The fact is, \nthere is no Senate bill; it is in preparation at this moment. But the \nRepublican side of the aisle, starting with Senator McConnell, the \nleader, through other Senators, continues to come to the floor and \nbemoan the fact that this bill may actually reach 2,000 pages in \nlength. I don't know that it will. I don't know that it will not. I \ndon't know that it makes any difference. I don't think people back home \nreally care if this is a short bill or a long bill as long as it is a \ngood bill, as long as it does what needs to be done.\n  When you get down to the issues we are talking about, we want to make \nsure the language is precise. If we are going to fight the health \ninsurance companies--and believe me, they are spending a fortune trying \nto stop us. But if we are going to fight the health insurance companies \nto make sure people have a fighting chance when they have a health \ninsurance plan not to be canceled when they have a preexisting \ncondition, so they have a health insurance plan that is there when they \nneed it when they get sick, a health insurance plan that has enough \nmoney in it to pay for what they need, pay for preventive care, then \nlet's take the time and write the pages that are necessary. Trust me, \nthe attorneys for the insurance companies will be fighting us in court \nevery step of the way as we try to make these changes.\n  I was listening to the Senator from Maryland and the Senator from \nMinnesota. I recall a story I learned when I went home about a good \nfriend of mine whose son has been battling cancer for years. He is a \nbright young man who developed a melanoma and has gone through \nextensive radiation and chemotherapy and also surgeries. It has been a \nvaliant effort on his part. Two years ago, his oncologist found a drug \nthat made a difference for him. He was cancer free. He was as happy as \nhe has been for a long time because of this drug.\n  I think you know how this story is going to end. Just 2 months ago, \nhis health insurance company notified him that they would no longer pay \nfor this drug that he needed. His oncologist sent a letter to the \ninsurance company and said: This drug I am using off-label is working \nfor him. It has arrested the spread of his cancer, saved his life, and \nyou need to continue it.\n  The insurance company said: No, we will no longer pay for this.\n  The drug costs $13,000 a month. There is no way this young man and \nhis young family can pay for this. Even if his dad, mom, and all the \nrelatives mortgage their homes, they just can't pay for it.\n  It shows you how average people who pay premiums all their lives are \nat the mercy of an insurance company executive or, worse, an insurance \ncompany clerk who decides to just say no. That happens every single \nday.\n  I have been waiting for the first person on the Republican side of \nthe aisle to stand up and say: We may disagree on a lot of things, but \nwe sure do agree we have to do something about health insurance reform. \nThe way they are treating Americans is unacceptable. But we never hear \nthat from that side of the aisle.\n  I hope at the end of the day we will be able to come together in a \nbipartisan way. We all want to. But there may come a point where we \ncannot. If standing up to the health insurance companies can only be \ndone on this side of the aisle, so be it. Let's gather the votes, and \nlet's do it. But at the end of the day for that family and many in \nMaryland and Minnesota, that is going to be the test of whether health \ncare reform works. Will the costs start coming down? Will you have a \nfighting chance with the health insurance company when you really need \nprotection? Will it pay for things that mean something to you, such as \nmaintaining a person on diabetes prevention and wellness? Will it start \nbringing more people into the protection of health insurance so, as \nSenator Cardin said, we all are not paying for those who show up as \ncharity cases at the hospital? Those are the bottom-line questions.\n  I thank the Senator for raising this because I think this goes to the \nheart of this health care debate.\n  Mr. CARDIN. A little earlier, I read into the record several letters \nI received from Marylanders. That was a sampling. I received a lot \nmore. But it just points out--a letter from a Marylander who was denied \nfull coverage, not only for himself but his two children, for \npreexisting conditions that didn't even exist, frankly--they didn't \nexist--but the insurance company was in a position where they could \nwrite a policy the way they wanted to write it, and this person in \nMaryland had no choice. There was no other insurance company that \nperson could get. There was no competition there. We need to do \nsomething about that. We need to make it clear. I agree with the \nSenator, if it takes 10 pages or 100 pages or 1,000 pages, we have to \nmake it clear that insurance companies cannot do those types of \npractices against people in this Nation. They cannot underwrite based \nupon preexisting conditions.\n  It seems as though insurance companies want to write insurance \npolicies where no one can make claims. We buy insurance to protect us. \nInsurance needs to be there. That is one of the reasons we eliminate \ncaps. Insurance should be there to give you the coverage when you need \nit. If that family needs that medicine to keep that child alive, that \nis why you have insurance. Insurance should cover that. If it takes \n1,000 pages, let's make sure we get it right to protect the people in \nthis Nation.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. If the Senator will yield, I was thinking, as the \nSenator from Illinois was talking about the number of pages in bills, \nwhen we were in the middle of this country's worst economic crisis \nsince the Depression under the Bush administration and people were \ntrying to figure out what to do, if you remember, the administration \ncame forward with a bill that gave nearly $1 trillion out to banks, and \nit was something like 25 pages long, if I remember. I think the people \nin this country said: Hey, wait a minute, this is a major issue; 25 \npages or 10 pages or 3 pages or 100 pages is not enough.\n  We are dealing with an incredibly complicated issue--with insurance \ncompanies that have been running this show for so long. The fact that \nwe are going to spend some time on this bill, as the Senator from \nIllinois has pointed out--and the Senate bill is not even\n\n[[Page S11044]]\n\ndone yet. We are still working on this, we are still bringing through \nthese consumer reforms and that which is going to be good for the \npeople of America.\n  I really am a little tired of hearing about the number of pages. As I \nsaid, I think there are 3 numbers that matter here: 6, 12 and 24. Mr. \nPresident, $6,000 is what an average family paid 10 years ago--$6,000. \nNow an average family pays $12,000. What are you going to pay 10 years \nfrom now? What are you going to pay if nothing is done here--just keep \ngoing the way we are going, with the cost, the waste in the system, the \nMedicare fraud, and all these things that should not be going on? Mr. \nPresident, $24,000 is what the average family is going to pay. We need \nto start bringing those costs down, and the only way we take on these \ncompanies that have been putting in place these rules that say if a \nbaby is 4 months old and happened to weigh 17 pounds, just a little \nunderweight, you can't get insurance, and his family's insurance \ncompany--the only way we are going to help by taking them on, and I \ndon't care how many pages it takes.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank my colleagues, Senator Klobuchar from Minnesota, \nSenator Kaufman from Delaware, and Senator Durbin from Illinois, for \ntheir comments and for their passion on this issue. This is an issue we \nhave to get right for middle-income families in America. They are the \nones hurting. They are the ones who cannot afford this current system. \nThey are the ones falling further and further behind every year. These \nare the ones--subject to the discriminatory practices of private \ninsurance companies--we have a responsibility to protect. These are the \nones paying the hidden tax for people who do not have health insurance, \nmany of whom can afford health insurance but choose not to get it. It \nis our responsibility to act on behalf of middle-income families in \nAmerica to make sure we have the health care system that is affordable \nand is available to every person in this country.\n  What we are doing is to bring down the cost of health care, to make \nsure we have affordable care for every person, every American, and do \nit in a fiscally responsible way. I urge my colleagues to make sure we \ntake advantage of this opportunity. Let's make sure we get health care \nreform done, and done as soon as possible.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about extended \nunemployment benefits. I just received a call this afternoon from one \nof my State legislators in Minnesota who represents the Iron Range of \nMinnesota where my grandpa grew up and worked 1,500 feet underground in \nthe mines in Ely, MN, never graduated from college, and saved money in \na coffee can in the basement of his and my grandma's house to send my \ndad to college, and my dad and brother also worked in the mines.\n  It is tough times up in Ely, MN. Things go up and down, up and down \nin the iron ore business. Right now, they are in a downtime. There are \nsome glimmers of hope out there. Some of the mines have started up \nagain, but there is high unemployment up there, high unemployment in \nthe double digits. That is why this is so important, as America has \nbeen trying to really pick itself up and get moving again after this \neconomic crisis.\n  Someone once said that when Wall Street gets a cold, Main Street gets \npneumonia. That is what we are still seeing across this country despite \nthe glimmers of hope we see with the GDP, the good numbers there and \nsome of the other good numbers with house sales going up. There are \nsome positives going on in this country, there is no doubt about that. \nBut there are still so many people looking for jobs. I think for every \njob out there, there are six unemployed people trying to find that job. \nI have gotten letters from people saying they have applied for hundreds \nof jobs, sent in their resumes.\n  That is why it is so important, while Wall Street is starting to do \nwell again, to make sure we are protecting the people in this country \nwho need their unemployment. In the past 125 days alone, over 185,000 \nAmericans lost their unemployment benefits. Each passing day without an \nextension, more and more Americans are losing the last lifeline they \nhave to keep their heads above water in this difficult economy.\n  One of the things I really like about the Senate bill--I see the \nSenator from Illinois is back. I thank him for his leadership, and \nSenator Reid and Senator Shaheen and others who have worked on this \nissue. The Senate bill doesn't say: OK, only certain States are going \nto be able to get this extension of unemployment benefits. The Senate \nbill says what the people of my State say: The unemployment rate in \nMinnesota might be 7.3 percent right now, but in my house it is 100 \npercent, and I have been trying to find work over and over again.\n  I don't know what I would have said to the people of my State if I \nhad to come home and say to them: Look, the people of Wisconsin are \ngoing to get their unemployment benefits extended, right across the \nborder there, but the people of Minnesota are not.\n  We were glad to get Brett Favre from Wisconsin. That was a nice \npickup. But it doesn't mean they get unemployment benefits and we \ndon't. That is not a fair trade. So we are very glad the Senate bill \ntakes care of States such as Minnesota and so many other States such as \nMontana and others across this country.\n  I urge the Senate to pass this as quickly as possible in the name of \nall the people in my State and others who have been looking for work.\n  I will end with a letter I got from a woman named Barbara, from \nMahtomedi, MN. She wrote:\n\n       My husband has been looking for a job since March and \n     without unemployment to help us out I don't know what will \n     happen. All of us [our kids] have been looking for steady \n     employment for months. We drive old cars, we bought a house \n     within our means that we have been fixing up slowly for \n     ourselves for the past 22 years. We buy everything used or on \n     sale. Please don't let [the people of our State] get left out \n     in the cold [because it is starting to get cold and we need \n     the unemployment until we find a job.]\n\n  I thank you for allowing me a few minutes to talk about this \nimportant bill pending before the Senate, and I urge the Senate to \nquickly adopt our unemployment bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Minnesota because the story she \ntells are stories that are told in every State. How will we ever \nexplain to people who are struggling from day to day to feed their \nfamilies while they look for a job why it took us 26, 27, 28 days to \nextend unemployment benefits in the Senate? Because, on the other side \nof the aisle there was objection because Senators had ideas of \namendments they wanted to offer.\n  Well, there are plenty of bills for ideas. This was a bill that was \nproviding necessities of life for a lot of people even in their own \nStates. I am glad that it appears we are finally going to move to it \ntomorrow, 4 weeks after we started the extension of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  I do not understand how you can be for family values and not stand up \nfor these families when they are facing the toughest challenges in \nlife.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for her comments.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, November 4, following a \nperiod of morning business, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n3548, and all postcloture time be considered expired, all amendments to \nthe substitute and bill be withdrawn, no further amendments be in \norder, and the substitute amendment be agreed to, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the Senate then have general \ndebate until 12:15 p.m., with the time equally controlled between the \nleaders or their designees, the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on H.R. 3548; and that if cloture is invoked, the \npostcloture time be considered to have begun running as if cloture had \nbeen invoked at 11:45 p.m., Tuesday, November 3.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S11045]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11045-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor Charlie Frias for his \npositive work in Nevada. For almost five decades Charlie and his wife \nPhyllis have worked to make Nevada a better place. Whether through \ntheir business endeavors or their philanthropy, the Friases have sought \nto improve their community and make life a little easier for their \nfellow Nevadans.\n  Charlie Frias was born in San Antonio, TX, in 1922. As a young man, \nhe worked with his father and grandmother as a delivery boy in the \nfamily business. He graduated from Breckenridge High School and then \njoined the Navy. After being honorably discharged, he returned to San \nAntonio, TX, and married his wife Phyllis. In 1958, the couple moved to \nLas Vegas, NV, with little if any resources.\n  Upon arriving in Las Vegas, Charlie took a job as a taxicab driver \nwith ABC Union Cab Company. He worked diligently for this company that \nhe would come to own by 1962. Charlie quickly acquired three more cab \ncompanies and opened the first taxicab service in Mesquite, NV, the \nVirgin Valley Cab Company. He later went on to further expand into the \nlimousine business by adding Airline Limousine and Las Vegas Limousine \nto his holdings. At the time of his passing in 2006, Charlie had \nenjoyed over 40 years of success in the transportation field as well as \nother business activities.\n  Mr. Frias's wife, Phyllis, has not played the role of spectator over \nthe years. A constant partner in her husband's entrepreneurial efforts, \nPhyllis has recently displayed her own business talents through the \ncompletion of A Cowboy's Dream Bed and Breakfast in Alamo, NV. I have \nno doubt that Phyllis' luxury resort will help stimulate Nevada's \neconomy during our period of recovery.\n  Over the years Charlie and Phyllis did not consign themselves to a \nprofit-driven life. Rather, they have shown a humanitarian spirit and \nhave displayed this by giving back to the people of Clark County and \nall Nevada. Mr. and Mrs. Frias have sent school bands to participate in \nevents in Washington, DC, purchased buses for Virgin Valley High \nSchool, and provided apparel for local high school athletics. One of \nCharles and Phyllis Frias' greatest beliefs is for every child to have \nthe opportunity to obtain a quality education. Over the years, the \nFriases established scholarships and funded other programs for students \nin the education system, subsequently making it possible for many \nchildren to attend college. They established the Phyllis Frias \nEnvironmental Studies Scholarship at the University of Nevada, Las \nVegas. They have not limited their generosity to education, but have \nalso donated to other cultural and community organizations such as the \nMesquite Arts Council, Spring Valley Little League, American Lung \nAssociation, Las Vegas Rescue Mission, the Clark County Firefighters \nChristmas Fund, and many others.\n  The valiant Mother Teresa once said, ``Let us not be satisfied with \njust giving money. Money is not enough, money can be got, but they need \nyour hearts to love them. So, spread your love everywhere you go.'' It \nis safe to say that Charlie and Phyllis Frias have displayed this ideal \nthrough their actions. They have devoted their time, energy, love and \nresources to helping Nevada's kids get a quality education and a better \nlife. For me Charlie Frias stands for the independent spirit of Las \nVegas and the west. He is in my Hall of Fame.\n  I know that A Cowboy's Dream Bed and Breakfast will have a future as \nbright as the neon Vegas Vic cowboy sign. I salute the Friases for \ntheir service to the people of our great State and I wish Phyllis the \nvery best now that Charlie is gone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11045-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                        Sergeant Dale R. Griffin\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SGT Dale Russel Griffin from Terre Haute, IN. Dale was 29 years \nold when he lost his life on October 27, from injuries sustained during \na roadside bomb attack in Arghandab Valley, Afghanistan. He was a \nmember of the 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry \nDivision, Fort Lewis WA. Dale was serving as part of operation Enduring \nFreedom.\n  Today, I join Dale's family and friends in mourning his death. Dale \nwill forever be remembered as a loving son, and friend to many. Dale is \nsurvived by his parents, Dona and Gene, and a host of other friends and \nrelatives.\n  Prior to entering the service, Dale graduated from Terre Haute South \nVigo High School in 1999 where he was an accomplished wrestler gaining \nAll-State recognition. He would later lead the Virginia Military \nInstitute to a fourth place finish in the All-Academy Wrestling \nChampionships in 2000, in which he was named the Tournament's \nOutstanding Wrestler.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Dale set as both a soldier and son. Today and \nalways, he will be remembered by family, friends and fellow Hoosiers as \na true American hero, and we cherish the legacy of his service and his \nlife.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as we can take \nsome measure of solace in knowing that Dale's heroism and memory will \noutlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Dale R. Griffin in the \nofficial record of the U.S. Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray \nthat Dale's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah \nwho said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \nwipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Dale.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11045-4", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11045-S11046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JAY FETCHER\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I want to take this opportunity \nto recognize a true champion of land protection who also happens to be \na member of my staff, Mr. Jay Fetcher.\n  Jay, who owns a ranch near Steamboat Spring, CO, and who is my \nnorthwestern Colorado field director, has been selected by a land \npreservation group called Colorado Open Lands as the recipient of their \n2009 George E. Cramner Award. Every year since 1992, Colorado Open \nLands has bestowed this award on someone who has distinguished \nthemselves in open space preservation. According to Colorado Open \nLands, recipients of this award are individuals who have gone above and \nbeyond what others have done to preserve and protect open spaces and \noften achieve these goals through determination and passion for the \nland. They leave behind a legacy that will be valued and enjoyed for \ngenerations. Jay is just such a person, and he is indeed deserving of \nthis prestigious award.\n  As highlighted in the Colorado Open Lands newsletter announcing this \naward, Jay's ties to Colorado agriculture and conservation run deep. He \ngrew up on the family ranch, and after receiving a degree in Animal \nScience from the University of Wyoming, he returned to his family's \nranch to take over the operation. In 1980, he received a master's \ndegree in genetics from Colorado State University.\n  In 1994, the Fetchers decided that they wanted their land near \nSteamboat Springs to be a ranch forever and to be able to pass it on to \ntheir children. After creating their ranch's conservation easement, Jay \nwent to the board of the Colorado Cattlemen's Association and suggested \nit start a land trust.\n\n[[Page S11046]]\n\nThe Cattlemen's Association voted to become the first mainstream \nagricultural organization in the Nation to form a land trust, which was \nofficially incorporated in 1995 as the Colorado Cattlemen's \nAgricultural Land Trust.\n  Jay worked diligently for land preservation as a founding member and \npast president of the Colorado Cattlemen's Agricultural Land Trust. \nJay's community service record is also impressive, and includes serving \non the boards of the Colorado Water Trust, the Colorado Environmental \nCoalition, the Steamboat Springs School District and Education Fund, \nthe North Routt Fire Protection District, the Yampa Valley Medical \nCenter, and as a founding member of the Community Agriculture Alliance.\n  He served on the Governor's Agriculture Land Conversion task force in \n1995 and is a member of the Routt County Cattlemen and the Colorado \nCattlemen's Association. He also served as a regional representative in \nnorthwest Colorado for Senator Ken Salazar.\n  In 1997, Jay received the American Land Conservation Award, which \nrecognizes outstanding volunteer leadership in land and water \nconservation. In April 2009, he received the William Funk Award for the \nNonprofit Association of Colorado, which honors acknowledged leaders \nwho can unify people and organizations around a common cause.\n  Over the years, Jay's insight and hard work for the land trust \nmovement and conservation have proven invaluable. Jay has become a \ntrusted resource for those considering conservation easements.\n  That experience--and his deep roots in the community and his \ndedication to service--lead Jay to twice run for a seat in the Colorado \nState Legislature. Jay applied the same work ethic--and integrity--to \nthese races as he does to his land preservation work. These were very \nclose races, and his loss has been our gain.\n  In March of this year, I asked Jay to join my office as field \ndirector for the issues and concerns of northwestern Colorado. I had no \nhesitation offering him the position, as he is a well-known and well-\nrespected community member of this region of Colorado. He had performed \nsimilar great service to a former Senator from Colorado--and now \nSecretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar. He has been doing an exemplary \njob working with the communities and citizens in this area on issues \nregarding water, land, agriculture, outdoor recreation, rural health \ncare and services, and federal public land management. Jay is an expert \nin all of these areas and has already proven himself as a valued member \nof my team.\n  Jay's dedication to the land and the need to keep it productive and \npreserved was recently highlighted in a book from Colorado's preeminent \nlandscape photographer, John Fielder. The book, called Ranches of \nColorado, features glorious photographs of many Colorado ranches, \nincluding the Fetcher ranch. In the text of the section describing the \nFetcher Ranch, former Denver Post reporter and author James Meadow had \nthis to say about Jay when describing the Fetcher ranch family history:\n\n       [Jay] fell in love with the land and the cattle and stayed \n     to learn their ways; remaining on the ranch year after year, \n     until the years became decades, and the decades tumbled past \n     a half-century, and there is still no end in sight to [Jay's] \n     love of the land. You can see that love in his eyes [and] you \n     can hear it in his voice. It is a soft voice, a voice that \n     cites Mother Teresa and the intricacies of cattle genetics \n     with the same kind of curiously easygoing gravitas.\n\n  This is a short but apt description of Jay--his story and passion for \nthe land he has worked and loved.\n  I appreciate that Colorado Open Lands has also recognized Jay's great \nwork and am pleased that they are honoring him with this prestigious \naward. My staff and I want to express our congratulations to Jay for \nall his great work. We will continue to expect many more great \naccomplishments from him in the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11046-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO GEORGE CANNELOS\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nleadership George Cannelos demonstrated during his 4 years of public \nservice as Federal Cochair of the Denali Commission. From 2005 to 2009, \nGeorge effectively used his extensive experience in rural Alaska to \nimprove the delivery of affordable, reliable, and sustainable \ninfrastructure to scores of Alaska communities.\n  With his guidance, the partnership between the Denali Commission and \nthe State of Alaska grew in significant ways and has become the \ncornerstone of the Commission's success and progress. His advancement \nof collaborative efforts helped find innovative solutions with a \npromptness for carrying out the Denali Commission's mission.\n  In his first year as Cochair, a transportation advisory committee was \ncreated, composed of rural Alaska leaders with broad experience. Its \nsuccessful implementation made it a useful model for committees to \ncome. In 2007, the Commission opened its first rural office, taking a \nnew approach with a remote site workforce.\n  George has led the Commission with passion and dedication to using \ninnovative strategies in rural Alaska. For 2 years in a row, the Denali \nCommission was recognized by the National Association of Development \nOrganization for innovative program work.\n  His contributions have moved the Commission forward, leaving a \npositive outlook for upcoming years. His efforts will continue to do \ngood work and play a critical role in the quality of life and economic \ndevelopment of Alaska's most remote communities.\n  Mr. President and colleagues, please join me in recognition of his \noutstanding accomplishments and important work in improving the quality \nof life, infrastructure, housing, access to health care, and economic \nopportunity in rural Alaska. We thank him for his service and wish him \nluck as he begins the next chapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11046-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING GOVERNORS STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, 40 years ago, just a few miles \nsouth of Chicago, a brand new public university first opened its doors \nto an incoming class of students. The school was designed to reflect \nthe core values of higher education, but in an innovative, \nnontraditional way. To bring exceptional undergraduate and graduate-\nlevel academics to a diverse student body, and to extend the benefits \nof a quality education beyond the walls of the college classroom.\n  This week, as Governors State University observes its 40th \nanniversary, I am pleased to join the students, alumni, administration, \nand faculty in celebrating the continued success of their fine public \ninstitution.\n  Since its inception, the Governors State community has grown and \ndeveloped into an educational and cultural center of Illinois. And even \nas the university looks back with pride on the last 40 years, they \nrecognize that the best way to celebrate their past is by looking to \nthe future.\n  I would like to commend Governors State University for its indelible \ncontributions to the quality of higher education in Illinois, and its \ncontinuing leadership in this field. Their evolving vision continues to \ninspire thousands to enroll every year. Their commitment to excellence \nhas touched the lives of generations of students.\n  And with the recent creation of a doctoral program in physical \ntherapy, Governors State continues to expand its reach and broaden its \nhorizons.\n  I am proud to join Governors State University in celebrating its \nfirst 40 years as a bastion of the Illinois educational community. And \nI have no doubt that as we look ahead to the next 40 years, this fine \ninstitution will continue to lead the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11046-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11046-S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING SILVIANO ROMERO\n\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, it is with great \nsorrow that today I pay tribute to one of the finest men Northern New \nMexico has ever known, Silviano Romero, or ``Silver,'' as he was known \nto all who knew and loved him.\n  On Sunday, October 25, 2009, Silver passed away, 1 month shy of his \n90th birthday, in the small Northern New Mexico town of Embudo where he \nwas born on November 27, 1919. But for his service to our Nation in the \nPacific\n\n[[Page S11047]]\n\nTheater and Phillipines during World War II, Embudo is where Silver \nlived his entire life with his extraordinary and beautiful wife and \nbest friend of 67 years, Mary B. Romero, of Dixon. Together, after \nSilver returned from military service, they built the house in Embudo \non County Road 0062 where their three sons, Alfonso, David, and \nRichard, grew up and where Silver lived and worked until his passing \nlast week.\n  Silver was a pillar of his community. He was a man dedicated to \nothers--to his family, his community, his country, and his God. Like so \nmany others of his noble generation, he served his country in the \nmilitary and continued to serve his community upon his return home. Not \nonly did Silver work for Los Alamos County, the Espanola School \nDistrict, and as the Rio Arriba County clerk, but he was also actively \ninvolved as a county school board member, a Jemez co-op board member, a \nmember of the East Rio Arriba Soil and Water Conservation District, and \na lifelong active member of the Rio Arriba Democratic Party.\n  Yes, Silver was a pillar of the extended Embudo community, and he was \nsomething of an institution in Rio Arriba County. But it was on County \nRoad 0062, at La Junta, and the confluence of the Rio Embudo and Rio \nGrande, that one could see and feel Silver's love for the people and \nworld around him. The cats, dogs, and horses who came under Silver's \ncare knew full well the enormity of Silver's heart. And one need look \nno further than see the joy on Silver's face as he drove his four-\nwheeler down the road to inspect what may or may not be a rattlesnake, \nwind whipping through his appropriately silver-colored hair, to \nunderstand his appreciation and love for life.\n  That Silver lived at the confluence of the little-known Rio Embudo \nand the Rio Grande, one of the largest rivers in the United States, is \nappropriate. The Rio Grande stretches almost 2,000 miles, providing \nwater and sustenance to parts of this country where no one has heard of \nthe little Rio Embudo. Yet without it, and other tributaries along the \nway, the Rio Grande would likely not be the force it is.\n  So, too, does a life like Silver's contribute to the world around \nhim. Those of us who knew him and knew of his commitment to his \ncommunity understand the contributions he made and the ways in which it \nimproved the lives of many beyond Embudo, Rio Arriba County, and even \nNew Mexico. But a life lived as Silver lived his touches even those who \nnever had the honor and pleasure of knowing him. Quite simply, the \nworld was a much better, kinder place with Silver in it.\n  While we are profoundly saddened by the passing of this humble yet \nextraordinary man, we can take great solace in the fact that he is \nsurvived by many deeply touched by him: his wife Mary; his brothers, \nTom and Uvaldo Romero; his sister, Julia Montoya; his sons, Alfonso, \nDavid, and Richard; his grandchildren, Ann Williams, Amy Shelly, Dee \nRomero, David Romero, Jason Romero, Ryan Romero, Richard Romero, Jr., \nand Marquita Romero; his great-grandchildren, Taylor, Tyrell, Ashton, \nSaren, Katherine, Emma, Isla, Noah Silviano, Juan Diego, and Mark.\n  The spirit of Silviano ``Silver'' Romero lives on in all of them and \nwill forever live in the Dixon and Embudo Valley, Rio Arriba County, \nand in all of the great State of New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11047-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11047-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "03"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/03/senate-section/article/S11047-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:36 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 174.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to conduct \na special resource study to determine the suitability and feasibility \nof adding the Heart Mountain Relocation Center, in the State of \nWyoming, as a unit of the National Park System; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I join Senator Enzi today to introduce \nthe Heart Mountain Relocation Center Study Act. This legislation will \nauthorize the National Park Service to conduct a special resource study \nof the site of Heart Mountain Relocation Center near Powell, Wyoming. \nThe site is an important part of our national history and of the \nhistory of our communities in western Wyoming.\n  This legislation is truly a credit to the individuals, local \ncommunities and grassroots organizations supporting recognition of the \nHeart Mountain site. Many of these individuals readily share their \nexperience of the years between 1942 and 1945, when Japanese American \nfamilies from the West Coast were forcibly moved to Park County, \nWyoming and interned at the site near Heart Mountain. During those \nyears, the Heart Mountain site was the third-\n\n[[Page S11051]]\n\nlargest community in Wyoming, housing nearly 11,000 Japanese Americans. \nThe experience during those years shaped internees and local residents \nalike. It represents an important chapter in American history.\n  The legislation introduced today will authorize study of the Heart \nMountain site and its significance to the mission of the National Park \nService. The study will involve participation by the public and \nevaluate options for future management of the Heart Mountain site.\n  I want to thank the Heart Mountain Wyoming Foundation, along with \nother supporting organizations, for championing this cause. It is \nbecause of their efforts that this important historical site has been \npreserved and presented to the public.\n  The internment of Japanese Americans during World War II is a part of \nAmerica's history. The special resource study of Heart Mountain \nRelocation Center will lay groundwork for protecting this history for \nfuture generations. I urge Senators to support the Heart Mountain \nRelocation Center Study Act.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the importance of \npreserving the Heart Mountain World War II Internment Camp in Powell, \nWyoming. My good friend and colleague Senator John Barrasso and I are \nintroducing a bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to \nconduct a special resource study to determine the suitability and \nfeasibility of adding the Heart Mountain Relocation Center as a unit of \nthe National Park System.\n  Heart Mountain, WY, was 1 of 10 relocation centers created during \nWorld War II to house Japanese and Japanese-Americans who were forcibly \nrelocated inland from the west coast. The current site contains the \nmost existing structures of any site in the country. To memorialize \nthis history, the Heart Mountain, Wyoming Foundation is working to \ndevelop a Learning Center on the site of the Internment Camp. The \nFoundation is a well-established and creditable organization serving \n2,800 on its mailing list, with notable Board and Advisory Board \nmembers including former Senator Alan Simpson and former U.S. \nDepartment of Commerce and U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary \nNorman Mineta. Senator Simpson and Secretary Mineta first met as Boy \nScouts when Senator Simpson's Cody, WY, Scout Troop visited Secretary \nMineta's troop while he was interned as a young man in the Heart \nMountain camp. They developed a bond that would last for decades and \neventually served in Congress together.\n  Private and public entities alike strongly believe that Heart \nMountain, WY, should be preserved for future generations. I, too, \nbelieve preservation of one of our country's landmarks from World War \nII should be saved so our children and grandchildren have another tool \nto learn about our country's history.\n  In 2000, I secured Federal funding from the Economic Development \nInitiative Grant Program, EDI, under the U.S. Department of Housing and \nUrban Development for the Heart Mountain, Wyoming Foundation. The \nfoundation used this funding to acquire land and conduct environmental \nassessment of the land in order to build an interactive learning \nfacility at Heart Mountain's World War II Internment Camp in Powell, \nWY. The facility educates tourists and Wyomingites about the camp's \nhistory and effects on the Japanese American population. In the past 9 \nyears, private individuals, non-profit organizations, and the Federal \nGovernment have issued additional dollars to the Heart Mountain, \nWyoming Foundation in order to achieve its goal of preserving the land, \nremaining structures, and building the Learning Center.\n  The next step in this journey is the bill Senator Barrasso and I are \nintroducing today. The bill would authorize the Secretary of the \nInterior to conduct a special resource study to determine the \nsuitability and feasibility of adding the Heart Mountain Relocation \nCenter as a unit of the National Park System. When conducting the \nstudy, the Secretary of the Interior will be looking at various factors \nincluding, but not limited to, evaluating the national significance of \nHeart Mountain, WY; identifying the cost estimates for any Federal \nacquisition, development, operation and maintenance of the area; and \nidentifying any potential impacts of designation of site as a unit of \nthe National Park System on private landowners. Once funds are made \navailable for the study, the Secretary of the Interior has 3 years to \nstudy the issue and issue a report about next steps to the appropriate \nHouse and Senate committees of jurisdiction.\n  Simply because we are introducing this legislation does not guarantee \nthat Heart Mountain will become a part of the National Park System. The \nbill we are introducing will allow the Secretary to study that question \nand to make a recommendation based on the merits of Heart Mountain and \nhow it would fit within the entire National Park System.\n  Heart Mountain Camp internees want to leave a legacy of learning \nthrough this Center to future generations such that abridgements of \nfreedoms and lack of ethnic understanding not occur again in this great \ncountry. Preserving the land and structures and building the Learning \nCenter will do just that. This bill is the next step forward in making \ntheir dream a reality.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 2723. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na special depreciation allowance and recovery period for noncommercial \naircraft property; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, Today I introduce an important piece of \nlegislation that would provide a real boost to our economy at little, \nif any, expense to taxpayers. The bill I introduce would offer bonus \ndepreciation on the purchase of noncommercial general aviation aircraft \nin 2010 or 2011.\n  America is the world leader in general aviation manufacturing, a \nsector in which we truly have no peer. General aviation is an essential \nand critical part of our Nation's transportation infrastructure for \nmany individuals and businesses, for whom time is of the absolute \nessence. Further, general aviation is a vital component of our economy, \nsupporting over 1.2 million jobs and providing $150 billion in economic \nactivity. It is one of the few remaining American manufacturing \nindustries that still provide a significant trade surplus for the U.S., \ngenerating over $5.9 billion in exports of domestically manufactured \nplanes in 2008 alone.\n  However, this sector is particularly susceptible to economic \ndownturns. Many individuals and companies will delay or even cancel the \npurchase of an aircraft in a bad economy even though they may have a \npresent need for a new aircraft.\n  We see this reflected in our general aviation sector where during the \nfirst half of 2009, we witnessed declines of 58 percent in piston \nengine aircraft sales; 37 percent in jet engine aircraft sales; and 13 \npercent in turboprop aircraft sales. At the same time, use of business \njets has declined 12 percent over the past year, and the number of used \naircraft on the global market stands at a historic high.\n  Cumulatively, general aviation companies have had to lay off 19,000 \nAmerican workers, and this includes 11,500 alone in Wichita, KS. Over \nthe past year, total employment of general aviation companies has \ndeclined by almost 14 percent. This is even more alarming when you \nconsider that the U.S. Department of Labor aerospace workforce \nmultiplier is three. For every general aviation worker on an aircraft, \nthere are three jobs outside the immediate company that are created, \nwhether manufacturing, engineering, supply or support. So, for this \nmany general aviation workers to have been laid-off has much further \nreaching consequences in terms of the number of people and families \nthat are adversely impacted.\n  The legislation that I propose today is a proven approach to spur \ngeneral aviation aircraft orders with minimal affect on the Federal \nbudget. My approach to this issue is an approach that has resulted in \nreal jobs. During the 2003-2004 economic downturn, I worked to have \ngeneral aviation bonus depreciation included in legislation that \nemerged from the Senate Finance Committee. That provision is credited \nwith spurring over $2 billion in new general aviation aircraft sales, \nand it is credited with saving or sustaining thousands of jobs. Also, \nanother consideration that makes this approach a real\n\n[[Page S11052]]\n\nno-brainer is that, in the past, the Joint Tax Committee reported the \nprovision to have a negligible impact on Federal tax revenues over the \n10-year budget window. This is because, while tax revenue is reduced in \nthe near-term, revenues rebound to higher levels in the second half of \nthe 10-year window as no deprecation is being taken in the later years \nof the period.\n  Acting on this proposal now is important. The Blue Chip Economic \nIndicators consensus forecast expect unemployment to rise above 10 \npercent and to remain above the 3rd quarter 2009 level of 9.6 percent \nat least though the end of 2010, so we are looking at uncertain \neconomic growth and high unemployment for several more quarters. A \nproposal like the one that I am putting forward is likely to encourage \nindividuals and businesses to go ahead and act now on placing orders \nrather than waiting. For the Congress to act on this bonus depreciation \nlegislation now would have a positive effect on getting our economic \nengines moving again and can play a part in helping facilitate a \nbroader economic recovery, as it would hopefully again help to save and \nsustain jobs as well as returning jobs to those who have lost them as a \nresult of the recession.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Ensign, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 2724. A bill to provide for environmental restoration activities \nand forest management activities in the Lake Tahoe Basin; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friends, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Ensign, and Senator Boxer to introduce the Lake \nTahoe Restoration Act of 2009.\n  Representatives Heller, Titus, Berkley and others will be introducing \nan identical version of this legislation in the House of \nRepresentatives today, and I urge both bodies to act swiftly on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Lake Tahoe is a place of incredible beauty. The clear blue waters of \nthe lake, surrounded by forested slopes and snow-capped peaks is a \nsight that can stir the soul. When Mark Twain first saw Lake Tahoe in \n1861, he described it as ``a noble sheet of blue water lifted six \nthousand three hundred feet above the level of the sea, and walled in \nby a rim of snow-clad mountain peaks that towered aloft full three \nthousand feet higher still!'' He went on to proclaim the view in front \nof him as surely ``the fairest picture the whole earth affords.'' I \ncould not agree more.\n  But the Lake Tahoe Basin faces some great challenges. The famed \nclarity of the lake declined by over a third during the last 50 years; \nit is estimated that 25 percent of the trees in the basin are dead or \ndying; the Lahontan cutthroat trout that once grew to 40 pounds or more \nin Lake Tahoe are no longer present; and many of the basin's natural \nmarshes and wetlands have been altered or drained.\n  It became clear to me in the 1990s that a major commitment was needed \nto turn things around for the health and future of Lake Tahoe and the \nLake Tahoe Basin. In 1996, I called then-President Clinton and Vice \nPresident Gore and asked if they would come to Lake Tahoe with me so \nthat they could see both the incredible beauty of the place and many \nthreats facing this rare jewel. When we convened in July 1997, the \nPresident and Vice President brought four cabinet secretaries with them \nand we had a serious multi-day session On the future of Lake Tahoe. \nPresident Clinton promised to make Lake Tahoe a priority--for the \npeople of Nevada, for the people of California and for the whole \ncountry. An executive order and the subsequent Lake Tahoe Restoration \nAct of 2000 underscored that commitment.\n  It would have been difficult to imagine at that first summit how much \nprogress we would be able to make in 12 years. The clarity of the lake \nnow appears to have stabilized, thousands of acres of forest lands have \nbeen restored, roads and highways across the basin have been improved \nto limit runoff, and the natural function of many miles of stream zones \nand riparian areas has been restored. But there is a great deal yet to \nbe done. We offer this legislation as the next step.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2009 focuses Federal attention on \nthe areas where we can be most effective and it builds on the lessons \nwe have learned since 1997. The basic summary of the bill is that it \nauthorizes $415 million over 8 years to improve water clarity, reduce \nthe threat of fire, and restore the environment. But I would like to \ntake a few minutes to explain some of the components in greater depth.\n  It would be impossible to make real progress in the Lake Tahoe Basin \nwithout working hand-in-hand with the Forest Service, which manages 75 \npercent of the land in the area. With that in mind, we call on the \nForest Service to support the thresholds put forth by the Tahoe \nRegional Planning Agency, we provide encouragement and funding to work \non the restoration of stream environment zones, and we withdraw all \nForest Service in the Basin lands from mineral entry in order to \nminimize soil disturbance. The Forest Service is also granted increased \nflexibility to exchange land with the states of Nevada and California \nwhich will allow for more cost-efficient management of the over 8,000 \npublicly owned urban parcels spread throughout the Basin. Currently, \nthe Forest Service owns over 3,280 of these urban parcels and there are \nquestions about whether it is in the public interest for the Forest \nService to manage these urban lands or whether it would be better to \npass them to other responsible entities that could provide more \nefficient management. We have asked the Forest Service to report to \nCongress on their plans for improving this part of their program, \nincluding any suggestions for how Congress might be able to help. Along \nwith these new authorities and direction for forest management, the \nbill authorizes $136 million to reduce the threat of wildfire. This \nincludes work on Forest Service lands as well as work done by local \nfire agencies. Local communities and fire districts that receive grants \nfrom this generous program will provide a 25 percent cash match.\n  The Environmental Improvement Plan, EIP, another key part of \nrestoration efforts in the basin. The EIP is a list, prepared by Lake \nTahoe stakeholders, of projects that are designed to improve water \nquality, forest health, air quality and fish and wildlife habitat \naround Lake Tahoe. As part of this bill we authorize $136 million for \nFederal funding to support EIP projects. We also call on stakeholders \nin the basin to carefully rank the projects in the EIP, using the best \navailable science, in order to give everyone involved an understanding \nof the long-term priorities and goals of the program. Through this \nranking, when state, local, or private funds become available, the \nstakeholders and government agencies can move immediately to fund and \nimplement the projects that are most vital and in keeping with the \nlong-range vision for environmental restoration in the basin.\n\n  Another important authorization in the bill is $72 million for \nstormwater management and watershed restoration projects which have \nbeen determined to be among the most effective ways to improve water \nclarity. These are projects designed to reduce the inflow of very fine \nsediment into the lake through improvement of urban stormwater systems \nor the restoration of natural watershed functions in the basin's \nstreams and marsh areas.\n  The legislation also takes great strides in protecting Lake Tahoe \nfrom dangerous invasive species like quagga and zebra mussels. The \ndamage that would be inflicted at Lake Tahoe by a quagga or zebra \nmussel infestation has been estimated to be in the tens of millions of \ndollars annually. These organisms destroy native ecosystems. Their \nrampant reproduction upsets food chains and drives other species out of \nexistence. Dense accumulation of shells damages infrastructure, clogs \nwater pipes and fouls boats and motors. As has been experienced in \nother parts of our country, these invasive species can leave boulders \nand beaches covered in an unsightly, foul-smelling, crust of sharp \nfingernail-sized shells. In order to protect Lake Tahoe from this \nhorrible fate, our bill would provide $20 million for watercraft \ninspections and removal of existing invasive species from Lake Tahoe. \nFurther, we prohibit watercraft that have had contact with quagga or \nzebra mussel-infested waters from entering waterbodies in the Lake \nTahoe Basin. All other watercraft must submit to inspection and \ndecontamination prior to launch in order to prevent\n\n[[Page S11053]]\n\nthe introduction of these harmful species. Watercraft can be exempted \nfrom decontamination if they have not launched elsewhere since last \nbeing in Lake Tahoe.\n  Of special importance to me, this legislation authorizes $20 million \nto help implement the full-scale recovery of the Lahontan cutthroat \ntrout. This iconic fish was highly sought by anglers for generations, \nand was the top predator in the lake's ecosystem. Populations started \nto decline when widespread logging and pulp operations came to the \nTahoe Basin, damaging crucial spawning areas. This, combined with \nserious overfishing, led to a sharp decline in population levels. To \nmake matters worse, a number of non-native fish were introduced into \nLake Tahoe and began to prey upon the remaining juvenile cutthroats.\n  We have since made great progress in cleaning up the Basin's streams \nand restoring lost habitat, but we will need to take additional steps \nto bring this great fish back to Lake Tahoe. The funding authorized by \nthis legislation will make these steps possible. I would also like to \nnote, that the Fish and Wildlife Service has made great progress in \nbringing Lahontan cutthroat trout back to Fallen Leaf Lake, in the \nTahoe Basin. I have faith that they can work similar wonders in Lake \nTahoe.\n  Another piece of this bill that we have put a lot of time and thought \ninto is the science program. A solid understanding of how our \nrestoration efforts are working, and how natural physical and \nbiological processes affect the lake is critical to ensuring continued \nprogress in restoring the health of the basin. The legislation \nauthorizes $30 million for scientific programs and research that will \nproduce information on long-term trends in the basin and provide the \nbasis for selection of the most effective projects. To help coordinate \nefforts, all projects funded by this legislation will have monitoring \nand assessment built into their project design so that we can better \nunderstand their contributions to restoration in the basin.\n  A great deal of work has gone into this bill, and I am grateful for \nthe help and assistance that my colleagues and their staffs have \nprovided. Senator Feinstein and her staff deserve special praise for \ntheir diligent efforts. I also sincerely appreciate the time and \nattention of the many people in Nevada and California who have provided \ncrucial input along the way.\n  Anyone who has been to Lake Tahoe knows that is it not just uniquely \nbeautiful but that it is also worth fighting to protect. It is my \nsincere hope that my grandchildren will see the day when the Lake's \nclarity is restored to 100 feet or more, when Tahoe's giant native \ntrout are once again plentiful, and when nearby forests are diverse and \nhealthy. Mark Twain saw something amazing when he crested into the Lake \nTahoe Basin. We owe it to ourselves and to subsequent generations to \nrestore as much of that splendor as we can. This bill is the next step \nin that journey.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2724\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, Lake Tahoe is a national treasure. Her \nalpine beauty has drawn and inspired people for centuries: artists and \npoets, John Muir and Mark Twain, and countless millions the world over.\n  But the ``Jewel of the Sierra'' is in big trouble. If we don't act \nnow, we could lose Lake Tahoe--lose it with stunning speed--to several \ndevastating threats.\n  Invasive species, such as the quagga mussel, could decimate the lake, \nmuch as it has Lake Mead. Just one quagga mussel attached to a boat \ncould lay 1 million eggs. An infestation would devastate the lake. It \nwould ruin its biology, foul its beaches, deliver a body\n\n[[Page S11058]]\n\nblow to the regional economy. It would turn this ``noble sheet of clear \nwater,'' as Twain put it, into just another dull, gray, polluted body \nof water. We must get a stranglehold on invasive species before they \nget a stranglehold on the lake.\n  Catastrophic wildfires could spiral out of control and consume the \nbasin. The Angora Fire of 2007 destroyed 242 homes and scorched 3,100 \nacres. It was just a wakeup call. Today, 25 percent of the basin's \nforests are marred by dead, downed or dying trees. These fuels--\ncombined with hot, tinder-dry conditions--threaten explosive wildfires \nthat could incinerate the basin. We must make their removal a top \npriority.\n  Pollution and sedimentation threaten Lake Tahoe's fabled water \nclarity. In 1968, the first year UC Davis scientists made measurements \nusing a device called a Secchi disk, clarity was measured at an average \ndepth of 102.4 feet. Clarity declined over the next three decades, \nhitting a low of 64 feet in 1997. We have seen improvements in this \ndecade. This year scientists recorded average clarity at 69.6 feet--\nroughly within the range of the past 8 years. Scientists say the rate \nof decline in Lake Tahoe's clarity has slowed. I believe we can build \non this. But the gains could easily be reversed if we are not diligent.\n  Climate change is real and adding to all these problems. It leaves \nthe basin hot and tinder-dry, and vulnerable to wildfires. The lake's \nsurface water temperature has risen 1.5 degrees in 38 years. That means \nthe cyclical deep-water mixing of the lake's waters will occur less \nfrequently, and this could significantly disrupt Lake Tahoe's \necosystem.\n  We must face facts--we could lose Lake Tahoe.\n  So it is with a real sense of urgency that today I join with Majority \nLeader Reid as he introduces sweeping legislation to attack these \nthreats. The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2009 is also cosponsored by \nSenators Ensign and Boxer. Representative Dean Heller of Nevada is \nintroducing a companion in the House of Representatives.\n  This legislation would authorize $415 million over 8 years to mount a \nrobust attack against these threats.\n  Against invasive species.\n  Against catastrophic wildfires.\n  Against the sedimentation and pollution that could forever ruin Lake \nTahoe's crystal waters.\n  With this legislation we can rise to the challenges presented by all \nthese threats, and build upon the gains set in motion by the Lake Tahoe \nRestoration Act of 2000.\n  Bottom line--this bill will help ensure the protection and \npreservation of Lake Tahoe, now and for future generations.\n  Now, to see where we are headed, it's important to review where we \nhave been. So I would like to touch on the work that's been done so far \nat Lake Tahoe, work that sets the foundation for the effort that lies \nahead.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2000 set in motion a partnership \nbetween the Federal Government, the States of California and Nevada, \nlocal governments and organizations, and the private sector.\n  All were brought together with a common purpose--to save Lake Tahoe.\n  I am proud to have been an original sponsor, along with Senators Reid \nand Boxer, and then-Senator Dick Bryan.\n  This legislation set in motion investments that have enabled us to \nget a foothold. These investments included $424 million by the Federal \nGovernment, $612 million by the State of California, $87 million by the \nState of Nevada, $59 million by local governments and $249 million by \nthe private sector.\n  It financed more than 300 projects under the Environmental \nImprovement Program, a combined Federal, State, local, and private-\nsector partnership to restore Lake Tahoe. One hundred eighty three more \nprojects are in progress.\n  We have seen improvements across the board:\n  Water Clarity: Stormwater, erosion-control, and road improvement \nprojects enabled us to begin to tackle the problem of sedimentation and \npollution, which enters the lake and degrades its fragile water \nclarity. This includes improvements to 429 miles of roadways and \nrestoring 739 acres of wetlands. As I noted a moment ago, we have seen \ngains in water clarity in this decade, and this year's average clarity \nwas 69.6 feet. Scientists report that the rate of decline has slowed. \nBut these gains could easily be reversed if we don't continue and \nbroaden our efforts to keep sediments out of the lake.\n  Catastrophic Wildfires: One-fourth of the forests of the Tahoe Basin \nare comprised of dead, downed, and dying trees. Combined with hot, \ntinder-dry conditions, they can feed massive wildfires that could \ndestroy the basin. Removal of these hazardous fuels has been a \npriority. The Fire Safe Councils and the local Fire Departments have \ndone good work. They deserve our continued support, and with this \nlegislation, they will get it. As with efforts on water clarity, \nefforts to clear the forests of hazardous fuels, and to institute \nsensible fire-safe practices must be continued. So far, hazardous fuels \nreduction treatment has occurred on 33,549 acres, including 12,256 \nacres treated since 2006. In the next 8 years, we plan on treating \n68,000 additional acres.\n  Stream Restoration and Wildlife Habitat Improvement: So far more than \n13,927 acres of wildlife habitat have been improved and 800 acres of \nStream Environment Zones restored. This includes restoration of the \nUpper Truckee Watershed to reduce the flow of sedimentation into the \nlake, and reintroduction of the Tahoe Yellow Cress, a plant that grows \nno place else on Earth.\n  Much work has been done. Much work lies ahead. It must be done, \nbecause the old threats are still there. And new ones--such as the \nquagga mussel--have arisen.\n  The bill introduced today by Senator Reid is essential to continuing \nthe good work done to date, and to meeting the threats facing the lake \ntoday.\n  It would authorize $415 million over 8 years to improve water \nclarity, reduce risk of catastrophic wildfire, and restore the \nenvironment. Specifically, it would do the following:\n  The bill provides $248 million over 8 years for the highest priority \nrestoration projects, according to scientific data. The legislation \nauthorizes at least $72 million for stormwater management and watershed \nrestoration projects scientifically determined to be the most effective \nways to improve water clarity. This bill also requires prioritized \nranking of environmental restoration projects and authorizes $136 \nmillion for state and local agencies to implement these projects. Now--\nand this is an important point--this legislation would direct \ninvestments to where it is needed most. For example, today we know the \nmajor sources of stormwater runoff that send sedimentation into the \nlake, degrading water clarity. So the monies would go to specific \nprojects addressing California State roads, source of 23 percent of \nurban particle loads; the city of Lake Tahoe, CA, 22 percent; Washoe \nCounty, Nevada, 17 percent; and so forth. In this bill, these \nstormwater projects are targeted to the areas of greatest concern. \nPriority projects will improve water quality, forest health, air \nquality and fish and wildlife habitat around Lake Tahoe. In addition, \nprojects that benefit low-income neighborhoods are encouraged.\n  The bill authorizes $136 million over 8 years to reduce the threat of \nwildfire in Lake Tahoe. This would finance hazardous fuels reduction \nprojects, at $17 million per year, including grants to local fire \nagencies. It provides the Forest Service up to $10 million for fuels \nprojects that have multiple environmental benefits, with an emphasis in \nrestoring Stream Environment Zones. This is critical because, again, \nthese streams feed into the lake, and form a critical link in the \necosystem. We need to pay attention to these stream zones if we hope to \nrestore water clarity. The bill also creates incentives for local \ncommunities to have dedicated funding for defensible space inspections \nand enforcement.\n  This bill protects Lake Tahoe from the threat of quagga mussels and \nother invasive aquatic species. Quagga mussels pose a very serious \nthreat to Lake Tahoe, a threat made more intractable because these \nmussels have been shown to survive in cold waters. And this summer UC \nscientists reported that they found up to 3,000 Asian clams per square \nmeter at spots between Zephyr Point and Elk Point in Lake Tahoe. The \nspreading Asian clam population could put sharp shells and rotting \nalgae on the lake's beaches and help spread other invasive species such \nas quagga mussels.\n\n[[Page S11059]]\n\n  The bill would authorize $20 million for watercraft inspections and \nremoval of existing invasive species. It would also prohibit watercraft \nthat have had contact with quagga or zebra mussel-infested waters from \nentering waters in the Tahoe Basin. As I noted earlier, one quagga or \nzebra mussel can lay 1 million eggs in a year. This means that a single \nboat carrying quagga could devastate the lake's biology, local \ninfrastructure, and the local economy. The damage that could be \ninflicted at Lake Tahoe by a quagga infestation has been estimated in \nthe tens of millions of dollars annually.\n  The threat to Lake Tahoe cannot be overstated. There were no quagga \nmussels in Lake Mead 3 years ago. Today there are more than 3 trillion. \nThe infestation is probably irreversible. Quagga mussels attach \nthemselves to underwater structures and clog water intake pipes, \ncanals, aqueducts and dams. They degrade water quality and can alter \nthe taste and smell of drinking water. They can devastate aquatic \necosystems by consuming large amounts of microscopic plants, leaving \nlittle or nothing for native fish and other aquatic species. They are a \nvery real threat.\n  But the fix need not be drastic. Only about 1.5 percent of boats that \nhave been inspected in Lake Tahoe would be prohibited from entering the \nlake, according to the Tahoe Regional Planning Agency. The bill would \nalso require that all watercraft be inspected and decontaminated to \nprevent the introduction of invasive aquatic species. Watercraft last \nlaunched in Lake Tahoe would be exempted. The Secretary of the Interior \ncan modify these regulations if scientific information leads to new \ntechnologies or techniques that would be no less effective than current \nmeasures. And there's good news. There's promising news on this front. \nThis week, scientists reported that under proper conditions, plastic \n``bottom barriers'' laid on top of clam beds can kill all Asian clams \nliving there within 28 days. We can fight off these invaders. But it \nwill require drive and imagination--and the help authorized within this \nbill.\n  The bill supports reintroduction of the Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The \nlegislation authorizes $20 million over 8 years for the Lahontan \nCutthroat Trout Recovery Plan. The Lahontan Cutthroat Trout is an \niconic species that has an important historic legacy in Lake Tahoe. \nWhen John C. Fremont first explored the Truckee River in January of \n1844, he called it the Salmon Trout River because he found the Pyramid \nLake Lahontan Cutthroat Trout. The trout relied on the Truckee River \nand its tributaries for their spawning runs in spring, traveling up the \nentire river's length as far as Lake Tahoe and Donner Lake, where they \nused the cool, pristine waters and clean gravel beds to lay their eggs. \nBut dams, pollution and overfishing caused the demise of the Lahontan \nCutthroat Trout. Lake Tahoe is one of the historic 11 lakes where \nLahontan Cutthroat Trout flourished in the past, and it's a critical \npart of the strategy to recover the species.\n  The bill funds scientific research. The legislation authorizes $30 \nmillion over 8 years for scientific programs and research which will \nproduce information on long-term trends in the basin and inform the \nmost cost-effective projects.\n  The bill prohibits mining operations in the Tahoe Basin. The \nlegislation would prevent the start of any mining operations in the \nbasin, ensuring that the fragile watershed, and Lake Tahoe's water \nclarity, are not threatened by pollution from mining operations.\n  The bill increases accountability and oversight. Every project funded \nby this legislation will have monitoring and assessment to determine \nthe most cost-effective projects and best management practices for \nfuture projects. The legislation also requires the Chair of the Federal \nPartnership to work with the Forest Service, Environmental Protection \nAgency, Fish and Wildlife Service and regional and state agencies, to \nprepare an annual report to Congress detailing the status of all \nprojects undertaken, including project scope, budget and justification \nand overall expenditures and accomplishments. This will ensure that \nCongress can have oversight on the progress of environmental \nrestoration in Lake Tahoe.\n  The bill provides for public outreach and education. The Forest \nService, Environmental Protection Agency, Fish and Wildlife Service, \nand Tahoe Regional Planning Agency will implement new public outreach \nand education programs including encouraging basin residents and \nvisitors to implement defensible space, conducting best management \npractices for water quality and preventing the introduction and \nproliferation of invasive species. In addition, the legislation \nrequires signage on federally financed projects to improve public \nawareness of restoration efforts.\n  The bill allows for increased efficiency in the management of public \nland. Under this legislation, the Forest Service would have increased \nflexibility to exchange land with State agencies which will allow for \nmore cost-efficient management of public land. There is currently a \ncheckerboard pattern of ownership in some areas of the basin. Under \nthis new authority, the Forest Service could exchange land with the \nCalifornia Tahoe Conservancy of approximately equal value without going \nthrough a lengthy process to assess the land. For example, if there are \nseveral plots of Forest Service land that surround or are adjacent to \nTahoe Conservancy land, the Tahoe Conservancy could transfer that land \nto the Forest Service so that it can be managed more efficiently.\n  Finally, it is important to note that this bill would increase \naccountability and oversight. All projects funded by this legislation \nwould be monitored and assessed to ensure cost-effectiveness. The bill \nwould also require annual reports to Congress detailing the status of \nall projects--including expenditures and accomplishments. Scientific \ndata will be used to inform every aspect of this legislation. It will \nhelp us refine and adjust our restoration programs and ensure that we \nfund only the highest priority projects.\n  Let there be no doubt: Lake Tahoe is in grave danger. Grave danger \nfrom catastrophic wildfires. Grave danger from invasive species. Grave \ndanger from sedimentation and pollution that threaten to dull her \ncrystal waters.\n  Mark Twain called Lake Tahoe ``the fairest picture the whole world \naffords.'' Mr. President, we must not be the generation that lets this \npicture fall into ruin. We must rise to the challenge, and do all we \ncan to preserve the ``Jewel of the Sierra.'' This legislation will do \nexactly that.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to talk about a bill that has been \nintroduced today by myself, along with Senators Reid, Feinstein, and \nBoxer, that will be the next chapter in our continuing support of one \nof the most pristine and magnificent areas in the United States.\n  Since it was formed 2 million years ago, the breathtaking beauty of \nLake Tahoe has awed all who have visited its crystal-clear waters and \ninspiring views. Mark Twain once said about the landmark, ``I thought \nit must surely be the fairest picture the whole world affords.'' From \nthe Washoe tribe that originally inhabited its shores to John C. \nFremont who first saw Lake Tahoe 165 years ago, this alpine lake is a \npart of our history and a part of our future.\n  Next year, the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act, originally enacted in \n2000, will expire. Over the course of a decade, $300,000,000 was \ninvested in environmental projects for water clarity, erosion control, \nand fire suppression. I am proud to have led the effort to amend the \nSouthern Nevada Public Land Management Act in 2003 in order to \nguarantee funding for the Lake Tahoe Restoration Act from land auctions \nacross southern Nevada. Great work has gone into protecting this \nnational legacy, but we are not done.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act of 2009 is our continued commitment to \nprotecting this Nevada treasure for future generations. This effort, a \ncollaboration among Senators Feinstein, Reid, Boxer, and me, authorizes \n$415 million for 8 years and provides for fuels reduction, \nEnvironmental Improvement Program projects, storm water management, and \nwatershed restoration. It devotes significant funding--for the first \ntime ever--to prevent the introduction of quagga and zebra mussels into \nthe lake, one of the greatest threats facing Tahoe today. There is also \nfunding for Lahontan Cutthroat Trout recovery and public outreach and \neducation.\n\n[[Page S11060]]\n\n  Unfortunately, there are many threats facing Lake Tahoe. This \nlegislation addresses each of those threats in a manner that is \nfiscally responsible with the most effective and efficient use of \nFederal funds. Hazardous fuels reduction is one of the most important \ninvestments we can make. If you have ever been to Lake Tahoe, you know \nthat one catastrophic fire could wipe out the entire basin. Just 2 \nyears ago, we watched in horror as the Angora fire spread and consumed \nland, trees, homes, and businesses. It spewed sediment and ash into the \nlake and turned our worst fears into reality. That is why we must be \naggressive with our fuels reduction efforts. This bill also provides \ngrants to Fire Protection Districts in the Lake Tahoe Basin to work in \npartnership with homeowners on defensible space.\n  The Lake Tahoe Restoration Act is not just a Federal effort. Nevada, \nCalifornia, and private entities are also partners in the Environmental \nImprovement Program. In Nevada, where the legislature recently \ncommitted 100 million to the Environmental Improvement Program, Lake \nTahoe is beloved and treasured. I had the privilege of spending several \nyears of my childhood at the lake. My wife Darlene and I have made it a \npoint to instill the same love for Lake Tahoe in our children. We spend \nour family's summer vacations there--biking, boating, waterskiing, and \nrock climbing. To this day, my favorite spot is the Tahoe Rim Trail \nlooking down on Sandy Harbor, where you can see deep into the lake. You \ncan see huge boulders. The clarity is so amazing, it is literally one \nof the most spectacular views in all the world. There really is no \nplace in the world like Lake Tahoe.\n  Let us make sure this inheritance is cared for and passed on to \nfuture generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Leahy, and Mr. \n        Graham):\n  S. 2725. A bill to provide for fairness for the Federal judiciary; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Federal \nJudicial Fairness Act of 2009.\n  I want to thank my cosponsors--Senator Hatch, Senator Leahy, and \nSenator Graham--for working with me on this important legislation.\n  The salaries of our Federal judges are eroding in their real buying \npower over time. This bill would solve that problem.\n  Over the past 30 years, pay for Federal judges has declined \ndramatically. Since 1969, the inflation-adjusted salaries of Federal \njudges have dropped by 24 percent, even as other Federal workers have \nreceived an average salary increase of 18 percent.\n  The way the pay system works now, Federal judges are at a stark \ndisadvantage each year for receiving a cost-of-living adjustment to \nkeep their salaries in pace with inflation. While most Federal civilian \nemployees receive an automatic cost-of-living adjustment, Federal \njudges do not. Instead, they currently receive an adjustment only if \nCongress passes a special law and also provides an adjustment for \nitself.\n  Judicial salaries should not be ensnared in Congressional-pay \npolitics. Judges should simply be on the same system that other Federal \nemployees are.\n  That is what this bill would do.\n  It would repeal ``Section 140,'' which currently requires Congress to \npass a special law each year in order for judges to receive a cost-of-\nliving adjustment; and it would provide judges with an automatic, \nannual cost-of-living adjustment under the same General Schedule used \nfor other Federal civilian employees.\n  In other words, the bill would simply put Federal judges on an even \nplaying field.\n  Why is this important?\n  The drop in real pay for Federal judges has created what Chief \nJustice John Roberts has called ``a Constitutional crisis.'' More and \nmore judges are being forced to leave the bench for financial reasons \nduring what should be the peak years of their judicial careers.\n  Recently, the Federal court for the Central District of California \nlost a U.S. District Judge, Stephen Larson, after only 4 years of \nservice. Larson had been a public servant for over a decade and said \nthat because of his large family, he was finally faced with an \nimpossible choice: He could either continue serving the public as a \njudge, or he could retire from the bench in order to be able to afford \na college education for his children.\n  Judge Larson's story is not an anomaly. The Federal bench has lost \n103 judges since 1990, 80 percent of whom ended up taking other, \nusually higher-paying, positions in the private sector.\n  The problem is especially acute in high-cost states like California. \nIn California, State court judges have higher salaries than Federal \nArticle III judges.\n  The rate at which our Federal courts are losing judges has increased \nby 24 percent since the 1990s, even as caseloads have gone up and the \nreplacement process has slowed down.\n  Departures like Judge Larson's are only half the problem. As former \nFederal judge and former Representative Abner Mikva has pointed out, a \nprimary effect of the erosion of judicial salaries is to discourage our \nNation's most talented lawyers from joining the bench in the first \nplace.\n  In 1969, the salary of a Federal district court judge was about 20 \npercent higher than the salary of a top law school dean and about 30 \npercent higher than that of a senior law professor at a top law school. \nToday, judges make only two-thirds the salary of similarly credentialed \nlaw professors, and half the pay of deans.\n  In many cases, judges make less than first-year associates fresh out \nof law school.\n  The bill that I am introducing today does not say that Federal judges \nshould make as much as law firm partners or law school deans. It simply \nsays that Federal judges should not be at a disadvantage vis-a-vis \nother Federal employees in getting a cost-of-living adjustment each \nyear. It simply ensures that the salary Congress intended judges to \nreceive will keep pace with inflation.\n  Congress has already delayed action on this issue for too long. Our \nNation now risks losing both our most experienced judges and the next \ngeneration of talented jurists.\n  As early as 2003, the nonpartisan National Commission on the Public \nService, also known as the Volcker Commission, concluded that ``the lag \nin judicial salaries has gone on too long, and the potential for the \ndiminished quality in American jurisprudence is now too large.''\n  I believe that the legislation that I am introducing today with \nSenators Hatch, Leahy, and Graham is a straightforward solution. It is \nnot a raise. It is simply an assurance that judges will not have to \njump through special hoops or rely on the politics of Congressional pay \nin order to get the cost-of-living adjustment received by other Federal \nemployees.\n  I do not believe that judges should expect to make the kind of \nsalaries available to partners at private law firms. The rewards of \npublic service are of a different kind. But we must ensure that \njudicial service remains a viable option for the most talented members \nof the bar.\n  Basic fairness requires that judges' salaries not diminish over time. \nIt is time to provide these critical public servants with a fair pay \nsystem that will guarantee the future health of the judiciary.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
