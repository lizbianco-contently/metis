Mr. President, it is not every day we get to read good news \nin the newspaper, and it is certainly not common of late to read good \nnews about newspapers. Today is one of those rare days. A newspaper in \nthe State of Nevada--the Las Vegas Sun--has won the Pulitzer Prize \nbecause of a courageous young journalist named Alexandra Berzon. I \nspoke to her yesterday. This was basically this young woman's first \nreporting job. She is so excited, as she should be.\n  I am very happy and proud the Pulitzer is coming to Nevada. This is \nonly the second time in Nevada's history it has received this most \nprestigious award in journalism and the first time in more than three \ndecades. But I am especially proud because the Sun has been recognized \nfor public service reporting that uncovered lax safety standards and \nled to actual policy changes that are saving lives.\n  The famous Las Vegas strip recently saw a $32 billion building boom. \nBut something else was going up along with the hotels and casinos--the \nunnecessary deaths of construction workers. Twelve workers died in a \nlittle over 17\n\n[[Page S4470]]\n\nmonths. Berzon's careful reporting led to important safety \nimprovements, and not one worker has died since these changes took \neffect. I applaud Alexandra Berzon, her editors, and everyone at the \nLas Vegas Sun, which has a storied history of solid investigative \njournalism.\n  This newspaper started on a string many years ago--in the 1950s--by a \nman by the name of Hank Greenspun. He was a crusading newspaperman. He \nwas the first person in the entire country to take on Senator McCarthy \nand the awful things he was doing to America and about America. He took \nhim on personally on one of McCarthy's visits to Las Vegas.\n  He also did something else which was very courageous. Nevada had a \nvery powerful Senator. His name was Pat McCarran. He was noted for his \nuse of power, and Hank Greenspun, of the Las Vegas Sun newspaper, took \nafter him big time. McCarran asked all the strip hotels to no longer \nadvertise in that newspaper, and they followed the demand of Senator \nMcCarran. A lawsuit was filed. We only had one Federal judge, and that \none Federal judge--even though he had been appointed by McCarran in an \nantitrust action, which is not a jury trial--ruled in favor of the Sun. \nHe won that lawsuit.\n  He took on McCarthy, he took on McCarran, and that was only the \nbeginning of this great newspaper and the things it has done, and now \nthey have won a Pulitzer. Hank Greenspun must be smiling from heaven.\n  Someone who is a modern-day icon of this newspaper was a man who \ntaught me in high school. Fortuitously, he and I, unexpectedly, were \nelected, independently, Governor and Lieutenant Governor at the same \ntime. He served 8 years. His name was Mike O'Callaghan, Governor of the \nState, and a very popular person. He could have gone on to make huge \namounts of money in other places. He decided not to do that. I was a \nlawyer. I drew up this big contract where he would go to work for Hank \nGreenspun running his newspapers. I met with him, handed him the \ncontract, and he said: We don't sign contracts; we shake hands. So they \nshook hands, and that was the beginning of a relationship that is \nhistoric in Nevada. My dear friend Mike O'Callaghan died in church; he \nwent to mass every morning, and died as a young man in church, where I \nam sure his good thoughts are still coming forward.\n  With Hank and Mike, I am sure, as I have indicated about Hank, they \nare looking down from this place we call heaven at this wonderful time \nfor this newspaper.\n  The kind of reporting Alexandra Berzon did is a model for reporters \neverywhere to follow. Of the 21 Pulitzer Prizes, only one--the Public \nService Award--the one that the Las Vegas Sun was awarded--doesn't come \nwith a cash prize. All the others come with a $10,000 cash prize but \nnot this one. It comes with a medal. But this medal is going to mean \nmuch more to Alexandra than any dollar amount would. It is a reminder \nthat journalism, in its most fundamental role--as a disinterested \nwatchdog for our communities and our citizens, our country--benefits \nall of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4470-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4470]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, I pointed out that the \nPresident's war funding request contains up to $80 million to close the \nU.S. detention facility in Guantanamo Bay. The administration says \nGuantanamo will be closed by next January. What they haven't told us is \nwhat they plan to do with these killers once it closes. Well, Americans \nwant some assurances that closing Guantanamo will not make them less \nsafe. Frankly, that is a very important and understandable request.\n  Guantanamo currently houses some of the most dangerous men alive. \nThese are men who are proud of the innocent lives they have taken and \nwho want to return to terrorism. One person who is there, and whom we \ndon't know what we will do with, is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the \nmastermind of the 9/11 attacks. We captured him while he was planning \nfollowup attacks to 9/11, including plots to destroy a West Coast \nskyscraper and to smuggle explosives into New York. If we hadn't \ncaptured him, he may have succeeded in launching the same type of \nattack on the west coast that he carried out on the east coast. This is \na man who brags about decapitating the American journalist Daniel \nPearl, with the following quote: ``. . . with my blessed right hand.'' \nHow does transferring Khalid Shaikh Mohammed make the country safer?\n  Another person at Guantanamo that the administration doesn't know \nwhat it will do with in 9 months is Ali Abd al-Aziz Ali, who served as \na key lieutenant for Khalid Shaikh Mohammed during the 9/11 operation. \nHow does transferring him make the country safer?\n  Then there is Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri. He was al-Qaida's operations \nchief in the Arabian Peninsula and the mastermind behind the attack on \nthe USS Cole which killed 17 sailors in 2000. How does transferring or \nreleasing him make our country safer?\n  These are just 3 of the 240 terrorists that the administration \ndoesn't know what to do with. The one thing they do know is that they \nclaim they are going to close Guantanamo in 9 months, even though they \ncan't say yet whether the alternative is as safe and secure. All of \nthis, despite the fact that after visiting Guantanamo for the first \ntime recently, Attorney General Holder said he was ``impressed by the \npeople who are presently running the camp'' and that ``the facilities \nthere are good ones.''\n  That was certainly my impression when I went there a few years ago.\n  The administration needs to tell the American people what it plans to \ndo with these men if it closes Guantanamo. Two years ago, the Senate \nvoted 94 to 3--94 to 3--against sending these men to the United States. \nForeign countries have so far been unwilling to take any of them in \nsignificant numbers--understandably. Even if countries were willing to \ntake them, there is an increasing probability that some of these \nmurderers would return to the battlefield. The Defense Department \nrecently confirmed that 18 former detainees had returned to the \nbattlefield and said that at least 40 more are suspected of having done \nso. These are people we have already released who are back on the \nbattlefield.\n  Earlier this year, the Saudi Government said that nearly a dozen \nSaudis who were released from Gitmo are believed to have returned to \nterrorism.\n  The administration has made a priority of closing Guantanamo, but its \nfirst priority should be to assure the American people that the \ndetainees at Gitmo will never again be able to harm Americans.\n\n\n                          Entitlement Spending\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to say another word in addition to my comments \nyesterday about the President's welcome gesture on wasteful spending. \nThe Cabinet has been asked to find $100 million in savings over the \nnext few months and this is clearly a step in the right direction, but \nit is just a step. Current levels of Government spending and debt are \ncompletely and totally out of control and the threat of a fiscal \ncatastrophe is very real. The only way to address this out-of-control \nspending is to get at the heart of the problem, which is entitlement \nspending. A lot of people do not realize that nearly 70 percent of the \nmoney the Federal Government spends every year is mandatory spending on \nvery popular programs such as Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security, and \non the interest we have to pay on the national debt.\n  Entitlements are the heart of the problem. As Willie Sutton put it: \nThat's where the money is. And if we don't find a way to address this \nspending, we will be in very serious trouble as a nation. Fortunately, \nSenators Gregg and Conrad have a proposal on the table that addresses \nentitlement spending head on, by forcing Democrats and Republicans to \ncome together and make the kind of tough choices necessary to steer the \ncountry out of an otherwise inevitable financial shipwreck. It deserves \nmuch more attention than it has received, and it deserves a vote here \nin the Senate.\n  Cutting $100 million in waste is certainly good, but let's put it in \ncontext. The amount of money the President asked the Cabinet to save \nyesterday,\n\n[[Page S4471]]\n\n$100 million, is about how much we will spend every single day on \ninterest on the stimulus bill we passed a while back. Mr. President, \n$100 million in savings is certainly good. It amounts to about 33 cents \nfor every single American. Compare that to entitlement spending where, \nin order to meet all our current and future entitlement promises, we \nwould have to extract $495,000 from every American household--$495,000 \nfrom every American household. The way I see it, there is simply no \nquestion as to where the priority should be.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4471-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4471]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

HILL TO BE AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ--Resumed\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate will proceed to \nexecutive session to consider the following nomination which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Nomination of Christopher R. Hill, of Rhode Island, a \n     Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career \n     Minister, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary \n     of the United States of America to the Republic of Iraq.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I know we are here to discuss the \nnomination of Christopher Hill to be our Ambassador to Iraq. I want to \ntalk about that for a few minutes.\n  But I have to say, as I was sitting there listening to the \ndistinguished minority leader complaining about the interest we are \npaying on the debt, I almost choked on the absurdity and irony of the \nsituation in which we find ourselves. The reason we have to have an \nenormous stimulus plan is because of the mismanagement of our entire \neconomy and Government over the course of the last 8 years. Not once--\nthe Senator from Rhode Island will know this--not once did the \nPresident of the United States George Bush veto a spending bill--not \nonce. It was under the leadership of the Republicans as the chairs of \nall the essential spending committees of the Congress. They had the \nHouse, they had the Senate, they had the White House. During that \nperiod of time, they took a $5.6 trillion surplus and turned it into a \n$10 trillion debt and about a $5.6 trillion deficit--the most \nirresponsible period of fiscal management in the history of this \ncountry. Not to mention what they did with respect to the management of \nthe regulatory process of our country, where, as we know, deals were \nallowed to be made on Wall Street that had no business being made. \nRegulators were taken out of the industry itself and it was like \nputting the fox in charge of the chicken coop in the most overt sense \npossible, so regulation went out the window.\n  We are paying the price for that today. The American taxpayer is \npaying the price. The average homeowner is paying the price. Retirees \nare paying the price. Workers--unprecedented numbers of people laid off \nbecause of the hollow, empty Ponzi scheme investments and commission \nschemes that were engaged in on Wall Street and elsewhere. It is \nstaggering.\n  To listen to them come to the floor with no alternative plan--they \ndon't offer any alternative as to how you put America back to work. \nThey just say: No, don't spend this money. Oh, my God, we are building \nup a terrible deficit--despite the fact that for 8 years they were \nsilent about the deficit. There is something in public where you earn \nthe right, sort of a moral level of rectitude or of justification for \nsaying the things you say. I have to tell you, it is hard to listen to \nsome of these folks, who were so much a part of that, without even \naccepting responsibility for it. They don't come down and say, you \nknow, we made a blooper of a mistake or, boy, did I misjudge this or \nthat or whatever. It is a wholesale flip-flop transition that is \nabsolutely staggering in its proportions. Judging by the polling \nnumbers on the President reflecting the decisions he is making, tough \ndecisions about how to get the country moving again, I think the \nAmerican people get it. I hope we are going to spend our time more \nprofitably around here than playing the traditional political game of \ndelay and obfuscation and those tactics.\n  The reason I mention that is the reason we are on the floor today \ndebating the nomination of Christopher Hill is more of the same. It is \nexactly part of the same process of politics as usual in Washington, \nDC. There is no reason that for the last 2 weeks, while the Congress of \nthe United States was on its Easter break--many Members back home or \ntraveling the world, dealing with a lot of issues--there is no reason \nwe did not have an ambassador in Iraq, which is what General Odierno \nwants, what General Petraeus wants, what the President wants, what the \nAmerican troops need and deserve.\n  Time and again, Senators have come to the floor and said there is no \nmilitary solution in Iraq. The reason we are drawing down our numbers \nof troops there now is to transfer authority to the Iraqis themselves \nso our troops can come home and so they can assume responsibility for \ntheir country. As all of us know, that cannot happen completely and \nproperly until and unless the political issues of Iraq are resolved. As \nthe Washington Post noted, we have not had an ambassador in Iraq since \nlast February. So we have gone all this time with the principal issue \nwhich needs to be resolved, which is political, without the principal \nplayer, who is the Ambassador.\n  It is stunning to me that a few Senators have decided not just to \nregister their opposition--which they can do. They have a right to do \nthat, come to the floor, speak against the nomination and let's have a \nvote. He is going to be overwhelmingly supported to be the next \nambassador to Iraq. But we will have delayed and diddled and who knows \nwhat opportunity may have been delayed or lost as a consequence of our \nnot having the principal political player on the ground in Iraq in \norder to help negotiate.\n\n  The fact is, Chris Hill, when you look at the record, even some of \nthe arguments that are being made about him by the few who oppose him \ndo not stand up. They do not stand up to scrutiny. In over three \ndecades of service at the State Department, as ambassador to \ncomplicated, difficult parts of the world--Ambassador to Macedonia and \nPoland, to South Korea--Chris Hill has proven himself to be one of \nAmerica's most talented diplomats. Today we are asking him to take on \none of the most challenging diplomatic posts, one that if you look at \nhis record through the years he has been preparing for in different \nways in each of these different posts.\n  Senator Lugar yesterday joined in the effort to get this vote and to \napprove this nomination. I appreciate enormously the partnership \nSenator Lugar has provided for years on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, as a partner to now-Vice President Biden, and now working \nwith me and with the rest of the committee. Senator Lugar believes in \ncalling things the way he sees them and in making judgments based on \nthe facts--above all, in trying to have a foreign policy presence for \nthe United States that is bipartisan, where the politics end at the \nwater's edge. The fact is, Ambassador Hill's decades of diplomatic \nexperience, as Senator Lugar has pointed out, give him the skills that \nmatter the most in Iraq--the ability to achieve our objectives in a \ncomplex, challenging, sectarian, volatile, complicated environment.\n  This is exactly the experience Chris Hill brings to this effort. He \nwas one of the principal players in helping to resolve the civil wars \nin the Balkans. Many of us remember how difficult and, frankly, \ngridlocked that particular situation looked. He has worked on \nmultiparty international negotiations. He has dealt with hostile \nregimes in the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program. \nSeveral times he has conducted his diplomatic efforts alongside a \nsizable military presence.\n  His next assignment will require him to bring every single one of \nthese experiences to the table. He will have to do it working against \nthe clock as we finally bring our troops home from Iraq.\n\n[[Page S4472]]\n\nWe have set a timetable. It is a timetable that the military and \nDefense Department have agreed with, and it is one that many people \nbelieve will require the Iraqis to stand up for themselves in ways that \nthey had been unwilling to do previously. But the fact is that to \nproperly effect the transition that is going to be needed to bring \nthose troops home, it is going to require more diplomacy, smarter \ndiplomacy, and more urgent diplomacy. Now more than ever we need to \nenlist Iraq's neighbors in working constructively to stabilize Iraq, \nand that includes Iran and Syria.\n  Iraq today still presents extraordinary challenges. Nobody should \nbelieve that because we have announced the troops are going to start to \ncome home that Iraq is a done deal. It is not a done deal. It is still \ntricky, it is volatile, explosive. There are very complicated issues \nsuch as the oil revenues, the Federal Constitution, the resolution of \nthe city of Kirkuk and the Kurds' interests. All are these are \npolitical solutions that need to be arrived at. I believe Chris Hill \nbrings the skills necessary to help us to be able to do that.\n  A few weeks ago, the Foreign Relations Committee strongly endorsed \nChris Hill's nomination. As I said a few moments ago, I absolutely \nrespect the right of any Senator to object to a nominee and to want to \nmake their points about that nominee. But when you know you do not have \nthe votes to legitimately block a nomination, to delay that nomination \nfor critical weeks I think borders on the irresponsible. It makes this \ninstitution look a little silly in some ways. The fact is, if you look \nat the issues that have been raised, those issues have been \nconsistently and accurately answered on the record. Let me go through a \ncouple of them.\n  Concerns have been raised about Ambassador Hill's record dealing with \nNorth Korea. Let me address that directly. First, some have attacked \nChris Hill for not pressing hard enough against North Korea's atrocious \nhuman rights record. My friend Senator Brownback in particular has been \noutspoken in this regard, arguing that Ambassador Hill reneged on a \npromise made at a July 31, 2008 Senate Armed Services Committee \nhearing.\n  Well, Ambassador Hill has spoken directly to that before our \ncommittee in answer to a question he was asked by Senator Lugar. \nYesterday, I asked that portions of Ambassador Hill's Senate testimony \nbe submitted for the Record so Senators could read that today in the \nCongressional Record and make their own judgment.\n  But Ambassador Hill did the following in answer to a question from \nSenator Brownback: He did consent to invite the Special Envoy for North \nKorean human rights, a fellow by the name of Jay Lefkowitz, to future \nnegotiations, except those that were specifically dealing with nuclear \ndisarmament. That is appropriate. Those are two totally different \nportfolios. Mr. Lefkowitz was responsible for human rights, but what \nwas being negotiated was the nuclear component, as Ambassador Hill \nexplained at his nomination hearing. The problem is that the talks with \nNorth Korea never got beyond the issue of nuclear disarmament. It never \ngot to the broader, more general issues that were before them.\n  Furthermore, the call on whether to include the Assistant Secretary \nfor Human Rights in the six-party talks was made above Chris Hill's pay \ngrade. That was not a Chris Hill decision, that was a decision for the \nPresident of the United States and the Secretary of State.\n  Let me tell you precisely what Secretary of State Condi Rice said \nabout Mr. Lefkowitz and his efforts. Publicly in the New York Times, \nshe is quoted rebuking the Human Rights Assistant Secretary in a public \nway. It is rather extraordinary that that would happen. But here is \nwhat she said:\n\n       He is the human rights envoy. That is what he knows. That \n     is what he does. He doesn't work on the Six-Party talks. He \n     does not know what is going on in the Six-Party talks. And he \n     certainly has no say what American policy will be in the Six-\n     Party talks.\n\n  That is not a Democrat talking; that is his boss, the Secretary of \nState, Condi Rice, talking about his interference in the process. And \nChris Hill was taking daily instructions, as he ought to be as a \ndiplomat, from Secretary of State Condi Rice and from the President of \nthe United States.\n  So, you know, this is ridiculous that we are here tying up a \nnomination over something Chris Hill had absolutely no power to \nfundamentally change. It was not his right to make that decision. He \ndid not make that decision. He followed his instructions. If Senator \nBrownback has a complaint, his complaint is with Secretary of State \nCondi Rice and President George Bush.\n  Lost in this is also the fact that Chris Hill was extraordinarily \noutspoken in his criticism of human rights in North Korea. He was \nplainspoken with respect to that, and he was diligent in his effort to \nimprove human rights in North Korea. Listening to some of his critics, \nyou might get the impression that Chris Hill was somehow indifferent to \nthe suffering of the North Korean people. Nothing could, in fact, be \nfurther from the truth.\n  First, he expressed, on a number of occasions, using the plainest \nlanguage, that North Korea's human rights record was ``abysmal,'' \nmaking clear in public and private that North Korea cannot fully join \nthe international community short of significant improvement on this \nissue.\n  Yesterday, my colleague from Kansas showed pictures comparing North \nKorean gulags to Nazi concentration camps. He warned that he must not \nbe silent about North Korea's conduct. He is right. We must not be \nsilent. Most importantly, Chris Hill agrees with him, and Chris Hill \nwas not silent. He made it plain in open testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee in July of 2008. Let me quote from that \ntestimony because it speaks eloquently to Ambassador Hill's character \nand to his concern for the innocent victims of North Korea's repressive \nsystem. Here is what Chris Hill said in 2008, well before being \nnominated for this job, before the Armed Services Committee of the \nSenate:\n\n       The DPRK's human rights record is, quite frankly, abysmal. \n     And every day that the people of North Korea continue to \n     suffer represents an unacceptable continuation of oppression. \n     I have seen--I've personally seen satellite images of the \n     DPRK's extensive prison camp system. This is truly a scar on \n     the Korean Peninsula . . .\n\n  So he refers specifically to the photos Senator Brownback showed \nyesterday.\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       It is reported that North Koreans suffer torture, forced \n     abortion, and in some cases, execution. The dangers faced by \n     North Korean refugees who flee their country in search of a \n     better life, often only to face suffering or eventual \n     repatriation with a very uncertain fate, are certainly, or \n     are similarly, unacceptable. The United States' dedication to \n     improving the lives of North Korean people will never wane, \n     and we will continue to seek all available opportunities to \n     improve this heartbreaking situation.\n       We have repeatedly made clear to the DPRK that human rights \n     is not only a U.S. priority--frankly, it's an international \n     priority. It is a part of the standard of joining the \n     international community. We've emphasized how much we value \n     the advancement of human rights in all societies and our need \n     to have this and other outstanding issues of concern \n     discussed in the normalization process.\n\n  So Chris Hill could not have been more clear, time and again, in his \nnegotiations, in his public comments, in his testimony to the Senate, \nabout the human rights situation.\n  Second, Chris Hill worked closely with his colleagues to implement \nthe North Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, sponsored by our friend, the \nSenator from Kansas. Consistent with that act, Ambassador Hill secured \nthe admission of the first North Korean refugees into the United States \nin 2006. He helped ensure the safe passage of asylum seekers from the \nnorth who were detained in other countries. He backed increased funding \nof radio broadcasting activities and support for defector organizations \nin South Korea, regularly meeting with North Koreans who made it out \nalive.\n  Finally, it was the team of Ambassador Hill and USAID official John \nBrause that secured unprecedented access for reputable U.S. \nnongovernmental organizations to deliver carefully monitored food aid \nto North Korean children. In my opinion, there can be no higher \naccomplishment in the field of human rights than to prevent the \nstarvation of children. It was not easy for Hill and Brause to convince \nNorth Korea to permit Mercy Corps, World Vision, Samaritan's Purse, \nGlobal Resources Service, and Christian\n\n[[Page S4473]]\n\nFriends of Korea to send Korean-speaking foreign staff to the \ncountryside of North Korea in order to monitor food aid deliveries. But \nthey did that. They accomplished that.\n  The fact that several of these NGOs are Christian charitable \norganizations makes this accomplishment even more remarkable given \nNorth Korea's poor record on religious freedom issues.\n  So Chris Hill's record on North Korean human rights is, frankly, \nunassailable, it is admirable, and we do him a disservice if that is \nnot acknowledged here in the Senate.\n  What is more, Chris Hill achieved these gains inside the limitations \nof a policy that was shaped from above by his superiors in the White \nHouse, one that properly focused on denuclearization first, while also \ntrying to address a wide range of other concerns, including human \nrights, missile proliferation, counterfeiting, drug smuggling, and \nother illicit activities. From the early days of the Bush \nadministration, the focus was always clearly on security issues. In \nannouncing the results of the Bush administration's North Korea policy \nreview on June 6, 2001, the President instructed his security team to \nfocus on North Korea's nuclear activities, its missile programs, and \nits conventional military posture. There was no explicit mention of \nhuman rights in President Bush's policy at that point in time, although \nthere was a pledge to help the North Korean people, ease sanctions, and \nencourage progress toward north-south reconciliation. But the focus of \nthe administration at that point was national security. As Secretary \nRice testified to in the Foreign Relations Committee back in January of \n2005:\n\n       Our goal now has to be to make the Six-Party mechanism work \n     for dealing with the North Korean nuclear program and then \n     hopefully for dealing with the greater problem of managing \n     this dangerous regime.\n\n  This was 6 weeks before Chris Hill was named envoy to the six-party \ntalks, and it was 3 months before he was even named Assistant Secretary \nof State. So what are we doing debating the question of Chris Hill and \nthis policy, when the policy was put in place by the President well \nbefore he even became Assistant Secretary of State? He followed the \npolicy directives.\n  My friend Senator Brownback said yesterday that our North Korean \npolicy was a Chris Hill policy. That is not the case, and the record \nproves that is not the case. The decision to focus on the complete \nverifiable and irreversible elimination of North Korea's nuclear \nprogram was American policy, it was U.S. policy well before Chris Hill \narrived, and it remains America's policy today.\n  Those who criticize Chris Hill for not accomplishing more in the area \nof human rights should also appreciate that he was, in many cases, \nhamstrung. I think he would have liked to have gone further in some \nregards, but his limitations were to the six-party talks, when many of \nus were pressing for bilateral talks, I might add. I remember in the \n2004 campaign, in the debates with President Bush, I advocated moving \ntoward biliteral as the way to get things done. And the President said \nno. He stood by the concept of six-party talks. For several years, we \nwent on with that. But ultimately it was through the administration's \neventual transition to a bilateral set of meetings that we actually \nmade progress and accomplished what was accomplished in that \nrelationship, tenuous as it was.\n  So Chris Hill was implementing the policy of President Bush, \nSecretary Rice, National Security Adviser Hadley, Vice President Dick \nCheney, and those who had the final say on North Korean policy. That \nfinal say did not then rest with a professional foreign career officer \nwho was implementing the policy of his superiors.\n  I am also troubled that some of the criticisms of America's policy \ntoward North Korea seem to carry with them the implication that Chris \nHill does not care on a personal level about human rights. Well, this \nruns counter to a lifetime of concern and achievement everywhere he has \nserved.\n  In Kosovo, Ambassador Hill advocated NATO intervention to prevent \nethnic cleansing. When more than a quarter million refugees from Kosovo \nflooded Macedonia in 1999, it was Ambassador Hill who worked tirelessly \nto keep the border open and set up dozens of refugee camps across \nMacedonia, protecting every last refugee and pressuring Macedonia's \nleadership to keep taking refugees even as they complained that their \ncountry could hold no more, even as the number of refugees rose to 10 \npercent of Macedonia's population, with a wave of Muslim refugees \nentering a delicately balanced majority-Christian, multireligious \nsociety. That is what Chris Hill accomplished. He managed to protect \nthe rights of those people, and he did so under enormously difficult \ncircumstances. He ought to get credit for that. The folks who are \nsounding the drumbeat of human rights ought to be giving him credit for \nthe record of what he accomplished in those difficult circumstances.\n  Another particular story shows Chris Hill's commitment to human \nrights. In the middle of the night, a crowd had gathered in a refugee \ncamp and was preparing to harm two Roma families in that camp. Chris \nHill personally risked his own safety to stand in front of that crowd \nand allow the families who were being targeted to evacuate while he \nstood there. Those present said it was an impressive display of moral \nand physical courage.\n  So while we may disagree with the American policy, let's not allow \nthose disagreements to degenerate into personal accusations against a \nman who has given his entire life to serving America's interests and \nideals and has a decades-long record on human rights to prove it.\n  Simply put, Chris Hill is one of the best diplomats we have. That is \nwhy Senator Lugar expressed his support and spoke of his outstanding \ndiplomatic and managerial skills. Vice President Biden has referred to \nAmbassador Hill as ``one of the gems we have in the Foreign Service.''\n  For years, many in this body have argued that we ought to follow the \nadvice of our commanders on the ground in Iraq. How many times have we \nhad a debate in which people have said: Listen to the generals. Listen \nto the commanders in Iraq. Well, here is what they are saying:\n  GEN Ray Odierno, the top military commander in Iraq, said:\n\n       Hopefully we will have an ambassador out here very soon. It \n     would certainly help to have an ambassador here as quickly as \n     possible.\n\n  The Pentagon's top spokesman went even further. He said:\n\n       It is vital that we get an ambassador in Baghdad as soon as \n     possible because there is no substitute for having the \n     President's envoy, the U.S. Ambassador, in place and on the \n     job.\n\n  Our Ambassadors have also been unanimous in their support. Ryan \nCrocker, Zalmay Khalilzad, John Negroponte, the three wartime American \nAmbassadors to Iraq, wrote a letter together urging a quick \nconfirmation for Chris Hill. They wrote Hill ``brings over three \ndecades of experience to this task, especially in the areas of national \nsecurity, peace-building, and post-conflict reconstruction. We need his \nexperience during this critical time in Iraq. . . . The issues are \npressing and the President must have his personal representative on the \nscene now. We encourage the Senate to act promptly to provide its \nadvice and consent.''\n  One of the principal reasons GEN David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan \nCrocker were able to accomplish so much is because they worked together \nso closely. I know General Petraeus's successor, General Odierno, is \nlooking forward to building a similar relationship with Ambassador \nHill, which explains why he is outspoken in the need to send Chris Hill \nto Baghdad in a timely manner.\n  So this is not a time for delay. Chris Hill has promised to leave for \nIraq within 24 hours of being confirmed, if possible. I believe we \nshould have Chris Hill on a plane tomorrow to Iraq. And I hope my \ncolleagues--I see none of them in the Chamber who oppose this \nnomination. We are going to try to move to a vote, let me say to my \ncolleagues. If there are people who oppose this nomination, they ought \nto be here to do so because we are going to try to move to a vote in \nthe early afternoon and not delay this nomination any further.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to join the distinguished\n\n[[Page S4474]]\n\nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in support of Ambassador \nChristopher Hill as our next United States Ambassador to Iraq.\n  In helping to negotiate an end to the crisis in the Balkans, in \nleading three Embassies, and in working to disarm North Korea's nuclear \nweapons program, Ambassador Hill has gleaned invaluable experience and \ngiven invaluable service in over 31 years of diplomatic service to this \ncountry.\n  Ambassador Hill is a fellow son of the Foreign Service. My father and \ngrandfather were Foreign Service officers, and I have some experience \nof the sense of calling and dedication that background provides. He is \ndecent, honorable, and snarled right now in Senate politics in a way, \nfrankly, that is less of a reflection on him than it is a reflection on \nus.\n  He is also a fellow Rhode Islander, with a family home in Little \nCompton, RI. His family moved there when he was in the fifth grade, \nwhen United States diplomats, including his father, were expelled from \nHaiti. He attended the Moses Brown preparatory school in Providence and \nlater returned to the Ocean State to attend the U.S. Naval War College.\n  Now, at the crest of his career, he is a hero of the American Foreign \nService and one of our very few most distinguished diplomats. He has \nshown in his career a special talent for bringing together ethnically \ndivided peoples, a skill that will, obviously, be critical in Iraq. \nWhen the Balkans erupted in ethnic conflict, Ambassador Hill was a \ncentral player on the Clinton team that forged the Dayton Accords, the \npeace settlement that ended the Bosnian war.\n  In his book on the Dayton negotiations, Special Representative for \nAfghanistan and Pakistan Ambassador Richard Holbrooke described Hill as \n``brilliant'' and ``fearless,'' praising him for being both ``very cool \nand very passionate,'' and for his strong negotiating skills. These are \nthe very traits we need in an Ambassador to Iraq.\n  Ambassador Hill served as Ambassador to Macedonia during a troubled \ntime, and as a special envoy to war-torn Kosovo. He said of this \nconflict that ``like a lot of things in life: you've got to do \neverything you can do'' to be satisfied ``that you have left no stone \nunturned.'' I am confident he will bring the same tenacity to his \nposition as United States Ambassador for Iraq.\n  As Ambassador to South Korea, Christopher Hill broke diplomatic \nprecedent and charmed the South Korean people by repeatedly visiting \nhotbeds of anti-American sentiment, such as universities, where he \nengaged in open debate with audiences. He paid his respects at a \nmemorial for thousands of civilians fired upon by a 1980s military \ngovernment. No senior U.S. official had ever before visited this \nmemorial, and he won the respect and trust of many through this simple \nyet momentous gesture. A senior official with the American Chamber of \nCommerce in South Korea, Tami Overby, stated:\n\n       He was here the shortest term among the six ambassadors \n     that I've seen here in my 18 years, but [he] had the most \n     impact.\n\n  Ambassador Hill's time in South Korea was cut short as he was tapped \nto head negotiations in six-party talks over North Korea's nuclear \nweapons program. At a time of crisis, when the Bush administration had \nlong ignored nuclear proliferation by North Korea, Ambassador Hill \nsuccessfully brought China, Japan, South Korea, Russia, and other \nregional partners to the bargaining table. Though some of my Senate \ncolleagues have criticized Ambassador Hill for negotiating with North \nKorea, his efforts there culminated in the dismantlement of the \nPyongyang reactor, slowing North Korean nuclear proliferation and \nprotecting United States and world security.\n  Now he is President Obama's nominee as Ambassador to Iraq. Timing, as \nSenator Kerry has pointed out, is crucial, and the delay is perplexing.\n  Let's look back to May 2005, when the Republican majority leader took \nto the floor to comment on the nominations of Miguel Estrada, Priscilla \nOwen, and Janice Rogers Brown to U.S. courts of appeals. He said then \nof the Senate Democratic minority:\n\n       For the first time in 214 years, they have changed the \n     Senate's ``advise and consent'' responsibilities to ``advise \n     and obstruct.''\n\n  Well, the shoe is on the other foot. My Republican colleagues are \nobstructing the nomination of our much needed United States Ambassador \nto Iraq.\n  When, in 2006, Kenneth Wainstein was nominated as the Assistant \nAttorney General for National Security, my colleague from Texas, \nSenator Cornyn, came to the floor and stated:\n\n       Obstruction from the other side of the aisle, Mr. \n     President, is impeding efforts to improve national security.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Democratic obstruction is impeding this effort to improve \n     national security.\n\n  Today, Republicans are engaged in the very obstruction they \ncriticized.\n  In 2007, when Michael Mukasey was nominated as Attorney General, the \nRepublican leader came here to state:\n\n       If . . . our colleagues intentionally delay the nominee and \n     hold him or her hostage, they will show the American people \n     that their concern for the Department was insincere. . . . In \n     these times, it is especially important that the Senate act \n     promptly. We are, after all, at war.\n\n  Well, they will be the first to tell you that we are still at war, \nand yet on this critical appointment for our new President: \nobstruction.\n  Similarly, when it came to the Iraq surge, my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle argued vehemently that we should defer to the \njudgment of General Petraeus and commanders on the ground in Iraq. I am \nnot so sure about that. Civilian control of the military is a longtime \nand valued American tradition. But that was their argument. We heard \nthe name of Petraeus invoked over and over and over again.\n  Senator McConnell, in March of 2007, spoke out against setting \ndeadlines for U.S. troop withdrawals in Iraq, stating that deadlines \nwould ``interfere with the President and General Petraeus's operational \nauthority to conduct the war in Iraq as he and his commanders see fit. \nIt would substitute for their judgment the 535 Members of Congress.''\n  In September of 2007, my colleague from South Carolina, Senator \nGraham, said that ``. . . to substitute the Congress's judgment for \nGeneral Petraeus's judgment, is ill-advised and unwarranted.''\n\n  Those of us who were here through that time remember clearly the \nrepeated incantation of the name of Petraeus that featured so \nprominently in the Republican rhetoric.\n  Well, I suggest to my Republican colleagues, the time may now have \ncome to heed their own advice. Last month, the U.S. military's chief \nspokesman, Geoff Morrell, stated:\n\n       Generals Odierno and Petraeus have come out very publicly \n     and very forcefully in support of Ambassador Hill's \n     nomination. I know they support it. They know him from \n     previous assignments, they like him, they believe he is well \n     suited to the job and are anxiously awaiting his \n     confirmation.\n\n  What happened to the deference to General Petraeus now that he wants \nAmbassador Hill? And it is not just General Petraeus and General \nOdierno and the military establishment engaged in that theater. The \nlast three United States Ambassadors to Iraq--all Republican \nappointees--Ambassador Ryan Crocker, Ambassador Zalmay Khalilzad, and \nAmbassador John Negroponte, have all also expressed their unequivocal \nsupport for Ambassador Hill.\n  There are areas outside of politics where professional respect \nprevails. As a former U.S. attorney and attorney general, I have seen \nit among prosecutors. We saw it when prosecutors of both parties \nrallied around the Department of Justice when the Bush administration \nand Attorney General Gonzales made their best efforts to ruin that \ngreat Department. The same principle applies here, the politics of this \nChamber notwithstanding. The professional colleagues of Ambassador Hill \nknow better. They know how good he is, and they know we need him there.\n  My distinguished colleague from Indiana, the ranking member of the \nSenate Committee on Foreign Relations, also agrees. He put it well in \nAmbassador Hill's confirmation hearing. ``We're at war,'' he said. \n``This is not a parliamentary struggle among senators with different \npoints of view.''\n  Senator Lugar is right. This is not or should not be a time for \nbickering. This is the time to confirm our next United States \nAmbassador to Iraq without further delay.\n  Christopher Hill has served in the State Department for 31 years. As \nSenator Kerry, the distinguished chair of\n\n[[Page S4475]]\n\nthe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations has said, he is one of our \nNation's most accomplished diplomats, ready for one of our most \ndifficult assignments. He has the votes to be confirmed. Delay now can \nonly impede progress in Iraq's future. And it fails me to understand \nhow that could be any Member's goal. The situation is better in Iraq, \nbut it remains difficult.\n  Arab-Kurd tensions are high in the north. Sectarian groups struggle \nfor power after January's provincial elections, and elections slated \nfor the end of this year will be a key indicator of Iraq's democratic \ndirection. The safety of our 146,400 men and women on the ground in \nIraq, of course, is always of concern. History shows that even major \ngains can always be reversed. So let us get Ambassador Hill out there \nto lead the transition of the United States mission in Iraq from a \nmilitary intervention to a much needed focus on stabilization and \neconomic development, and to advance our Nation's interests in that \ntroubled region.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore. I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee for his advocacy and his \nardent support of this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am very grateful to the Senator from \nRhode Island for his comments now, as well as his leadership on the \ncommittee. And I appreciate his coming to the floor to take time to do \nthis.\n  I know Senator Cardin has been waiting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to urge my colleagues to \nconfirm the nomination of Christopher Hill to be Ambassador to Iraq.\n  I compliment the distinguished chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, Senator Kerry, for his comments. I agree with him on the \nurgency of our action. It is critically important we have a confirmed \nambassador in Iraq.\n  I also concur in the comments of Senator Lugar, the ranking member of \nthe Foreign Relations Committee. We are at war. We should be coming \ntogether, as Senator Whitehouse has pointed out, and acting on this \nnomination.\n  I am somewhat confused as to why this nomination has been held up \nseveral weeks when I think of the fact that a clear, overwhelming \nmajority of the Members of the Senate are going to vote for Ambassador \nHill's confirmation.\n  It is critically important we have an experienced diplomat in Iraq as \nour Ambassador. Christopher Hill has devoted his career to service to \nour country as a diplomat. He first volunteered as a Peace Corps \nvolunteer in Cameroon. He was Special Envoy to Kosovo, a very difficult \npart of the world. He was Ambassador to Poland and Macedonia and head \nof the U.S. delegation to the six-party talks on North Korea. That \nexperience will serve him well as Ambassador to Iraq. He has navigated \ncomplex regional dynamics in seemingly intractable conflicts to promote \npeace and development in parts of the world where we thought we could \nnot make progress. He is exactly the type of experienced diplomat the \nUnited States needs representing our interests in Iraq. As has been \npointed out, we need a career diplomat, someone who has the confidence \nof the community to be able to make the type of progress we need to \nmake in Iraq.\n\n  Chris Hill has the endorsements of the three prior Ambassadors of the \nUnited States to Iraq. As Senator Whitehouse pointed out, they were \nappointed by a Republican President. However, quite frankly, Ambassador \nHill represents a nonpolitical appointment that has bipartisan support \nin Congress. Again, he is the right type of person at this moment to \nrepresent the interests of the United States.\n  Let me speak a little about the urgency of why we need to move \nforward now and get Ambassador Hill confirmed as our Ambassador. Mr. \nPresident, 140,000 American troops are currently in Iraq. They are \nentitled to have a confirmed ambassador to represent the interests of \nthe United States in Iraq. Our soldiers are serving valiantly, and they \nare entitled to have all the tools at their disposal to make sure their \nmission succeeds. One of the most important tools is to have a \nconfirmed U.S. Ambassador.\n  By August 31, 2010, America's combat mission in Iraq will end. That \nputs more urgency on our diplomacy. There may have been some \ndisagreement--there was disagreement--as to the surge of U.S. troops, \nbut there is no disagreement as to the surge and the need of a surge \nfor U.S. diplomacy. This is a critical time for Iraq. They are going \nthrough a transition in their political environment. The United States \nneeds to be represented by an experienced, confirmed diplomat. Chris \nHill is that type of an individual.\n  Let me speak about a couple of the other issues, starting with the \nrefugee issue, which I heard Senator Kerry speak about. I was recently \nin Syria and saw firsthand Iraqi refugees who are currently living in \nSyria. I have been to Jordan. I have seen Iraqi refugees who are living \nin Jordan. There are millions of displaced Iraqis--a couple million \nwithin Iraq, a couple million outside of Iraq, mostly in the \nsurrounding countries--and one of the challenges to a stable Iraq will \nbe dealing with that refugee issue. The United States has to play a \ncritical role in that, a lead role. We know that. We need an ambassador \nin Iraq on the ground advising the Obama administration as to what will \nbe the most effective policies in dealing with the displaced \nindividuals within Iraq and the refugees living in surrounding \ncountries. We need an ambassador in Iraq now to represent those \ninterests to give the President the best advice so we have our best \nchance of a successful mission within Iraq.\n  President Obama stated our strategy in Iraq ``is grounded in a clear \nand achievable goal shared by the Iraqi people and the American people: \nan Iraq that is sovereign, stable, and self-reliant. To achieve that \ngoal, we will work to promote an Iraqi government that is just, \nrepresentative, and accountable, and that provides neither support nor \nsafe-haven to terrorists.''\n  I think we all agree with President Obama's goals for Iraq, but it is \nclear to all of us that we need a career, experienced diplomat in Iraq \nrepresenting our interests at this critical moment.\n  Quite frankly, I don't understand the delay. I really don't. I think \nthe vote is going to be overwhelmingly in support of his confirmation. \nLet's get on with it. Let's get him confirmed. As Senator Kerry has \nsaid, let's get him on a plane to Iraq as quickly as possible so he can \nhelp serve our interests as Ambassador to Iraq.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for confirmation--and let's get that \nvote as quickly as possible--to represent the U.S. interests in Iraq.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Christopher Hill to be Ambassador to Iraq.\n  Last week, I had the very distinct privilege of joining Senator Jack \nReed on a trip to Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan to witness firsthand \nthe remarkable contributions of our military and civilians abroad. In \neach and every meeting in Baghdad, we were asked about the nomination \nof Ambassador Hill, and it was painstakingly clear that the absence of \na U.S. Ambassador creates questions regarding America's commitment to \nthe future of Iraq.\n  I cannot stress enough the concern expressed by our military and \ncivilian leadership, as well as the Iraqi Government, that there is no \nhigh-level civilian representing the United States in Iraq. It is in \nthis regard that I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting \nAmbassador Hill's confirmation.\n  Here in the Senate, we understand the intricacies of parliamentary \nprocedures, but outside this delay is interpreted differently. It is \nseen by far too many as signifying a low priority, a lack of American \ninterest, and a slight to the people of Iraq.\n\n[[Page S4476]]\n\n  With the beginning of President Obama's drawdown plan and the \nwithdrawal of American forces from major cities by this summer, we \nabsolutely, positively need an ambassador to coordinate increased \ncivilian efforts needed to replace our military presence.\n  As Iraqis take important steps to improve security, governance, \neconomic development, and the training of police, we must have an \nambassador to coordinate our efforts and continue to channel U.S. \nresources and support. As Iraq faces the challenge of continued \nsectarian tension--especially between the Arabs and the Kurds--\nAmbassador Hill's first task should be focusing on mitigating tensions \nin the north and helping the Iraqis resolve difficult questions \nsurrounding the status of Kirkuk and the hydrocarbons law.\n  The future of Iraq is incumbent upon critical developments and \ncritical milestones that were made this year, and it is incumbent upon \nthis body--the Senate--to ensure that the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad--the \nlargest in the world--has the leadership it needs to succeed in Iraq.\n  I have met with Ambassador Hill and I am positive that he is the \nright person for this critical task. His extensive experience in \ndiplomacy, nation building, and conflict management--especially in the \nBalkans--has prepared him for the challenge of Iraq. As a member of \nAmbassador Holbrooke's team, Ambassador Hill was deeply engaged in the \nsuccess of the Dayton peace accords in Bosnia. As Ambassador of \nMacedonia, he helped to ensure refugee camps were established for the \nKosovar refugees. As a Special Negotiator for Kosovo, Ambassador Hill \nwas the architect for efforts to secure human rights for the \npopulation. When those negotiations failed, he recommended NATO \nintervention to prevent ethnic cleansing. Ambassador Hill has been \ntested by some of the very biggest foreign policy challenges in recent \ndecades. He has demonstrated time and time again that he has the skills \nnecessary to succeed in Iraq.\n  The post of Ambassador to Iraq is vitally important to U.S. security \ninterests in the region, and I am confident the Senate will soon \nconfirm Ambassador Hill. With this in mind, I urge my colleagues who \noppose this nomination to reconsider their reservations and concerns. \nFor that reason, I wish to address a few of those concerns now because \nit is critical to stress the importance of protecting human rights \nthroughout the world, and Ambassador Hill does.\n  The most serious allegation against Ambassador Hill is related to his \nalleged unwillingness to push North Korea during the Six Party Talks. I \ncan tell my colleagues frankly that I would not support Ambassador \nHill's nomination if I had any question about his commitment to human \nrights. But I have none. He coordinated his efforts closely with the \nState Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor. \nTogether they worked to admit the first North Korean refugees to the \nUnited States in 2006 and expanded funding in support of North Korean \nhuman rights. This included expanded radio broadcasting efforts and \nsupport for North Korean defector organizations in South Korea.\n  He has intervened with foreign governments, including China, to make \nsure North Korean asylum seekers did not disappear into detention but \ncould have safe transit into third countries. In public and in private, \nAmbassador Hill has made clear to North Korean officials that human \nrights are a primary concern of the United States--as important as the \nnuclear issue. The United States must insist that any settlement with \nNorth Korea take into account its atrocious record on human rights. \nAmbassador Hill was clear about the primacy of human rights in the \nprocess of negotiations.\n  Critics of Ambassador Hill have looked at a disappointing outcome at \nSix Party Talks and pointed the blame at him. It is a chilling thought, \nbut it must be noted that without Ambassador Hill's commitment, the \nsituation could have been far worse. In this regard, I am grateful to \nAmbassador Hill for all that he accomplished with a government well-\nknown for its intransigence--clearly, the most intransigent government \non the face of the Earth.\n  The practical diplomatic skills Ambassador Hill demonstrated in the \nBalkans and North Korea are what we need in Iraq. We will need his past \nexperience with refugees and internally displaced persons. We will need \nhis ability to interact with all parties as a fair arbitrator, and we \nneed his experience with security issues and the training of police.\n  Now, more than ever, it is absolutely critical to demonstrate to the \nIraqi people and the world that we value the importance of the future \nof Iraq. At this critical turning point, we must have a diplomat in \nBaghdad who can confront the many challenges and provide the necessary \nleadership for our mission. It is in this regard that I strongly \nsupport the nomination of Ambassador Chris Hill, not only because he is \nan accomplished diplomat but because he is the right person for the \ntask at hand in Iraq.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, today is a sad day in the history of \nthe world. It is Holocaust Remembrance Day. This month marks the 65th \nanniversary of a daring escape from Auschwitz by a teenager who then \nrevealed the truth about the death camps, only to be ignored by the \nallied leadership.\n  In March 1944, the Germans occupied Hungary and prepared to deport \nthat country's Jews--numbering approximately 750,000--to Auschwitz. A \n19-year-old prisoner, Rudolph Vrba, together with fellow inmate Alfred \nWexler, decided to do something that almost nobody had ever done \nbefore: escape from Auschwitz. They were determined to alert the world \nabout the doom Hungarian Jews would soon face.\n  On April 7, Vrba and Wetzler slipped away from their slave labor \nbattalion and hid in a hollowed-out woodpile near the edge of the camp. \nOn the advice of Soviet prisoners of war, the fugitives sprinkled the \narea with tobacco and gasoline, which confused the German dogs that \nwere used to search for them.\n  On their second day in the woodpile, Vrba and Wetzler heard Allied \nwarplanes overhead. ``They came closer and closer--then bombs began to \ncrunch not far away,'' Vrba later recalled in his searing memoir I \nCannot Forgive. ``Our pulses quickened. Were they going to bomb the \ncamp? Was the secret out? . . . Was this the end of Auschwitz?''\n  The Allied planes were actually bombing German oil factories in and \naround the Auschwitz complex. The idea of bombing the death camp had \nnot yet been proposed to the Allied leadership, and details such as the \nlocation of the gas chambers and crematoria were not yet known to the \nAllied war command. But that was about to change.\n  On April 10, in the dead of night, Vrba and Wetzler emerged from the \nwoodpile and began an 11-day, 80-mile trek to Slovakia. There they met \nwith Jewish leaders and dictated a 30-page report that came to be known \nas the ``Auschwitz Protocols.'' It included details of the mass-murder \nprocess, maps pinpointing the gas chambers and crematoria and warnings \nof the impending slaughter of Hungary's Jews.\n  ``One million Hungarian [Jews] are going to die,'' Vrba told them. \n``Auschwitz is ready for them. But if you tell them now, they will \nrebel. They will never go to the ovens.''\n  A copy of the report was given to Rudolf Kastner, a Budapest Jewish \nleader. Instead of publicizing the information, Kastner negotiated a \ndeal that involved bribing the Germans to permit a train with 1,684 of \nhis relatives, friends and Hungarian Jewish leaders to leave the \ncountry. Kastner's action became the centerpiece of a controversial \ntrial in Israel after the war.\n  Another copy of Vrba's Auschwitz Protocols was given to Rabbi Michoel \nDov Weissmandl, a rescue activist in Bratislava, who then wrote the \nfirst known appeal for the use of Allied air power to disrupt the mass \nmurder. Weissmandl's plea to the Allies to bomb the railroad lines \nbetween Hungary and Auschwitz reached the Roosevelt administration in \nJune.\n\n[[Page S4477]]\n\n  Assistant secretary of war John McCloy responded that the request was \n``impracticable'' because it would require ``diversion of considerable \nair support essential to the success of our forces now engaged in \ndecisive operations.'' He also claimed the War Department's position \nwas based on ``a study'' of the issue. But no evidence of such a study \nhas ever been found by researchers. In reality, McCloy's position was \nbased on the War Department's standing policy that no military \nresources should be allocated for ``rescuing victims of enemy \noppression.''\n  Vrba's report convinced the Jewish Agency leadership in Palestine to \nchange its position on bombing. Agency leaders initially opposed \nbombing Auschwitz because they believed it was a labor camp, not a \ndeath camp. But after receiving the Auschwitz Protocols in June, agency \nofficials lobbied British, American and Soviet officials to bomb the \ncamp or the railways leading to it. Their requests were rebuffed.\n  Most important, a condensed version of the Auschwitz Protocols \nreached the U.S. Government's War Refugee Board in June. It helped \ngalvanize the board mobilize international pressure on Hungary to halt \nthe deportations to Auschwitz. Although that effort came too late for \nthe more than 400,000 Hungarian Jews who had been shipped to their \ndoom, it did spare the 200,000-plus who were still alive in Budapest.\n  The full version of the Vrba report was actually held up in \nSwitzerland for three months by U.S. diplomats who regarded it as low \npriority. And when the report finally reached Washington in October, \nthe Office of War Information opposed distributing it; OWI director \nElmer Davis claimed the report was actually part of a Nazi conspiracy \nto ``create contempt for the [Jewish] inmates'' by showing that the \nJews were not resisting their killers.\n  Fortunately, Davis and his cockamamie theories were too late to blunt \nthe impact of the Auschwitz Protocols. The Hungarian deportations had \nbeen stopped, and Rudolf Vrba and Alfred Wetzler had played a \nsignificant role in bringing that about.\n  So it was held up by U.S. diplomats, who regarded Auschwitz, in this \nsituation, as a low priority.\n  I will show you a picture of what is happening in North Korea. These \nare North Korean children who are being starved to death. These \npictures were smuggled out by activists who wanted us to see what is \ntaking place there. There are reliable estimates that up to 10 percent \nof the North Korean population has been starved to death in a gulag \nsystem, which I have spoken about many times on this floor, or by a \nregime that willfully gives food to those they deem reliable and \nwillfully keeps food away from those they deem unreliable--including \ninnocent children.\n  This is taking place today on Holocaust Remembrance Day, in full view \nof the world, with full knowledge of U.S. diplomatic officials and with \nthe knowledge that this has been going on for some time. They have \ndeemed it a low priority, that it is not essential for us to deal with \nit at this time, that we have more important obligations to the world \nand to ourselves. And they starve and they die. It continues.\n  The situation in North Korea has been studied fairly in depth. Here \nis a report done by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, \nchaired by Vaclav Havel and Eli Wiesel, among others. It is titled \n``Failure to Check the Ongoing Challenge in North Korea,'' about the \nstarvation at the gulags. Here is another report titled ``North Korea: \nRepublic of Torture.'' They gave this report. And we have our own \nreport by the Congressional Research Service, titled ``North Korean \nRefugees in China and Human Rights Issues: International Response and \nU.S. Policy Options.'' So we have a number of studies. Ambassador Hill \nknows of these quite well.\n  Here on Holocaust Remembrance Day, this sounds eerily familiar--\ndeeming this a low priority, saying that we have other more urgent \nneeds and we should not divert resources or attention or focus to \nanother area. And they continue to die. It seems as if we have seen \nthis play before. It always saddens me to see this play. I don't like \nit.\n  The title for this year's Holocaust Remembrance Day is ``Never Again: \nWhat You Do Matters.'' I think that title could not be more appropriate \nwhen we are debating the new potential Ambassador who will go to Iraq. \nIt does matter. This has been a matter that for some length of time I \nhave negotiated with this Ambassador--to elevate this issue in North \nKorea. But it hasn't taken place. And we continue to see this \nsituation.\n\n  I guess you could say: Well, OK, we could do that. We must have \ngotten a great deal for letting this situation be ignored. Yet as \narticulated last night--actually it will be worthwhile to go through it \nright now.\n  Let's look at the deal we got from the North Koreans in the six-party \ntalks. Let's put these guys on the side bench. We are not going to \nconsider them right now. It is low priority.\n  This is what the United States got out of the six-party talks where \nwe set aside the human rights issue--not now, even though we have a \nspecial envoy for human rights, even though the Congress passed a bill, \nthe North Korean Human Rights Act, after we have done all these things, \nbut, OK, we are going to set that aside right now because we got a good \ndeal in the six-party talks out of the North Koreans. I know they are \ndifficult to deal with, tough negotiators, crazy, but we got a good \ndeal this time.\n  What we got out of it was we obtained an incomplete declaration from \nNorth Korea which the United States was unable to verify. They gave us \na declaration, and we could not verify it. It was incomplete. It was \nalso radioactive, which is spiteful on the part of the North Koreans. \nThe actual report was radioactive.\n  They imploded a cooling tower at Yongbyon--a little bit of theater, a \ncamera shot, a photo op. It did not stop them from producing nuclear \nmaterial there. It is just less safe to do it now in this spot. They \nare even saying now they are going to produce there.\n  In the last 2 weeks, they have launched a missile that flew over \nJapan and has a range to reach the western United States. They have \ncaptured and detained two U.S. citizens who were reporting on this \nsituation.\n  They are being investigated for selling nuclear material to Iran. \nThat is what has happened in the last 2 weeks. They pulled out of the \nsix-party talks and kicked out U.N. inspectors. That has happened. That \nwas the deal we got.\n  What did the North Korean regime get so we could set aside this sort \nof human rights mess there and kind of ignore that? What did they get? \nThey got delisted as a state sponsor of terrorism. They were able to \naccess funds they had in an international bank. Probably those were \ngotten funds by selling drugs or by printing U.S. currency, which they \nare greatly proficient at doing. They obtained key waivers of U.S. \nsanctions imposed after the regime's illegal nuclear detonation in \n2006. So we waived those sanctions. They got off the state-sponsored \nterrorism list. They received tens of millions of dollars worth of U.S. \nenergy assistance, fuel oil we gave them. That is what the Soviets used \nto give the North Koreans. Now the United States is giving it to North \nKorea. They were allowed to continue totalitarian oppression and \nstarvation of the North Korean people and continued operation of a \ngulag of concentration camps for political dissidents. They were never \nrequired to release or account for all abductees or POWs or acknowledge \na clandestine uranium enrichment program or their role in Syria's \nreactor bombed by the Israelis. That was a North Korean-designed \nreactor. They didn't have to say: This is what we did with that. They \nwere able to test ballistic missile technology in violation of U.N. \nSecurity Council sanctions without any meaningful consequences.\n  That was the deal we got, and that was the deal North Koreans got. We \ncalled off the human rights issue, which I was pushing and a number of \npeople here were pushing for years, holding up different things in the \nsystem saying, you have to deal with this because we don't like these \npictures; we know what is going on; you have to stop it. No, we have to \nput all that aside; this is a great deal. It was a terrible deal.\n  Who was the head of all these negotiations? It turns out it is the \nindividual we are now going to promote to the lead diplomatic post \naround the world for us, Ambassador Chris Hill, nominated to be our \nAmbassador to\n\n[[Page S4478]]\n\nIraq at the very point in time when those negotiations are moving into \nthe most important diplomatic phase, more from the military phase to \nthe diplomatic phase. This is the key person, this is our lead person \non the ground, this is our representative to the Iraqi people whom we \nput in place, and this is the deal he got in his last assignment. Let's \nset aside those nettlesome human rights issues that always seem to pop \nup and get in the way.\n  On its face, we should not put the individual who negotiated that bad \ndeal and ignored that terrible situation into our best and most \nimportant post around the world. We should not do that. And certainly \nadding insult to injury, doing it on Holocaust Remembrance Day when we \nhave a modern equivalent--not an equivalent, that is not fair to say--\nwe have a systematic modern killing by a government of millions of \nNorth Koreans, and that is taking place now.\n  One can say, I guess, there is nobody else who would take the post in \nIraq. And yet CNN was reporting the story about General Zinni, a highly \ndecorated individual of our Government, being offered the post of \nAmbassador to Iraq by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, being \ncongratulated by Vice President Joe Biden, and then mysteriously it is \npulled back and he is not given the post. Here General Zinni, a highly \nqualified, knowledgeable individual of what is taking place in the \nregion--he was certainly a skeptic on parts of the war, an individual \nwith whom I disagreed, but he had his basis to do that--this is the \nindividual who was initially nominated for this post or initially put \nforward and then suddenly is abruptly pulled out and instead they bring \nforward an individual who negotiated this bad deal.\n  Why not General Zinni? If people are so upset, as they I guess \nrightfully should be, that we do not have anybody in that post, why did \nthey throw the last ambassador out so quickly before we got this one in \nor bring in General Zinni who doesn't have these questions and problems \nand doesn't have this history of a horrific failure. Why not General \nZinni? We can move him through fast. No problem. He is knowledgeable \nand qualified, not this controversial background nor this ignoring of a \nhuman rights disaster in North Korea as being problematic and \nnettlesome and harmful to the overall debate.\n  Never again, as we say, never again are we going to let this sort of \nsituation bubble up on us. Never again Rwanda. Never again a holocaust. \nNever again, as it happens today.\n  I want to go through what is happening. I have a number of points I \nwant to cover, but let me start with this. I had a lengthy and ongoing \ndiscussion with Ambassador Hill about the human rights situation in \nNorth Korea and the problems with it. He refused to invite the Special \nEnvoy Jay Lefkowitz to those negotiations. I talked directly with Jay \nLefkowitz since that period of time. Jay said he was never invited by \nanybody or by Mr. Hill to the six-party talks or any associated talks. \nHe was kept away from them.\n  There has been a refusal by Ambassador Hill to comply with the North \nKorean Human Rights Act. He refused to make use of resources at his \ndisposal to assist in bringing out the human rights issues overall.\n  I want to read from the record what Ambassador Hill said. We had this \nongoing negotiation. I know there is some question about what he \nactually committed to. I have been talking with people at the State \nDepartment for some period of time. They continue to say: No, we are \nnot going to do human rights, but we might do something, this or that. \nI said: It is not good enough; it needs to be involved in the actual \nnegotiations and is actually a key to getting the regime under control \nand getting it to stop doing the terrible things it is doing now if you \nbring up the human rights issues. When you put exterior pressure on \nNorth Korea--you have to stop the missiles, nuclear development--the \nleader can say to his own people: They are threatening us and we have \nto stand together and be protected. When you talk about human rights, \nthis is what he is doing to his own people. It weakens the regime. They \nrefused to bring that up.\n  In a hearing before the Armed Services Committee on the six-party \ntalks and implementation activities, Ambassador Hill spoke. Senator \nJohn Warner worked with me, saying: Will you work with Ambassador Hill? \nYes, if he includes the Special Envoy for human rights in these talks. \nIf he agrees, fine, let's get it out in a public hearing and out on the \nrecord and move forward with it. This is what happened at that hearing \non July 31 of last year. I was there. I asked Ambassador Hill:\n\n       . . . will you state that the Special Envoy will be invited \n     to all future negotiating sessions with North Korea?\n\n  That was my question in a public hearing on the record. This was \nchoreographed ahead of time. I asked:\n\n       . . . will you state that the Special Envoy will be invited \n     to all future negotiating sessions with North Korea?\n\n  ``All future negotiating sessions with North Korea.''\n\n       Ambassador Hill: I would be happy to invite him to all \n     future negotiating sessions with North Korea.\n       Senator Brownback: Thank you.\n\n  Those are two sentences. As a lawyer, that is pretty clear. It is \n``all.'' It says ``all.'' We both say ``all.'' It is not, well, OK, I \nmeant this group, not that group of sessions. There was no parsing of \nwords because I knew this is what would take place if I did not get a \ncomplete statement, and it was a complete statement--all future \nnegotiating sessions. ``I would be happy to invite him to all future \nnegotiating sessions with North Korea,'' and that did not occur.\n  We received a statement from Jay Lefkowitz who was our Special Envoy \nto North Korea. I talked with Jay about this. Let me dig up the \nstatement he sent back to me on the specifics of whether he was invited \nto any of those sessions. He said he was invited to none of them. Yet \nhere is a statement that he will be invited to all. Jay Lefkowitz: I \nwas invited to none.\n  Misleading or lying to a Member of Congress at the Senate Committee \non Armed Services by the individual we now are asked to trust with the \nmost important account that we have. He is going to be an individual \nwho is going to come back up to this body and he is going to be asking \nfor resources, he is going to be asking for different things for the \nCongress to do. This is an individual I have had some depth of \nexperience with and I am going to question what he is asking and what \nhe is guaranteeing then in the process, if this is the way he has dealt \nwith me on a very specific, a very clear issue that has come forward.\n  A number of my colleagues have questions about his overall \nqualifications to go to the region in Iraq with no prior experience \nthere, when you have an individual such as General Zinni who wants to \ntake the post and has enormous experience in the types of things about \nwhich we are talking. I think this is lamentable.\n  I put in a bill last night. It calls for resanctioning North Korea \nwith the sanctions that were lifted off this deal that was structured. \nThis bill calls for resanctioning North Korea, putting it back on the \nterrorism list, not sending them more fuel oil, funds to have at their \ndisposal from us, fuel oil to fuel their economy. I think this is \nappropriate for us to be discussing at this point in time since the \nindividual who negotiated that deal is the one we are considering for \nthis next future negotiation.\n  It is my hope that we can bring that bill up, that we can get some \nsort of vote on it. I remind individuals--and I know President Obama is \nvery concerned about what is taking place in North Korea. He stated it, \nhe stated very publicly that he is concerned about it. He stated it as \na candidate, and he stated it as a Senator.\n  I want to put up a quote from Candidate Obama who was also then \nSenator Obama at that point in time about what he was saying about \nNorth Korea. He said this:\n\n       Sanctions are a critical part of our leverage to pressure \n     North Korea to act. They should only be lifted based on North \n     Korean performance. If the North Koreans do not meet their \n     obligations, we should move quickly to re-impose sanctions \n     that have been waived, and consider new restrictions going \n     forward.\n\n  This is Candidate Obama, Senator Obama, now President Obama, what he \nstated on June 26, 2008.\n  What has been the performance by North Korea? I have gone through \nthis. I think it is worth noting, but the most obvious one is a big \nmissile test that\n\n[[Page S4479]]\n\ntook place less than 2 weeks ago. They are now restarting a nuclear \nreactor. They are being investigated for sending nuclear material to \nIran. The North Koreans have arrested two U.S. citizens. That is the \nperformance that has taken place. We go to an international body, the \nU.N., and they say we ought to put sanctions on them. I am saying we \nought to put our own sanctions back on based on what our President \nsaid, as a candidate at that time.\n  In deference to several of my colleagues, I have much more to say, \nbut I will allow others to speak, and then I will come back later in \nthe day to speak further.\n  With that, at this point in time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to speak on behalf of Ambassador \nHill. First of all, I wish to commend my colleagues. Yesterday, by a \nvote of 73 to 17 the Senate confirmed the nomination of Ambassador \nChris Hill to serve as our Ambassador to Iraq, and I cast a vote for \nhim. I did not get the chance yesterday to speak prior to the vote, so \nI wished to take a couple minutes today because I think this is an \nimportant issue. Its not just about Chris Hill but also about how we \nconduct diplomacy and about a professional, an individual who has \nserved in administrations, regardless of politics or party, but as a \nprofessional. It is extremely important, in my view, that we have a \ncadre of professional people in our diplomatic corps who can serve both \nDemocratic and Republican administrations with dignity, with \nprofessionalism, with brilliance in this case, and that we recognize \nthem. That will necessitate from time to time that there will be a \nchange in policies, but having individuals who are able to accommodate \nthose changes and serve the interests of our country in a highly \nprofessional capacity is something to be celebrated, in my view, and \nsomething we need more of, not less. My support for Chris Hill's \nnomination is not to suggest that I necessarily agreed with every \ndecision he made when he served at the discretion of Condoleezza Rice \nand President Bush but because he did so professionally and with great \ncapacity. That willingness is something I believe we need to celebrate, \nas I said a moment ago, more often.\n  Chris Hill is one of America's most accomplished Ambassadors and \ndiplomats. He has served as Ambassador of our country to Macedonia, to \nPoland, and South Korea, as Special Envoy to Kosovo, and as a key \nnegotiator of the 1995 Dayton Accords. He has been the Assistant \nSecretary of State for East Asia, and the Special Envoy to the six-\nparty talks on North Korea's nuclear program.\n  His experience, tremendous professionalism and discipline, and his \nvery keen analytical skills have made Ambassador Hill uniquely \nqualified, I believe, to serve as Ambassador to Iraq. It is high time \nthe Senate confirmed him. This has gone on too long, given the \nimportance of that Nation and the very precarious situation Iraq is in \nas it transitions from a nation at war with itself to the political \nstability we all hope will be achieved.\n  The purpose of the surge in Iraq was to create the breathing space \nfor the Iraqis to engage in political reconciliation and the political \nprocesses that would enable the Government to address the needs of its \npeople and to rely less on American Security forces while doing so. The \nreduction in violence is a very positive sign and one that all of us \nwelcome. But we must ask ourselves some critical questions as well: \nHave the fundamentals in Iraq changed? Is this reduction in violence \norganic or temporary? Is it sustainable? Have the fundamental \nroadblocks to political reconciliation been removed? How real is that \nprogress? How fragile is it? Given the answers to these questions, what \nstrategy should the United States employ in Iraq?\n  I believe we made the correct decision yesterday by a vote of 73 to \n17 that Ambassador Hill is the right person to analyze these questions. \nHe has a wealth of experience in very difficult places around the \nglobe. While he lacks the so-called direct experience in this part of \nthe world, the skill sets he brings to this are absolutely essential, \nin my view, to navigate these very difficult issues I have raised. So \nwe need to recognize that.\n  I also believe he is the right individual because he has demonstrated \na solid grasp of the complex Iraqi reality, as well as a commitment to \nworking toward reconciliation in Iraq and helping build an inclusive \nand responsive government that meets the needs of its people, while \nallowing American forces to quickly withdraw in the most responsible \nway possible.\n  I am confident Ambassador Hill can accomplish this extraordinarily \ndifficult and complex mission because he has demonstrated his ability \nto do so time and time again. Most recently, with the full confidence \nof the former President and Secretary of State, Ambassador Hill \ncoordinated difficult and highly sensitive multilateral negotiations \nover North Korea's nuclear program.\n  For people who supported President Bush's policy regarding North \nKorea to raise objections to Ambassador Hill's embrace and faithful \nexecution of that policy is somewhat illogical. Similarly, it is unfair \nand dangerous for us to sit here and second-guess every split-second \ndecision our Ambassadors around the world have to make, often in \nextremely difficult and rapidly changing circumstances, when those \ndecisions are consistent with the guidance of the Secretary of State \nand the President, as they were in the previous administration. On one \nsuch occasion, in fact, in his negotiations on North Korea, then-\nSecretary of State Condoleezza Rice approved of Chris Hill's quick \nthinking and adaptability, and she was highly critical of his Chinese \nnegotiating partners for complicating an already tenuous situation.\n  The American people need our Ambassadors to carry out administration \npolicy at the direction of the President and the Secretary of State and \nto think quickly on their feet when unexpected circumstances arise. \nChris Hill has demonstrated the ability time and time and time again to \nmake those kinds of decisions that advance our interests as a nation \nthrough the diplomatic process. To do otherwise would be irresponsible.\n  Moreover, I am concerned about the complaints that Ambassador Hill \ndid not press hard enough against North Korea on its deplorable human \nrights record. North Korea's human rights practices are horrific. We \nall know it. I know of no one, including Ambassador Hill, who thinks \notherwise. But to claim Ambassador Hill somehow failed to faithfully \nand energetically carry out the human rights policies of President Bush \nand Secretary of State Rice, I think, is wrong. It is not just unfair \nto him and unfair to the former President and Secretary of State, it is \na naive oversimplification of a highly complex matter, particularly \nwhen the reduction of a nuclear threat was the primary objective of \nthose efforts.\n  Ambassador Hill, has earned the support of the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Generals Petraeus \nand Odierno, and the last three U.S. Ambassadors to Iraq. Ambassador \nHill has testified before the Foreign Relations Committee and has \nanswered all our questions on that committee, and I believe it is time \nwe stopped delaying and send this Ambassador to Baghdad, where he is \nneeded to carry out the critical missions of our Nation and advance the \ninterests of our Nation. I know I am not alone in my belief that we are \nlucky to have such a talented and dedicated public servant to take on \nthis daunting task, and I would urge my colleagues to support his \nnomination.\n  I referred earlier to the vote yesterday. That vote was on a cloture \nmotion to go to Ambassador Chris Hill's nomination. When I said it was \na vote on his nomination--that vote of 73 to 17--it was a vote that \nallows us to get to the vote on the nomination. I was confusing the \ncloture motion with the vote to come on his nomination, which will \noccur at some point in the next day or two. Again, I urge my colleagues \nto be as supportive in the nomination as they were on the cloture \nmotion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n\n                               Earth Day\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, tomorrow is Earth Day, and it is a \ngood day to save our mountaintops. I live in east Tennessee, near the \nedge of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Millions of Americans \nvisit us\n\n[[Page S4480]]\n\nevery year because of the natural beauty of our landscape. They do not \ncome to Tennessee to see the smog, they do not come to Tennessee to see \ncreeks polluted by mountaintop mining, and they don't come to Tennessee \nto see ridgetop wind turbines that are three times as tall as our \nUniversity of Tennessee football stadium, which, with their \ntransmission lines, would create a junkyard in the sky.\n  The American landscape is a part of our environment. It is essential \nto the American character. From John Muir and Theodore Roosevelt to \nLady Bird Johnson, generations of Americans have worked to protect the \nlandscape. Some of the same groups that have worked hardest to protect \nthe landscape are neglecting it in pursuit of remedies for climate \nchange.\n  I am working with three Democratic Members of Congress to try to \nprotect the American landscape. The first is Senator Tom Carper of \nDelaware. He and I are introducing legislation to put stiffer controls \non sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury emissions from coal plants. We have \nthe technology to make the air cleaner, and we should be using it. \nThere is no need to delay dealing with sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury \nwhile we figure out what to do about carbon.\n  Secondly, Senator Cardin of Maryland and I have introduced \nlegislation to ban the practice of blowing off the tops of mountains \nand dumping the waste in streams to mine coal. Coal is essential to our \nenergy future. I hope we will reserve a Nobel Prize for the scientist \nwho finds a way to deal with the carbon from existing coal plants. But \nwe will create many more jobs by saving our mountaintops to attract \ntourists than we will by blowing them up to find coal, especially \nbecause our State produces less than 2 percent of the Nation's coal.\n  Finally, Representative Heath Shuler of North Carolina and I hosted a \nforum in Knoxville highlighting the Tennessee Valley Authority and \ntheir choices for renewable energy. Conservation and nuclear power are \nrealistic options for clean electricity for our region, and we should \nmove ahead aggressively with both. But solar power, for the longer \nterm; underwater river turbines in the Mississippi River; biomass, such \nas wood chips; and methane from landfills are all good choices for \nrenewable electricity as well.\n  On the other hand, the idea of polluting our landscape with 500-foot \nwind turbines and their transmission towers is preposterous. It makes \nno sense to destroy the environment in the name of saving the \nenvironment, especially since the wind only blows about 18 percent of \nthe time at TVA's one wind farm. And much of that is at night, when TVA \nalready has thousands of unused megawatts of electricity that we could \nbe using. TVA should take the $60 million it is spending to buy about 5 \nmegawatts of unreliable wind power and instead buy 10 compact \nfluorescent light bulbs for every TVA household, which, if used, would \nsave about 920 megawatts of reliable power--the equivalent of an entire \nnuclear plant.\n  Senator Carper and I will host a roundtable this Thursday in the \nCapitol on our legislation to establish stiff standards for sulfur, \nnitrogen, and mercury. The Tennessee Valley Authority needs to go ahead \nand put sulfur, nitrogen, and mercury controls on all its large coal \nplants that it intends to keep open. But TVA actions alone will not be \nenough to give us clean air in the Great Smoky Mountains and in \nTennessee. We need strong national standards, such as those in our \nlegislation because so much of our dirty air blows in from coal \npowerplants in other States.\n  During each of the 2-year Congresses in which I have been a Senator, \nI have introduced legislation to curb pollutants from coal plants, \nincluding carbon. Tomorrow is Earth Day and a good day to save our \nmountaintops. The way we should do that is to have stiffer controls for \ncleaner air, to ban mountaintop removal for coal mining, and to stop \nthe practice of wasting ratepayer dollars for ridgetop wind turbines \nthat destroy the landscape, which is also an essential part of the \nAmerican environment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Casey pertaining to the introduction of S. 839 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in late February, President Obama made \nan announcement to thousands of marines in Camp Lejeune about bringing \nan end to the war in Iraq. After only 5 weeks in office, this President \ndelivered on what I consider to be one of his most important campaign \npromises--to end this war once and for all.\n  But amidst this historic position and with this change that is \nlooming, the Senate unfortunately has delayed the confirmation of the \nUnited States Ambassador to Iraq. We have gone almost 2 months without \nan ambassador in Iraq. With more than 140,000 American military \npersonnel literally risking their lives in that country, the Senate has \nrefused to fill this vacancy and to send our highest ranking civil \nofficial to Iraq to work with our military for a peaceful conclusion to \nthis war. It is unforgivable. It is inexcusable. It is a fact.\n  Ambassador Hill, Christopher Hill, the man who has been nominated for \nthis position, is a highly accomplished career diplomat. This is not a \nman who comes to this job without experience. He has served America for \nover three decades in some of the world's most difficult and \nchallenging situations. Here is what President Obama said in nominating \nChristopher Hill to be our Ambassador:\n\n       From his time in the Peace Corps to his work in Kosovo and \n     Korea, Ambassador Hill has been tested, and he has shown the \n     pragmatism and the skill that we need right now.\n\n  In the former Yugoslavia, Ambassador Hill was at the center of \nnegotiations for the Bosnia peace settlement. He was the first United \nStates Ambassador to Macedonia, where he helped to build the basic \ninstitutions of democratic governance and civil society. As our \nAmbassador to South Korea, Christopher Hill worked with Korean \nofficials and U.S. military leaders to develop and implement the most \nsignificant realignment of military posture in the region since the \nKorean war of the 1950s.\n  Most recently, as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and \nPacific Affairs, Ambassador Christopher Hill worked with China, South \nKorea, Russia, and other nations to advance negotiations with North \nKorea over its nuclear program.\n  Some have argued on the floor that Ambassador Hill did not adequately \npress the North Korean Government on its deplorable human rights \nrecord. But, in truth, Hill did address the North Korean human rights \nrecord, but he did so while following the President's request to keep \ndenuclearization of the Korean peninsula at the forefront of his \nagenda.\n  President Obama's plan to remove 140,000 troops from Iraq, including \nall combat forces by next summer, is a challenge. It is a challenge not \nonly for our military but also on the diplomatic front. We will be \nworking with the Iraqi Government throughout this transition to make \ncertain we do everything in our power to have a meaningful handover of \nauthority and a stable Iraq left behind. We are going to have 35- to \n50,000 transitional forces that will remain to train and advise Iraqi \nsecurity forces, to conduct counterterrorism operations, and to protect \nAmerican civilian and military personnel. Those transitional forces are \nscheduled to leave by the end of 2012. Is there anyone who believes we \ncan accomplish this without having our best and brightest on the ground \nin Iraq? Is there any parent or spouse, relative, or friend of a \nservice man or woman now risking their life in Iraq who does not \nbelieve we should have an ambassador on the ground? How can we explain \nto these soldiers that for 2 months, while Congress sits here wringing \nits hands, we have not sent an ambassador to Iraq?\n  Yesterday, we were forced to have a cloture vote. A cloture vote \nbasically\n\n[[Page S4481]]\n\nsays: Stop talking, Senators, and get down to business. Make a decision \nonce in a while.\n  Do you know what the vote was yesterday? It was 73 to 17. That means \nthat not only the 57 Democrats who are here but at least 16 of the \nRepublicans joined us and said: Let's get this moving.\n  How do we find ourselves in this position where the President wants \nto send the most important civil representative of our Government to a \nnation where American soldiers' lives are at risk and the Senate wrings \nits hands and says: Well, maybe we ought to wait a few days; maybe we \nought to wait a few weeks; maybe we ought to let this sit over the \nEaster recess while we eat our Peeps and jellybeans. I do not buy that. \nThis is a critical decision for America's security interests. Sending a \ndiplomat of the skill of Christopher Hill is absolutely essential to \nprotect America's interests, to protect the interests of servicemen, to \nmake certain we have an ongoing relationship with the Iraqis, so that \nour service men and women can come home safely and Iraq will be stable \nand safe itself afterward. There is no reason to delay this 1 minute \nmore. We should vote on Christopher Hill's nomination immediately. Why \nare we denying this? Why are we delaying this when 73 Senators \nyesterday said: Do it. That is enough. There are enough Senators to get \nthis job done.\n  President Obama stated a clear goal here: ending our combat mission \nin Iraq by August 31, 2010. When the combat mission ends, the United \nStates will still leave behind in Iraq the largest American Embassy in \nthe world, where we will maintain a diplomatic mission to help a \ncountry still struggling to build stability and democracy. Is there \nanyone who questions whether we need an ambassador to be in that \nEmbassy? Shouldn't that person have been there weeks ago instead of \nbeing delayed by the other side in the Senate?\n  I do not deny to any Senator the right to speak, express their \nconcerns or reservations about any appointment. I do not deny to any \ncommittee of this Senate the opportunity to have a hearing, which \nAmbassador Hill did have. All of that happened in the regular order. At \nthe end of the day yesterday, 73 Democratic and Republican Senators \nsaid: Get on with it. Still, we languish over this nomination at this \nvery moment. The military leaders, American military leaders of Iraq, \nhave been begging this Senate to do its job and send an ambassador who \ncan complement the fine work of General Odierno in Iraq. We continue to \ndelay.\n  The President's plan for Iraq is measured and thoughtful and will \nbring a resolution to this war. It sends a message to the Iraqi \npolitical leadership that they have to take responsibility for their \nown future. It takes into consideration the concerns and \nrecommendations of the senior military leaders regarding the time for \nthe drawdown and the manner in which it will be implemented. It frees \nresources for the real battle against al-Qaida in Afghanistan, which \nwas the source of the 9/11 attacks. It includes comprehensive \ndiplomatic engagement with all of the countries of the region not only \non the future of Iraq but on other important regional challenges. It \nbegins to put an end to the extraordinary cost to America and American \nfamilies in terms of lives and dollars that the Iraqi war has entailed.\n  Our military men and women have served heroically in Iraq. I have \nbeen there to visit them. I have been several times in my home State to \nsee our Guard units take off and join the conflict. I have been there \nto welcome them home, attended the funerals. We could not ask for \nanything more. They have given us so much, and they continue to do so \nas we meet in the safety of the Senate Chamber here in the Capitol. \nMore than 4,200 Americans have been killed, 165 from my home State of \nIllinois. When the war started, I said I would write a note to the \nfamilies who lost soldiers from my State. Little did I dream that years \nlater I would still be signing those notes, as I did yesterday. \nThousands have suffered serious physical and psychological injuries. \nThat is the real cost of this war. Civilian experts in and out of the \nGovernment have also served with distinction and paid with their lives. \nThousands of innocent Iraqis have died. I have seen firsthand the \ndangerously hard work our soldiers face.\n  We owe them gratitude and admiration, but we also owe them our best \nefforts to make certain we bring this war in Iraq to an end in the best \npossible way. President Obama has the strategy, but to implement this \nstrategy we need an experienced ambassador in Iraq without any further \ndelay.\n  I wonder what would have happened under the previous administration \nif the Democrats had held up a key appointment of an ambassador to Iraq \nin the midst of a war. Well, I can tell you what would have happened: \nThe rightwing radio would have gone crazy, talking about endangering \nAmerican servicemen by not filling this critical position. We would \nhave speeches on the floor about shirking our responsibility and that \nwe cannot go home for a break until we send a full complement of our \nbest and brightest to represent America in Iraq. I can almost predict \nthat would have happened if we had been so shortsighted under the \nprevious administration as to hold back a career diplomat such as \nChristopher Hill.\n  Well, it has happened here, and it is happened for too long. It is \nunforgivable. It is inexcusable. Members have had plenty of time to \ngive their speeches, to express their concerns, even to vote no, which \nis their right to do if they believe this man is not the right person \nfor the job. But it is time for us to get on with this important \nmission. We owe it to those men and women who are risking their lives \nin Iraq. We owe it to all who have served there and to the American \npeople who have sustained this war, as expensive as it has been in \nterms of life and costs. It is time for us to stop wasting time. It is \ntime for us to fill this position and send Christopher Hill to be the \nU.S. Ambassador to Iraq.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

HILL TO BE AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ--Continued\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I trust we are not in a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are not.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and that Senator Brownback be recognized following my \npresentation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Dorgan are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Chris Hill \nnomination to be Ambassador to Iraq. I am opposed to that nomination. A \nnumber of issues have been raised on this nomination I want to talk \nabout to try to put some factual setting associated with that.\n  First, though, I wish to have printed in the Record at the end of my \nstatement a Jerusalem Post online edition article dated yesterday that \nI read extensively from in my first presentation regarding the 65th \nanniversary of the escape from Auschwitz. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave that article printed in the Record at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I want to note for my colleagues, I read extensively \nfrom this article and did not cite that during my initial presentation. \nI want to make sure they know this came from that reporter and that we \nwere putting that in.\n  Second, there has been a lot of discussion here about: OK, we have to \nget this person confirmed. We have to get him out, and it is a terrible \nshame it has not taken place to date.\n\n[[Page S4482]]\n\n  I agree we need an ambassador to Iraq. There is no question about \nthat. I appreciate my colleagues' concern about getting an ambassador \nto Iraq. I would note, there is one who does not have the controversy \nthis one has who was offered the post initially, who accepted it, and \nthen somehow this was mysteriously withdrawn. So there was a person we \ncould have gone forward with, who had accepted it, and for some reason \nit was pulled back.\n  Yesterday, CNN was talking to General Zinni, retired General Zinni, \nand I wish to quote from this report from yesterday.\n\n       Zinni told CNN Monday he hasn't been given any explanation \n     about why the offer he got in January for the post--\n\n  This is U.S. Ambassador to Iraq--\n\n     which he accepted was abruptly taken back. Zinni confirmed in \n     an e-mail that he was asked to take the job by Secretary of \n     State Hillary Clinton, and even congratulated by Vice \n     President Joe Biden, but then the offer was revoked and \n     extended to Hill, a development Zinni says he heard on the \n     news. Zinni is a retired four-star Marine general and former \n     head of Central Command. Like President Barack Obama, he was \n     an early critic of the Iraqi war.\n\n  He would seem like a likely--logical, actually--pick for our \nAmbassador to Iraq, putting forward somebody whom I could have seen \nsupporting. He is knowledgeable of the region and not with a history of \ndeception toward this body or of problems dealing with human rights \nissues.\n  To my colleagues who put forward: We have to get this done, it is a \nterrible tragedy you are holding this up, well, why didn't you nominate \nsomebody such as Retired General Zinni, or why did you pick him and \nthen pull him back? That might be a more interesting note to find out. \nIt would be interesting to me, anyway and, I would hope, to a number of \nother people.\n  The reason I have trouble with this nominee is because of this \nnominee's past performance, lack of concern on human rights, and then \nwe are giving him this great, huge assignment for the United States, \nand I don't agree with that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  There has also been a charge that Ambassador Hill simply didn't raise \nthe human rights issues because the Bush administration wouldn't let \nhim do this and that you needed to look up the ladder, not at \nAmbassador Hill on this. I can tell my colleagues from my personal \nconversations with President Bush, he was deeply concerned about human \nrights. He loathed Kim Jong-Il because of the human rights issues more \nthan any other. Those were his statements. I personally had two direct \nconversations at length with the President about this.\n  The idea that somehow Chris Hill couldn't do this because the \nPresident and his apparatus wouldn't agree to it raises some major \nquestions about that charge because it certainly wasn't the President \nwho was saying anything such as that. I think that one is patently \nfalse on its face.\n  There is also this unfortunate history that Chris Hill has of \ndiminishing and playing down human rights issues. There are human \nrights issues in Iraq as well, and there are going to be as we go \nforward in that region. To have somebody who consistently has played \nthese down, ignored them, papered them over, that raises real questions \nto me.\n  To support that, I wish to put forward as well some thoughts from \nothers of my colleagues who are concerned about human rights. I have \ncited my own discussion with him. I have cited previously, but I think \nthis bears putting forward to my colleagues again, Jay Lefkowitz was \nour North Korean Human Rights Special Envoy, who was appointed pursuant \nto the North Korean Human Rights Act that this body passed and the \nPresident signed, and Jay Lefkowitz wrote to me:\n\n       At no point during my tenure as special envoy for human \n     rights in North Korea, either before or after July 31, 2008, \n     did Chris Hill or anyone acting on his behalf invite me to \n     participate in any six party talks; any, none, not at all. \n     Jay.\n\n  This is after Chris Hill had stated in open testimony before the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, when I was asking him:\n\n       Will you state that the special envoy will be invited to \n     all future negotiating sessions with North Korea?\n\n  Ambassador Hill responds:\n\n       I would be happy to invite him to all future negotiating \n     sessions with North Korea.\n\n  This is on the Record. This is Jay Lefkowitz' statement afterward.\n  I ask unanimous consent that both of those be printed in the Record \nafter my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibits 3 and 4.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, a number of my colleagues will know \nCongressman Frank Wolf from the House side as a wonderful human rights \nadvocate and has been for a number of years. He is deeply concerned \nabout human rights issues overall. He has worked these issues for a \nlong period of time. He is a fabulous man on these topics. He wrote \nAmbassador Hill on February 5, 2009, this to Ambassador Hill on his \nnomination to go into Iraq:\n\n       While I do not question your qualifications as a diplomat, \n     I must be frank in telling you that I was often disappointed \n     in your approach to diplomacy with North Korea; specifically, \n     your marginalization and oftentimes seeming utter neglect of \n     human rights.\n       In a Washington Post piece Michael Gerson described your \n     shaping of America's North Korea policy in this way--\n\n  Now, Michael Gerson was on the inside of the Bush White House and \ncites to Ambassador Hill as shaping United States-North Korea policy, \nand Michael Gerson writes this:\n\n       Hill has been a tireless advocate of preemptive diplomatic \n     concessions--\n\n  preemptive diplomatic concessions--\n\n     and the exclusion of human rights issues from reports and \n     negotiations.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from Gerson.\n\n       It is difficult to know how much the policy you were \n     pursuing simply reflected the President and the Secretary's \n     aims or whether you were in fact the chief architect and \n     advocate of this approach. Regardless, while Iraq and North \n     Korea are obviously two very different countries, it gives me \n     pause as I consider the human rights challenges confronting \n     Iraq's ethno-religious minorities who are increasingly under \n     siege.\n\n  This is taking place in Iraq today. We have all these human rights \nabuses that are boiling in Iraq today, and now we want to send a guy \nwho has a highly questionable record on human rights in his last \nassignment.\n  Frank Wolf goes on:\n\n       More than 500,000 Christians, or roughly 50 percent, have \n     fled Iraq since 2003. Even though Christians make up only 3 \n     percent of the country's population, according to the U.N. \n     High Commission for Refugees, they comprise nearly half of \n     all refugees leaving Iraq. As Iraq has continued to \n     stabilize, these minority populations, including the aging \n     Christian community--some of whom still speak Aramaic--is \n     dwindling and increasingly vulnerable to marginalization and \n     increasing attacks, of the sort we witnessed in Mosul this \n     past fall.\n\n  This is from Congressman Frank Wolf.\n  We have a history of bad human rights in dealing with North Korea and \nwe have a bubbling problem, a current problem in Iraq, and we send \nChris Hill who has had big difficulty in dealing with it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record at the end \nof my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 5.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Finally, in this tranche, there was a letter sent--\nthis is on January 28 of 2005 and it was to the Permanent \nRepresentative of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the \nU.N., our contact point with North Korea diplomatically. It was \naddressed to Ambassador Pak. It states:\n\n       This letter is to inform you and your government of the \n     distress with which the undersigned Members of the \n     Illinois Congressional Delegation received the finding \n     from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office on \n     December 14, 2004 that South Korean citizen and U.S. \n     permanent resident Reverend Kim Dong-Shik had been \n     abducted by agents of your government in northeast China \n     in January of 2000 and taken forcibly into North Korea. \n     Your government regrettably has, by its own admission, \n     been involved in the abduction of a number of Japanese \n     citizens as well as an even greater number of South Korean \n     citizens.\n       Reverend Kim Dong-Shik, as you may be aware, is the spouse \n     of Mrs. Young Hwa Kim\n\n[[Page S4483]]\n\n     of Chicago, Illinois, and is the parent of U.S. citizens, one \n     of whom is currently residing in Skokie, Illinois. Citizens \n     from a Korean-American church in the Chicago area have also \n     raised this matter as an issue of grave concern and requested \n     congressional assistance in ascertaining the facts behind the \n     disappearance and current whereabouts of Reverend Kim. In \n     pursuant of these issues, Mrs. Kim and a delegation from \n     Illinois will be visiting Capitol Hill in the near future.\n       The successful resolution of this case, therefore, is of \n     critical importance to us--\n\n  This is the Illinois delegation--\n\n     both because of the constituent interest involved as well as \n     because it is a case involving the most fundamental of human \n     rights. Reverend Kim, in his selfless efforts to assist \n     refugees escaping in an underground network to third \n     countries, brings to mind two great heroes held in high \n     esteem in the United States. The first is Ms. Harriet Tubman, \n     who established an underground railroad allowing for the \n     escape from slavery of those held in bondage before President \n     Lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation, the second is \n     the Swedish diplomat Raoul Wallenberg who, during the dark \n     days of the world conflict against fascism in the Second \n     World War, rescued Jewish refugees trapped in Hungary. We \n     view Reverend Kim Dong-Shik as also being a hero who assisted \n     with the escape of the powerless and forgotten.\n       We, therefore, wish to inform the Government of the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea that we will not \n     support the removal of your government from the State \n     Department's list of State sponsors of terrorism until such \n     time, among other reasons, as a full accounting is provided \n     to the Kim family regarding the fate of Reverend Kim Dong-\n     Shik following his abduction into North Korea five years ago.\n\n  This is signed by U.S. Senators Richard J. Durbin and Barack Obama. \nThey signed this letter to our permanent representative, the permanent \nrepresentative of North Korea to the U.N. on January 28 of 2005.\n  Well, those sanctions are now lifted. The guy who pushed for the \nlifting of them is now being pushed to be the Ambassador to Iraq, and \nRev. Kim Dong-Shik--it is still not known where he is. He is still \nsomewhere abducted, hopefully alive--we don't know--in North Korea.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 6.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. When people say this is being held up and it is \nirresponsible and you shouldn't do this, I am just quoting a number of \nMembers of Congress. I am just quoting the President. I am just \npointing to a human rights situation that our Ambassador to Iraq will \ngo into, and saying, isn't this reason enough to go with somebody such \nas General Zinni instead of Ambassador Hill in this situation?\n  Also, we haven't been able to get information from the State \nDepartment. I had asked for the instructions they had given to \nAmbassador Hill. He had stated in committee testimony here that at one \npoint in time he called it ``inaudible'' in the negotiations, and in \nthat ``inaudible'' he made a change. We wanted to find out what State \nDepartment instructions were to him, or what they were to him on human \nrights issues, and that hasn't been received by my office. We haven't \nbeen able to get those back.\n  A number of my colleagues don't remember, or they don't cite to the \nperiod of time that Ambassador Hill was working on the Korean desk, but \nthey do cite to what he did in Bosnia and say, OK, he was a successful \ndiplomat, he did this; North Korea is tough, we are going to ignore \nthat; and now let's put him in Iraq. Well, there are some real \nquestionable records of what he did in the situation in the Balkans and \nin Bosnia. Here I have an article, dated March 22, of this year. I \nthink it is very interesting and quite troubling. This is about one of \nthe people who is charged with war crimes and his dealings with \nAmbassador Hill. I am going to quote from this article and enter it \ninto the Record.\n\n       Every time Radovan Karadzic, the onetime Bosnian Serb \n     leader, appears in court on war crimes charges, he has \n     hammered on one recurring claim: a senior American official \n     pledged that he would never be standing there being charged \n     with war crimes.\n       The official, Richard C. Holbrooke, now a special envoy on \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan for the Obama administration, has \n     repeatedly denied promising Mr. Karadzic immunity from \n     prosecution in exchange for abandoning power after the \n     Bosnian war.\n       But the rumor persists, and different versions that \n     recently emerged that line up with Mr. Karadzic's assertion, \n     including a new historical study published by Purdue \n     University in Indiana.\n       Charles W. Ingrao, the study's co-editor, said that three \n     senior State Department officials, one of them retired, and \n     several other people with knowledge of Mr. Holbrooke's \n     activities, told him that Mr. Holbrooke assured Mr. Karadzic \n     in July 1996 that he would not be pursued by the \n     international war crimes tribunal in The Hague if he left \n     politics.\n       Mr. Karadzic had already been charged by the tribunal with \n     genocide and other crimes against civilians.\n\n  Now, you say, OK, that is charging Mr. Holbrooke, but let's see what \nthe report writers go on to say about this.\n\n       The Purdue University study, ``Confronting the Yugoslav \n     Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative'', instructed his \n     principal assistant, Christopher Hill, to draft the \n     memorandum to be signed by Karadzic, committing him to give \n     up power--\n\n  in exchange for not being charged with war crimes.\n  The author of the study said Mr. Holbrooke used Slobodan Milosevic, \nthe then Serbian leader, and other Serbian officials as intermediaries \nto convey the promise of immunity and to reach the deal with Mr. \nKaradzic. ``The agreement almost came to grief when Holbrooke \nvigorously refused Karadzic's demand, and Hill's appeal, that he affix \nhis signature to it,'' the study says, citing unidentified State \nDepartment sources.\n  Chris Hill's name again.\n  The study, the product of 8 years of research by historians, jurists, \nand social scientists from all sides of the conflict, was an effort to \nreconcile disparate views of the wars that tore the former Yugoslavia \napart in the 1990s, Mr. Ingrao said.\n  The former official said Mr. Karadzic wanted written assurance that \nhe would not be pursued for war crimes and refused to sign without \nthem.\n  ``Holbrooke told the Serbs, `You can give him my word he won't be \npursued,' but Holbrooke refused to sign anything,'' the official said. \nMr. Holbrooke could make that promise because he knew that American and \nother western militaries in Bosnia were not then making arrests, the \nofficial said.\n  Neither Mr. Hill nor Mr. Goldberg responded to requests for \ninterviews for this article.\n  Here is another insertion of Mr. Hill on a huge problem with human \nrights. This one in the Yugoslav, the Balkans theater. There it is \nagain--North Korea, the Balkans, and we have a brewing situation taking \nplace in Iraq, and we are going to send him there.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this article be printed in the Record at \nthe end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 7.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I am doing that so my colleagues and \nothers who study this can look at the factual studies we have in \nexamining what is taking place here.\n  A number of my colleagues say the North Korean situation is not \nrelevant to the debate we are in today. I don't know why it is not. \nWhen we run for office, people go look at our backgrounds and say what \ndid they do in their past job to see if we ought to elect them for this \none. People don't kind of walk into the Senate. There is an examination \nprocess that the public goes through. I don't know why we would not \nwant to examine somebody to see their track record.\n  Some have suggested that the human rights issue kind of popped up in \nNorth Korea, and that we learned at the last minute, so that Chris Hill \nhad to deal with this at a quick point so he should have had set it \naside to get the full deal.\n  This is a February 4, 2004 article on washingtonpost.com. This is \nwritten by Anne Apolebaum. The title is ``Auschwitz Under Our Noses.''\n  As I stated, it is Holocaust Remembrance Day today. This article \ntalks about North Korea and what is taking place there in 2004. So this \ndidn't just pop up. There had been a documentary put forward by the BBC \ndescribing the atrocities in North Korea. I will read one section that \nis incredible. It says this:\n\n       Look, for example, at the international reaction to a \n     documentary, aired last Sunday night on the BBC. It described \n     atrocities committed in the concentration camps of \n     contemporary North Korea, where, it was alleged, chemical \n     weapons are tested on prisoners. Central to the film was the \n     testimony of Kwon Hyuk, a former administrator at a North \n     Korean camp.\n\n\n[[Page S4484]]\n\n\n  This is what the administrator said:\n\n       I witnessed a whole family being tested on suffocating gas \n     and dying in the gas chamber.\n\n  He witnessed that.\n  He said:\n\n       The parents, son, and a daughter. The parents were vomiting \n     and dying, but till the very last moment they tried to save \n     the kids by doing mouth-to-mouth breathing.\n\n  The article goes on:\n\n       The documentary also included testimony from a former \n     prisoner, who says she saw 50 women die after being \n     deliberately fed poison. And it included documents smuggled \n     out of the country that seemed to sentence a prisoner to a \n     camp ``for the purpose of human experimentation.''\n\n  The author writes this at the end, and this is the whole point of \nthis:\n\n       Later--in 10 years, or in 60--it will surely turn out that \n     quite a lot was known in 2004 about the camps of North Korea. \n     It will turn out that information collected by various human \n     rights groups, South Korean churches, oddball journalists, \n     and spies added up to a damning and largely accurate picture \n     of an evil regime. It will also turn out that there were \n     things that could have been done, approaches the South Korean \n     government might have made, diplomatic channels the U.S. \n     Government might have opened, pressure the Chinese might have \n     applied.\n       Historians in Asia, Europe, and here will finger various \n     institutions, just as we do now, and demand they justify \n     their past actions. And no one will be able to understand how \n     it was possible that we knew of the existence of the gas \n     chambers but failed to act.\n\n  That is what I am asking. My goodness. This has been going on, and I \ntried to push Chris Hill about it for years and nothing happened, and I \ngot an agreement in open testimony in a hearing, and nothing happened \nafter that. But now let's move him to Iraq and give him that account.\n  I ask unanimous consent this article be printed in the Record after \nmy statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 8.)\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a procedural question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask my colleague, if he has a moment, to see whether we \ncan set a time for the vote with respect to this issue.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If I may respond through the Chair, I have contacted \ncolleagues. We are still confirming at what time they can speak. \nSeveral colleagues want to speak. We are working on that right now.\n  Mr. KERRY. Does the Senator have a sense of when we could try to come \nto some arrangement? A lot of Senators on both sides of the aisle are \ntrying to arrange schedules, and the majority leader is trying to deal \nwith the question of the legislative schedule. If we can get a sense of \nthat--I know the Senator is trying to get at it. I think if we could \npin this down, that would be helpful. If he could give me a sense of \nhow many Senators, when, and if we will lock in their times and then \nlock in a vote.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am contacting colleagues now. We don't have that \nofficially tied down yet so that I can respond at this time. I \nappreciate my colleague from Massachusetts saying that, as I \nunderstand, there will be a hearing on North Korean--not necessarily on \nthe atrocities, although I hope it will be covered, but also on \npossible sanctions on North Korea. I appreciate that is being worked on \nto address some of these concerns. I will be raising, as well--while my \ncolleague is here--that we not put in a supplemental bill support for \nthe North Korean regime that is beyond humanitarian aid, particularly \nas these things are surfacing now. I realize that is not the Senator's \ncommittee, but I want to make my colleagues, who know the situation \nwell, aware of these points that I will be raising.\n  Mr. KERRY. Let me say that every one of us shares the outrage at the \ntype of government and the way in which the people of North Korea are \noppressed. I commend the Senator from Kansas for calling the country's \nattention and the world's attention and the Senate's at this moment to \nit. We will have a hearing on May 6. It will be a comprehensive hearing \non North Korea. It will involve all of the issues with respect to North \nKorea. We welcome that. That is an appropriate role for us.\n  But it is also appropriate for us to try to get this nominee a time \ncertain. He would like to leave for Iraq tomorrow. So we wish, if we \ncan, to have a sense of the timing on the vote. If we can get an \nagreement here, maybe I could--how many Senators are planning to speak \non the Senator's side of the aisle?\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we have three who are lined up to \nspeak. There are Senators McCain and Kyl, who have scheduling issues \nlater in the day. That is what I am trying to get firmed up. I am not \ntrying to delay my colleagues.\n  Mr. KERRY. I understood that Senator McCain was going to try to speak \nat 3:30, which is about 35 minutes from now. We are prepared not to \nhave any further speakers on our side.\n  I will propound a request. I ask unanimous consent that we allow the \nSenator from Kansas to control the time, but for, say, 10 minutes \nbetween now and the hour of 5 o'clock, and that the vote be at 5 \no'clock. I ask for an order to that effect.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have to object at this time. I simply \ndon't know when Senator Kyl can speak, and he desires to speak. Until I \ncan determine that, I cannot agree for others of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. KERRY. I respect that, but I also know how the Senate works; I \nhave 26 years here. I will come back. I have a meeting going on now, \nbut I will be back in about 20 minutes. I hope we can find Senator Kyl \nbetween now and then, pin down the time for him, and get an agreement. \nI think it is important for the Senate to get its business done. Is \nthat agreeable to the Senator from Kansas?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. If we can locate him and if there are not others.\n  Mr. KERRY. If we cannot contact a member of the Senate who is in the \nleadership--surely we can find one of the leaders of the Senate in 20 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I have said what I know.\n  Mr. KERRY. I will be back at a quarter after, and I hope we can \npropound an agreement at that time. I thank the Senator for the \ninterruption.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to speak about another issue, \nbecause this caught a lot of what is involved here. This is a 2004 \narticle called ``An Auschwitz in Korea.'' I had hoped my colleague \ncould stay and hear this, but he has to leave.\n  This is to the point raised by a number of people that this was kind \nof quick and the problem with human rights was not known as an issue in \nNorth Korea, and that we don't know about it. Chris Hill steps in and \nhe has to make the call that we are not going to pursue human rights, \nbut we are going to go completely after the nuclear issue.\n  This article is by Jeff Jacoby from the Boston Globe. He puts it so \nwell, because it is to the point we have here. He writes this:\n\n       Does ``never again'' simply mean ``never again will Germans \n     kill Jews in Europe between 1939 and 1945?''\n\n  Is that what ``never again'' means? Obviously, that is not the case. \nWe are not going to let this sort of thing happen again on Holocaust \nRemembrance Day.\n  That brings us to North Korea. In 2004, this author writes this. This \nwas in the press:\n\n       It is not exactly news that the Communist regime of Kim \n     Jong Il has sent millions of North Koreans to early graves. \n     Estimates back to 1998 were that as many as 800,000 people \n     were dying in North Korea each year from starvation and \n     malnutrition caused by Kim's ruthless and irrational \n     policies. World Vision, a Christian relief organization, \n     calculated that 1 million to 2 million North Koreans had been \n     killed by ``a full-scale famine'' largely of Pyongyang's \n     creation.\n\n  They created the famine and people die off who don't support the \nregime. We have heard about that system before, and some of the purges \nthat took place in the Soviet Union.\n  The article also says:\n\n       Nor is it breaking news that North Korea operates a vicious \n     prison gulag--``not unlike the worst labor camps built by Mao \n     and Stalin in the last century,'' as NBC News reported more \n     than a year ago. Some 200,000 men, women, and children are \n     held in these slave-labor camps; hundreds of thousands of \n     others have perished in them over the years. Some of the \n     camps are so hellish that 20 percent or more of their \n     prisoners die from torture and abuse each year. The dead can \n     be of any age: North Korea's longstanding policy is to \n     imprison not only those accused of such ``crimes'' as \n     practicing Christianity [one of\n\n[[Page S4485]]\n\n     the major crimes] or complaining about North Korean life, but \n     their entire families, including grandparents and \n     grandchildren. The policy there is if one member of the \n     family complains, 3 generations are taken. This is the way \n     they then operate these prison camps.\n\n  I want to show a picture of one of the prison camps that looks \norganized along the lines that Auschwitz was organized. This is taken \nby Google Earth. They are organized like the Auschwitz ones. The \ndifference here is that they group you by families, so they have taken \nthree generations when one is opposed. They organize this and it is a \ndeath camp. Kwon Hyuk was quoted, saying:\n\n       I witnessed a whole family being tested on suffocating gas \n     and dying in the gas chamber.\n\n  The article says:\n\n       The speaker is Kwon Hyuk, a former North Korean \n     intelligence agent and a one-time administrator at Camp 22, \n     the country's largest concentration camp.\n\n  We have a picture of camp 22. I will show you what he is talking \nabout here. It is the largest camp. The testimony was heard on a \ntelevision documentary that aired on BBC, which I mentioned.\n  Here we have a situation--this writer is writing--of ``Gas chambers. \nPoisoned food. Torture. The murder of whole families. Massive death \ntolls. How much more do we need to know about North Korea's crimes \nbefore we act to stop them? How many more victims will be fed into the \ngas chambers before we cry out, `never again!' ''--and we mean it?''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis article titled ``An Auschwitz in Korea.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From boston.com, Feb. 8, 2004]\n\n                         An Auschwitz in Korea\n\n                            (By Jeff Jacoby)\n\n       TWO WORDS--``never again''--sum up the most important \n     lesson that civilized men and women were supposed to have \n     learned from the 20th century. It is forbidden to keep \n     silent, forbidden to look the other way, when tyrants embark \n     on genocide and slaughter--if Auschwitz and Kolyma and the \n     Cambodian killing fields taught us nothing else, they taught \n     us that.\n       Or so, at any rate, we like to tell ourselves. As Samantha \n     Power discovered upon returning to the United States after \n     two years as a war correspondent in Bosnia, the lesson of \n     ``never again'' is invoked far more often than it is applied.\n       ``Everywhere I went,'' Power recalled in a speech at \n     Swarthmore College in 2002, ``I heard `never again.' Steven \n     Spielberg's `Schindler's List' had been a smash hit. The \n     Holocaust Museum had opened on the Mall in Washington. \n     College seminars were taught on the `lessons' of the singular \n     crime of the 20th century. But why, I wondered, had nobody \n     applied those lessons to the atrocities of the 1990s: the \n     systematic murder of 200,000 Bosnian civilians in Europe \n     between 1992 and 1995 and the extermination of some 800,000 \n     Rwandan Tutsi in 1994.\n       ``Did `never again' simply mean `never again will Germans \n     kill Jews in Europe between 1939 and 1945?' ''\n       Power went on to write ``A Problem From Hell,'' her \n     Pulitzer Prize-winning account of America's failure to \n     intervene in the genocides of the 20th century. The book was \n     hugely and deservedly praised. It made clear, as no book had \n     before, how much Americans knew about some of the most \n     horrific massacres of the last century even as they were \n     happening, and how little we did to stop them--or even, in \n     most cases, condemn them.\n       Which brings us to North Korea.\n       It is not exactly news that the communist regime of Kim \n     Jong II has sent millions of North Koreans to early graves. \n     Estimates back in 1998 were that as many as 800,000 people \n     were dying in North Korea each year from starvation and \n     malnutrition caused by Kim's ruthless and irrational \n     policies. World Vision, a Christian relief organization, \n     calculated that 1 million to 2 million North Koreans had been \n     killed by ``a full-scale famine'' largely of Pyongyang's \n     creation.\n       Nor is it breaking news that North Korea operates a vicious \n     prison gulag--``not unlike the worst labor camps built by Mao \n     and Stalin in the last century,'' as NBC News reported more \n     than a year ago. Some 200,000 men, women, and children are \n     held in these slave-labor camps; hundreds of thousands of \n     others have perished in them over the years. Some of the \n     camps are so hellish that 20 percent or more of their \n     prisoners die from torture and abuse each year. The dead can \n     be of any age: North Korea's longstanding policy is to \n     imprison not only those accused of such ``crimes'' as \n     practicing Christianity or complaining about North Korean \n     life, but their entire families, including grandparents and \n     grandchildren.\n       And, of course, it is widely known that Kim is openly \n     pursuing nuclear weapons, has fired missiles capable of \n     reaching Japan, and controls one of the largest military \n     forces on earth.\n       All of this is hideous enough, and more than sufficient \n     reason for making Kim's ouster--and his prosecution for \n     crimes against humanity--an explicit goal of the United \n     States. But now comes something new.\n       ``I witnessed a whole family being tested on suffocating \n     gas and dying in the gas chamber. The parents, a son, and a \n     daughter.'' The speaker is Kwon Hyuk, a former North Korean \n     intelligence agent and a one-time administrator at Camp 22, \n     the country's largest concentration camp. His testimony was \n     heard on a television documentary that aired last week on the \n     BBC. ``The parents were vomiting and dying, but till the very \n     last moment they tried to save the kids by doing mouth-to-\n     mouth breathing.''\n       Like other communist officials, Kwon was not bothered by \n     what he saw. ``I felt that they thoroughly deserved such a \n     death. Because all of us were led to believe that all the bad \n     things that were happening to North Korea were their fault. . \n     . . Under the society and the regime I was in at the time, I \n     only felt that they were the enemies. So I felt no sympathy \n     or pity for them at all.''\n       Soon Ok-lee, who spent seven years in another North Korean \n     camp, described the use of prisoners as guinea pigs for \n     biochemical weapons.\n       ``An officer ordered me to select 50 healthy female \n     prisoners,'' she testified. ``One of the guards handed me a \n     basket full of soaked cabbage, told me not to eat it, but to \n     give it to the 50 women. I gave them out and heard a scream. \n     . . . They were all screaming and vomiting blood. All who ate \n     the cabbage leaves started violently vomiting blood and \n     screaming with pain. It was hell. In less than 20 minutes, \n     they were dead.''\n       Gas chambers. Poisoned food. Torture. The murder of whole \n     families. Massive death tolls. How much more do we need to \n     know about North Korea's crimes before we act to stop them? \n     How many more victims will be fed into the gas chambers \n     before we cry out ``never again!''--and mean it?\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, this is Camp 22. You can see it \noutlined, the size and scale. We have some other camp pictures that \nshow this. I want to make sure everybody knows that on Holocaust \nRemembrance Day we have pictures of this going on. This is not some \nsecret information. This is on Google Earth. Look it up yourself.\n  This picture is of outside the camp, the westbound coal train from \nCamp 22 where they do coal mining, slave labor where people go in, but \nnobody comes out. They are worked to death, starved to death.\n  There are a couple books on this point--``The Aquariums of \nPyongyang'' was written by a survivor and ``Eyes of Tailless Animals'' \nwas written by Soon Ok Lee. Those are a couple books people can look \nat.\n  This is another picture from Google Earth. These are people in the \nconcentration camp, this shows outside the fence. About 200,000 people \nwe believe are in concentration camps in North Korea. Here is another \npicture, one of a concentration camp. I urge my colleagues to get a \nbriefing on this situation so they can look at the high resolution \ninformation we have access to, not just Google Earth. Google Earth is \nuseful for this setting.\n  Here is another concentration camp. Here is the execution site in \nthis particular camp. These have all been run by refugees who have been \nable to make their way out and now give the information of here is what \ntook place in various places. Here are the coal mine entrances marked \nNo. 1; prisoner housing, No. 2; the execution site, No. 3; No. 4 is a \nrifle range. I don't know if they use individuals as target practice.\n  This picture shows the location of various prison camps of the gulag \nthat is in North Korea that we chose to ignore in our six-party talks. \nThese are the selected North Korean prison camp locations, where they \nare around the country. We know what is taking place in that country. I \nraise all of these points to point out that we cannot continue to allow \nthis to take place.\n  I want to raise one final issue. My colleagues have been very \ngenerous to allow me to put this forward. I have to do this on this \nday, Holocaust Remembrance Day, when we are about to confirm an \nambassador who looked past all of this while he was there.\n  We will soon consider the supplemental appropriations bill. That will \nbe coming up shortly before this body. Last year, this body inserted \ninto the supplemental appropriations bill a waiver to waive the Glenn \namendment sanctions against North Korea. The Glenn amendment sanctions \ndo not provide for a Presidential waiver. The Congress has to \naffirmatively act to waive Glenn amendment sanctions. The Congress did, \nand that allowed us to send--as the Soviet Union used to send to the \nNorth Koreans only we are sending it now. I ask my colleagues not to \nput in this year's supplemental Glenn amendment waivers and not to put \nin this year's supplemental funding for North Korea beyond humanitarian\n\n[[Page S4486]]\n\nassistance. Yes to humanitarian assistance because people are starving \nto death, but no to fuel, oil aid, no to other aid because they tested \nmissiles in defiance of us and the United Nations. They are being \ninvestigated now for sending nuclear material to Iran. They have \ncaptured two American journalists and still have them there. They have \nunaccounted for other people they have captured. They have this \nincredible human rights gulag system that is tragic and taking place \nright now. They are forcing people to walk into China, many of whom are \nwomen who walk into China to get food and are taken for human \ntrafficking and as concubines.\n  Let's not continue a regime that is a disaster, that is a horrific \nsituation, and we are allowing this to happen.\n  Let's not do that in the supplemental.

A 19-year-old prisoner \n     named Rudolf Vrba, together with fellow-inmate Alfred \n     Wetzler, decided to do something that almost nobody had ever \n     done before: escape from Auschwitz. They were determined to \n     alert the world about the doom that Hungarian Jews would soon \n     face.\n       On April 7, Vrba and Wetzler slipped away from their slave \n     labor battalion and hid in a hollowed-out woodpile near the \n     edge of the camp. On the advice of Soviet prisoners of war, \n     the fugitives sprinkled the area with tobacco and gasoline, \n     which confused the German dogs that were used to search for \n     them.\n       On their second day in the woodpile, Vrba and Wetzler heard \n     Allied warplanes overhead. ``They came closer and closer--\n     then bombs began to crunch not far away,'' Vrba later \n     recalled in his searing memoir I Cannot Forgive. ``Our pulses \n     quickened. Were they going to bomb the camp? Was the secret \n     out? . . . Was this the end of Auschwitz?''\n       THE ALLIED PLANES were actually bombing German oil \n     factories in and around the Auschwitz complex. The idea of \n     bombing the death camp had not yet been proposed to the \n     Allied leadership, and details such as the location of the \n     gas chambers and crematoria were not yet known to the Allied \n     war command. But that was about to change.\n       On April 10, in the dead of night, Vrba and Wetzler emerged \n     from the woodpile and began an 11-day, 80-mile trek to \n     Slovakia. There they met with Jewish leaders and dictated a \n     30-page report that came to be known as the ``Auschwitz \n     Protocols.'' It included details of the mass-murder process, \n     maps pinpointing the gas chambers and crematoria and warnings \n     of the impending slaughter of Hungary's Jews.\n       ``One million Hungarian [Jews] are going to die,'' Vrba \n     told them. ``Auschwitz is ready for them. But if you tell \n     them now, they will rebel. They will never go to the ovens.''\n       A COPY of the report was given to Rudolf Kastner, a \n     Budapest Jewish leader. Instead of publicizing the \n     information, Kastner negotiated a deal that involved bribing \n     the Germans to permit a train with 1,684 of his relatives, \n     friends and Hungarian Jewish leaders to leave the country. \n     Kastner's action became the centerpiece of a controversial \n     trial in Israel after the war.\n       Another copy of Vrba's Auschwitz Protocols was given to \n     Rabbi Michoel Dov Weissmandl, a rescue activist in \n     Bratislava, who then wrote the first known appeal for the use \n     of Allied air power to disrupt the mass murder. Weissmandl's \n     plea to the Allies to bomb the railroad lines between Hungary \n     and Auschwitz reached the Roosevelt administration in June.\n       Assistant secretary of war John McCloy responded that the \n     request was ``impracticable'' because it would require \n     ``diversion of considerable air support essential to the \n     success of our forces now engaged in decisive operations.'' \n     He also claimed the War Department's position was based on \n     ``a study'' of the issue. But no evidence of such a study has \n     ever been found by researchers. In reality, McCloy's position \n     was based on the War Department's standing policy that no \n     military resources should be allocated for ``rescuing victims \n     of enemy oppression.''\n       VRBA'S REPORT convinced the Jewish Agency leadership in \n     Palestine to change its position on bombing. Agency leaders \n     initially opposed bombing Auschwitz because they believed it \n     was a labor camp, not a death camp. But after receiving the \n     Auschwitz Protocols in June, agency officials lobbied \n     British, American and Soviet officials to bomb the camp or \n     the railways leading to it. Their requests were rebuffed.\n       Most important, a condensed version of the Auschwitz \n     Protocols reached the U.S. government's War Refugee Board in \n     June. It helped galvanize the board to mobilize international \n     pressure on Hungary to halt the deportations to Auschwitz. \n     Although that effort came too late for the more than 400,000 \n     Hungarian Jews who had been shipped to their doom, it did \n     spare the 200,000-plus who were still alive in Budapest.\n       The full version of the Vrba report was actually held up in \n     Switzerland for three months by U.S. diplomats who regarded \n     it as low priority. And when the report finally reached \n     Washington in October, the Office of War Information opposed \n     distributing it; OWI director Elmer Davis claimed the report \n     was actually part of a Nazi conspiracy to ``create contempt \n     for the [Jewish] inmates'' by showing that the Jews were not \n     resisting their killers.\n       Fortunately, Davis and his cockamamie theories were too \n     late to blunt the impact of the Auschwitz Protocols. The \n     Hungarian deportations had been stopped, and Rudolf Vrba and \n     Alfred Wetzler had played a significant role in bringing that \n     about.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n            Preference for Hill Over Zinni Remains a Mystery\n\n                             (By Dana Bash)\n\n       Washington (CNN)--Chris Hill is slowly overcoming GOP \n     opposition that has delayed his nomination as U.S. ambassador \n     to Iraq, but it's still unclear why the Obama administration \n     revoked the offer they gave to someone else first--General \n     Anthony Zinni.\n       Zinni told CNN Monday he hasn't been given any explanation \n     about why the offer he got in January for the post, which he \n     accepted, was abruptly taken back.\n       Zinni confirmed in an e-mail that he was asked to take the \n     job by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and even \n     congratulated by Vice President Joe Biden. But then, the \n     offer was revoked and extended to Hill--a development Zinni \n     says he heard on the news.\n       Zinni is a retired four-star Marine general and former head \n     of Central Command. Like President Barack Obama, he was an \n     early critic of the Iraq war.\n       Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CNN he would \n     have wholeheartedly supported Zinni for position because of \n     his knowledge of the region. Graham, along with Sens. John \n     McCain, R-Arizona, and Sam Brownback, R-Kansas, have led the \n     opposition to Hill, citing his ``controversial legacy'' as \n     point man in the six-nation talks aimed at dismantling North \n     Korea's nuclear program and his lack of experience in the \n     Middle East.\n       Graham, however, voted Monday to move Hill's nomination \n     forward, while McCain did not vote. Brownback voted against \n     Hill.\n       A State Department spokesman had no comment on Zinni.\n       A senior Democratic congressional source, who would not be \n     quoted speaking about private deliberations, called the \n     decision to nominate Hill over Zinni one of the ``great \n     mysteries'' of the early days of the Obama administration.\n\n                               Exhibit 3\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 25, 2009.\n     Mr. Jay P. Lefkowitz, P.C.,\n     Kirkland & Ellis LLP, Citigroup Center, New York, NY.\n       Dear Jay: Christopher Hill testified today before the \n     Senate Foreign Relations Committee. In response to a question \n     by Senator Lugar, he failed to specifically address whether \n     he invited you to participate in the Six Party Talks to \n     address North Korean human rights. As you recall, in his \n     testimony before the Senate Armed Service Committee on July \n     31, 2008, he promised to invite you to participate in all \n     future negotiation sessions, without qualifying the nature of \n     those sessions.\n       Based on my knowledge of the situation, I believe he \n     violated his commitment. Can you please respond to me as to \n     whether or not Christopher Hill or anyone acting on his \n     behalf invited you to the Six Party Talks subsequent to July \n     31, 2008?\n       I look forward to your swift reply, and appreciate your \n     cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Sam Brownback,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Senator Brownback: At no point during my tenure as \n     Special Envoy for Human Rights in North Korea, either before \n     or after July 31, 2008, did Chris Hill or anyone acting on \n     his behalf invite me to participate in any Six Party Talks.\n     Jay.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 4\n\n       Senator Brownback. I want to, because my time will be \n     narrow here: will you state that the Special Envoy will be \n     invited to all future negotiating sessions with North Korea?\n       Ambassador Hill. I would be happy to invite him to all \n     future negotiating sessions with North Korea.\n       Senator Brownback. Thank you.\n       Mr. Ambassador, you noted this earlier, that there are \n     political gulags and concentration camps in North Korea. Will \n     you state that any prospect of normalization with North Korea \n     is contingent upon the regime shutting down the political \n     gulags and concentration camps?\n       Ambassador Hill. I can say to you, Senator, that we will \n     definitely raise these issues as an element of the \n     normalization process. I'm not in a position at my level to \n     state to you today what the specific conditions of \n     normalization were, but they will be raised as part of that \n     and clearly, we will be looking for more satisfactory answers \n     on this.\n       Senator Brownback. Mr. Ambassador, the Illinois delegation \n     in total in a letter dated\n\n[[Page S4487]]\n\n     in 2005--noted the abduction of Reverend Kim Dong Shik, who's \n     a U.S. citizen, and his wife is an Illinois resident, \n     children U.S. citizens. I'm going to enter this letter in the \n     record. It's from the Illinois delegation. They have said \n     they would not support any normalization with North Korea \n     until his abduction is dealt with.\n       [The information referred to follows:]\n\n                               Exhibit 5\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 5, 2009.\n     Mr. Christopher R. Hill,\n     Assistant Secretary, Bureau of East Asian and Pacific \n         Affairs, Washington DC.\n       Dear Mr. Hill: I write in light of your nomination to serve \n     in the critical position of U.S. ambassador to Iraq.\n       While I do not question your qualifications as a diplomat, \n     I must be frank in telling you that I was often disappointed \n     in your approach to diplomacy with North Korea--specifically \n     your marginalization and often times seemingly utter neglect \n     of human rights. In a Washington Post piece, Michael Gerson \n     described your shaping of America's North Korea policy in \n     this way, ``Hill has been a tireless advocate of preemptive \n     diplomatic concessions and the exclusion of human rights \n     issues from reports and negotiations.'' It is difficult to \n     know how much the policy you pursued simply reflected the \n     president and the secretary's aims or whether you were in \n     fact the chief architect and advocate of this approach. \n     Regardless, while Iraq and North Korea are obviously two very \n     different countries, it gives me pause as I consider the \n     human rights challenges confronting Iraq's ethno-religious \n     minorities who are increasingly under siege.\n       More than 500,000 Christians, or roughly 50 percent, have \n     fled Iraq since 2003. Even though Christians make up only 3 \n     percent of the country's population, according to the UN High \n     Commission for Refugees, they comprise nearly half of all \n     refugees leaving Iraq. As Iraq has continued to stabilize, \n     these minority populations, including the ancient Christian \n     community--some of whom still speak Aramaic, the language of \n     Jesus--is dwindling and increasingly vulnerable to \n     marginalization and targeted attacks, of the sort we \n     witnessed in Mosul this past fall.\n       I have already requested that Secretary Clinton facilitate \n     the development of a comprehensive policy to address the \n     plight of these struggling minority communities, and, \n     consistent with the recommendations of the U.S. Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom, that she appoint a special \n     envoy for human rights in Iraq to our Embassy in Baghdad, \n     reporting directly to her.\n       Similarly, should you be confirmed, I urge that these \n     communities, which are foundational to a modern pluralistic \n     Iraq, not be neglected on your watch. Before departing for \n     Baghdad, it is critical that you meet with a coalition of \n     NGOs, consisting in part of members of the Iraqi diaspora, so \n     that they might brief you on the unique challenges \n     confronting these ancient faith communities and make \n     additional concrete policy recommendations for their \n     protection.\n       Best wishes.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Frank R. Wolf,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n                               Exhibit 6\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on International \n           Relations,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 28, 2005.\n     His Excellency Pak Gil Yon,\n     Ambassador, Permanent Representative of the Democratic \n         People's Republic of Korea to the United Nations, New \n         York, NY.\n       Dear Ambassador Pak: This letter is to inform you and your \n     government of the distress with which the undersigned Members \n     of the Illinois Congressional Delegation received the finding \n     from the Seoul Central District Prosecutor's Office on \n     December 14, 2004 that South Korean citizen and U.S. \n     permanent resident Reverend Kim Dong-Shik had been abducted \n     by agents of your government in northeast China in January \n     2000 and taken forcibly into North Korea. Your government, \n     regrettably, has, by its own admission, been involved in the \n     abductions of a number of Japanese citizens, as well as an \n     even greater number of South Korean citizens.\n       Reverend Kim Dong-Shilc, as you may be aware, is the spouse \n     of Mrs. Young Hwa Kim of Chicago, Illinois, and is the parent \n     of U.S. citizens, one of whom is currently residing in \n     Skokie, Illinois. Citizens from a Korean-American church in \n     the Chicago area have also raised this matter as an issue of \n     grave concern and have requested Congressional assistance in \n     ascertaining the facts behind the disappearance and current \n     whereabouts of Reverend Kim. In pursuit of these issues, Mrs. \n     Kim and a delegation from Illinois will be visiting Capitol \n     Hill in the near future.\n       The successful resolution of this case, therefore, is of \n     critical importance to us, both because of the constituent \n     interests involved as well as because it is a case involving \n     the most fundamental of human rights. Reverend Kim, in his \n     selfless efforts to assist refugees escaping in an \n     underground network to third countries, brings to mind two \n     great heroes held in high esteem in the United States. The \n     first is Ms. Harriet Tubman, who established an underground \n     railroad allowing for the escape from slavery of those held \n     in bondage before President Lincoln issued the Emancipation \n     Proclamation; the second is the Swedish diplomat Raoul \n     Wallenberg who, during the dark days of the world conflict \n     against fascism in the Second World War, rescued Jewish \n     refugees trapped in Hungary. We view Reverend Kim Dong-Shik \n     as also being a hero who assisted with the escape of the \n     powerless and forgotten.\n       We, therefore, wish to inform the Government of the \n     Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) that we will NOT \n     support the removal of your government from the State \n     Department list of State Sponsors of Terrorism until such \n     time, among other reasons, as a full accounting is provided \n     to the Kim family regarding the fate of the Reverend Kim \n     Dong-Shik following his abduction into North Korea five years \n     ago.\n           Sincerely,\n         J.

Holbrooke, now a special envoy on \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan for the Obama administration, has \n     repeatedly denied promising Mr. Karadzic immunity from \n     prosecution in exchange for abandoning power after the \n     Bosnian war.\n       But the rumor persists, and different versions have \n     recently emerged that line up with Mr. Karadzic's assertion, \n     including a new historical study of the Yugoslav wars \n     published by Purdue University in Indiana.\n       Charles W. Ingrao, the study's co-editor, said that three \n     senior State Department officials, one of them retired, and \n     several other people with knowledge of Mr. Holbrooke's \n     activities told him that Mr. Holbrooke assured Mr. Karadzic \n     in July 1996 that he would not be pursued by the \n     international war crimes tribunal in The Hague if he left \n     politics.\n       Mr. Karadzic had already been charged by the tribunal with \n     genocide and other crimes against civilians.\n       Two of the sources cited anonymously in the new study, a \n     former senior State Department official who spent almost a \n     decade in the Balkans and another American who was involved \n     with international peacekeeping there in the 1990s, provided \n     additional details in interviews with The New York Times, \n     speaking on condition that they not be further identified.\n       The former State Department official said he was told of \n     the offer by people who were close to Mr. Holbrooke's team at \n     the time. The other source said that Mr. Holbrooke personally \n     and emphatically told him about the deal on two occasions.\n       While the two men agreed, as one of them put it, that \n     ``Holbrooke did the right thing and got the job done,'' the \n     recurring story of the deal has dogged Mr. Holbrooke.\n       Last summer, after more than a decade on the run, Mr. \n     Karadzic was found living disguised in Belgrade, Serbia's \n     capital. He was arrested and sent to the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia in The Hague for \n     his trial, which is expected to start this year.\n       Asked for comment for this article, Mr. Holbrooke repeated \n     his denial in a written statement. ``No one in the U.S. \n     government ever promised anything, nor made a deal of any \n     sort with Karadzic,'' he said, noting that Mr. Karadzic \n     stepped down in the summer of 1996 under intense American \n     pressure.\n       ``The agreement almost came to grief when Holbrooke \n     vigorously refused Karadzic's demand, and Hill's appeal, that \n     he affix his signature to it,'' the study says, citing \n     unidentified State Department sources.\n       The study, the product of eight years of research by \n     historians, jurists and social scientists from all sides of \n     the conflict, was an effort to reconcile disparate views of \n     the wars that tore the former Yugoslavia apart in the 1990s, \n     Mr. Ingrao said.\n       Neither Mr. Hill nor Mr. Goldberg responded to requests for \n     interviews for this article.\n       In an interview, the former State Department official, who \n     had access to confidential reports and to members of the \n     Holbrooke team, said that during that evening in 1996,\n\n[[Page S4488]]\n\n     Mr. Milosevic and other Serbian officials were on the phone \n     with Mr. Karadzic, who was in Pale, Bosnia.\n       The former official said that Mr. Karadzic wanted written \n     assurances that he would not be pursued for war crimes and \n     refused to sign without them.\n       ``Holbrooke told the Serbs, `You can give him my word he \n     won't be pursued,' but Holbrooke refused to sign anything,'' \n     the official said. Mr. Holbrooke could make that promise \n     because he knew that American and other Western militaries in \n     Bosnia were not then making arrests, the official said.\n       There were some 60,000 American and NATO troops in Bosnia, \n     but the soldiers had no orders to arrest indicted Bosnians, \n     for fear of inciting local rebellion.\n       In the brief statement Mr. Karadzic eventually signed, he \n     agreed to withdraw ``from all political activities'' and to \n     step down from office. It carried the signatures of Mr. \n     Milosevic and four other Serbian leaders acting as witnesses \n     and guarantors. It did not include any Americans' names and \n     made no mention of immunity.\n       The American who was involved in peacekeeping insisted in \n     an interview that Mr. Holbrooke himself told him that he had \n     made a deal with Mr. Karadzic to get him to leave politics. \n     He recalled meeting Mr. Holbrooke in Sarajevo, Bosnia, on the \n     eve of Bosnian elections in November 2000, just after Mr. \n     Milosevic had finally been ousted from power in Serbia.\n       Mr. Holbrooke was worried about the outcome of the Bosnian \n     vote because he knew that Mr. Karadzic was still secretly \n     running his nationalist political party and picking \n     candidates, including mayors and police chiefs who had run \n     prison camps and organized massacres.\n       ``Holbrooke was angry; he was ranting,'' the American \n     recalled. He quoted Mr. Holbrooke as saying: ``That son of a \n     bitch Karadzic. I made a deal with him that if he'd pull out \n     of politics, we wouldn't go after him. He's broken that deal \n     and now we're going to get him.''\n       Mr. Karadzic's party won those elections in the Bosnian \n     Serb republic. Shortly afterward, he disappeared from public \n     view.\n       ``In subsequent meetings, as a private citizen, I \n     repeatedly urged officials in both the Clinton and Bush \n     administrations to capture Karadzic,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. \n     ``I am glad he has finally been brought to justice, even \n     though he uses his public platform to disseminate these \n     fabrications.''\n       Mr. Holbrooke declined to accept further questions and did \n     not address the specifics of the new accounts.\n       Mr. Karadzic, by insisting that he is exempt from legal \n     proceedings, has now forced the war crimes tribunal to deal \n     with his allegations, illustrating the difficulty of both \n     administering international justice and conducting diplomacy.\n       In December, tribunal judges ruled that even if a deal had \n     been made, it would have no bearing on a trial. They said no \n     immunity agreement would be valid before an international \n     tribunal in a case of genocide, war crimes or crimes against \n     humanity. Mr. Karadzic is charged with all three.\n       But Mr. Karadzic has appealed and filed motions demanding \n     that prosecutors disclose every scrap of confidential \n     evidence about negotiations with Mr. Holbrooke. He has asked \n     his lawyers to seek meetings with American diplomats.\n       His demands have led the court to write to the United \n     States government for clarification.\n       Peter Robinson, a lawyer for Mr. Karadzic, said that he had \n     received a promise from Washington that he could interview \n     Philip S. Goldberg, who was on the Holbrooke team meeting in \n     Belgrade the night the resignation was negotiated.\n       ``Goldberg took the notes at that meeting,'' Mr. Robinson \n     said. ``The U.S. government has agreed to search for the \n     notes and provide them if they find them.''\n       A State Department spokesman said that the government was \n     cooperating with the tribunal, but would provide no further \n     details.\n       Mr. Holbrooke, who brokered the peace agreement that ended \n     the Bosnian war in 1995, returned to Belgrade in 1996 to \n     press Mr. Karadzic to resign as president of the Bosnian Serb \n     republic. Mr. Holbrooke's memoirs recount a night of fierce \n     negotiation on July 18, 1996, but make no mention of any \n     pledge of immunity.\n       The Purdue University study, ``Confronting the Yugoslav \n     Controversies: A Scholars' Initiative,'' says that Mr. \n     Holbrooke ``instructed his principal assistant, Christopher \n     Hill, to draft the memorandum to be signed by Karadzic,'' \n     committing him to give up power.\n       Mr. Ingrao said Mr. Holbrooke used Slobodan Milosevic, then \n     the Serbian leader, and other Serbian officials as \n     intermediaries to convey the promise of immunity and to reach \n     the deal with Mr. Karadzic.\n\n                               Exhibit 8\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Feb. 4, 2004]\n\n                       Auschwitz Under Our Noses\n\n                          (By Anne Applebaum)\n\n       Nearly 60 years ago last week, Auschwitz was liberated. On \n     Jan. 27, 1945, four Russian soldiers rode into the camp. They \n     seemed ``wonderfully concrete and real,'' remembered Primo \n     Levi, one of the prisoners, ``perched on their enormous \n     horses, between the gray of the snow and the gray of the \n     sky.'' But they did not smile, nor did they greet the \n     starving men and women. Levi thought he knew why: They felt \n     ``the shame that a just man experiences at another man's \n     crime, the feeling of guilt that such a crime should exist.''\n       Nowadays, it seems impossible to understand why so few \n     people, at the time of the Auschwitz liberation, even knew \n     that the camp existed. It seems even harder to explain why \n     those who did know did nothing. In recent years a plethora of \n     respectable institutions--the Vatican, the U.S. government, \n     the international Jewish community, the Allied commanders--\n     have all been accused of ``allowing'' the Holocaust to occur, \n     through ignorance or ill will or fear, or simply because \n     there were other priorities, such as fighting the war.\n       We shake our heads self-righteously, certain that if we'd \n     been there, liberation would have come earlier--all the while \n     failing to see that the present is no different. Quite a lot \n     has changed in 60 years, but the ways in which information \n     about crimes against humanity can simultaneously be ``known'' \n     and not known hasn't changed at all. Nor have other interests \n     and other priorities ceased to distract people from the \n     feelings of shame and guilt they would certainly feel, if \n     only they focused on them.\n       Look, for example, at the international reaction to a \n     documentary, aired last Sunday night on the BBC. It described \n     atrocities committed in the concentration camps of \n     contemporary North Korea, where, it was alleged, chemical \n     weapons are tested on prisoners. Central to the film was the \n     testimony of Kwon Hyuk, a former administrator at a North \n     Korean camp. ``I witnessed a whole family being tested on \n     suffocating gas and dying in the gas chamber,'' he said. \n     ``The parents, son and a daughter. The parents were vomiting \n     and dying, but till the very last moment they tried to save \n     the kids by doing mouth-to-mouth breathing.'' The documentary \n     also included testimony from a former prisoner, who says she \n     saw 50 women die after being deliberately fed poison. And it \n     included documents smuggled out of the country that seemed to \n     sentence a prisoner to a camp ``for the purpose of human \n     experimentation.''\n       But the documentary was only a piece of journalism. Do we \n     really know that it is true? We don't. It was aired on the \n     BBC, after all, an organization whose journalistic standards \n     have recently been questioned. It was based on witness \n     testimony, which is notoriously unreliable. All kinds of \n     people might have had an interest in making the film more \n     sensational, including journalists (good for their careers) \n     or North Korean defectors (good for their cause).\n       The veracity of the information has been further undermined \n     by the absence of official confirmation. The South Korean \n     government, which believes that appeasement of the North will \n     lead to reunification, has already voiced skepticism about \n     the claims: ``We will need to investigate,'' a spokesman \n     said. The U.S. government has other business on the Korean \n     Peninsula too. On Monday Secretary of State Colin L. Powell \n     told a group of Post journalists that he feels optimistic \n     about the prospect of a new round of nuclear talks between \n     North Korea and its neighbors. He didn't mention the gas \n     chambers, even whether he's heard about them.\n       In the days since the documentary aired, few other news \n     organizations have picked up the story either. There are \n     other priorities: the president's budget, ricin in the Senate \n     office building, David Kay's testimony, a murder of a high \n     school student, Super Tuesday, Janet Jackson. With the \n     possible exception of the last, these are all genuinely \n     important subjects. They are issues people care deeply about. \n     North Korea is far away and, quite frankly, it doesn't seem \n     there's a lot we can do about it.\n       Later--in 10 years, or in 60--it will surely turn out that \n     quite a lot was known in 2004 about the camps of North Korea. \n     It will turn out that information collected by various human \n     rights groups, South Korean churches, oddball journalists and \n     spies added up to a damning and largely accurate picture of \n     an evil regime. It will also turn out that there were things \n     that could have been done, approaches the South Korean \n     government might have made, diplomatic channels the U.S. \n     government might have opened, pressure the Chinese might have \n     applied.\n       Historians in Asia, Europe and here will finger various \n     institutions, just as we do now, and demand they justify \n     their past actions. And no one will be able to understand how \n     it was possible that we knew of the existence of the gas \n     chambers but failed to act.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Kansas for \nmaking such a powerful, persuasive case for human rights and freedom in \nNorth Korea and around the world. I wish to change subjects slightly \nfor a few minutes and talk about some experiences over the last couple \nof weeks.\n\n\n                           Stop The Spending\n\n  Last Wednesday, tens of thousands of Americans celebrated tax day by \nspeaking out against the direction of this Federal Government. I \nattended three tea parties in South Carolina. What struck me the most \nwas how nonpartisan these events were. These were families, couples \nwith children, not\n\n[[Page S4489]]\n\nnecessarily Republicans or Democrats, but both were there. They did not \ncare about parties or candidates. They cared about their kids and the \ndebt we are saddling them with, with almost everything we do in \nWashington. They cited with their signs and their voices that every \nAmerican today has a $35,000 share in our national debt. That is just \ntoday, not counting what we have added. And it does not count the \nunfunded costs of Social Security and Medicare that we borrowed from \nour future.\n  The way we are spending up here, the per capita debt in our country \nwill soon exceed the per capita income. We are not just bankrupting our \ncountry, we are bankrupting generations of Americans not even born yet.\n  This is a moral issue. Every dollar spent represents another freedom \nseized, another constitutional principle ignored, another opportunity \nsquandered. The American people are tired of politicians--Republicans \nand Democrats--borrowing and spending money on programs we do not need, \nprograms they know will not work.\n  The message of the tea parties is clear: Stop growing Government and \nspending all our money, all our kids' money, all our grandkids' money.\n  But will we get the message? We keep hearing that we are in the \nmiddle of an economic crisis, but we are in the middle of a political \ncrisis. We hear a lot about corporate greed, but that pales in \ncomparison to the political greed of elected officials who continue to \nmake promises that we cannot pay for and borrowing the money to do it.\n  A poll conducted last week suggests that while a majority of American \npeople have a favorable view of these tea parties, only 13 percent of \nthe political class does. It is the same pattern over and over again on \nthe stimulus, on earmarks, on socialized and rationed health care, on \nthe proposed tax on electricity and energy. Americans disagree with \nWashington on these socialistic experiments, and our leaders act as if \nit is the American people who are the ones who are out of touch.\n  Indeed, no sooner had the protesters gone home than they learned that \ntheir preference for freedom, limited Government, and local control \nmarked them as potential terrorist threats, according to a report by \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  Americans have been misled and lied to by elected officials who \npromise the world while stealing our future. And they have had enough. \nTea parties are only the beginning. Americans have come to understand \nthat many of our problems are caused by more Government and that they \ncan only be solved by more freedom.\n  Think of the things that are categorized as crises today--a crisis in \neducation, a crisis in health care, a crisis in energy, our \ntransportation infrastructure, banking and finance, the auto industry. \nBut who has been running these services for the last several decades? \nWho has been running our education system? It has not been the free \nmarket. It has not been the free people. It has been Government, with \nthe price we are paying expanding faster than any other service. We \nspend more per capita than any other country in the world, yet \nconsistently we lose ground to other industrialized nations. We do not \nneed more Federal control, we need more freedom in education, more \nchoices, more competition, more technology, the kinds of things that \nGovernment and union control cannot provide in our education. It may be \na crisis, but it is not one caused by freedom, it is one caused by \npoliticians.\n  What about health care? We talk about the number of uninsured \nAmericans, but have we given freedom a chance? The rules and laws we \npass here make it virtually impossible for individuals to own and keep \ntheir own insurance policy. There are ways we can solve this problem, \nthere are ways we can get every American insured without spending one \nadditional dime of tax dollars. But instead, the movement in Washington \nis toward Government health care, socialized medicine, and we have made \na downpayment in our recent budget in that direction.\n  We have an energy crisis, but who has held back this country from \nexploring and developing our own energy reserves? It has not been the \nfree markets or the free people; it has been this Government. And under \nthe name of environmental protection, we have actually made the \nenvironment worse by blocking nuclear energy, blocking natural gas \ndevelopment, and not moving where other countries have toward cleaner \nenergy sources that are within our reach.\n  What about our transportation infrastructure? Who has been running \nthat? Increasingly, the Federal Government takes more and more gas tax \ndollars and instead of giving them back to States for their priorities, \nwe earmark it in every different direction. The last Secretary of \nTransportation basically said we cannot have a transportation program \nbecause it is all politically directed. That is political greed. That \nis not a fault of freedom.\n  What about banking and finance? The Government was going to help our \nfinancial system, so they made loans, not just to those too big to \nfail. If you talk to local bankers, the Federal Government essentially \nforced these banks to take this money, and now they will not let them \ngive it back. And they are now talking about converting these loans \ninto common stock so the Federal Government owns the banks. That is not \nfreedom. That is not the America we know. That is nationalization, that \nis socialization of a country.\n  Freedom has not failed in the financial markets. It has been this \nGovernment, our oversight, and the Government intermediaries of Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac that essentially packaged and brokered all of these \nso-called toxic assets.\n  Freedom has not failed. Has freedom failed in our auto industry? Of \ncourse not. The Government and the labor unions have been running the \nAmerican auto companies for years. Management has very little \ndiscretion. If you look at other auto companies that are free of \nGovernment control, free of the barnacles of unionization, we see these \ncompanies succeeding in the United States. You cannot bail them out \nwith more money; you have to bail them out with freedom.\n  Over the work period, I had a chance to visit Europe and the Middle \nEast. I had a chance to welcome the new Prime Minister, Benjamin \nNetanyahu, back to office. It was interesting to hear him talk. He is \nconcerned about the direction of our country moving toward a more \nsocialist direction, while he realized the opportunities in Israel were \nto move away from socialization to more free markets, more land reform \nthat allowed more property ownership, exactly the opposite of where we \nsee us going. He realized that in order to have a prosperous Israel and \na strong military and a bright future, he needed to move his country \nmore toward freedom.\n  I heard the same thing in Brussels from a lot of our European allies, \nstartled at the level of spending and debt the United States has taken \non, concerned that we have the ability to pay it back, concerned that \nour commitment to the military is falling off, concerned that America \nwill not be there as promised as part of a NATO partner sometime in the \nfuture.\n  But it was concern about our abandonment of free market principles, \nfree trade, the things that can make the world safe and prosperous, \nthat the United States seemed to be pulling back from those principles.\n  I just wanted to share a few thoughts today because as we talk about \nmore Government and more spending in almost every area of our lives, \nand we continue to blame our problems on freedom and capitalism--the \npeople who work hard and take personal responsibility--it seems we have \nit backwards from what actually made America great and exceptional and \nunique and prosperous and good.\n  I keep hearing our economic problems were caused by the free market. \nBut what free market? What have I talked about that has had a chance to \nwork as a free market? If you look at those areas where the Government \nhas not yet reached its tentacles in to regulate to the point of \nparalysis, look at our telecommunication system, which we are talking \nabout in committee as to how we can regulate it. The incredible \nexplosion of innovation and choice and competition--the cell phones, \nthe BlackBerrys, the fantastic ways we have to communicate all over the \nworld--could never have been created by a government system. It was \ncreated by free people and free markets, and that can work in every \narea, as it has before in America.\n\n[[Page S4490]]\n\n  Let's not blame this financial crisis and the housing problems on \nfreedom and free markets. The Government itself, through its public-\nprivate partnership of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, was the broker of \nthese deals--the middle man of toxic assets. No private company would \ntake the kind of risks that were taken unless they could first get \ncheap money, which the Federal Reserve provided, and then have a basic \ngovernment guarantee for these loans that they were making and \npackaging. The Government is in the middle of this crisis. It is \npolitical greed. It is not the fault of freedom.\n  This Congress and this Federal Government are really at a crossroads, \nand the American people are standing there with these tea parties \ntelling us: Don't give up on freedom. Government does not work. \nSocialism does not work. There is no example in history where it has. \nYet we contemplate every day another step closer to more Government \ncontrol. I am thankful the American people are standing up. They are \nalarmed at what we are doing. It has nothing to do with politics. It \nhas nothing to do with a political party. It has everything to do with \nwhat makes this country great and good. But we have abandoned it in \nCongress, and this crossroads at which we stand is the crossroads \nbetween freedom and socialism.\n  Some folks say you shouldn't use that term, ``socialism.'' But, \nfolks, when the Government basically controls or owns most aspects of \neconomic production, which is where we are headed today, we are talking \nabout socialism, and socialism that is to the left of where many \nEuropean countries are. We can stop it, but we have to stop it starting \ntoday, and that is why these tea parties are so important. I hope they \nwill shake up a few people here in both parties. I hope they will send \na message that this Government is for the people, and of the people, \nand by the people. If we don't get it right, if we don't listen to \nthem, these people can take it back, and I am thankful they are willing \nto stand up and express their voices. And I am very sorry anyone in \nthis administration or this Government would categorize them as a \nthreat in any way just because they are willing to speak out against \nwhat they know is wrong in Washington.\n  I encourage my colleagues, as we think about one spending program \nafter another, one Government takeover after another, that we not give \nup on freedom and that we listen to the American people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I came to speak in support of the \nnomination of Christopher Hill to be the Ambassador to Iraq, but I have \nheard my distinguished colleague from South Carolina speak, and I feel \ncompelled to say a few things in response.\n  It is easy to rail against the Government when you are part of it. It \nis easy to rail against the Government. But when we have a national \ndisaster, whether it be September 11 or hurricanes or floods or \ntornadoes, it is only the National Government that can come and help \nour fellow citizens. It is only the National Government that can come \nat the end of the day and create a common defense. It is only the \nNational Government that very often can stop us from economic collapse.\n  Now, I am for the free market as much as anyone else, but there is a \ndifference between a free market and a free-for-all market. What we saw \nover the last 8 years is regulators, who were supposed to act as the \ncops on the beat, ultimately allowing the private sector, particularly \nthose who are regulated industries, to regulate themselves. The \nconsequence of that is we have excess that now each and every American \nis paying for. Yet there are those who want to rail against that.\n  There are those who also rail about spending. I am with them. But the \ntime to have railed against that was in the last years that saw the \ndebt and the deficit dramatically grow. If President Obama did \nabsolutely nothing--nothing--he would have inherited a $1.3 trillion \ndeficit. So I think we need some intellectual honesty in this Chamber \nas we have our debates.\n  Mr. President, I want to now talk about the President's nomination of \nChristopher Hill to serve as our next Ambassador to Iraq. I support \nthat. It should be clear to all of us that the position of the \nAmbassador to Iraq is one of the most critical ambassadorial selections \nthat President Obama will make. We are at the beginning of a period of \ntransition in our relationship with Iraq. We are now working under a \nStatus of Forces Agreement. Our troops are winding down their combat \nrole and many will withdraw by June 30 of this year.\n  In his speech to the Marine Corps at Camp Lejeune at the end of \nFebruary, President Obama made his policy clear: by the 31st day of \nAugust of the year 2010, in accordance with the Status of Forces \nAgreement, the combat mission of U.S. troops in Iraq will come to an \nend. But even though the end of our combat mission in Iraq may now be \nin sight, we cannot forget that today we still have more than 140,000 \nU.S. troops there, and we have over 1,000 U.S. civilian employees from \nthe Department of State, from USAID, and many other departments and \nagencies who have been assigned to work at the Embassy in Baghdad under \nthe authority of our Chief of Mission.\n  We all look forward to the day when our combat mission in Iraq is \nended, our troops are returned home, and the Iraqis enjoy relative \npeace and security under the full protection of their own security \nforces. But that day has not yet come. We are at the beginning, not the \nend, of the transition in our role in Iraq. It is a time of uncertainty \nand risk, and that is why it is so urgent that the Ambassador's \nposition be filled without delay.\n  We hear the military counterparts constantly saying--General \nOdierno--where is my civilian counterpart? Where is the Ambassador?\n  Now, I certainly respect the decision of any colleague to closely \nscrutinize any of the President's appointments. This is a keystone \nposition at a critical juncture in our relationship with Iraq, and we \nneed to ensure the person leading our Embassy in Baghdad is and has in \nfull measure the background, skills, and pragmatism needed. I have \nscrutinized Ambassador Hill's qualifications and his testimony, both \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee, of which I am a member, and in \nresponding to questions for the record, and I am convinced that in \nnominating Ambassador Hill, President Obama has chosen exactly the \nright person to lead our Embassy in Baghdad at this point in time. I \nurge my colleagues to confirm his nomination without delay.\n  During his 32-year career in the Foreign Service, Ambassador Hill has \ndeveloped a well-earned reputation as a diplomatic trouble-shooter by \ntaking on a series of difficult assignments, including serving as an \nambassador in the Balkans, Special Envoy to Kosovo, Ambassador to \nPoland and South Korea, and most recently as Special Envoy to the six-\nparty talks involving North Korea's nuclear program. He was one of the \nState Department's top negotiators during the 1995 Dayton talks that \nended the war in Bosnia. He has never balked from taking on the most \ndifficult assignments and has a long list of honors and awards which \nstand as evidence of his accomplishments.\n  Now, one of the concerns raised by my colleague earlier was about \nAmbassador Hill's experience, or lack of experience, in the Middle \nEast. It should be noted that our three prior ambassadors in Baghdad--\nRyan Crocker, Zalmay Khalizad, and John Negroponte--the persons who \nknow best the experience needed to do the job--do not share this \nconcern. They have expressed their support for Ambassador Hill's \nconfirmation.\n  I am confident the experience Ambassador Hill has gained in other \nareas can be readily applied to the challenges he will face in Iraq. \nAmbassador Hill's experience in coordinating the multilateral \nnegotiations on North Korea's nuclear program will serve him well when \nhe seeks the support of Iraq's neighbors on nuclear issues. That \nexperience will also serve him well in working with Iraq's numerous \npolitical factions. Ambassador Hill's experience in the Balkans has \nprepared him to deal with sectarianism, border disputes, human rights, \nrefugees, developmental assistance, and postconflict normalization of \nrelations, all of which will be major issues in his portfolio in \nBaghdad.\n  Mr. President, I share the concerns expressed by my colleague about \nNorth\n\n[[Page S4491]]\n\nKorea's human rights record, and I agree completely with Ambassador \nHill's own assessment of that record of North Korea when he said it is \nabysmal. But as others have noted, Ambassador Hill's mission with \nregard to North Korea was set by his superiors in the Bush \nadministration, not by him. The primary objective was to push the North \nKoreans to end their nuclear weapons program and their nuclear \nproliferation activities. That was his mission, directed by the Bush \nadministration. That is the mission he undertook to accomplish.\n  I appreciate Ambassador Hill's continued willingness to take on these \ntough assignments. He is the right person to lead our Embassy in \nBaghdad at this time, and I urge his nomination be confirmed without \ndelay.\n  Finally, I too often hear on the other side of the aisle a very \nfamiliar refrain lately. It is no--no to just about everything we are \ntrying to do here. President Obama was elected with overwhelming \nsupport to try to move this country in a different direction, and what \nwe hear consistently on the other side of the aisle--using the \nprocedural mechanisms of the filibuster in this institution--is no and \nno and no. Then, while they hold up nominees, such as yesterday's \nnominees for Assistant Attorneys General--incredibly important to the \nAttorney General for law and order in this country--when we finally get \nto the vote, we see overwhelming bipartisan votes.\n  We have delayed it an inordinate amount of time instead of having \nthose people work for the security of the country, instead of being \nable to move this agenda forward, instead of having more time for the \nSenate to meet some of the Nation's critical challenges.\n  It is time to get over the noes and start saying yes to some of the \ncritical issues we need. The first yes should be today, with Ambassador \nHill. That will move our foreign policy agenda ahead in one of the most \ncritical parts of the world today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for a \nvery precise and important set of arguments about why we ought to \nproceed forward, and I appreciate his taking time to come to the Senate \nfloor to do that.\n  Momentarily, it is my hope we will be able to propound a unanimous \nconsent agreement. We are just waiting, I hope, for the word to come \nback from Senator Kyl shortly. I hope that can come very quickly so \nthere could be a vote around 5:15 on this nomination.\n  Let me just say a couple of words about a few of the things that have \nbeen said. Obviously, we hope to be able to divide up the remaining \ntime between us and then conclude the debate, but part of what the \nSenator from Kansas has said, both this morning and this afternoon, is \nthat the human rights envoy, then Jay Lefkowitz of the State \nDepartment, was not invited to take part in the six-party talks per an \nexchange that Senator Brownback had with Chris Hill--with Ambassador \nHill--before the Armed Services Committee.\n  Ambassador Hill has addressed this issue, I have addressed this issue \non a number of occasions, and we have really laid this out. The full \ntext of his remarks has been submitted for the Record. In a nutshell, \nlet me just state one last time for the record exactly what happened.\n  As Ambassador Hill made clear at the time, his promise to Senator \nBrownback applied to the future negotiating sessions, except those \nspecifically dealing with nuclear disarmament where the Human Rights \nAssistant Secretary had no portfolio whatsoever. To make it clear, the \nSenator from Kansas somehow believes that no matter what, Special Envoy \nLefkowitz should have been invited to that, but that was not a decision \nthat was up to Ambassador Hill. Let's be clear about this. That was not \nAmbassador Hill's decision to make.\n  The New York Times on January of 2008 reported that the decision \nabout who would attend the six-party talks and what issues would be \ndiscussed was made by Secretary Rice and the President. Here are the \nwords of Secretary Rice speaking about Human Rights Envoy Jay Lefkowitz \nas quoted by the New York Times on January 23, 2008. ``He,'' Lefkowitz, \n``doesn't work on the six-party talks.'' This is Secretary of State \nRice talking, rebuking her own Assistant Secretary.\n\n       He doesn't work on the six-party talks. He doesn't know \n     what's going on in the six-party talks and he certainly has \n     no say in what American policy will be in the six-party \n     talks.\n\n  That is exactly what Secretary Rice said. So the Senator may have a \nquarrel but it is not with Ambassador Hill. Secretary Rice was very \nexplicit in that rebuke. Quoting Secretary Rice, again from the New \nYork Times, this is what she said:\n\n       I know where the President stands, and I know where I \n     stand, and those are the people who speak for American \n     policy.\n\n  That is the level of the rebuke you are talking about here. It is \nalmost unprecedented, frankly. And here the Senator is, trying to carry \nwater for this rebuked Assistant Secretary who was inappropriately \nasserting himself at that time. But regardless of whether you think he \nshould have been there or should not have been there, it was not \nAmbassador Hill's decision to make. He took daily instructions from the \nPresident and from the Secretary of State, from the State Department. \nThat is what a good diplomat and negotiator at important talks like \nthat does and that is exactly what he did.\n  I ask unanimous consent the full text of the article in the New York \nTimes be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Jan. 23, 2008]\n\n      Rice Rebukes Bush Envoy Who Criticized Policy on North Korea\n\n                           (By Helene Cooper)\n\n       Washington.--Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, in a rare \n     public rebuke, has upbraided a White House envoy who \n     criticized United States diplomacy toward North Korea that is \n     aimed at coaxing the North Koreans to give up their nuclear \n     weapons.\n       Ms. Rice said the official, Jay Lefkowitz, President Bush's \n     special envoy on North Korean human rights, was not speaking \n     for the administration when he told an audience at the \n     American Enterprise Institute last week that the United \n     States ``should consider a new approach to North Korea'' \n     because the current approach was unlikely to resolve the \n     issue before the end of Mr. Bush's term in a year.\n       Speaking to reporters aboard her flight to Berlin on \n     Monday, Ms. Rice sharply disagreed, and said Mr. Lefkowitz \n     should stick to human rights and leave the talks over the \n     North's nuclear policy to her, Mr. Bush and the other nations \n     involved: Russia, China, Japan and South Korea.\n       ``He's the human rights envoy,'' Ms. Rice said. ``That's \n     what he knows. That's what he does. He doesn't work on the \n     six-party talks. He doesn't know what's going on in the six-\n     party talks and he certainly has no say in what American \n     policy will be in the six-party talks.''\n       Mr. Lefkowitz, reached at his office in New York, said he \n     and Ms. Rice spoke on Friday about the disagreement, and he \n     described their conversation as ``very amicable, substantive \n     and useful.''\n       ``I'm going to have a great deal more to say about \n     elevating the issue of human rights in North Korea, which is \n     clearly a priority for the president and Congress,'' he said.\n       The dispute comes at a time when nuclear talks have \n     stalled, with North Korea missing a year-end deadline to \n     disclose all of its nuclear programs. A debate within the \n     administration has fractured along familiar lines, with hard-\n     line national security hawks in Vice President Dick Cheney's \n     office and at the White House arguing for a more \n     confrontational approach with the North.\n       On the other side, Mr. Bush's lead North Korea nuclear \n     negotiator, Christopher R. Hill, backed by Ms. Rice, has \n     argued that the United States should continue a more \n     restrained approach, one that was widely credited with \n     bringing about an agreement last year intended to eventually \n     lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n       Ms. Rice said that Mr. Bush had ``spoken as to what our \n     policy is in the six-party talks.''\n       ``I know where the president stands,'' she added, ``and I \n     know where I stand, and those are the people who speak for \n     American policy.''\n\n  Mr. KERRY. The second thing alleged here is somehow Ambassador Hill \nfailed to implement the North Korean Human Rights Act. That is not \naccurate. Facts are facts. Facts, as has been said many times, are \nstubborn things. Consistent with the Human Rights Act, Ambassador Hill \nsecured the admission of the first North Korean refugees into the \nUnited States in 2006. He worked to ensure the safe passage to South \nKorea of asylum seekers from the North who had been detained in other \neast Asian\n\n[[Page S4492]]\n\ncountries. He backed increased funding of radio broadcasting by Radio \nFree Asia. During Ambassador Hill's tenure as Assistant Secretary of \nState for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, the State Department approved \nthe expenditure of $2 million of our taxpayer funds to sponsor the \nSeoul Summit on North Korean Human Rights in South Korea, in December \nof 2005. Ambassador Hill met regularly with North Korean refugees and \ndefectors who made it out of North Korea.\n  The record simply doesn't substantiate the notion that Chris Hill was \ninattentive to human rights. In the morning debate, the Senator from \nKansas showed a dramatic picture of starving North Korean children. \nNoting that today is Holocaust Remembrance Day, Senator Brownback said \nwe should not be indifferent to the suffering of North Korean people \nand we must not consider human rights inside North Korea to be a low \npriority. We all agree with the Senator. Of course we should not allow \nit to be a low priority.\n  He noted that unnamed ``U.S. diplomats'' had opposed decisive action \nto bomb the rail lines leading to Auschwitz during World War II and \nsaid the current situation with north Korea is ``eerily familiar.''\n  All of us should listen carefully to what the Senator has said about \nNorth Korea and its oppression. None of us should forget the lessons of \nthe Holocaust. We have an obligation to respond to great humanitarian \ncrises, whether they are caused by nature or by man.\n  But to show a picture of starving North Korean children in the debate \non Ambassador Hill's qualifications and to imply somehow that he is \nindifferent to their plight does a good public servant an enormous \ndisservice--particularly one whose record is what I have described, who \ntime and again has fought for the implementation of the Human Rights \nAct and who has taken personal risks on occasion to enforce human \nrights.\n  The date of the photograph that was there was not in fact declared, \nbut I believe it was during the great Republic of North Korea's famine \nin 1996 and 1997. If that is true, that is 10 years before Ambassador \nChris Hill began his duties as the lead envoy in the six-party talks. \nSo, again, to create some sense of linkage or nexus here is \ninappropriate.\n  In any case, the bottom line is this. No one is going to deny that \nNorth Korea is a country on the brink of famine and failure. It is a \nfailed place. None of us should be idle in the face of this basic \nthreat to the health of the North Korean people and to the security of \nthe peninsula and of the region. It is deplorable that North Korea has \nrecently expelled food aid workers. I hope they are going to reverse \nthat decision. We are going to listen carefully to testimony before our \ncommittee on May 6. We will have a comprehensive view on what is \nhappening in North Korea and what the possibilities are for our policy. \nBut let me emphasize: Chris Hill never ignored that situation. He \nworked with skill and persistence to secure direct access for five U.S. \nNGOs, including Christian groups, to provide aid to millions of North \nKoreans, including hungry children exactly like the kids who were \ndepicted in the photograph on the floor this morning.\n  Thanks to the work of Ambassador Hill, Korean-speaking U.S. aid \nworkers in 2008-2009 were able to travel to remote parts of North Korea \nnever before reached by U.S. aid workers. That is an extraordinary \nsuccess for which Ambassador Hill ought to be congratulated. They were \nable to establish five field offices in rural areas where they had \nnever been before. That is a success. They were able to conduct \nunannounced visits to schools, hospitals, and orphanages. That is an \naccountability we never had before. That is a success. They were able \nto provide 100,000 tons of food aid to help people feed literally \nmillions of North Korean children. That is a success.\n  This was the first U.S. food aid to North Korea delivered by U.S. \nNGOs since the year 2000 and this was delivered in the most intrusive, \ncomprehensive monitoring system ever permitted by North Korea. \nAmbassador Hill deserves praise for his efforts on this issue, not the \ncriticism that was implied on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 p.m. today all \npostcloture time be yielded back and the Senate proceed to vote on the \nconfirmation of the nomination of Christopher Hill to be Ambassador to \nIraq, that the time until then be equally divided and controlled \nbetween myself and Senator Brownback or designees of each of us, and \nthat the 10 minutes immediately prior to the vote be equally divided \nand controlled between myself and Senator Brownback; further, that the \ntime controlled by the Republicans, of that time, Senator Kyl control \n15 minutes, Senator McCain control 20 minutes, and that upon \nconfirmation, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, no \nfurther motions be in order, the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair and thank my colleague.\n  I yield the floor, according to the unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I agreed to this unanimous consent \nrequest to try to move this somewhat forward. I do believe this has \nbeen a healthy debate. It has been a good thing for us to discuss what \ntook place in North Korea. It has been a good thing for us to discuss \nhuman rights. Anytime we can do that I think it is a good thing for us \nto discuss that setting, moving into Iraq and the human rights concerns \nthere.\n  I do want to address a few things the Senator from Massachusetts \nraised. One is on the North Korean Human Rights Act. I was the author \nof that bill. I know that bill. I worked to get that bill through. I \npushed hard to get it through. One of the provisions in that bill was \n$20 million authorized under the North Korean Human Rights Act for use \nof the North Korean Human Rights Act and to resettle refugees from \nNorth Korea in the United States and for a number of other issues. The \nadministration has not requested a single dime under that \nauthorization. It didn't ask for a single appropriation. So the idea \nthat we have implemented the North Korean Human Rights Act when no \nmoney was requested underneath that, I guess I am impressed that could \ntake place. I hope the Government can do that well in many other areas, \nwhere they do not ask for any money and then they fully comply with an \nact.\n  I do not think the act was fully complied with. I stated that \nspecifically here on the Record, the places I do not believe it was \ncomplied with.\n  We are digging up right now how many people have been resettled in \nthe United States under this North Korea Human Rights Act. It is a very \nsmall number--in the dozens at most. There is a lot of hesitation, \nhiccups taking place. The State Department is not pushing or working \nwith this. A number of these refugees could have been resettled here by \ncommunities in the United States. This is actually one piece that could \nhave been done very cheaply because the Korean-American community here \nwould have resettled them, in many cases, without cost to the Federal \nGovernment. Very few were received or brought to the United States.\n  The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is a very \ndistinguished Senator from Massachusetts with a lot of foreign policy \nexperience. I admire all of that. I don't think he has worked quite as \nmuch on the Korean issue, certainly not as much as some other Members \nof this body and myself have worked on it. To say that this was a \nsuccessful negotiation I think does not stand the overall, just view of \nthis from the public's view, let alone from a diplomatic viewpoint.\n  When you look at this--you say it was a successful negotiation \nAmbassador Hill conducted with North Korea and the six-party talks. \nWhen you look at what North Korea has done since then and try to call \nit that, I don't think the Japanese would call this a successful \nnegotiation that a missile was fired over their country, one that could \nreach the western United States. I don't think the Japanese would call \nit a successful negotiation that the abductees that were taken from \nJapan by the North Korean leadership and never accounted for were not \naccounted for during the negotiation.\n\n[[Page S4493]]\n\nThis was the top issue. I had the Japanese Embassy contacting my \noffice, complaining about the six-party talks and not being included on \ntheir top issues.\n  Why are they having to go through me? Because they can't go through \nChris Hill. What kind of diplomat is that, when he has trouble with one \nof your main allies on a very specific item and issue that you can at \nleast keep them tuned in and coming along with the overall issue?\n  China is one of the members of the six-party talks and China has been \none of the lead problems with us dealing with North Korea. Yet we do \nnot even push the Chinese on North Korea or North Korean human rights. \nWe don't demand that the U.N. Human Rights Commission, or Commission on \nHuman Rights, be allowed into China to determine are these North Korean \nrefugees who are coming into China, are they economic migrants, are \nthey refugees? We don't even push the Chinese to allow the U.N. in to \nlook and see what the status is here. We do not push them at the six-\nparty talks or the U.N. There is a complete failure of this.\n  I have had some refugees, a few who made it out of North Korea into \nthe United States, a few more who made it into China--it is hard to get \nout of China and into the country--I have had a couple into my office, \ninterviewing them, and they talked about the horrible conditions in \nChina for North Korean refugees. Several hundred thousand, probably, \nare there, stateless, not protected. The women are generally captured \nand sold as concubines in China--captured like wild animals. This is \ntheir fate. We do not push the U.N. Human Rights Commission, don't push \nthe Chinese to allow these individuals in, even though the Chinese have \nsigned the declaration on this. We don't get that done. That is not a \nsuccess taking place.\n  North Koreans recently abducted two Americans on the North Korea-\nChina border. That has taken place. We don't object to that. They are \ndeveloping part of the Syrian nuclear reactor. We don't get any \ninformation on that. We get incomplete information. We waive the \nterrorism list. We get nothing out of this deal. That is called a \nsuccessful negotiation. I wonder what we will call successful \nnegotiations in Iraq, then, if that is what we are calling a successful \nnegotiation with the North Koreans in the six-party talks. I wonder \nwhat we will call successful human rights being determined in Iraq when \nwe see the human rights record of what is taking place in North Korea. \nI wonder how that is going to be viewed.\n\n  For all of those reasons, I think this has been a healthy debate for \nus to have had. I hope when the supplemental comes up, we as a body do \nnot waive again the Glenn sanctions on North Korea. That will come up \nin front of this body. It is an annual waiver that will have to take \nplace. I hope we as a body do not fund North Korea beyond humanitarian \nassistance. That will come up in the supplemental. I want to lay those \nmarkers down for my colleagues. I hope people are watching for this, \nthat we do not reward the North Koreans, that we do not become their \nsupporter like the Soviets were, and we do not continue this practice, \nmuch of which Chris Hill negotiated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I would like to add my voice in support of \nthe nominee, Chris Hill, whom I have had the pleasure of working with \nextensively in his current assignment, both in my role as a member of \nthe Armed Services Committee and also of the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n  I think he is a uniquely qualified individual. He has a long history \nof success. If anything, in the current debate, I believe he is perhaps \nbeing victimized by the fact that he is a loyal diplomat and was \ncarrying out, with great expertise, the charges that had been given to \nhim as someone who has a career in that area.\n  The numbers are pretty clear. He is going to get at least 70 votes. I \nbelieve it is time for us to end this debate and have the vote and get \nChris Hill on his way. I respect the Senator from Kansas. I respect his \nconcerns. He has been a great champion in terms of human rights. I \nwould just suggest that this is not the place to continue this sort of \ndiscussion when the situation in Iraq is filled with unknowns, as it \nis, and our need of getting someone who has these types of \nqualifications over there to do this job.\n  The Chris Hill nomination is no more place to have this debate than \nit was when the nomination of the current Ambassador to South Korea was \nalso held up for similar reasons. The points have been made. I think \nall of us understand them, and we need to get on with this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise today in opposition to the \nconfirmation of Assistant Secretary Christopher Hill as U.S. Ambassador \nto Iraq. I do not often come to the floor and object to nominees of the \nPresident of the United States. I believe elections have consequences, \nand that gives a President of the United States the benefit of the \ndoubt and, even more, as far as the selection of the team he assembles \nin order to do the best job possible. So it is on a rare occasion that \nI object to a nominee of the President. But for too long and too deeply \nthe United States of America has been involved in Iraq. There is a \nfragile situation there. We have recently seen an uptick in violence \nand attacks by extremist elements within Iraq. Now is not the time to \nsend a person who I believe is not only unqualified on the face of it \nbut also, in my view, has not conducted himself in the most admirable \nfashion in his previous work.\n  Today, we find ourselves in a situation few could have foreseen just \na few years ago. In late 2006, the situation in Iraq was deteriorating \nat an alarming rate. The Government was mired in internal strife and \ndeadlock, sectarian violence crippled the lives of everyday Iraqis, and \nthe outlook for the country's future was increasingly bleak. Yet in the \nface of seemingly unsurmountable challenges, a drastic change in \nstrategy was introduced. GEN David Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan Crocker \nlaunched and executed a civil-military counterinsurgency plan for Iraq \nthat turned the tide of violence in a timeframe and to a degree that \nsurprised even the optimists. The result has been a decrease in \nviolence to the lowest levels since 2003 and real hope about the future \nof the country in which we have expended so much precious American \nblood and treasure. Yet as our commanders have repeatedly warned, these \ngains, though real, are fragile. The recent uptick in violence \ndemonstrates anew that there remain elements within Iraq who wish to \ncontinue the violence and use their power to disrupt the transition to \na more stable, democratic, and tolerant society. There also remain a \nnumber of difficult political and economic issues that lay ahead, \nincluding the distribution of oil revenues, the resettlement of \nrefugees and internally displaced Iraqis, and ongoing tensions between \nArabs and Kurds.\n  Ambassador Ryan Crocker was able to tackle these and other issues \nwith great skill and expertise, ensuring unprecedented cooperation \nbetween the military, the Embassy, and their counterparts in the Iraqi \nGovernment. Ambassador Crocker's remarkable tenure was a byproduct of \nhis lengthy career in the Middle East, not simply incidental to his \nlong record of experience in the region. He had served two tours in \nBaghdad previously, including in the Coalition Provisional Authority, \nand he also served as Ambassador to several neighboring countries, \nincluding Lebanon, Kuwait, and Syria. His longstanding relationships \nwith the region's leaders, his deep understanding of the complexities \nof Arab and Iraqi culture, and his ability to speak fluent Arabic were \ninstrumental to his success.\n  Now, as we reduce the number of combat forces in Iraq, our national \ninterests there will depend to an increasing degree on the skill of our \ndiplomacy. I believe Ambassador Crocker's successor should possess many \nof the same traits he demonstrated, including experience in the region, \nan understanding of its players and dynamics, and relevant language \nskills. While Ambassador Hill has developed regional expertise, it is \nnot in the Middle East. He has served as Ambassador in Europe and Asia, \nand speaks, admirably, three European languages but does not speak \nArabic. He has not had the opportunity to work with leaders in Iraq or \nin the region. In fact, he has\n\n[[Page S4494]]\n\nnever been to Iraq. He has limited experience at best in working with \nthe military in the areas of counterterrorism and counterinsurgency.\n  The next U.S. Ambassador to Iraq will take over at a critical time in \nhistory of our involvement there. The U.S. Embassy in Baghdad is the \nworld's largest and, along with our Embassy in Kabul, one of the two \nmost important. The next Ambassador will play a vital role in \nconsolidating our hard-won gains and ensuring that the country does not \nbackslide into violence and turmoil. Given the enormity of our stakes \nin Iraq, I do not believe it is appropriate to select as our next \nAmbassador someone who will require on-the-job training in Iraqi \naffairs and in Middle East issues.\n  This may well be, I am afraid, the case with Mr. Hill.\n  There are a number of well-qualified individuals both within the \nForeign Service and without it who would make excellent U.S. \nAmbassadors to Iraq. I do not believe Mr. Hill is among this number.\n  Our next Ambassador must hit the ground running and quickly work with \nthe ground commander, Iraqi leaders, and others to confront the still \ngreat challenges that will present themselves over the next several \nyears. We have made many mistakes in Iraq over a number of years, and \nthey have cost us dearly. We have seen individuals take charge of U.S. \nefforts there without the background and experience necessary to \nsucceed. I do not want us to repeat this mistake.\n  In addition to my concerns about Ambassador Hill's lack of Middle \nEast experience, I also have questions arising from his tenure as U.S. \nEnvoy to the six-party talks on North Korea's nuclear program. His \nlegacy in those talks was controversial, as evidenced by complaints \nthat other members of the interagency process were cut out of crucial \npolicy deliberations. In a cable reported in the Washington Post, \nThomas Schieffer, then-U.S. Ambassador to Japan, warned of irreparable \nharm to our relations with Tokyo resulting from an agreement that did \nnot adequately address Japanese interests, including the issue of \nabductions. Ambassador Schieffer added that he could not play a role in \nremedying this state of affairs because Ambassador Hill had cut him out \nof the flow of information on North Korea.\n  Members of the Senate, including my colleague from Kansas, have \nasserted that Ambassador Hill broke a commitment made before a \ncongressional committee to include North Korean Special Envoy for Human \nRights Jay Lefkowitz to all future negotiating sessions with North \nKorea. I am aware that Ambassador Hill has asserted that he did not, in \nfact, break such a commitment, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. \nLefkowitz was not included in these subsequent negotiating sessions.\n  Given the key role the Congress and non-State Department agencies \nplay in our Iraq policy, however, I believe it is crucial that the next \nAmbassador to Iraq begin with a surplus of trust and good will with \nboth. Ambassador Hill, I am afraid, starts with a deficit.\n  Ambassador Hill testified on October 25, 2007, before the House \nForeign Affairs Subcommittee that ``clearly we cannot be reaching a \nnuclear agreement with North Korea if at the same time they are \nproliferating. It is not acceptable.'' Yet, just months later, \nAmbassador Hill reached an agreement with Pyongyang despite its alleged \nnuclear proliferation to Syria, and reports have emerged of Iranian-\nNorth Korean cooperation in missile technology.\n  In recent weeks alone, North Korea has tested a ballistic missile in \nviolation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, expelled \ninspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency, removed seals \non equipment, and turned off surveillance cameras at the Yongbyon \nnuclear plant and announced that it is withdrawing from the six-party \ntalks.\n  While Mr. Hill did not bear sole responsibility for the content of \nU.S. policy toward North Korea, nor for the outcomes I have just \ndescribed, it is nevertheless inescapable that he has played the key \nU.S. role in the formulation of policy toward Pyongyang for the past \nseveral years. To the eyes of most objective observers, those policies \nhave failed.\n  Finally, I am troubled at comments and characterizations that \nappeared in a recent book by New York Times reporter David Sanger. In a \nstatement to associates, for example, Ambassador Hill is quoted--and it \nis a direct quote--as saying of members of the administration--the \nadministration which he supposedly served--``these [expletive] don't \nknow how to negotiate. Everything is Appomattox. It's just `Come out \nwith your hands up.' It's not even really Appomattox, because at the \nend of Appomattox they let the Confederates keep their horses.'' This \nis perhaps the most colorful but not the only reference along these \nlines. Mr. Sanger quotes Ambassador Hill as saying that his \ninstructions ``showed a complete lack of understanding about how the \nworld works,'' and the book, along with other accounts, cites numerous \nexamples of Mr. Hill going beyond his instructions as authorized by the \nDepartment of State.\n  I know loyalty is a rare commodity in this town, and I do not expect \na lot of it. I have seen a lot of situations where people seek to \nburnish their own images and their own reputations. I guess in some \nways this is kind of a classic example, this quote of Ambassador \nHill's, talking about the people he works for: ``These [expletive] \ndon't know how to negotiate.'' And he says--and it is a direct quote \nagain--that his instructions ``showed a complete lack of understanding \nabout how the world works.'' I wonder if Mr. Hill really felt this \nstrongly, as these quotes indicate in Mr. Sanger's book, that he might \nhave felt motivated for the good of the country to speak out publicly \nto remonstrate that ``These [expletive] don't know how to negotiate.'' \nInstead, many times we see people more interested in how a New York \nTimes reporter describes them than they are in serving the people who \nappoint them to the positions of responsibility.\n  In response to a lengthy set of questions I submitted to Ambassador \nHill, he wrote that fulfilling the oath taken by a Foreign Service \nofficer ``means respecting the chain of command and remaining loyal to \nmy leadership.'' In this, I agree with Mr. Hill. Mr. Hill, if those \nquotes are accurate--and I have no reason to believe they are not--\nobviously did not feel so at the time.\n  But, most importantly, the stakes in Iraq today could hardly be \nhigher. We have been at this war for 6 long and difficult years. We \nmade many mistakes. We paid an enormous price for the gains we see in \nthat country today. And I must say, in all candor, we have seen another \nAmbassador to Iraq who went there without experience, and things did \nnot turn out so well.\n  There are qualified individuals who are serving this Nation in and \nout of the Foreign Service.\n  It well known that Marine General Zinni was offered the job, at least \nby some members of the administration, and then somehow that offer \ndisappeared. The fact is, we have sacrificed a lot. We owe it to the \nbrave men and women who have sacrificed so much to ensure that the \nremarkable progress they have achieved translates into long-term \nstability as our combat troops begin leaving the country. After meeting \nwith Ambassador Hill and examining his record, the concerns I raised \nfollowing his nomination last month remain. For this reason, I must \noppose his nomination as the next U.S. Ambassador to Iraq.\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to Ambassador \nChristopher Hill's nomination to serve as the next U.S. Ambassador to \nIraq. As Senator Brownback and I stated in a letter to Secretary of \nState Clinton regarding Ambassador Hill's nomination:\n\n       Our role as United States Senators is not to choose the \n     President's envoys. However, in the exercise of the Senate's \n     constitutionally mandated role of advising and consenting to \n     nominations, we are required to judge the qualifications by \n     ambassadorial candidates on several levels, not least their \n     past record of dealing with our own branch of government.\n\n\n[[Page S4495]]\n\n\n  I do not believe Ambassador Hill has the requisite experience to be \nour Ambassador to Iraq at this critical time in that young democracy's \nhistory. Beyond that, serious allegations have been made by members of \nthe press as well as Members of this body that call into question Mr. \nHill's ability to follow orders and his willingness to be forthcoming \nand truthful with the Senate itself. I believe these allegations merit \nmuch more rigorous review.\n  Many of my colleagues believe that Iraq is at a critical and fragile \njuncture and that now is no time to delay the installation of our \nAmbassador to that country, and to them I say I could not agree more. \nHowever, I would also say to them it is even more critical that we send \nan Ambassador who has the proper experience for the tough task ahead of \nhim. We should be sending someone who understands the complex and \nunique historical, cultural, and tribal intricacies of those with whom \nhe will be interacting and negotiating. We should be sending someone \nwho speaks their language, literally. We should be sending someone who, \nover their distinguished career at the State Department, has at least \nhad one assignment to the Middle East. Ambassador Hill has had none. At \nno time during his 32 years has he had an assignment there, nor does he \nspeak Arabic. Surely, the State Department has at least one \ndistinguished diplomat who has career experience in the Middle East.\n  Some of my colleagues argue that Ambassador Hill's experience in \nKosovo and Bosnia give him crucial experience solving complex problems \nof ethnic civil wars. After 6 years of, I would hope, lessons learned, \nI am sure my colleagues would agree with me that we should not approach \nthe cultural and ethnic nuances in Iraq with a same-thing-only-\ndifferent diplomacy. I certainly hope the Obama administration is not \ntaking a one-size-fits-all approach to the world.\n  Iraq's history is not that of Kosovo or Bosnia. Its cultural and \nethnic makeup is completely unique. We need someone who understands \nIraq's history, culture, and, yes, language. That is why the choice of \nAmbassador Ryan Crocker was so inspired--a diplomat who, over his \ncareer at the State Department, had been assigned to Iran, Qatar, \nLebanon, Egypt, Syria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan--all before he took on \nhis assignment as Ambassador to Iraq. In addition, he spoke Persian and \nArabic.\n  Much of our recent success in Iraq is because of Ambassador Crocker's \nlifetime of knowledge and understanding of Iraq and its neighbors' \ncultural and ethnic history. While I don't expect a carbon copy of \nAmbassador Crocker, I do assert again that surely the State Department \nhas to have at least one distinguished diplomat with relevant \nexperience in the Middle East. If it doesn't--if its bench for Iraq is \none diplomat deep--we need to find out what is going on over at the \nState Department.\n  Moreover, I worry what signal it sends--when coupled with the recent \ncampaign rhetoric--of our commitment to sustain the hard-fought gains \nof the surge by sending an ambassador to Iraq with no experience in the \nregion. What message does that send to Iraqi leaders who are nervous \nthat the U.S. commitment to finish what we started has ended?\n  In addition to his lack of Middle East experience, recent press \nreports about Ambassador Hill's conduct as head of the U.S. delegation \nof the six-party talks on the North Korean nuclear issue raise serious \ndoubts about his fitness to serve in such a sensitive position as \nAmbassador to Iraq.\n  Twice, Ambassador Hill allegedly disobeyed orders from the President \nand Secretary Rice not to engage in any bilateral meetings with the \nNorth Koreans. According to Stephen Hayes of the Weekly Standard:\n\n       On July 9, 2005, [Secretary of State] Rice had given \n     approval for a trilateral meeting with the Chinese and the \n     North Koreans in an effort to get the North Koreans to return \n     to the six-party talks on their nuclear program. . . . The \n     Chinese didn't show up, as they had promised. Hill \n     nonetheless met alone with the North Koreans and gave them an \n     important propaganda victory.\n\n  We cannot afford to have diplomats exceeding their authority and \nengaging in freelance diplomacy when they see fit and in direct \nopposition to the wishes of the President and the Secretary of State.\n  That is why Senator Brownback and I wrote to Secretary Clinton and \nasked her to provide us with all relevant cables and correspondence \nregarding Ambassador Hill's instruction for these two meetings so that \nwe can establish the facts. These matters could have been cleared up by \nnow if the State Department had responded to the letter that Senator \nBrownback and I sent. It has not chosen to do so. We have no response.\n  Finally, Senator Brownback raised questions about Ambassador Hill's \ntruthfulness to the Senate. The Senator spoke to this matter.\n  The position of U.S. Ambassador to Iraq is among the most sensitive \nmissions we have in the world at this time. It is critical that \nambassadors follow the letter and spirit of the orders given by the \nPresident and the Secretary of State. It is equally important that \nanytime an ambassador gives assurances to the Senate that something \nwill be carried out, or certain actions will not be engaged in, that \nthose assurances be rock solid.\n  Mr. President, for the reasons I have articulated--and I associate \nmyself with the remarks of Senators Brownback and McCain--I regret that \nI cannot support Christopher Hill's nomination to replace Ambassador \nCrocker as U.S. Ambassador to Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \nChristopher R. Hill to be the next Ambassador to Iraq. I have had the \nprivilege of working with Ambassador Hill and I know him. He is a Rhode \nIslander. He was born in Little Compton, where he resides. He brought \nhis fine skills and talents to public service many years ago. He has \ndistinguished himself in that service over many years. He is being \nposted to one of the most critical areas of the world.\n  Mr. President, you and I just returned from Iraq. One of the comments \nwe heard from General Odierno and from our diplomatic personnel was the \nneed to rapidly confirm Ambassador Hill. They have every confidence in \nhim. They believe he cannot only do the job but do it extremely well. I \nthink their support is much more compelling than the opposition I have \nheard on the Senate floor today.\n  We understand, as they do, the real step forward in Iraq is building \nits governmental capacity and dealing with very explicit problems, one \nof which--and the Presiding Officer and I have both spoken on this \ntoday--is the tension between the Kurds and Arabs around Kirkuk, with \nrespect to oil. Our Ambassador has to hit the ground running and deal \nwith a very difficult set of issues. Chris Hill is prepared to do that.\n  Together with General Odierno, they will form a team that will \ncontinue the progress that has been made over the last several months.\n  Ambassador Hill, as I mentioned, is from Rhode Island. He earned his \nB.A. from Bowdoin College and a masters from the Naval War College, \nalso in Rhode Island. He is extremely well qualified for this position, \nwith a lifetime of diplomatic service and facing challenges in many \ndifferent arenas, and facing them with distinction. He has particular \nskills in bridging gaps and bringing people together, which will be \ncritical.\n  Ambassador Hill entered the Foreign Service in 1977. In the 1980s, he \nserved in various positions within the State Department in Washington. \nHe was an economic officer in the Embassies in Belgrade, Yugoslavia; \nWarsaw, Poland; and Seoul, Korea.\n  Beginning in 1991, he spent 2 years as the Deputy Chief of Mission at \nthe U.S. Embassy in Tirana, Albania. From 1994 to 1996, he was the \nDirector of the Office of South Central European Affairs.\n  Then, in 1996, he was named the Ambassador of Macedonia during a \nperiod when the United States was actively engaged in multilateral \nefforts to prevent the spread of ethnic conflict in Macedonia, bolster \nMacedonian independence and state viability, and manage bilateral \ndisputes between Macedonia and Greece. He worked with our American \nmilitary forces during that period.\n  The first time I met with him I was with the commander of the First \nInfantry Division of the U.S. Army who was on the ground. So the \nAmbassador is someone who has already been in a situation in which \nethnic tension, bilateral relationships between regional\n\n[[Page S4496]]\n\npowers, and Army military stabilization operations were underway. I \nthink that experience will make him extremely prepared for and equipped \nto accomplish the mission he has been assigned in Baghdad.\n  Ambassador Hill was also part of a team that was assembled by \nAmbassador Holbrooke that negotiated the Bosnian peace settlement. He \nfought to ensure that protections were included for those who had been \nmade refugees by the war. In one instance, he personally intervened at \nthe Stenkovac refugee camp to prevent a rioting mob from beating an \nethnic Roma family to death.\n  I think he has a sensitivity to ethnic and sectarian tension, not \ngleaned from textbooks but from personal involvement and engagement in \nthese situations.\n  In 2004, he returned to Seoul, Korea, this time as the Ambassador. \nThere he partnered with Korean authorities and the commander of the \nU.S. Forces Korea, General Leon LePorte, another Rhode Islander, to \ndevelop and implement the most significant realignment of our military \nposture in the region since the Korean war. I think it was an effort \nthat today is bearing fruit in terms of the ability of U.S. forces in \nKorea to continue their mission with a smaller footprint, and indeed to \nbe able to support operations around the globe as units from Korea are \nbeing sent into the combat zone in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Most recently, after his experience as Ambassador to Seoul, he served \nas Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and \nalso as head of--as somebody mentioned--the six-party talks, which \nattempted to get the North Koreans to move away from their path of \nnuclear progress they had been making. He worked hard to dismantle \ntheir main nuclear facility and provide a full accounting for their \nplutonium.\n  Ambassador Hill also engaged in issues of human rights. It has been \npointed out that not all of the efforts have been completely \nsuccessful. But what he was doing was carrying out the policy of the \nbeneficiary administration. He was carrying out the instructions of the \nSecretary of State and the President of the United States. I think he \ndid that with fidelity to his responsibilities to his superiors and \nalso a keen commitment to improving a situation that had become very \ndire indeed.\n  Ambassador Hill has received numerous awards, including the Secretary \nof State's Distinguished Service Award, the Francis Shattuck Security \nand Peace Award, the Robert C. Frasure Memorial Award for Peace \nNegotiations, and the Secretary of Defense Medal of Meritorious \nCivilian Service.\n  Ambassador Hill, with his talent, his character, and his commitment \nto the Nation, has also been recognized because he has been endorsed \nfor this position by the last three Ambassadors to Iraq, including Ryan \nCrocker, Zalmay Khalilzad, and John Negroponte. These gentlemen did an \nextraordinarily good job for us there. I am particularly singling out \nRyan Crocker--someone whose commitment was not just in terms of his \nprofessional skill but his physical skill--risking his life numerous \ntimes, working day and night, 7 days a week, and doing it with \ndistinction and grace. That is remarkable.\n  Again, no one is going to be another Ryan Crocker. I think it is \nextraordinarily significant that Ryan Crocker, who probably knows that \njob as well as anybody, would endorse Christopher Hill to take the job. \nHe would not do it just as a courtesy to a fellow State Department \nofficer. He did it because I believe he understands that Ambassador \nHill not only can do the job but will do it.\n  I also say the same thing about the commitment and sincerity and \nsupport of Zalmay Khalilzad and John Negroponte. Furthermore, I think \nboth General Petraeus and General Odierno have indicated that not only \nis he someone with whom they can work, they want to be able to work \nwith him quickly. They want him on the ground. Iraq is at a pivotal \njuncture in the history of that country and its relationship with the \nUnited States. The intelligence and commitment and experience of the \nAmbassador to Iraq is critical. Ambassador Hill has an abundance of the \nnecessary skills. He has proven again and again he can bring a possible \nsituation to a workable solution. He is the right man for the job. I \nurge my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I strongly support the nomination of \nChristopher Hill, one of America's most distinguished and accomplished \ncareer diplomats, to serve as Ambassador to Iraq.\n  Our Bagdad Embassy is, obviously, a post of critical importance to \nUnited States interests. Our Armed Servicemembers and diplomats serving \nin Iraq need and deserve an ambassador without further delay. President \nObama has set forth a sound strategy for ending our combat role in Iraq \nand allowing the Iraqi Government to take full responsibility for that \nNation's affairs. We will be extremely fortunate to have an ambassador \nof Christopher Hill's skills, stature, and experience, to oversee this \nimportant new phase in our relations with Iraq.\n  Ambassador Hill's career in the Foreign Service spans more than three \ndecades. He has extraordinary expertise and experience in the fields of \nnational security, peacebuilding, and postconflict reconstruction. He \nis exactly the right person to have in this critical post at this \npivotal time in Iraq.\n  While serving in the former Yugoslavia from 1996 to 1999, Ambassador \nHill was at the center of negotiations for the Bosnia peace settlement, \nserving as deputy to chief negotiator Richard Holbrooke. He fought to \nensure the protection of those who had been made refugees by the war. \nIn one instance, he personally intervened at the Stenkovac refugee camp \nto prevent a rioting mob from beating to death an ethnic Roma family.\n  As America's first Ambassador to Macedonia, he worked with local \nauthorities to quell ethno-religious violence and build institutions of \ndemocratic governance and civil society.\n  As Ambassador to South Korea, Hill strengthened a key bilateral \nalliance, partnering with Korean authorities and the commander of U.S. \nForces in Korea to develop and implement the most significant \nrealignment of our military posture in the region since the Korean war.\n  Most recently, as Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and \nPacific Affairs, Ambassador Hill led extremely complex negotiations to \ncounter North Korea's nuclear ambitions, working with a diverse and \npowerful group of countries, including China, South Korea, Japan, and \nRussia.\n  Ambassador Hill has a master's degree from the Naval War College, and \nhas extensive experience working with our U.S. military on \ncounterterrorism and counterinsurgency. Ambassador Hill has worked with \nsome of the best military commanders of this generation, addressing \nsome of our Nation's toughest challenges GEN Eric Shinseki in the \nBalkans, GEN Leon LaPorte in Korea, ADM Tim Keating of Pacific Command, \nto name just a few.\n  Ambassador Hill's nomination has been endorsed enthusiastically by \nour last three Ambassadors to Iraq: Ambassador Ryan Crocker, Ambassador \nZalmay Khalilzad, and Ambassador John D. Negroponte. We need his \nexperience and seasoned judgment during this crucial time of transition \nin Iraq. Ambassador Hill's nomination has been vetted through the \nnormal process. It is now time for the Senate to vote on his \nconfirmation, and allow Ambassador Hill to get to work on the \nsignificant challenges ahead.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to give my remarks on the \nnomination of Christopher Hill to be United States Ambassador to Iraq. \nUnfortunately, I cannot support this nomination. There are two \nprincipal reasons for my opposition. The first is his inexperience in \nthe Middle East and with the type of challenges provided by Iraq. The \nsecond is his actions and behavior during negotiations with North \nKorea.\n  It is generally accepted that career diplomats will serve in many \nvery different parts of the globe. However, the position of Ambassador \nto Iraq is arguably the most important diplomatic post in the world to \nthe United States. To see an example of just the type of person suited \nto this job one only need to look to the most recent U.S. Ambassador to \nIraq: Ryan Crocker. Mr. Crocker previously served as Ambassador to \nPakistan, Syria, Kuwait, and\n\n[[Page S4497]]\n\nLebanon. He had served in Iraq previously and was Deputy Assistant \nSecretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. He is also fluent in \nArabic.\n  Ambassador Hill has none of these credentials. He has spent nearly \nhis entire career concentrating on European affairs, until recently \nshifting to the Far East to concentrate on issues regarding the Korean \npeninsula. He has no prior postings or assignments that would give him \nexperience with the Middle East nor that would give him any knowledge \nof U.S. counterinsurgency efforts there. As the United States begins to \ndraw down the military presence in Iraq, the efforts of our diplomats \nthere will become even more important. We need a more experienced head \nof these efforts than we have been given in Christopher Hill.\n  Within Ambassador Hill's experience to date, I have severe concerns \nin the manner in which he conducted himself as chief U.S. negotiator in \nthe disarmament talks with North Korea. Not only do I find his actions \nunprofessional but question his negotiating tactics and the concessions \nhe made. Records show he engaged in evasive and unprofessional \nactivities, including sidelining key officials at the State Department \nand breaking commitments made before congressional committees.\n  Ambassador Hill also made significant concessions to North Korea \nduring his disarmament talks that I believe were diplomatically unsound \nand imprudent. I firmly believe they put the United States at a \ndisadvantage in our efforts to move forward with this rogue Communist \nregime. Removing North Korea from our list of state sponsors of \nterrorism along with lifting our sanctions in return for a mere ``good \nfaith'' declaration of their nuclear weapons program was unsound and \nirresponsible. True to form, North Korea, through a symbolic process of \nsmoke and mirrors, only partially disclosed their weapons program \ngiving the United States access to information that was already known \nthroughout the international community. North Korea's recent decision \nto abandon the six party talks and restart their nuclear weapons \nprogram only highlights our failed diplomacy and Ambassador Hill's \nshortcomings.\n  As we move forward with one of the most diplomatically sensitive \nmissions in American history I do not believe that we can afford to \nmake any mistakes. While Ambassador Hill has a distinguished career of \ndiplomatic service, I do not believe that he is the right nominee for \nthis position. Thus, I respectfully oppose his nomination.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, there is a previous agreement that the \nfinal 10 minutes be equally divided, 5 minutes on either side, and I \nrise to use that 5 minutes in opposition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, we are soon to vote on the issue of \nwhether Chris Hill should be the next ambassador to Iraq, and I want to \nmake a few comments about that in closing.\n  I think there has been a good, full discussion, and I think it has \nbeen a good discussion. I misspoke at one point in time, in talking \nabout Auschwitz and Poland. It wasn't a Polish concentration camp. It \nwas in Poland, but it was run by the Nazis. I wanted to make sure I am \nclear on that to individuals.\n  Also, I wish to add Senator Hutchison to the North Korean Sanctions \nAct for the Record.\n  Today marks the Holocaust Remembrance Day, as cited earlier on the \nfloor. The Holocaust Museum's theme this year is: ``Never again: What \nYou Do Matters.'' I think what Chris Hill did matters in this case.\n  I want to read one section of the statement from the Holocaust Museum \nand what they put forward about what you do matters. They stated:\n\n       Remembrance obligates us not only to memorialize those who \n     were killed but also to reflect on what could have been done \n     to save them. Those who survived tell us that as many faced \n     their horrific deaths, their last words were ``Remember us. \n     Tell our story.'' Survivors promised that they would, and \n     that never again would the world stand silent or look the \n     other way.\n\n  Well, I can't stand silent and look the other way in North Korea. And \nI think ``never again'' ought to mean that. The deeds of Ambassador \nHill in North Korea--no progress on human rights, a terrible deal, \nfailed diplomacy--and I can go through what has happened in the last 2 \nweeks. To reiterate, North Korea has launched a multistage ballistic \nmissile over Japan, kidnapped two of our citizens, pulled out of the \nsix-party talks, kicked out international nuclear inspectors and \nAmerican monitors, restarted its nuclear facilities, and according to \nat least one news source is now under investigation for shipping \nenriched uranium to Iran.\n  It was a terrible deal. In all this debate we have had about Chris \nHill, not one colleague has defended the deal Chris Hill got with the \nNorth Koreans on its merits. Nobody has defended the deal he has gotten \non the merits. They just said: Well, it is tough to negotiate. Yes, it \nis tough to negotiate, but on the merits, this was a terrible deal. And \nthe irony is that the only thing dismantled in the six-party talks was \nour strategic deterrence and our moral authority. That was the only \nthing that was dismantled. Convening a six-party dialogue is not \nsuccess in and of itself, especially when the result is so abhorrent.\n  We will have a chance to talk about this again shortly. It is going \nto be coming up in a supplemental. As a reminder here in the Chamber, \nthen-Senator Obama said:\n\n       Sanctions are a critical part of our leverage to pressure \n     North Korea to act. They should only be lifted based on North \n     Korean performance. If the North Koreans do not meet their \n     obligations, we should move quickly to reimpose sanctions \n     that have been waived and consider new restrictions going \n     forward.\n\n  In the supplemental fight, there will be a discussion to give North \nKoreans more heavy fuel oil. I ask my colleagues not to put that in the \nbill. There will be a sanctions waiver discussion in the supplemental. \nI ask my colleagues not to waive sanctions on North Korea in the \nsupplemental fight, and I ask instead that we reimpose the sanctions \nthat then-Senator and Presidential candidate, now President Barack \nObama called for in June of 2008. That seems to me to be an appropriate \nroute for us to take as we look at this full set of problems we have \nand the discussion that we have had to date.\n  I ask my colleagues again to consider the qualifications of \nAmbassador Hill, the problems that have come under his watch, and the \nNorth Korean talks, and not confirm him to be our ambassador for Iraq \nin a situation where he has produced such terrible results and on a \nHolocaust Remembrance Day when we say: Never again.\n  I further ask my colleagues that if you do confirm him, if he is \nconfirmed today, that we actually do remember that what we do matters \nand what we say matters and that we not go forward here at this point \nin time and say: Fine, we are going to go ahead and waive the \nsanctions. This was part of the Hill strategy toward North Korea; we \nare going to go ahead and waive these and we are going to let it happen \nanyway.\n  Mr. President, I realize I have used my time, and I do appreciate \nthat my colleagues have let us have a full debate on this.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have given Senators now a chance to air \nthese grievances and raise questions and engage in a pretty full debate \non the nomination of Chris Hill. I appreciate the issues my colleague \nhas raised. I know he is deeply concerned about these, and has been one \nof the leaders in the Senate on the subject of human rights. We all \nrespect that and we are determined in the course of our hearings and in \nthe course of the work of the committee to keep that issue front and \ncenter, not just with respect to North Korea but with every country \nwhere those issues exist.\n  I do think it is unfair to suggest that Ambassador Chris Hill has \ndone anything less than meet the standards we would expect with respect \nto his stewardship, both with the six-party talks as well as in the \nrest of his career, and I have talked about that a great deal.\n\n[[Page S4498]]\n\nWe have heard the arguments and now is the time to vote. We need an \nambassador in Iraq. We need this ambassador in Iraq.\n  This should not be a controversial nomination. Ambassador Hill is a \nproven expert negotiator. He is a problem solver and one of the best \ndiplomats we have in the corps. As has been discussed, he has a great \ndeal of experience with the skills that matter the most for the \nresolution of the remaining issues in Iraq, and he has been \nparticularly involved in ethnic and sectarian conflicts not unlike \nthose he will face when he gets over there. He has worked on multiparty \ninternational negotiations, and he is going to have to bring every \nskill he has learned in the fullness of his career to this task.\n  Particularly, I want to say we join Senator Brownback in expressing \nthe full concern of every Member of the Senate that we give meaning to \nthe words ``never again.'' That is a solemn responsibility. It is a \nsolemn responsibility particularly on this Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n  But it is also clear from the record, from Secretary Rice's own \nwords, that the decision to leave the Special Envoy for Human Rights \nout of these negotiations was not made by Chris Hill and we should not, \nin our votes today, hold that decision of his superiors against Chris \nHill. It was a decision which Secretary Rice has spoken to publicly and \nI think we have addressed the major concern that was raised by the \nSenator from Kansas.\n  We have also shown the fullness of Chris Hill's own record on human \nrights and I think that record speaks for itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair and look forward to this vote. I hope it \nwill be an overwhelming vote in favor of our ambassador to Iraq.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nmotion with respect to the motion to proceed to S. 386 be withdrawn, \nand that on Wednesday, following a period of morning business, the \nSenate proceed to the consideration of Calendar No. 28, S. 386.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. There will be no further rollcall votes today, of course \nafter the Hill vote. Tomorrow we will consider financial fraud \nlegislation. I encourage those Members who have indicated to the \nmanagers interest in offering amendments or coming to speak on the \nbill, that they do that. I have spoken to the Republican leader today. \nHe said he believes there are a number of amendments--not long in \nnumber--that the Republicans wish to offer. We solicit those \namendments. There could be several amendments from this side also. It \nwould be good if we could get to legislating on this tomorrow.\n  I also say I think it set a good tone. We should not have to file \ncloture on every motion to proceed. I appreciate very much the \nRepublicans not necessitating that wasteful vote. This bill has been on \nthe calendar and available since March 5. No one has to be concerned \nabout not having seen this financial fraud legislation.\n  Members who have amendments should be ready to go forward with them \ntomorrow morning.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Christopher R. Hill, of Rhode Island, a \nCareer Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career Minister, \nto be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the United States \nof America to the Republic of Iraq?\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I have come to the floor to talk for a \nmoment about the unprecedented flooding that has occurred in the State \nof North Dakota in recent weeks. My colleague, Senator Conrad, \ndiscussed it some yesterday, and I want to discuss it as well.\n  We have had flood disaster assistance now approved for 38 of North \nDakota's 53 counties, and it has been the most unprecedented, \nunbelievable flooding we have ever seen in the State of North Dakota. \nThis chart I have in the Chamber shows, in red, the counties that have \nbeen declared disaster areas as a result of flooding. You can see it \ncovers nearly three-fourths of the State of North Dakota. And we have \nhad more snow, more moisture, more difficulty, more blizzards, and so \non, and the rivers across our State have exceeded their banks and \nthreatened very dramatic flooding, which I am going to talk about some \ntoday. But before I talk about the water, I want to talk about the \npeople of North Dakota.\n  The unprecedented flooding that has driven people from their homes \nand caused so much damage and so much difficulty for so long has caused \npeople in North Dakota to come together to do the most unusual things I \nhave ever seen.\n  At midnight one night, I peered down the stairs of what is called the \nFARGODOME to see this large expanse. Inside this large dome building, \nat near midnight, I peered down on that floor, and there were thousands \nand thousands of people on the floor of that dome filling sandbags. \nThey filled 3\\1/2\\ million sandbags in about 5\\1/2\\ days--3\\1/2\\ \nmillion sandbags in 5\\1/2\\ days. And they did not hire anybody to do \nthat; they just put out a notice on the radio to say: We need people, \nand people showed up. The most unbelievable thing in Fargo, ND, was to \nwatch what they did with just the people power that showed up. No one \nthought a group of people could do that, but they did--3\\1/2\\ million \nsandbags.\n\n[[Page S4499]]\n\n  The Anne Carlsen School over in Jamestown, ND--on the James River \nthat began flooding--the Anne Carlsen School previously, many years \nago, was called the Crippled Children's School. Children who are in \nthat school need a great deal of care. There needed to be an evacuation \nof the Anne Carlsen School. Eighty athletes from the college and the \nhigh school showed up, and in 4 hours, not just the children but the \nspecial beds and special equipment and all the things that are \nnecessary to help take care of those children was moved to higher \nground and moved to safer quarters.\n  It is unbelievable that people all over our State just showed up. \nWhen all of these volunteers were out there walking the dikes--and \nparticularly the National Guard that walked all of those dikes on the \nRed River especially, and now in Valley City, which has very high \nlevels at the moment and is in a very difficult circumstance--we had \nall of those people involved 24 hours a day.\n  As is very typical in a State such as mine, hundreds and hundreds of \npeople decided that one way they could participate is to prepare hot \ndishes and casseroles and meals. I was in meetings where people would \nshow up with big platters of homemade sandwiches. I know volunteers who \nworked for hour after hour on end would find that people would show up \nwith casseroles and hot dishes, as they call them in our part of the \ncountry. One of the ways you fight floods as well is to feed those who \nare hungry out there in the dike lines and out there who are \nsandbagging.\n  Let me show a couple of the sites from the Red River Valley. This is \na photograph of a National Guard helicopter. I cannot say enough about \nthe National Guard and how critically important they have been to this \nflood fight.\n  But, as you can see from this picture, this area is as flat as a \ntable top. Someone once described the Red River and the Red River \nValley as a table top with a scratch in it, the scratch being the Red \nRiver. You can see there is not a hill in sight. This is totally, \ncompletely flat. You see water simply spreads everywhere. Here is a \nfarmstead completely surrounded by water. That is in the Red River \nValley of North Dakota.\n  In Pembina, ND--and by the way, this Red River runs north and runs \nout of North Dakota at Pembina into Lake Winnipeg--you will see the \ncity of Pembina is surrounded by water. As shown in this picture, this \nis an interstate highway surrounded by water. The folks in Pembina, \nalmost every year, have to fight these floodwaters, and this year was \nno different.\n  As reported in the Valley City Times Record, a substantial portion of \nValley City had to be evacuated. In the middle of this unbelievable \nfight in Valley City--and by the way, that is on the Sheyenne River--\nthe fight to the finish line here was with so many volunteers to build \ndikes and to try to do what is necessary to save the city of Valley \nCity. I walked into the Valley City Winter Show facility and saw once \nagain an unbelievable sandbagging operation. Just blowing the city \nwhistle and putting out a notice over the radio meant that people \nflocked to the area where they were needed to fill sandbags. In Valley \nCity, even as I speak, they are still fighting those floodwaters. As \nshown in this picture, this is part of the diking around Valley City, \nas you can see. This happens to be the Sheyenne River. I mentioned the \nRed River Valley, which is the Red River. The Red River runs north, one \nof the only rivers in America that run north. The headwaters are in the \nsouthern part of North Dakota and South Dakota, so the headwaters are \nsouth and the river runs north. But this is the Sheyenne River, which \nthen eventually runs into the Red River as well. That happens to be the \nValley City issue.\n  This is a picture of Fargo, ND. This photograph is all water. \nObviously, this house is flooded. But we had the Coast Guard there. We \nhad propeller boats evacuating people. It is an unbelievable sight.\n  This is a copy of the Bismarck Tribune: ``Forces of Nature.'' It \nshows a number of head of cattle simply gathered here on the only piece \nof dry ground, stranded by all of the water.\n  Of course, Linton, ND, a little community, a smaller community south \nof Bismarck, was hit with a significant flood.\n  Beulah and Hazen were hit with a significant flood, and Bismarck, ND, \nwith ice jams, has a threat to a substantial portion of that city of a \nwall of 3 or 3\\1/2\\ feet of water that would inundate the southern part \nof that city if the ice jams broke.\n  All of these communities were facing those kinds of challenges.\n  Ransom County, ND. This is dead cattle shown in this picture. We do \nnot know the count yet of how many dead head of livestock we will have, \nbut it will be plenty, and our ranchers will have suffered a \nsubstantial amount. In addition to the dead livestock that is going to \nhappen, we will have, undoubtedly, more than 3 million acres of ground \nthat cannot be planted this year because of water--another difficulty \nas a result of this flood to the agriculture community.\n  As shown in this picture, this is one block from Main Street in \nBeulah, ND. I will be in Beulah on Saturday of this week. Here is the \nthreat that Beulah faced, a city in the center of our State, and all of \nthese communities: Valley City, Lisbon, La Moure, Fort Ransom, Mott, \nBeulah, Linton, Bismarck--and the list goes on--Pembina. All of these \ncities faced very substantial flooding this year.\n  Here, shown in this picture, is a feed lot west of Mandan, ND, with a \ncouple dogs and a bucket. All you can see is water because that is all \nthere was because of complete total flooding.\n  This is a photograph of a flooded yard and outbuilding in Fargo, ND, \nwith a dog looking over the dikes.\n  Let me say the Corps of Engineers has done a masterful job. Let me \nalso say the mayor and the vice mayor and the folks in Fargo and so \nmany other communities have done an extraordinary job. The mayor of \nValley City even today is continuing to fight this fight. If you go \ninto a fight, a flood fight, you want the Corps of Engineers on your \nside because they have sent hundreds of people into our State to try to \nfight these floods.\n  This is a photograph of sandbagging, in this case by National \nGuardsmen, in Bismarck, ND.\n  This is a photograph of the dropping of 2,000-pound sandbags in areas \nof the dike that were about to breach, dropping from a helicopter \n2,000-pound sandbags into a crevice to see if they could stop a breach.\n  These are just a few of the challenges we have faced in so many \ndifferent communities: Jamestown, La Moure, Linton, Beulah/Hazen, Mott, \nFort Ransom--so many other communities.\n  I want to say that I think almost everyone in North Dakota has been \noverwhelmed by what the notion of being a good neighbor really means. \nIt means showing up, just showing up when you are needed--not because \nsomebody asked you to but because you just felt you should because it \nwas part of the destiny and the future of your community to be involved \nin fighting floodwaters.\n  This is a natural disaster, and it is going to take some long while \nfor our State to recover. But our State is a community of interests \nthat has made me enormously proud. The folks who settled the northern \nGreat Plains are pretty special people. My ancestors showed up there \nfrom Europe a long, long time ago and pitched a tent on the prairies \nand raised a family and then built a house and started a farm. That is \nthe way they started populating the prairies of the northern Great \nPlains.\n  In North Dakota, they still look after each other when times are \ntough. And this is about as tough a time as I have ever seen in my \nlifetime in the State of North Dakota with respect to natural \ndisasters. We know that 12 years ago, in 1997, the city of Grand Forks \nfaced a flood and the dike breached and the city of 50,000 people was \nevacuated. It was the largest evacuation of a major city at that time \nsince the Civil War. We well understand a flood fight, well understand \nthe consequences of natural disasters and flooding, and I am proud to \nsay Grand Forks has come roaring back as a city.\n  I am also proud to say the cities of Fargo and Moorhead and Wahpeton \nand Breckenridge and others have fought back these floodwaters, and we \ndid not have a breach in the dike, so that a major portion of the \ncities were protected. But other areas were not. The mayor of Oxbow, \nND, for example--I recall standing on a dike with him, and\n\n[[Page S4500]]\n\nhis eyes were full of tears as he recalled and recounted the fight they \nfought and lost in some areas because they simply could not hold back \nthe waters.\n  There are so many stories and so much misery as a result of a natural \ndisaster, but I think there is also a second side to it, and that is a \nvery inspirational side of what people can do for each other and with \neach other to try to deal with these difficult times. The one thing \nabout life is, success is pretty easy to handle. The question is, How \ndo you handle things when times get a little tough?\n  I wanted to say I am so proud of the people of my State, the State I \nam privileged to represent. We have a lot now to do with the Corps of \nEngineers, with future water projects, and the kinds of protections \nthat are needed to be improved for future flood protection. That will \ncome at a different moment in the weeks and months ahead, but for now I \nsimply wanted to describe to my colleagues some of the circumstances we \nfaced in our State and especially the stories about what people did \ntogether to try to make a big difference, fighting back the waters of \nthese many rivers that exceeded their banks and caused such havoc in \nmany of our communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4500-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4500-S4501]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JOHN HOPE FRANKLIN\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I would like to take some time today and \ntalk a little bit about an individual for whom I have great admiration \nwho passed away without much comment from this body last month, John \nHope Franklin, I think perhaps the most eminent Black historian in \nAmerica. Even that does not do justice to John Hope Franklin, one of \nthe most eminent historians in our country, who happened to be of \nAfrican-American descent.\n  I make these comments as someone who spent a good deal of my life as \na writer and dedicated to examining American history, and also I make \nthem in the spirit that our Attorney General offered when he said: \nMaybe we should have a little more courage when we are talking about \nissues like race in America.\n  It is interesting to take a look at the paper this morning and see \nthe Pulitzer Prizes that were awarded this year, the Pulitzer Prize for \nhistory being awarded to Annette Gordon-Reed for a book entitled ``The \nHemingses of Monticello: An American Family,'' which ties into the \ncontinuing saga of Thomas Jefferson; and for general nonfiction, a book \nentitled ``Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black \nAmericans From the Civil War To World War II,'' by Douglas A. Blackmon, \nwhich is another examination of the situation of Black America in the \nAmerican South.\n  Those are both important contributions to our understanding of \nAmerican history. When I look at John Hope Franklin, who died at the \nage of 94 last month, and the contributions he made and the environment \nin which he grew up and basically conquered through his success, I look \nat an individual who had a lot of impact on me when I was a young man \ntrying to put the history of the American South into some context \nbecause John Hope Franklin had the courage to not only address Black \nhistory but to place it into the context of American history, not to \ndeal with it as a separate issue.\n  There is a very fine obituary that was written in the Economist April \n4 edition which outlined a lot of the high points and the challenges of \nJohn Hope Franklin's life. I ask unanimous consent this obituary be \nprinted at the end of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WEBB. I am going to hit a couple of points in this obituary, then \nI want to talk about the American South as John Hope Franklin \nunderstood it and where we are today, White and Black.\n  John Hope Franklin grew up in Oklahoma. His father moved to Oklahoma \nwhen he was 6 years old to practice law. He had his own challenges in \nthat environment during the Jim Crow laws. He then went to Fisk \nUniversity, was an outstanding scholar, got a doctorate at Harvard. He \nbecame the first African American to lead an all-White history \ndepartment at Brooklyn College.\n  He later taught at the University of Chicago, and as the Economist \npointed out:\n\n       Unlike many after him, he did not see ``black history'' as \n     an independent discipline and never taught a formal course on \n     it. What he was doing was revising American history as a \n     whole. His books, especially ``From Slavery to Freedom'' \n     which was first published in 1947, offered Americans their \n     first complete view of themselves.\n\n  When I was at Georgetown Law Center, after I left the Marine Corps, \nand was studying on my own stead, sort of an avocation, of ethnic \nsettlement patterns in America, I was being confronted with a lot of \nrhetoric that had come out of people who did not understand the \nAmerican South, who did not really understand that, in truth, the \nAmerican South has never been White against Black, even during its \nworst times. It was more a three-tiered than a two-tiered society. It \nwas a small veneer of White aristocrats in many ways manipulating White \nagainst Black.\n  White and Black in the majority of the American South economically \ndiffered very little at all. I started reading John Hope Franklin's \nclassic book, ``From Slavery to Freedom.'' I saw that he was an \nintellectually honest observer, a passionate observer of true history, \nand he commented in this book on that in 1860, at the height of slavery \nright before the Civil War began.\n  Region-wide, less than 5 percent of the Whites in the South owned \nslaves. If you think about what the American perception is on the issue \nof South versus slavery, you will realize what an astounding statistic \nthat happens to be. He also went on to say:\n\n       Fully three-fourths of the white people of the South had \n     neither had slaves nor an immediate economic interest in the \n     maintenance of slavery or the plantation system.\n\n  So contrary to a lot of rhetoric today and a lot of misunderstanding, \nJohn Hope Franklin was giving an actual context that in the South, \nfully 75 percent of the Whites living alongside Blacks during the Civil \nWar and afterwards had never benefitted from slavery or had never \nparticipated in it as an economic institution.\n  The aftermath of the Civil War was a very difficult time for the \nAmerican South, White and Black. As I wrote in my book ``Born \nFighting,'' between the end of the Civil War and the beginning of World \nWar II, the South was basically an owned place. It was a colonized \nplace and, in fact, it was colonized doubly. It was colonized from the \noutside, an entire region owned from the outside in its basic \ninfrastructure, its banking systems, its schools not properly funded, \nand it was also colonized from the inside.\n  This is the area that we see so many historians commenting on even \ntoday; that is, the planters society, early, before the Civil War, \nbecame, in many ways, this aristocracy that kept White and Black down \nat the same time, and it has taken us a very long time to get past \nthat.\n  In 1933, President Roosevelt published probably the most \ncomprehensive document on the economic conditions of the American South \nthat has ever been written. He pointed out in this document in 1933, \nthe educational base of the South has been decimated, White and Black. \nIlliteracy in the South was five times as high in the North Central \nStates and more than double the rate in New England than the Middle \nAtlantic States.\n  The total endowments of all of the colleges and universities in the \nSouth were less than the combined endowments of Harvard and Yale alone. \nThe South was being required to educate one-third of the Nation's \nchildren with one-sixth of the Nation's school revenues. The richest \nState in the South in 1933 ranked lower in per-capita income than the \npoorest State outside the region.\n  In 1933, the average annual income in the South was only $314, while \nthe rest of the country averaged more than $600. This report pointed \nout, importantly, using the terms of the time:\n\n       Whites and Negroes have suffered alike. Of the 1.8 million \n     tenant families in the region, about 66 percent are white \n     [the South's population at this time was 71 percent white] . \n     . . half of the sharecroppers are white, living under \n     conditions almost identical with those of Negro \n     sharecroppers.\n\n  The region had 28 percent of the country's population. In 1937 it had \n11 percent of the Nation's bank deposits.\n\n[[Page S4501]]\n\nSo this was a region, all the way into World War II, where you had \nlegal separation, which we were able to overcome through the Civil \nRights Movement and through a lot of very courageous people, John Hope \nFranklin among them.\n  But once you get past the legal restrictions, the economic conditions \namong a preponderance of the population were basically the same. But \nthis has provided downstream implications for both African Americans \nand people of European descent in the American South.\n  When I was in law school in 1974, the National Opinion Research \nCenter at the University of Chicago did a study on White ethnic groups, \nbroke them down by 17 different criteria. White Baptists, which \nbasically are a population that has descended out of the American South \nthrough the Scotch-Irish migration--of which I wrote in ``Born \nFighting''--averaged 10.7 years of education. Blacks nationwide \naveraged 10.6 years of education. So the point to be made is that for \nboth of these groups with a very common heritage, once we set aside, as \nwe have, the legal disparities that tormented the South for so long, \nhave very similar challenges in terms of breaking down generational \ncycles.\n  In the obituary from the Economist that was written about John Hope \nFranklin, this point was made:\n\n       Militancy was not in his nature. He was too scrupulous a \n     historian for that, and too courteous a man. Asked whether he \n     hated the South, he would say, on the contrary, he loved it. \n     His deepest professional debt was to a white man, Ted \n     Currier, who had inspired him to study history and had given \n     him $500 to see him through Harvard.\n\n  I would say, as we remember this truly brilliant American, that he \nnot only loved the South, he understood it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [From the Economist, Apr. 4, 2009]\n\n                           John Hope Franklin\n\n       His chief pleasures were contemplative and patient. With \n     watering can and clippers, he would potter in his greenhouse \n     among hundreds of varieties of orchids. Or, standing in a \n     river, he would wait for hours until a fish tickled his line. \n     These were, one could say, typical historian's amusements; \n     very close, in rhythm and character, to the painstaking, \n     careful accumulation of tiny pieces of fact.\n       And yet what John Hope Franklin collected, over a lifetime \n     of scholarship, were scraps of horror. Five dollars for the \n     cost of a branding iron. A deed of sale, in Virginia in 1829, \n     for a male slave ``of a yellow colour'' who ``is not in the \n     habit of running away''. Or the testimony from 1860 of Edward \n     Johnson, a black child apprentice:\n       ``I was tacon and plased with a rope a round my rists my \n     back intiarly naked and swong up then and there Each of [the \n     men] tuck a cow hide one on Either side and beet me in such a \n     manner when they let me down I fanted and lay on the ground 2 \n     hours.''\n       To these Mr Franklin could add from his own experience. The \n     train journey to Checotah, Oklahoma, when he was six, that \n     ended when his mother refused to move from the whites-only \n     carriage. His father's small law office in Tulsa, reduced to \n     rubble after a race riot in 1921. The day he was told by a \n     white woman whom he was helping, at 12, across the road, that \n     he should take his ``filthy hands'' off her. And the warm \n     evening when he went to buy ice cream in Macon, Mississippi--\n     a tall 19-year-old student from Fisk University, scholarly in \n     his glasses--only to find as he left the store that a semi-\n     circle of white farmers had formed to block his exit, \n     silently implying that he should not try to break through \n     their line.\n       Academia offered no shelter. He excelled from high school \n     onwards, eventually earning a doctorate at Harvard and \n     becoming, in 1956, the first black head of an all-white \n     history department at a mostly white university, Brooklyn \n     College. Later, the University of Chicago recruited him. But \n     in Montgomery, Louisiana, the archivist called him a \n     ``Harvard nigger'' to his face. In the state archives in \n     Raleigh, North Carolina, he was confined to a tiny separate \n     room and allowed free run of the stacks because the white \n     assistants would not serve him. At Duke in 1943, a university \n     to which he returned 40 years later as a teaching professor, \n     he could not use the library cafeteria or the washrooms.\n       Whites, he noted, had no qualms about ``undervaluing an \n     entire race''. Blacks were excluded both from their \n     histories, and from their understanding of how America had \n     been made. Mr Franklin's intention was to weave the black \n     experience back into the national story. Unlike many after \n     him, he did not see ``black history'' as an independent \n     discipline, and never taught a formal course in it. What \n     he was doing was revising American history as a whole. His \n     books, especially ``From Slavery to Freedom'' (1947), \n     offered Americans their first complete view of themselves.\n\n\n                        Thomas Jefferson's wine\n\n       Militancy was not in his nature. He was too scrupulous a \n     historian for that, and too courteous a man. Asked whether he \n     hated the South, he would say, on the contrary, that he loved \n     it. His deepest professional debt was to a white man, Ted \n     Currier, who had inspired him to study history and had given \n     him $500 to see him through Harvard. Yet, alongside the \n     dignity and the ready smiles, a sense of outrage burned. He \n     longed to tell white tourists thronging Washington that the \n     Capitol had been built by slaves, and that Pennsylvania \n     Avenue had held a slave market, ``right by where the \n     Smithsonian is''. Profits made possible by enslaving blacks \n     had not only allowed Thomas Jefferson to enjoy fine French \n     wines: they had also underpinned America's banks, its \n     economic dynamism and its dominance in the world. The \n     exploitation of blacks was something he admitted he had \n     ``never got over''.\n       Nor had America got over it, despite the march from Selma, \n     in which Mr Franklin led a posse of historians, and Brown v \n     Board of Education, where he lent his scholarship to help \n     prove that the Framers had not meant to impose segregation on \n     the public schools. The ``colour line'', as he called it, \n     remained ``the most tragic and persistent social problem'' \n     the country faced. His own many black firsts--president of \n     the American Historical Association and the Southern \n     Historical Association, membership of Washington's Cosmos \n     Club--had not necessarily opened the door to others. The \n     night before he received the Presidential Medal of Freedom in \n     1995, a woman at the Cosmos Club asked him to fetch her coat. \n     He was overjoyed by Barack Obama's election, but could not \n     forget the poor, immobile blacks revealed by Hurricane \n     Katrina.\n       He yearned to improve things, but wondered how Financial \n     reparations he was doubtful about; apologies seemed trifling. \n     Only time, in historical quantities, seemed likely to make a \n     difference. For some months he was chairman of Bill Clinton's \n     Initiative on Race, a disorganized effort that ended by \n     recommending ``community co-operation''. Hostile letters \n     poured in, mostly from people who did not think the subject \n     worth talking about. Mr Franklin took them in his stride.

Today, we remember the \nhorrific events of over half a century ago, when more than 6 million \nJewish men, women, and children were targeted and systematically \nmurdered, along with countless other victims of Nazi persecution. \nToday, we honor their memories and renew our commitment to stand up \nagainst prejudice and hatred in all its forms.\n  In 1980, Congress passed legislation that would dedicate this week \nevery year to Holocaust Remembrance, so that Americans all over our \ncountry could come together and pay tribute to those who perished, and \nto ensure their stories will never be forgotten. This same legislation \ncreated the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, a building that now stands \nin our Nation's Capital as a center of Holocaust education and learning \nand a memorial to its victims. Today, the names of some of those who \nperished will be read aloud in the Museum's Hall of Remembrance, and on \nThursday, Holocaust survivor and Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel will join \nPresident Barack Obama and congressional leaders in a ceremony in the \nCapitol Rotunda.\n  Even now, so many decades later, we continue to uncover more stories \nof untold brutality and terror during the Holocaust, as work by the \nInternational Institute for Holocaust Research at the Yad Vshem \nHolocaust Museum exposes new evidence of Nazi genocide. These little-\nknown cases are even more poignant today, as we consider the renewed \nstruggle against anti-Semitism and continued denial by some of the \nState of Israel's very right to exist.\n  Next week, on April 29, we will celebrate 61 years since the \nestablishment of Israeli independence, and 61 years of unwavering U.S.-\nIsraeli friendship. Last year, I was proud to lead the Senate in \nadopting a bipartisan resolution to honor Israel in its achievement of \n60 years of statehood, and its resilience as a stronghold of democratic \nprinciples and freedoms in a volatile region. Although Israel remains \nunder constant siege from neighboring states and terrorist groups, its \nunwavering dedication to these ideals and its proud history of survival \ndemonstrate that Israel will endure and it will do so with the United \nStates standing firmly by its side.\n  Today, as we both remember those who perished in the Holocaust and \nlook\n\n[[Page S4502]]\n\ntoward the coming celebration of Israel's independence, let us reflect \nupon the imperative we face. Since the establishment of the term \n``genocide'' in 1944, the terrible events in former Yugoslavia, Rwanda, \nand now ongoing in Sudan have taught us what will continue to happen \nwhen hatred and persecution go unchecked. The day of Yom Hashoah calls \nupon each one of us to work individually and collectively to rededicate \nourselves to overcoming intolerance, and--perhaps just as important--\nindifference, wherever and whenever we encounter them.\n  To the vibrant Jewish community that calls our great state of Nevada \nhome, I wish you a joyous celebration of the 61st anniversary of \nIsraeli independence, and I look forward to many more years of \nproductive friendship between the United States and Israel. And to all \nwho gather today and all of this week to pay tribute to the victims and \nsurvivors of the Holocaust, let us join together in honoring their \nmemories and pledging to take up our shared mission of remembrance and \naction.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I rise today for the solemn \npurpose of commemorating Holocaust Remembrance Day.\n  I just returned from an overseas visit with Senators Levin and \nCollins to examine missile defense issues in Russia, the Czech \nRepublic, and Poland. In Poland, I visited the Warsaw Ghetto memorials, \none of which was built on the location where the Jews were transported \nto the death camp at Treblinka, beginning in July 1942. I was moved by \nvisiting that place. We saw another monument built to the heroes of the \nWarsaw Ghetto uprising. The death camps would not be liberated until \n1945, but we remember this courageous struggle against overwhelming \nodds.\n  In America and throughout the world, Jews are observing this day in \nsynagogues, reciting prayers. Young people listen to the testimonies of \nsurvivors who witnessed and were victims of the worst crimes committed \nby humankind, so that the Holocaust is not forgotten by future \ngenerations.\n  Florida has the largest number of Holocaust survivors in the entire \ncountry. These survivors remind us that the Holocaust was a tragedy of \nalmost unimaginable proportions.\n  Today we remember those who lost their lives, not because of any \ncrime they committed, but simply because of their faith and their \nheritage. And, though Jews were indeed the primary victims, we also \nremember the others who suffered persecution and were murdered by the \nNazis: Gypsies and Poles, Jehovah's Witnesses, the handicapped, gays, \npolitical dissidents and Soviet prisoners of war.\n  In addition to marking this day, we in Congress are doing what we can \nto ensure that we never forget what happened during the Holocaust and \nthat it never happens again.\n  Earlier this year, two of my distinguished colleagues, Senators \nCollins and Cardin, introduced an important resolution that I \ncosponsored, which condemns anti-Semitism in all its forms.\n  In respect for the victims of the Holocaust and surviving relatives, \nI will introduce a resolution on restitution or compensation for \nproperty and other assets seized by the Nazi and Communist regimes in \npostwar Europe, in anticipation of the International Conference on \nHolocaust Assets that will be held in Prague at the end of June. This \nconference is a followup to the International Conference that was held \n10 years ago in Washington, which established the framework \ncompensation programs that were established throughout western Europe \nduring the past decade.\n  I would point out that we still must determine how to address the \ncases of the remaining Holocaust victims who have yet to be compensated \nfor the unpaid value of insurance policies they held before the war. I \nwould support legislation that actually helps survivors to obtain just \ncompensation and avoid dragging out compensation efforts or giving \nfalse hope to survivors.\n  I will also be introducing the World War II War Crimes Accountability \nAct to encourage foreign governments to prosecute and extradite wanted \ncriminals, and to bring them to justice.\n  Despite the efforts of the U.S. Government, particularly the \nDepartment of Justice, and of groups such as the Simon Wiesenthal \nCenter, a number of perpetrators of crimes against humanity remain at \nlarge. What is worse, we know exactly where some of the individuals are \nliving, but the countries where they reside refuse to extradite them to \nface justice.\n  We are in a race against time. Each year, more Holocaust survivors \nare laid to rest. Let us work together quickly to let them see a \nmeasure of justice done in their lifetime.\n  Finally, our Government has made solemn commitments in the past that \nthe horror of the Holocaust will never be repeated. And yet we are all \nwell aware of the grim stories of ethnic cleansing in the former \nYugoslavia in the 1990s, the mass murder of Tutsis in Rwanda in 1994, \nand now the ongoing genocide in Darfur. America as a nation must be a \nleader on the world stage to prevent genocide.\n  I urge President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and UN Ambassador \nRice to continue the battle against ignorance, intolerance, and \ninstability that seem to contribute to genocide, and to confront those \ngovernments that engage in genocide. And America must make every effort \nto ensure that those who commit these horrific crimes face justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4502-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4502]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RETIREMENT OF RABBI SOIFER\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to recognize Rabbi Myra \nSoifer, who will retire on June 30, 2009, after 25 years of service to \nthe congregation of Temple Sinai in Reno, NV. Rabbi Soifer was one of \nthe first ten women ordained as a rabbi after the Reform Jewish \nmovement accepted them in 1972. A well accomplished scholar, she \nreceived her undergraduate degree from Lawrence University, her Masters \nin Hebrew Letters and ordination from Hebrew Union College in \nCincinnati, Ohio, and graduate work at the Pacific School of Religion \nin Berkeley, CA, and the Leo Baeck College Rabbinical School in London, \nEngland.\n  Rabbi Soifer has enriched her community with her grasp of the Torah \nand its teachings. Under her guidance, Temple Sinai has grown into a \nvibrant religious community with an expanded religious school and an \nenlarged campus that can accommodate both the congregation's largest \ngatherings as well as community meetings.\n  Besides being a dedicated spiritual leader for her congregants, she \nhas been a powerful voice for good in the community at large. Rabbi \nSoifer has been a fearless, driving force in bringing the greater faith \ncommunity together around prayer, and to address moral and political \nissues. She led Temple Sinai to help organize the Northern Nevada \ninterfaith response to the tragic events of 9/11. She has organized \nwomen in the faith community as the founder of the Reno Clergywomen's \nAssociation, and she created an interfaith clergy study group known as \nthe ``Study Buddies'', which has been going strong for over 20 years. \nThe community recognizes her as a passionate advocate for social \njustice, celebrating cultural and religious diversity, and caring for \nthe underserved locally and globally.\n  Her accomplishments have been recognized in many ways over the years, \nas she has been the recipient of the Metropolitan Community Church's \nHuman Rights Award; University of Nevada, Reno's Psychological Services \nAward; ACLU's Civil Libertarian of the Year; and Reno Magazine's ``88 \npeople to watch in '88'' Award. Her reach in the community goes beyond \nthe Temple's walls, having worked with the Washoe County School \nDistrict, Nevada Coalition Against the Death Penalty, Witness For \nPeace, Reno/Sparks Metro Ministry, Community Coalition to End Hate and \nViolence, Northern Nevada AIDS Foundation, Planned Parenthood of \nNorthern Nevada, Northern Nevada Black Cultural Awareness Society, and \nthe Food Bank of Northern Nevada.\n  I join with Nevadans throughout the Silver State to honor Rabbi Myra \nSoifer for her lifetime dedication to her faith, her community, and the \nsocial justice of all people. She has indisputably made a tremendous \nimpact which will endure in the institutions she has enriched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4502-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4502-S4503]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LEGACY OF CHICAGO'S ARTURO VELASQUEZ, SR.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, at the start of the Great Depression, a\n\n[[Page S4503]]\n\nMexican immigrant mother in Gary, IN, found herself with no job, no \nmoney and no food. So she did the only think she could think of: She \ndecided to pack up her young son and move back to Mexico, where they \nwould at least have something to eat.\n  Fortunately for the city of Chicago, which I am honored to represent, \nthe old Model T Ford they rode in overturned near Albuquerque, leaving \nthem stranded without money.\n  The mother took a job as a farm worker and they began migrating \nbetween sugar beet fields in the Black Hills of South Dakota and tomato \nfarms in Minnesota and Iowa.\n  Eventually, they landed in Chicago.\n  Over the next seven decades, that little boy, Arturo Velasquez, would \nbecome a civic treasure in Chicago: an entrepreneur, philanthropist, \nactivist, advisor to Chicago's leaders, and patriarch of one of \nChicago's leading Hispanic families.\n  Arturo Velasquez was dedicated to his family, his church, his \nbusiness, and the city of Chicago, especially the Mexican American \ncommunity on Chicago's South Side.\n  This past Friday, Mr. Velasquez passed on at the age of 93. But his \ninfluence will live on in the people he inspired, the lives he helped \nchange, and the opportunities he helped create for so many.\n  Mr. Velasquez was a gracious man. He was also humble. He used to \ndescribe himself as a ``jukebox operator.''\n  In fact, he owned one of Chicago's largest music and game firms, \nVelasquez Automated Music Co, which he founded more than 70 years ago. \nIt is run today by his son Ed and daughter Maria Elena.\n  In 1970, Mr. Velasquez helped another son, Art, found Azteca Foods, \nInc; which supplies thousands of groceries and restaurants with \ntortillas and other food products.\n  He played a key role in the establishment of the Mexican American \nChamber of Commerce, the Azteca Lions Club, the Illinois Federation of \nMexican Americans and many other business and civic groups.\n  Formal education was a luxury for Mr. Velasquez, as it is for many \nchildren of migrant workers.\n  He attended 13 different grade schools and he never went to high \nschool. But he was a strong advocate for education.\n  He was determined that all five of his children would graduate from \ncollege, and they did.\n  He also worked tirelessly for decades to provide other young people, \nespecially Mexican Americans, with the educational opportunities he \nhimself never received.\n  He served as a trustee for two colleges: the City Colleges of Chicago \nand National Louis University.\n  And a year ago, Chicago City Colleges' West Side Technical Institute, \nwhich Mr. Velasquez supported strongly, was renamed in his honor.\n  Arturo Velasquez continues to help others, even now.\n  His family asks that anyone wishing to honor his memory donate to two \ncauses that were important to him.\n  The first is the City Colleges of Chicago Foundation for Scholarships \nto the Arturo Velasquez West Side Technical Institute, a scholarship \nfund for Latinos in the 2-year technical education program who want to \ngo on to 4-year colleges.\n  The second cause is Alivio Medical Center, near and dear to my heart, \na community health center, founded by Mr. Velasquez's daughter Carmen, \nthat provides free health care to thousands of Chicago families each \nyear in the mostly Latino Pilsen, Little Village and Back of the Yards \nneighborhoods.\n  I cannot tell you how impressed I am with Carmen and her work at \nAlivio. The fact that her father inspired her and now wants to continue \nhelping her, even in his passing, says a lot about the family.\n  Mr. Velasquez received many well-deserved accolades including an \nhonorary doctorate for public service from St. Xavier University, and \nthe Ohtl Award from the Mexican government, the highest award to a \nMexican who lives outside that country.\n  And in 2002, he was honored by the Chicago Historical Society with \nits Making History Award.\n  But what meant most to Mr. Velasquez was his family.\n  He and his wife Shirley were married for 72 years. They were blessed \nwith five children, 11 grandchildren and 19 great-grandchildren.\n  As a young father, Mr. Velasquez dreamed of being able to provide his \nfamily with a home of their own.\n  It took a while. He bought an empty lot at 72nd Street and St. Louis \nAvenue in 1945. But he did not build a house on it until 1950.\n  Mrs. Velasquez once told a reporter, ``Every Sunday he would take the \nkids to the empty lot. He'd tell them, `Go jump on it. It's yours.' And \nI'd say, Can't you think of any other place to go?''\n  In 1959, Mr. Velasquez covered the White Sox for a Spanish-language \nnewspaper. That year, the Sox won their first division pennant in 40 \nyears, only to lose the World Series to the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n  In 2005, he saw his great-grandson Willy throw out the first pitch \nduring Game 2 of the division series.\n  He had tickets to every game of the playoffs.\n  And he saw his beloved White Sox, at last, win the World Series, \nanother dream come true for a man who made the dreams of so many others \npossible.\n  I want to express my deep condolences to his wife Shirley, their \nchildren, Art, Raymond, Carmen, Maria Elena and Edward, and their \ngrandchildren and great-grandchildren.\n  Arturo Velasquez was a gracious and generous man and a true community \nleader. He will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4503-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4503-S4504]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

Corporal Alleman died in the service \nto our country on February 23, 2009, of wounds suffered when insurgents \nattacked his unit using small arms in Iraq's Diyala Province. He was 32 \nyears old and is survived by his parents Boyd and Susan Alleman, his \nwife Amy, and their two sons Kai and Kennet.\n  Corporal Alleman served in the 5th Squadron, 1st Cavalry Regiment, \n1st Stryker Brigade Combat Team, 25th Infantry Division, Fort \nWainwright, AK.\n  Two years ago, Micheal Alleman decided to put his teaching career on \nhold to enlist in the U.S. Army. When he explained this decision to his \nfifth grade class at Nibley Elementary School, he said he wanted to be \nlike the Nation's first President, who left his career as a Virginia \nplanter to take up arms against the British monarchy. He said that \nGeorge Washington was his hero.\n  I am proud to talk about another American hero today, CPL Micheal \nAlleman. He defines what makes our Nation great. With absolute surety, \nhe exhibited a devotion to duty and sense of purpose that transcends \npersonal comfort and desire. Corporal Alleman heard his country's call \nto duty and in that service he gave his last full measure of devotion. \nHe gave his life so we can continue to remain safe and free each day.\n  As I read accounts from his family and friends, it was readily \napparent he was a tremendously selfless and caring man. He was \ndescribed as a man who deeply loved his family and cared about those \naround him. His family would bend over backward for anyone. It is no \nwonder he so readily decided to serve this Nation.\n  Let us not forgot the sacrifice of CPL Micheal Alleman. His service \nshould inspire everyone in this Chamber. I thank him for his service \nand pray for his family and friends during this tremendously difficult \ntime.

Madam President, today we are releasing the declassified \nreport of the Senate Armed Services Committee's investigation into the \ntreatment of detainees in U.S. custody. The report was approved by the \ncommittee on November 20, 2008, and has, in the intervening period, \nbeen under review at the Department of Defense for declassification.\n  In my judgment, the report represents a condemnation of both the Bush \nadministration's interrogation policies and of senior administration \nofficials who attempted to shift the blame for abuse--such as that seen \nat Abu Ghraib, Guantanamo Bay, and Afghanistan--to low ranking \nsoldiers. Claims, such as that made by former Deputy Secretary of \nDefense Paul Wolfowitz that detainee abuses could be chalked up to the \nunauthorized acts of a ``few bad apples,'' were simply false.\n  The truth is that, early on, it was senior civilian leaders who set \nthe tone. On September 16, 2001, Vice President Dick Cheney suggested \nthat the United States turn to the ``dark side'' in our response to 9/\n11. Not long after that, after White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales \ncalled parts of the Geneva Conventions ``quaint,'' President Bush \ndetermined that provisions of the Geneva Conventions did not apply to \ncertain detainees. Other senior officials followed the President and \nVice President's lead, authorizing policies that included harsh and \nabusive interrogation techniques.\n  The record established by the committee's investigation shows that \nsenior officials sought out information on, were aware of training in, \nand authorized the use of abusive interrogation techniques. Those \nsenior officials bear significant responsibility for creating the legal \nand operational framework for the abuses. As the committee report \nconcluded, authorizations of aggressive interrogation techniques by \nsenior officials resulted in abuse and conveyed the message that \nphysical pressures and degradation were appropriate treatment for \ndetainees in U.S. military custody.\n  In a May 10, 2007, letter to his troops, GEN David Petraeus said that \n``what sets us apart from our enemies in this fight . . . is how we \nbehave. In everything we do, we must observe the standards and values \nthat dictate that we treat noncombatants and detainees with dignity and \nrespect. While we are warriors, we are also all human beings.'' With \nlast week's release of the Department of Justice Office of Legal \nCounsel, OLC, opinions, it is now widely known that Bush administration \nofficials distorted Survival Evasion Resistance and Escape ``SERE'' \ntraining--a legitimate program used by the military to train our troops \nto resist abusive enemy interrogations--by authorizing abusive \ntechniques from SERE for use in detainee interrogations. Those \ndecisions conveyed the message that abusive treatment was appropriate \nfor detainees in U.S. custody. They were also an affront to the values \narticulated by General Petraeus.\n  In SERE training, U.S. troops are briefly exposed, in a highly \ncontrolled setting, to abusive interrogation techniques used by enemies \nthat refuse to follow the Geneva Conventions. The techniques are based \non tactics used by Chinese Communists against American soldiers during \nthe Korean war for the purpose of eliciting false confessions for \npropaganda purposes. Techniques used in SERE training include stripping \ntrainees of their clothing, placing them in stress positions, putting \nhoods over their heads, subjecting them to face and body slaps, \ndepriving them of sleep, throwing them up against a wall, confining \nthem in a small box, treating them like animals, subjecting them to \nloud music and flashing lights, and exposing them to extreme \ntemperatures. Until recently, the Navy SERE school also used \nwaterboarding. The purpose of the SERE program is to provide U.S. \ntroops who might be captured a taste of the treatment they might face \nso that they might have a better chance of surviving captivity and \nresisting abusive and coercive interrogations.\n\n[[Page S4505]]\n\n  SERE training techniques were never intended to be used in the \ninterrogation of detainees in U.S. custody. The committee's report, \nhowever, reveals troubling new details of how SERE techniques came to \nbe used in interrogations of detainees in U.S. custody.\n  The committee's investigation uncovered new details about the \ninfluence of SERE techniques on military interrogations at Guantanamo \nBay, Cuba--GTMO. According to newly released testimony from a military \nbehavioral scientist who worked with interrogators at GTMO, ``By early \nOctober [2002] there was increasing pressure to get `tougher' with \ndetainee interrogations'' at GTMO. (p. 50). As a result, on October 2, \n2002, 2 weeks after attending interrogation training led by SERE \ninstructors from the Joint Personnel Recovery Agency, JPRA, the DOD \nagency that oversees SERE training, the behavioral scientist and a \ncolleague drafted a memo proposing the use of aggressive interrogation \ntechniques at GTMO. The behavioral scientist said he was told by GTMO's \nintelligence chief that the interrogation memo needed to contain \ncoercive techniques or it ``wasn't going to go very far.'' (p. 50). \nDeclassified excerpts from that memo indicate that it included stress \npositions, food deprivation, forced grooming, hooding, removal of \nclothing, exposure to cold weather or water, and scenarios designed to \nconvince a detainee that ``he might experience a painful or fatal \noutcome.'' On October 11, 2002, MG Michael Dunlavey, the Commander of \nJTF-170 at GTMO, requested authority to use aggressive techniques. \nMajor General Dunlavey's request was based on the memo produced by the \nbehavioral scientists.\n  Major General Dunlavey's request eventually made its way to \nDepartment of Defense, DoD, General Counsel Jim Haynes' desk. \nNotwithstanding serious legal concerns raised by the military service \nlawyers, Haynes recommended that Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld \napprove 15 of the interrogation techniques requested by GTMO. On \nDecember 2, 2002, Secretary Rumsfeld approved Haynes' recommendation, \nauthorizing such techniques as stress positions, removal of clothing, \nuse of phobias--such as fear of dogs--and deprivation of light and \nauditory stimuli.\n  The committee's investigation revealed that, following Secretary \nRumsfeld's authorization, senior staff at GTMO drafted a standard \noperating procedure--SOP--for the use of SERE techniques, including \nstress positions, forcibly stripping detainees, slapping, and \n``walling'' them. That SOP stated that ``The premise behind this is \nthat the interrogation tactics used at U.S. military SERE schools are \nappropriate for use in real-world interrogations.'' Weeks later, in \nJanuary 2003, trainers from the Navy SERE school travelled to GTMO and \nprovided training to interrogators on the use of SERE techniques on \ndetainees. (pp. 98-104).\n  The influence of Secretary Rumsfeld's December 2, 2002, authorization \nwas not limited to interrogations at GTMO. Newly declassified excerpts \nfrom a January 11, 2003, legal review by a special mission unit, SMU, \nTask Force lawyer in Afghanistan state that ``SECDEF's approval of \nthese techniques provides us the most persuasive argument for use of \n`advanced techniques' as we capture possible [high value targets] . . . \nthe fact that SECDEF approved the use of the . . . techniques at GTMO, \n[which is] subject to the same laws, provides an analogy and basis for \nuse of these techniques [in accordance with] international and U.S. \nlaw.'' (p. 154).\n  The committee's report also includes a summary of a July 15, 2004, \ninterview with CENTCOM's then-Deputy Staff Judge Advocate, SJA, about \nSecretary Rumsfeld's authorization and its impact in Afghanistan. The \nDeputy SJA said: ``the methodologies approved for GTMO would appear to \nme to be legal interrogation processes. [The Secretary of Defense] had \napproved them. The General Counsel had approved them . . . I believe it \nis fair to say the procedures approved for Guantanamo were legal for \nAfghanistan.'' (p. 156).\n  The committee's report provides extensive details about how the \naggressive techniques made their way from Afghanistan to Iraq. In \nFebruary 2003, an SMU Task Force designated for operations in Iraq \nobtained a copy of the SMU interrogation policy from Afghanistan that \nincluded aggressive techniques, changed the letterhead, and adopted the \npolicy verbatim. (p. 158). Months later, the Interrogation Officer in \nCharge at Abu Ghraib obtained a copy of the SMU interrogation policy \nand submitted it, virtually unchanged, through her chain of command to \nCombined Joint Task Force 7--CJTF-7--led at the time by Lieutenant \nGeneral Ricardo Sanchez. On September 14, 2003, Lieutenant General \nSanchez issued an interrogation policy for CJTF-7 that authorized \ninterrogators to use stress positions, environmental manipulation, \nsleep management, and military working dogs to exploit detainees' fears \nin their interrogations of detainees.\n  The committee's investigation uncovered documents indicating that, \nalmost immediately after Lieutenant General Sanchez issued his \nSeptember 14, 2003, policy, CENTCOM lawyers raised concerns about its \nlegality. One newly declassified email from a CENTCOM lawyer to the \nStaff Judge Advocate at CJTF-7--sent just three days after the policy \nwas issued--warned that ``Many of the techniques [in the CJTF-7 policy] \nappear to violate [Geneva Convention] III and IV and should not be used \n. . .'' (p. 203). Even though the Bush administration acknowledged that \nthe Geneva Conventions applied in Iraq, it was not until nearly a month \nlater that CJTF-7 revised that policy.\n  Not only did SERE techniques make their way to Iraq, but SERE \ninstructors did as well. In September 2003, JPRA sent a team to Iraq to \nprovide assistance to interrogation operations at an SMU Task Force. \nThe Chief of Human Intelligence and Counterintelligence at the Task \nForce testified to the Committee in February 2008 that JPRA personnel \ndemonstrated SERE techniques to SMU personnel including so-called \n``walling'' and striking a detainee as they do in SERE school. (p. \n175). As we heard at our September 2008 hearing, JPRA personnel were \npresent during abusive interrogations during that same trip, including \none where a detainee was placed on his knees in a stress position and \nwas repeatedly slapped by an interrogator. (p. 176). JPRA personnel \neven participated in an interrogation, taking physical control of a \ndetainee, forcibly stripping him naked, and giving orders for him to be \nkept in a stress position for 12 hours. In August 3, 2007, testimony to \nthe committee, one of the JPRA team members said that, with respect to \nstripping the detainee, ``we [had] done this 100 times, 1000 times with \nour [SERE school] students.'' The committee's investigation revealed \nthat forced nudity continued to be used in interrogations at the SMU \nTask Force for months after the JPRA visit. (pp. 181-182).\n  Over the course of the investigation, the committee obtained the \nstatements and interviews of scores of military personnel at Abu \nGhraib. These statements reveal that the interrogation techniques \nauthorized by Secretary Rumsfeld in December 2002 for use at GTMO--\nincluding stress positions, forced nudity, and military working dogs--\nwere used by military intelligence personnel responsible for \ninterrogations.\n  The Interrogation Officer in Charge in Abu Ghraib in the fall of 2003 \nacknowledged that stress positions were used in interrogations at Abu \nGhraib. (p. 212).\n  An Army dog handler at Abu Ghraib told military investigators in \nFebruary 2004 that ``someone from [military intelligence] gave me a \nlist of cells, for me to go see, and pretty much have my dog bark at \nthem. . . . Having the dogs bark at detainees was psychologically \nbreaking them down for interrogation purposes.'' (p. 209).\n  An intelligence analyst at Abu Ghraib told military investigators in \nMay 2004 that it was ``common that the detainees on [military \nintelligence] hold in the hard site were initially kept naked and given \nclothing as an incentive to cooperate with us.'' (p. 212).\n  An interrogator told military investigators in May 2004 that it was \n``common to see detainees in cells without clothes or naked'' and says \nit was ``one of our approaches.'' (p. 213).\n  The investigation also revealed that interrogation policies \nauthorizing aggressive techniques were approved months after the CJTF-7 \npolicy was revised to exclude the techniques, and\n\n[[Page S4506]]\n\neven after the investigation into detainee abuses at Abu Ghraib had \nalready begun. For example, an interrogation policy approved in \nFebruary 2004 in Iraq included techniques such as use of military \nworking dogs and stress positions. (p. 220).\n  A policy approved for CJTF-7 units in Iraq in March 2004 also \nincluded aggressive techniques. While much of the March 2004 policy \nremains classified, newly declassified excerpts indicate that it warned \nthat interrogators ``should consider the fact that some interrogation \ntechniques are viewed as inhumane or otherwise inconsistent with \ninternational law before applying each technique. These techniques are \nlabeled with a [CAUTION].'' Among the techniques labeled as such were a \ntechnique involving power tools, stress positions, and the presence of \nmilitary working dogs. (pp. 220-221).\n  Some have asked why, if it is okay for our own U.S. personnel to be \nsubjected to physical and psychological pressures in SERE school, what \nis wrong with using those SERE training techniques on detainees? The \ncommittee's investigation answered that question.\n  On October 2, 2002, LTC Morgan Banks, the senior Army SERE \npsychologist warned against using SERE training techniques during \ninterrogations in an email to personnel at GTMO, writing that:\n\n       [T]he use of physical pressures brings with it a large \n     number of potential negative side effects . . . When \n     individuals are gradually exposed to increasing levels of \n     discomfort, it is more common for them to resist harder . . . \n     If individuals are put under enough discomfort, i.e. pain, \n     they will eventually do whatever it takes to stop the pain. \n     This will increase the amount of information they tell the \n     interrogator, but it does not mean the information is \n     accurate. In fact, it usually decreases the reliability of \n     the information because the person will say whatever he \n     believes will stop the pain . . . Bottom line: the likelihood \n     that the use of physical pressures will increase the delivery \n     of accurate information from a detainee is very low. The \n     likelihood that the use of physical pressures will increase \n     the level of resistance in a detainee is very high . . . (p. \n     53).\n\n  Likewise, the Deputy Commander of DOD's Criminal Investigative Task \nForce at GTMO told the committee in 2006 that CITF ``was troubled with \nthe rationale that techniques used to harden resistance to \ninterrogations would be the basis for the utilization of techniques to \nobtain information.'' (p. 69).\n  Other newly declassified emails reveal additional warnings. In June \n2004, after many SERE techniques had been authorized in interrogations \nand JPRA was considering sending its SERE trainers to interrogation \nfacilities in Afghanistan, another SERE psychologist warned: ``[W]e \nneed to really stress the difference between what instructors do at \nSERE school (done to INCREASE RESISTANCE capability in students) versus \nwhat is taught at interrogator school (done to gather information). \nWhat is done by SERE instructors is by definition ineffective \ninterrogator conduct . . . Simply stated, SERE school does not train \nyou on how to interrogate, and things you `learn' there by osmosis \nabout interrogation are probably wrong if copied by interrogators.'' \n(p. 229).\n  If we are to retain our status as a leader in the world, we must \nacknowledge and confront the abuse of detainees in our custody. The \ncommittee's report and investigation makes significant progress toward \nthat goal. There is still the question, however, of whether high level \nofficials who approved and authorized those policies should be held \naccountable. I have recommended to Attorney General Holder that he \nselect a distinguished individual or individuals--either inside or \noutside the Justice Department, such as retired federal judges--to look \nat the volumes of evidence relating to treatment of detainees, \nincluding evidence in the Senate Armed Services Committee's report, and \nto recommend what steps, if any, should be taken to establish \naccountability of high-level officials--including lawyers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4506-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4506-S4507]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO LINDSEY JEWELL\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the 5 years of \noutstanding service that Lindsey Jewell has provided to me in various \ncapacities in both my personal office, and on the Senate Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, of which I am ranking member. Ever \nsince Lindsey began working in my office in 2004, I have been \nconsistently impressed with her dedication, professionalism, and hard \nwork, and I am sad to see her leave the Senate.\n  While still a student at the University of Maine Orono, my alma \nmater, Lindsey began her Senate career as an intern in my Washington \noffice and thereafter as a staff assistant in my Bangor office. There, \nshe served as a key liaison between my office and Maine constituents, \nassisting them in solving their problems and concerns with the Federal \nGovernment. Lindsey's work on behalf of Mainers proved to be her true \npassion, and after graduating in 2005 with a B.A. in political science, \nshe came back to Washington, DC, to join my staff here.\n  Upon arriving in Washington, Lindsey hit the ground running as a \nlegislative correspondent, handling a hefty portfolio of issues ranging \nfrom taxes, budget, and banking to agriculture, immigration, and \nforeign affairs. Lindsey's stellar stand-out performance in dealing \nwith these issues led to her earning a promotion to Director of \nConstituent Correspondence in 2006. In this role, she oversaw all of my \noffice's legislative correspondents, helping me ensure that mail was \nresponded to in a thoughtful and timely manner. Through this position, \nLindsey gained immense experience dealing with a vast array of issues \nthe Senate faces. She also proved to be a capable, talented, and \namicable leader, who was a tremendous supervisor.\n  During the summer of 2007, Lindsey left my personal office and moved \nthree floors up in the Russell Building to serve as Senior Research \nAnalyst on the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship. \nAs ranking member of that committee, I continued to benefit from \nLindsey's wisdom and insight. That said, her departure certainly left a \nlarge void in my personal office. As Lindsey continued to provide me \nwith detailed and thorough materials on a range of small business \nissues, she once again earned a well-deserved promotion to Professional \nStaff Member early in 2008. In that capacity, Lindsey advised the \ncommittee on matters relating to women-owned businesses, small business \nenergy concerns, entrepreneurial development programs, and military \nbase redevelopment initiatives.\n  Lindsey was instrumental in my recently introducing the Defense \nCommunities Assistance Act of 2009, a key bill aimed at providing \nimmediate economic development benefits to all base communities, for \nboth closed and active military installations across the country. \nAdditionally, Lindsey helped me prepare an amendment to the fiscal year \n2010 budget resolution to ensure that small businesses receive adequate \nfunding under the Energy Star program. Lindsey's versatile nature and \nwillingness to assist her colleagues in any way possible led to her \ndrafting statements and press releases for a variety of committee \nhearings, bill introductions, and small business events, covering a \nhost of issues.\n  Lindsey's sense of humor and easy-goingness make her instantly \nlikeable. But more crucially, her responsible nature and advanced \nanalytical skills make her indispensable to anyone she is working for. \nAnd Lindsey is a true team player, never considering any task beneath \nher. Indeed, she was a key member of my office's softball team this \npast summer, someone equally feared and respected by opponents!\n  That is why I am deeply saddened that Lindsey will be leaving us this \nweek. But I am thrilled for Lindsey's future, as she will be marrying \nher long-term boyfriend, Patrick Hughes, in just a few weeks in \nPortland, ME. Pat, a Marine officer, and Lindsey will be moving to the \nSan Diego area shortly thereafter, where Pat will be stationed at Camp \nPendleton. I wish them both the best in married life, and hope that \nthey enjoy the beautiful California sunshine!\n  A native born Mainer, Lindsey Jewell is an incredibly talented \nperson. Coming from hard-working, community-oriented roots in the \nAroostook county town of Monticello in northern Maine, Lindsey displays \nthe classic values of our State: solidly dependable, intellectually \ncurious, and immensely industrious. I am proud to have had someone like \nLindsey on my staff, and even prouder to have gotten to know her\n\n[[Page S4507]]\n\nover the past several years. Her sincerity, thoughtfulness, creativity, \nand consideration of others will be sorely missed. Lindsey, thank you \nfor your service to Maine and America, and best wishes for your bright \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4507-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4507-S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, In mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I own a small construction business and, on the surface, \n     high prices do hurt my bottom line; however, that is not such \n     a bad thing. I have always been conscious about my personal \n     and worldwide energy use, but the fast rate of price increase \n     has made me even more, especially about my driving. My \n     driving efficiency has increased, and my total mileage for \n     the year has decreased several thousands of miles. This is a \n     good thing especially when I consider that everybody I am \n     talking to is thinking the same way. Statistics say Americans \n     are driving less; that is a good thing. It is good the people \n     get humbled and remember that every bit of energy and every \n     material object we use was made in the natural world and \n     refined using human intelligence; there are no freebies.\n       Americans need to plan a future without oil for energy. For \n     some reason, it is taboo to mention solar energy and subsidy \n     in the same sentence. Solar is the best hope for continuous \n     energy yet nobody wants to subsidize the fledgling industry. \n     Farmers and ethanol are subsidized, though they hate to admit \n     it; the coming second nuclear program will be fully \n     subsidized though they attempt to account around it. Even the \n     fossil fuel industry is subsidized, among other ways, by \n     being protected by the U.S. military. (Oil has caused all the \n     havoc in the Middle East, so Iraq and Afghanistan and all the \n     other military deployments acts of security for big oil). \n     Hundreds of billions go to these fruitlessly revolving \n     enterprises. Let us pay to get a nationwide solar plan fully \n     off the ground. Imagine if every single house south facing \n     roof was solar panels and all flat topped roofs were solar \n     panels, we could power the entire country without having to \n     build another structure. Subsidize and organize turning the \n     entire fleet of cars over to solar/battery/electric cars. It \n     would work. Ethanol is a joke, nuclear is a waste, wind is \n     like putting high rise buildings far into the countryside, \n     coal and gas and hydro could be back up to solar; to even the \n     load.\n     Pike, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our family has been working to get out of debt and have \n     breathing room to finally start saving for retirement; but \n     with the price of fuel going up daily, there is no way. In \n     fact we are sinking deeper in debt. We have to really \n     struggle with going to watch the grandchildren play ball or \n     buy groceries. We both have to drive quite a distance to our \n     work each week and now feel trapped. We love our home, but \n     cannot afford the commute, but with the housing market and \n     fuel costs, we cannot sell either! So we are still forced to \n     commute, going straight to where we stay when we go down for \n     our work and then our jobs and back again.\n       We have always been a nation of integrity, of a backbone, \n     fueled by necessity. If our government will get out of the \n     way and let her people do what we need to do to be self-\n     sufficient again, we will all be better off. It is so sad \n     that so many people think the only way we can make it is if \n     government controls, but when government controls we lose as \n     is shown by the dropping dollar and high fuel prices. We have \n     our own fuel and our own ingenuity, let us use it and refine \n     it.\n     Nancy.\n                                  ____\n\n       You may not want my input on the high energy prices, \n     because I see a lot of good coming from them. For one thing, \n     the air is a lot cleaner. Also, I would assume there are \n     fewer car accidents/deaths due to fewer cars on the roads. \n     People are improving their health because they are out there \n     walking, bicycling, etc. And I see them reaching out to help \n     one another. It is also forcing people to be more creative in \n     the ways that they are dealing with the higher price of \n     products/food. They are asking themselves, is it something \n     they want or do they actually need it. They are fixing up the \n     things they have instead of throwing them away and filling up \n     the landfill. To me, I see the high energy prices as a change \n     of direction. A good change of direction.\n       As for all the money that is being accumulated, I think it \n     would be best used on developing alternate forms of energy--\n     wind, solar etc. Drilling for more oil is just going to \n     extend the inevitable. The oil is going to run out and, while \n     we are waiting for it to run out, we will continue to destroy \n     the planet and ourselves.\n     Kathleen.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking for my experience with the recent \n     rapid rise in gasoline/energy prices. My husband and I are in \n     our mid-fifties, and remember the first ``energy crisis'' in \n     the mid 1970s when fuel prices more than doubled but were \n     still way below one dollar. I purchased my first car during \n     that time--a Toyota Corolla that got 36 mpg. My husband \n     reserved his Dodge van which had much lower mileage for only \n     special needs trips; then he purchased a Ford small truck \n     (made by Mazda) which got 35 mpg. It travelled anywhere in \n     Montana the big 4 wheel drives did with some weight in the \n     bed in winter. We have only driven fuel efficient vehicles \n     since, except for the special trip farm/plow vehicles.\n       At this time I drive 36 miles round trip from our rural \n     home to work at IDL in Sandpoint. The 2000 Honda CRV gets 29 \n     mpg with windows down and 27 mpg with windows up and internal \n     fan using heat or AC. I find I fill up every 10 days (extra \n     errands after work) and am spending perhaps an extra $1/day \n     on gas. Not a big deal.\n       My husband has telecommuted for his job as an electrical \n     engineer for the last 13 years so he rarely drives his \n     extremely fuel-efficient Honda Fit--a perfect commuter \n     vehicle for one person at 35+mpg. The little Kubota tractor \n     runs on diesel and uses perhaps 10 gallons per summer season. \n     We can absorb that. Our house is fully electric and electric \n     rates have stayed the same. Food at the grocery store has \n     been increasing for a year or two so we eat smarter and raise \n     our own meat.\n       By learning the lesson of the 1970s, we are not victim to \n     the fluctuations of the fossil fuel markets or contributing \n     greatly to the damages which result. Opening fragile and \n     deteriorating ecosystems to offshore drilling will not bring \n     down fuel prices--people are going to get used to them \n     anyway, as they always have. There are still plenty of large \n     expensive SUVs on the roads in Sandpoint.\n       If the country, led by Congress, would focus on funneling \n     money to alternative fuels and technologies to get off this \n     destructive bandwagon of the oil companies everyone could be \n     better off. Think about it and please start being a \n     constructive leader.\n     Jan.\n                                  ____\n\n       The energy crisis is hitting us like almost everyone in \n     Idaho. It is not bad enough that we are paying outrageous \n     prices at the pump but we are also paying nearly twice what \n     we were this time last year at the grocery store. In Idaho we \n     do not have mass transit to utilize so we are stuck paying \n     for the gas at the pump.\n       I did have one idea to help Idaho rely less on oil for \n     power. My husband works at the INL and we have seen the \n     negative publicity about nuclear power. The Federal \n     Government owns all that land, as I understand it is about \n     the size of Rhode Island. Why not put wind mills up out \n     there? That would be free power after paying for the wind \n     mills. There is probably enough area for wind mills that they \n     could power the entire state of Idaho without the use of \n     water or oil. You could most likely find some kind of federal \n     grant to help fund the wind mills. It is just one idea for \n     you to consider.\n     Gayle.\n                                  ____\n\n       I find it absolutely ridiculous that we cannot drill for \n     oil within the United States. I find it insane that we are \n     dependent on foreign sources. I find it ludicrous that \n     Congress refuses to do anything about the issue. I drive \n     forty miles to and from work each day. It is not much, but it \n     adds up quickly at $4.00+ a gallon. I cannot even pay at the \n     pump anymore, because the $75 limit on my credit card will \n     not fill my tank. I fully support the Drill Here, Drill Now, \n     Pay Less campaign. Please support any legislation that \n     increases our energy independence and gets the price down!\n     Dann, Rigby.\n                                  ____\n\n       This last school year 07-08 I lived in Twin Falls and \n     attended the College of Southern Idaho. We had four girls \n     living in our apartment. The first semester two of us had \n     vehicles and two of my roommates received help from their \n     parents. In January, those two roommates moved out and the \n     two that moved in did not receive financial help from their \n     parents either. Because of rising fuel costs we mostly walked \n     to campus even when it was cold because we could not afford \n     gas (campus is a good 25-35 minute walk one way). And when we \n     did go somewhere like to the grocery store we car pooled. We \n     only ate out if it was a special occasion but even then most \n     of the time we had large dinner parties at our apt and we had \n     every one bring something. But we made it! However with the \n     rising cost of everything, partially due to the\n\n[[Page S4508]]\n\n     rise in energy cost, this next year will be even harder. Yes, \n     we could take out student loans for more than just tuition \n     and books but having large amounts of borrowed money with no \n     guaranteed way to pay it back is scary!\n       On another note, my parents now live in Las Vegas, and I \n     have been here visiting for about a month and a half. My \n     father, who is now 57, has worked hard all his life for our \n     family. Now he works even harder. He gets up every morning to \n     leave the house by 5 a.m. so he can walk 15 minutes to catch \n     the bus and then walk for another 20 minutes to be at work by \n     6:30 a.m. so he can save a much-needed $200 a month in gas. \n     It takes him at least 1.5 hours longer each day to get to and \n     from work, that is, if the bus is not so full that he could \n     catch the first one home and would not have to wait for the \n     next one or the next one. He owns two older vehicles that are \n     diesel. When he bought them, diesel was cheaper than gas and \n     they both get 17-18 miles to the gallon. They got the best \n     mileage of SUVs and Trucks. However, even though they are \n     paid for and worth a bit of money, there is no longer a \n     market for vehicles like that so he cannot sell them for \n     close to what they are worth and so he cannot afford to buy \n     another vehicle with better gas mileage.\n       In my personal opinion, the United States government may \n     not be able to make energy cost go down but I feel that they \n     could make them more secure. The U.S. relies largely on oil \n     and gas from other countries. Most of those countries are in \n     some of the most unstable parts of the world, meaning our \n     energy supply is unstable. We need to bring it home. Yes, \n     there are countries such as Qatar that are stable and I think \n     we should still support them. However, for example, places \n     such as off the coast of Nigeria (Shell and U.S.-based \n     Chevron have had problems due to lack of stability in the \n     region) are not only unstable for reliance of supply but are \n     unstable for the environment. Even if energy cost will not \n     subside, most likely the stability of supply and price would \n     increase and the environment would be better off over all if \n     we were more self-reliant.\n     Emily, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife, Michelle, and I send our heart-felt thanks for \n     your principled stand for sound energy policy based on \n     factual data and reality as opposed to the potentially \n     catastrophic positions taken by the Democrat party in \n     Congress, and its leadership.\n       We are solidly in favor of developing our own oil, coal and \n     natural gas resources to reduce or eliminate our dependency \n     on often hostile, foreign sources for the oil our economy \n     requires. We also support an aggressive nuclear power \n     program, and federal assistance to the nuclear power industry \n     in preventing the array of anti-nuclear, anti-power, anti-\n     development and anti-capitalist groups and their attorneys--\n     as well as the dozens of federal environmental agencies--from \n     endlessly delaying or preventing nuclear power facility \n     construction progress.\n       We agree that alternative energy sources need to be \n     developed by the private sector with as little federal \n     interference as possible, but believe it is misguided to \n     suggest that the oil industry should be spending their \n     capital for R into alternative ``fuels''. It seems to us \n     that actions to force the oil industry to do so is the \n     equivalent of federally mandating a private industry to \n     incorporate a profound conflict of interest into their \n     business plan. Logic indicates that such a federal action \n     would drive the oil industry to raise product prices to allow \n     their ongoing oil product R activities to continue, while \n     pursuing an alternative fuel R program for which the \n     industry and its shareholders would have little, if any, \n     business interest in advancing.\n       The X-Prize type concept Senator McCain recently mentioned \n     to encourage R to produce a new super battery for powering \n     vehicles is a concept I have had and shared frequently for \n     several years, although I question why the Senator's focus \n     was narrowed only to one type of energy, rather than offering \n     the prize for the first ``vehicle'' to meet defined safety, \n     performance, capability and efficiency standards and allow \n     the private competitors to pursue hydrogen fuel-cell \n     technology, compressed air and steam technologies, advanced \n     internal combustion engine technologies, even micro-nuclear \n     technologies or any combination of technologies, rather than \n     only electrical battery technologies. (Batteries for electric \n     cars might be a practical idea in some applications, but it \n     is doubtful if such R would benefit the oil burning \n     aviation or shipping industries.)\n       Anyway, we wanted to thank you for being a clear voice for \n     logical solutions to oil supply, and for having the courage \n     to stand against the knee-jerk reactionaries who are intent \n     on convincing the American public that industry greed, rather \n     than governmental interference, has caused the current spikes \n     and the price in oil-based consumer products.\n     Steve and Michelle, Melba.\n                                  ____\n\n       What we really need to do to help our state and our country \n     is to drill, explore, experiment, expand, and adapt. Drill \n     more oil, explore more options for energy, and experiment \n     with new technology to make our state and our country more \n     independent and healthier. Our country needs to expand our \n     public transportation system and make it easier to use. That \n     is the biggest complaint about public transit. Finally, our \n     whole country needs to adapt and realize that this is not the \n     60s, 70s, 80s or 90s anymore. The economy is different. If we \n     can do this appropriately, then not only do we create jobs, \n     but then we can say we did it without foreign interference.\n       I am a big supporter of the SUV. But yesterday, I did the \n     hardest thing I could do. I turned in my SUV to the car lot I \n     purchased it from and am now riding the bus system in Boise. \n     It is not the most convenient since you have to make multiple \n     stops and sometimes go a little out of the way to get where \n     you are going, but for the price of two dollars a day, it is \n     worth it. I take two buses in the morning and walk a mile to \n     get to work every day. Every afternoon I walk a mile and take \n     two buses. I am a mom who manages to get it done. It just \n     takes commitment and help from our legislature to get the \n     nation going in the right direction.\n     Shasta, Boise.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4508-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4508]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n   25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LAND CONSERVANCY OF SAN LUIS OBISPO COUNTY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 25th anniversary of the Land Conservancy of San Luis \nObispo County, LCSLO.\n  Created in 1984 by a group of local residents determined to protect \nlands throughout San Luis Obispo County, LCSLO has experienced many \nsuccesses over the past 25 years in its efforts to ensure a proud \nlegacy of scenic beauty and healthy lands throughout the county. What \nbegan as an all-volunteer group working on small conservation \nagreements has since grown into an established land trust with 16 \nprofessional staff members. LCSLO staff and volunteers work to set \naside local lands for wildlife, farming, and ranching by preventing \npoorly planned development; protecting drinking water sources; \nrestoring wildlife habitat; and promoting family farms and ranches.\n  Since its initial projects in Cambria and Nipomo Mesa, LCSLO has \npermanently protected over 10,500 acres of land in San Luis Obispo \nCounty. The organization has worked to conserve over 100 acres of \nstreamside lands to enhance habitats of steelhead trout, purchased over \n300 individual lots to protect the Monterey Pines in Cambria, and \nrestored hundreds of acres of damaged coastal land in the Guadalupe-\nNipomo Dunes. Today, five of the Conservancy's land parcels are \navailable for public use. Parcels that are not open to the public \nprovide space for projects that produce stunning views, protect air and \nwater quality, and preserve local farmland.\n  The Land Conservancy of San Luis Obispo is a grassroots movement that \nempowers local farmers, ranchers, and residents to protect the land \nthat make San Luis Obispo County so beautiful. By partnering with local \norganizations and offering residents the opportunity to contribute \nhands-on to the preservation of their own community, LCSLO is able to \nconserve the unique rural culture that is so closely tied to this \ncoastal environment.\n  For 25 years, LCSLO has worked passionately and effectively to \nsustain a high quality of life for residents and visitors in a healthy \nnatural environment. I commend LCSLO staff and volunteers for \nmaintaining the natural beauty of San Luis Obispo County and for \nsupporting the county's agricultural and tourism-based economy. I look \nforward to future generations having the opportunity to enjoy this \nspecial part of California for many years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4508-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4508-S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING PETER K. WILSON\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today I would like to note the \nsudden passing of Peter K. Wilson, of Lapwai, ID. A lifelong farmer, \nWorld War II veteran and father of seven, Peter was a leader in Idaho \nagriculture. He served as chairman of the Nez Perce County Agricultural \nStabilization and Conservation Service, and as a member of the Idaho \nState Brand Board, the Nez Perce County Fair Board, the Lewiston Grain \nGrowers Board, and the Idaho Co-op Council Board of Directors. From \n1988 until his untimely death on March 30, 2009, Peter was an elected \ncommissioner of the Port of Lewiston, and served as chairman for \nseveral terms. From 1994 to his death, Peter also served on the board \nof the Pacific Northwest Waterways, and was chairman from 2003-2005.\n\n[[Page S4509]]\n\n  He received numerous awards and honors throughout his working life, \nincluding the Governor's Award for Lifetime Achievement in Agriculture, \nNez Perce County Grassman of the Year and Nez Perce County Outstanding \nFarm Citizen.\n  Peter's love of farming, the mountain pastures he called home, and \nhis family was well-known to many. In his contributions to the \ncommunity and to Idaho agriculture, he touched many lives, working hard \nand providing strong, principled leadership. Peter will certainly be \nmissed.

Madam President, Fenway Park, America's most \nbeloved ballpark, will play host to a different collection of \nsuperstars on April 30: the young people from cities across \nMassachusetts including Boston, Brockton, Lawrence, Springfield and \nWorcester, whose achievements are not measured in batting average or \nRBIs or All Star Game selections; but in SAT scores, GPA and college \nacceptance letters.\n  These young people measure their success by the number of lives they \nchange, the number of young people they help get into college, and the \ndreams they help make real for hundreds of Massachusetts high school \nstudents each year.\n  Tonight at Fenway Park, you will not find Josh Beckett or Dustin \nPedroia or Kevin Youkilis. But you will find Pat Johnson and tonight, \nto the people at Fenway, he is every bit the superstar David Ortiz is.\n  Patrick is the incoming Boston College Site Director for Let's Get \nReady or LGR, an organization relying wholly on the generosity, \ncompassion and selflessness of college students that guides low-income \nhigh school students through the dizzying and daunting college \nadmissions process. He is joined at Fenway tonight by LGR's other \nvolunteers and supporters and by the students and families they work so \nhard to help.\n  The college students who volunteer with LGR serve as coaches. These \ncollege coaches provide SAT preparation and assistance with all aspects \nof the college application process to underserved students in five \nMassachusetts communities. The college application process has become a \nmultimillion-dollar industry and too often low-income students find \nthemselves at a disadvantage. They can not afford the private SAT \ntutors or professional personal essay advisers more affluent high \nschool students take advantage of. Commercial prep courses cost \nanywhere from $1,200 to $5,000; LGR has a direct cost of only $500 per \nstudent.\n  That $500 goes a very long way. LGR helps to level the playing field \nand ensure the remarkable opportunities that can come from a college \neducation are not reserved for the well-to-do or well-connected. And \nlevel the playing field is exactly what the LGR coaches do. Ninety-two \npercent of LGR students go directly to college after high school, \ncompared to 47 percent of low-income students nationally. LGR students \nincrease their SAT scores an average of 110 points. LGR has provided \nsupport to over 7,500 high school students and engaged over 3,500 \ncollege students in meaningful service learning experiences.\n  I commend Pat and all the superstar LGR coaches at Fenway Park \ntonight and I thank them for their efforts to ensure no hardworking \nstudent with a dream of a college education is left on the \nsidelines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4509-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         GRAND OPENING OF NUCOR CORPORATION'S DETAILING CENTER\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, today I wish to \nrecognize a major business expansion in my home State of Nebraska which \nwill serve as an inspiration for all businesses struggling in the face \nof this economic recession.\n  The Nucor Detailing Center will celebrate its grand opening on May 1, \n2009, in Norfolk. This is a state-of-the-art facility operated by Nucor \nCorporation, a Fortune 500 Company and national manufacturer of steel \nproducts.\n  Nucor's story is an impressive one. Nationally, Nucor has 20,000 \nemployees; more than 900 of them are in Norfolk, NE. Despite a downturn \nin America's economy which has hit the steel industry especially hard, \nNucor practices a no-layoff policy and has not closed any of its \nplants.\n  In fact, in Nebraska, Nucor is expanding with the opening of its \nNucor Detailing Center. The Detailing Center is the fourth Nucor \ndivision to locate in Norfolk, which is the only city in the world \nclaiming four Nucor divisions.\n  The Nucor Detailing Center started as a small group with just seven \nemployees. Today, it employs 70 teammates with plans to grow to 200 in \nthe near future. This grand opening, in the midst of an economic \ncrisis, the likes of which our country has not seen since the Great \nDepression, is a testament to the indomitable spirit of the American \nbusinessman and to Nucor's belief in a return on its investment in its \nmost valuable resource--workers.\n  Nucor has gained a reputation as North America's largest recycler and \nas a company which puts an emphasis on safety, the environment and \nsocial responsibility. Now, Nucor is adding to that reputation by being \nable to expand and excel even during troubled economic times.\n  Congratulations to Nucor Detailing Center on its grand opening! \nNebraska is proud to have Nucor Corporation as one of our fine \ncorporate citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/21/senate-section/article/S4509-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4509]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO JONATHAN EDWARD KOTILNEK\n\n Mr. THUNE.

I would like to take some time to make a \nfew remarks on their tireless efforts and work on behalf of crime \nvictims.\n  National Crime Victims' Rights Week will be observed from April 26 to \nMay 2, 2009. This year marks the 25th anniversary of the passage of the \nVictims of Crime Act of 1984, which created the Office for Victims of \nCrime and is responsible for nearly $7 billion in support for crime \nvictim compensation, assistance, and other programs that serve victims. \nOn Thursday, April 23, Attorney General Holder will preside over a \nnational candlelight observance and will join victims, victim \nadvocates, criminal justice professionals, and members of the public to \nremember crime victims and reflect on progress made in improving \nvictims' rights.\n  On Friday, April 24, the PSS of Lafourche Parish will receive the \nAward for Professional Innovation in Victim Services. Team members \ninclude: LT. Karla S. Beck, Ms. Deanna Dufrene, SGT. Valerie Day, \nDeputy Dale Savoie, Deputy Walter Tenney, Deputy Delaune Boudreaux, \nAdvocate Tamera Joseph, Deputy Rebecca Shaver, Deputy Amy Guillot, \nDeputy Pam Guedry, and Reservist Bernard Lafaso. The team is unique in \ntheir innovative and significant efforts on behalf of victim services. \nThe PSS Elderly Services Officer is a devoted, full-time, extensive \ncase manager, visiting the local nursing home and community Council on \nAging groups to provide assistance, services, and education to older \nvictims, their family members and caregivers. They also implemented the \nCrime Victims with Disabilities Program to address victims with \ndisabilities, and also developed a model curriculum, ``Beyond the \nBarriers: Crisis Intervention Training,'' that has been used to educate \nlaw enforcement personnel throughout Louisiana. They were also awarded \na grant in 2007 to establish Supervised Visitation Centers--a safe \nspace for children to transition from one parent to another.

A bill to assist States in making voluntary high quality \nuniversal prekindergarten programs available to 3- to 5-year olds for \nat least 1 year preceding kindergarten; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the well-being \nof our children, both now, today, and also into the future. That is why \ntoday I am reintroducing my bill, Prepare All Kids, along with Senator \nKaufman of Delaware and Senator Whitehouse of Rhode Island.\n  I believe--and I know this is a belief shared by many people in our \ncountry--every child in America is born with a light inside and it is \nour responsibility to keep that light burning ever brightly. This bill \nwill help States to provide at least 1 year of voluntary \nprekindergarten education to children between the ages of 3 and 5. The \nPrepare All Kids Act will also provide funding for important programs \nthat serve the needs of children from birth to age 3, a most critical \ntime in the development of children.\n  The research is irrefutable. Investing in children in their earliest \nyears greatly improves their life outcomes, and conservative estimates \nput the savings to our economy at about $7 for every $1 we invest. So \nthis is about two things: It is certainly about our obligation, our \nabiding obligation to our children, but it is also about our economy, \nthe obligation to our economy that we have to develop skilled workers \nto compete in a world economy.\n  There is no question that for some of the most disadvantaged children \nthere is an achievement gap between them and their more privileged \npeers that sometimes never closes. One study shows that before entering \nkindergarten, the average cognitive scores of preschool-age children in \nthe highest socioeconomic group were 60 percent above the average \nscores of children in the lowest socioeconomic group. I believe \ninvesting in children is the right thing to do, and it is the smart \nthing to do. Sometimes the oldest sayings are the truest because years \nof scientific research on early childhood programs has proven without a \ndoubt that an ounce of prevention is indeed worth a pound of cure--\ncertainly when it comes to investing in our children.\n  Earlier this year, I was proud to advocate for investments in our \nchildren in this year's recovery bill and prouder still when those \ninvestments remained intact with passage. Programs such as Early Head \nStart, Head Start, and childcare programs are receiving desperately \nneeded increases right now, as working parents all across the country \nstruggle to maintain jobs, keep their homes, and ensure their children \nare well cared for while they take care of their responsibilities. It \nis critical that working families can depend upon these investments in \nthe years to come.\n  The Presidency, the administration of Barack Obama, has an important \nbudget blueprint for further recognizing the wisdom of investing in our \nchildren. In addition to the recovery bill investments, the President's \nZero to Five initiative highlights the importance of investments during \nthe critical period of time between birth and age 5: investments in \nearly learning, nurse home visitation, and creating neighborhoods in \nwhich low-income and disadvantaged children can receive the help and \nassistance they need to succeed in life.\n  I want to emphasize very clearly today as it relates to the bigger \npicture of giving children what they need in the early years, my bill, \nthe Prepare All Kids Act, focuses on prekindergarten, but it also \nfocuses on programs that serve infants and toddlers. It is also about \ninvesting in and preparing all kids--not just some but all--who are \nabout to enter kindergarten. It is absolutely imperative that we don't \nsee children in pieces, that we not create silos as we begin to focus \non the kinds of investments our children need. We cannot allow that to \nbe ``siloed'' that way, not childcare versus Head Start versus \nprekindergarten. These programs should not have to compete with one \nanother, and in my bill I make sure they don't.\n  We also have to remember that investing in children cannot suddenly \nbegin when they are 3 or 4 years old. It must begin from the earliest \ndays of a child's life, literally beginning before they are born. The \nObama administration, in outlining its vision of early childhood, shows \na wise commitment to streamlining and coordinating a system of early \nchildhood programs and investments. I could not agree more with the \nneed for such streamlining.\n  We are also fortunate indeed to have Secretary Duncan and, hopefully \nvery soon, the confirmation of Governor Sebelius as Secretary of Health \nand Human Services--both of whom really get it, as the President said \nto a joint session in speaking of another part of our priorities in \nterms of getting it, understanding what we have to do. When it comes to \nthe continuum of early childhood development and education, both of \nthese officials, as well as the President and Vice President and their \nteam, all get this, and they understand it. That is why they have made \nZero to Five such a high priority.\n  Let me turn to an economic summary of the Prepare All Kids Act. First \nof all, in this bill we assist States in providing at least 1 year of \nhigh-quality prekindergarten education to children. Under my bill, \nprekindergarten programs must adhere to high-quality standards. That \nincludes a research-based curriculum that supports children's \ncognitive, social, emotional, and\n\n[[Page S4517]]\n\nphysical development and individual learning styles. Experts tell us \nthat at the preschool stage, social and emotional learning can be as \nimportant and perhaps even more important than cognitive learning. That \nis where early socialization takes place--learning to share, pay \nattention, work independently, and express feelings. All these are \ncritical to successful childhood development.\n  Classrooms in our bill will have a maximum of 20 children and \nchildren-to-teacher ratios of no more than 10 to 1. Children need \nindividualized and quality attention to thrive, and these requirements \nprovide that. The bill helps States that want to expand pre-K programs \nto full-day programs as well as extend their programs year round. This \nsupports both children and working parents who need high-quality \nprograms for their children during the workday and in the summer.\n  Prekindergarten teachers will be required to have a bachelor's degree \nat the time they are employed, but we give them sufficient time, 6 \nyears, in order to get it. We also allow States to use funds for \nprofessional development for teachers. But we want highly qualified and \ncommitted teachers in our pre-K programs.\n  States must create a monitoring plan that will appropriately measure \nindividual program effectiveness. And, one more point: infant and \ntoddler programs will receive a significant portion of the funding--15 \npercent. These programs typically receive the lowest dollars of all \nearly childhood programs, making it difficult for parents, many of them \nsingle moms, to find quality childcare for the youngest of our \nchildren.\n  We have to recognize in this bill and other places as well the \ncritical role of parents in the education of their young children by \nstrongly encouraging parental involvement in programs and assisting \nfamilies in getting the supportive services they may need.\n  Children come in families. To truly help children, we have to involve \nand support their parents. We have to involve the whole family. More \nimportant, children cannot succeed without the active involvement of \ntheir parents. I believe we have an obligation to our children and to \nour future workforce.\n  Compared to children who attend high-quality preschool, those who do \nnot attend such programs are five times more likely to be chronic \nlawbreakers as adults and more likely to abuse illegal drugs. Children \nwho attend high-quality preschool are more successful in school, more \nlikely to graduate from high school, and thus more likely to become \nproductive adults who contribute to the U.S. economy.\n  But for anyone who needs additional reasons, decades of research on \nlife outcomes of children who have attended early childhood programs \nproves the wisdom of this investment. Conservative estimates are that \nwe save $7 for every $1 invested--in crime, welfare, and education \ncosts. Some studies have shown as much as $17 in savings.\n  We must ensure that the light in every child--really, their \npotential--burns brightly. It is my deep conviction that as elected \npublic servants we have a sacred responsibility to ensure we invest in \nour children by providing early learning and development, nutrition and \nhealth care--these three: nutrition, health care, and early learning. \nThat is why I am committed to serving the children of this Nation and \nwhy I am reintroducing the Prepare All Kids Act.\n  I look forward to working with President Obama and Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Congress who share these priorities. I look forward \nto giving our children the good start they deserve, to keep their light \nshining brightly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 839\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Transportation to study and \nestablish a motor vehicle safety standard that provides for a means of \naltering blind and other pedestrians of motor vehicle operation; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Pedestrian \nSafety Enhancement Act of 2009 with Senator Specter. This bill is \ndesigned to ensure that those with limited or no vision are able to \nidentify electric and hybrid vehicles as they travel down the road. I \nam a strong supporter of increasing the number of electric and hybrid \nelectric vehicles on our roads because they will limit our dependence \non foreign oil and help limit pollution. However, the silent operation \nof hybrid vehicles has created a potentially hazardous situation for \nsome pedestrians with limited or no vision. Too often, vision impaired \nindividuals are unable to hear hybrid cars as they pass by them. This \nmakes it more difficult for them to get around.\n  While I am thankful that there will be less noise on the street, we \nshould be fair to those among us who use senses other than sight to \nnavigate the streets. The bill directs the Secretary of Transportation \nto study and establish a motor vehicle safety standard that provides \nfor a means of alerting vision impaired pedestrians of motor vehicle \noperation. This bill requires that solutions to this problem are \nstudied and the best of these solutions is implemented in a timely \nmanner.\n  I ask all my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Reed, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Levin, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. \n        Durbin, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Gillibrand, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 843. A bill to establish background check procedures for gun \nshows; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise because yesterday marks 10 \nyears since the shootings at Columbine High School in Littleton, CO, \nand on this 10th anniversary, we need to speak about the problems with \nour Nation's gun laws.\n  Whether it is Columbine, Virginia Tech, Mexican gun trafficking or \nthe recent killings in Pittsburgh, Binghamton, and Oakland we are \nreminded over and over again that our gun laws are not strong enough, \nand it is time we said--not another day.\n  Not another day should we allow the gun show loophole to stand.\n  Not another day should we allow gun dealers to sell firearms without \nconducting a background check.\n  Not another day should we allow terrorists, criminals, gun \ntraffickers and the mentally ill to buy firearms.\n  It is as easy as ever for criminals to buy guns--easier, in fact, \nthan it is to get a library card.\n  What happened at Columbine High School 10 years ago was a tragedy \nnone of us can forget.\n  Two shooters went on a rampage and killed 12 students and 1 teacher.\n  But here is what a lot of people do not realize: all of the firearms \nused by the shooters were bought at gun shows.\n  That means, because of the gun show loophole, they were bought \nwithout a background check, and they were bought ``cash and carry,'' no \nquestions asked.\n  Those 13 people never should have died because those teenagers never \nshould have had those guns.\n  Just think: the young woman who bought the guns for the shooters said \nshe wouldn't have done it had a background check been required.\n  In 1999, I introduced legislation to close the gun show loophole and \nkeep guns from falling into the wrong hands.\n  In the aftermath of Columbine, the Senate passed my legislation, with \nVice President Al Gore casting the tie-breaking vote.\n  It was a great victory, but it was short lived. The gun lobby \nstripped my legislation in conference.\n  Ten years later, this gap in our law still remains.\n  We were reminded of that last Thursday when we marked the second \nanniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings.\n  In that tragedy, a mentally deranged man killed 32 students and \nfaculty in the worst mass shooting in American history.\n  The Virginia Tech shooter was able to obtain his guns from licensed \ngun dealers because the records of his mental illness were not in the \nbackground check database as they were supposed to be. But if a \nbackground check stopped him from buying his guns from a gun dealer, he \ncould have walked to a gun show and purchased the guns with no \nbackground check.\n  Yesterday we marked the 14th anniversary of the Oklahoma City \nBombing--the Nation's worst domestic terrorist attack.\n  The men responsible for that despicable act frequently bought and \nsold firearms at gun shows.\n  Gun trafficking to Mexico is another reminder of the dangers of the \ngun show loophole.\n  We know that as many as 30 percent of the firearms traveling across \nour border into Mexico originate from gun shows.\n  We have an opportunity to save lives--and that is why I am \nreintroducing legislation today to close the gun show loophole once and \nfor all.\n  Closing the gun show loophole will not adversely affect licensed gun \nsellers and it will not place a burden on law-abiding gun owners.\n  It simply ends a dangerous, unnecessary exemption so that the Brady \nLaw is applied equally.\n  But that difference--the difference between buying a gun with a \nbackground check and not--is everything.\n  It is the difference between saving lives and putting more at risk, \nbetween keeping guns out of the wrong hands and letting terrorists and \nothers have easy access to guns, and the difference between upholding \nthe rule of law or allowing loopholes to undermine it.\n  Specifically, my legislation would take several steps to make gun \nshow transactions safer for all Americans: gun shows are defined to \ninclude any event at which 50 or more firearms are offered or exhibited \nfor sale. This definition includes not only those events where firearms \nare the main commodity sold, but also other events where a significant \nnumber of guns are sold, such as flea markets or swap meets.\n  Gun show promoters would be required to register with the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, ATF, maintain a list of vendors at all \ngun shows, and ensure that all vendors acknowledge receipt of \ninformation about their legal obligations.\n  The bill requires that all firearms sales at gun shows go through a \nFederal Firearms Licensee, FFL. If a nonlicensed person is selling a \nweapon, they would use an FFL at the gun show to complete the \ntransaction.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 846\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds that--\n       (1) Dr. Muhammad Yunus is recognized in the United States \n     and throughout the world as a leading figure in the fight \n     against poverty and the effort to promote economic and social \n     change;\n       (2) Muhammad Yunus is the recognized developer of the \n     concept of microcredit, and Grameen Bank, which he founded, \n     has created a model of lending that has been emulated across \n     the globe;\n       (3) Muhammad Yunus launched this global movement to create \n     economic and social development from below, beginning in \n     1976, with a loan of $27 from his own pocket to 42 crafts \n     persons in a small village in Bangladesh;\n       (4) Muhammad Yunus has demonstrated the life-changing \n     potential of extending very small loans (at competitive \n     interest rates) to the very poor and the economic feasibility \n     of microcredit and other microfinance and microenterprise \n     practices and services;\n       (5) Dr. Yunus's work has had a particularly strong impact \n     on improving the economic prospects of women, and on their \n     families, as over 95 percent of microcredit borrowers are \n     women;\n       (6) Dr. Yunus has pioneered a movement with the potential \n     to assist a significant number of the more than 1,400,000,000 \n     people, mostly women and children, who live on less than \n     $1.25 a day, and the 2,600,000,000 people who live on less \n     than $2 a day, and which has already reached 155,000,000, by \n     one estimate;\n       (7) there are now an estimated 24,000,000 microenterprises \n     in the United States accounting for approximately 18 percent \n     of private (nonfarm) employment and 87 percent of all \n     business in the United States, and the Small Business \n     Administration has made over $318,000,000 in microloans to \n     entrepreneurs since 1992;\n       (8) Dr. Yunus, along with the Grameen Bank, was awarded the \n     Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for his efforts to promote economic \n     and social opportunity and out of recognition that lasting \n     peace cannot be achieved unless large population groups find \n     the means, such as microcredit, to break out of poverty; and\n       (9) the microcredit ideas developed and put into practice \n     by Muhammad Yunus, along with other bold initiatives, can \n     make a historical breakthrough in the fight against poverty.\n\n     SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\n\n       (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate \n     shall make appropriate arrangements for the presentation, on \n     behalf of the Congress, of a gold medal of appropriate design \n     to Dr. Muhammad Yunus, in recognition of his many enduring \n     contributions to the fight against global poverty.\n       (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation \n     referred to in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury \n     (hereafter in this Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') \n     shall strike a gold medal with suitable emblems, devices, and \n     inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary.\n\n     SEC. 3. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\n\n       The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of \n     the gold medal struck pursuant to section 2, under such \n     regulations as the Secretary may prescribe, at a price \n     sufficient to cover the cost thereof, including labor, \n     materials, dies, use of machinery, and overhead expenses, and \n     the cost of the gold medal.\n\n     SEC. 4. STATUS OF MEDALS.\n\n       (a) National Medals.--The medals struck pursuant to this \n     Act are national medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title \n     31, United States Code.\n       (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and \n     5136 of title 31, United States Code, all medals struck under \n     this Act shall be considered to be numismatic items.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 107 submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n  A resolution (S. Res. 107) commending the University of Connecticut \nHuskies for their historic win in the 2009 National Collegiate Athletic \nAssociation Division I Women's Basketball Tournament.\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise today with my colleague and friend, \nSenator Lieberman, to congratulate the University of Connecticut \nWomen's Basketball team for winning the 2009 NCAA Division I Women's \nBasketball Tournament. I know that I speak for the entire Connecticut \nCongressional Delegation when I say how proud I am to be able to stand \nhere and acknowledge the accomplishments of this magnificent group of \nyoung women.\n  I have had the privilege of coming to the floor on numerous other \noccasions to applaud the Huskies for winning the NCAA Division I \nTournament. In fact, this is the sixth time that the University of \nConnecticut Women's Basketball team has won this championship, the \nsecond highest number of wins in all of women's Division I history.\n  As they did in 1995 and 2002, the Huskies went the entire 2009 season \nundefeated. In addition to this incredible achievement, this year's \nteam added another accomplishment that is truly unique in the history \nof the NCAA, as it has never before been achieved by any NCAA \nbasketball team--they bested each and every one of their challengers by \ndouble digits. This tremendous accomplishment undoubtedly means that \nthis year's team is not only among the best to play at UCONN, but one \nof the best college teams ever.\n  Numerous factors contributed to the Huskies' historic win, not the \nleast of which is the steadfast dedication and well-honed skills of the \nindividual players. Every player deserves special recognition for her \nwork, and I would like to take a moment to specifically point out the \nachievements of the impressive trio of stars that led this year's team. \nSophomore Maya Moore, senior point guard Renee Montgomery, and junior \ncenter Tina Charles all played critical roles in UCONN's victory. In \nrecognition of their efforts, all three women have won numerous awards. \nMaya Moore was chosen as the Naismith Award winner, the Wooden Award \nwinner, the State Farm Wade Trophy winner, the United States Basketball \nWriters Association player of the year, and the Associated Press player \nof the year. For her part, Renee Montgomery was chosen as the winner of \nthe Nancy Lieberman award, an honor that is reserved for the top point \nguard in the Nation. And Tina Charles, who had a staggering 25 points \nand 19 rebounds in the championship game, was honored as the Women's \nFinal Four Most Valuable Player.\n  All three players were named State Farm First Team All-Americans and \nmembers of the Final Four First All Tournament Team. These are \nimpressive awards and acknowledgments, but none of this could have been \ndone without the other members of the team. These women, all of whom \ncould be starters or stars at other programs, helped to deliver this \nyear's national championship to UCONN. They are without question an \nimpressive squad who have left an indelible mark upon the history of \nthe Huskies basketball program. I would be remiss if I didn't take a \nmoment to acknowledge the great play and important role that these \nwomen played. They are: Heather Buck; Lorin Dixon; Caroline Doty; \nJacquie Fernandes; Meghan Gardler; Kalana Greene; Tiffany Hayes; Cassie \nKerns; Jessica McCormack; Kaili McLaren; and Tahirah Williams.\n  In addition to the impressive talents of the young women who make up \nthe team, one must not forget Geno Auriemma, who has led the Huskies to \nsix national championships and three undefeated seasons during his \ntenure as head coach. For his efforts, Coach Auriemma has once again \nbeen picked as the Associated Press Coach of the Year, a well-deserved \nhonor for such an accomplished and hard-working coach. And to add \nanother honor to his impressive resume, Coach Auriemma was just named \nhead coach of the U.S. Women's Olympic Team. I am sure he will bring \nthe same dedication and skill to bringing us another gold medal as he \nhas to UCONN. Also, Chris Dailey, associate head coach; Jamelle \nElliott, assistant coach; and Shea Ralph, assistant coach, contributed \nimmensely to the success of the team.\n  However, I firmly believe that the most important factor that led the \nUCONN women to victory this year is the character of each of the team's \nplayers. Make no mistake about it, these young women are very \ndedicated, and have worked extremely hard to get to where they are now. \nHowever, their tireless dedication and perseverance extend well beyond \nthe basketball court. You may be interested to know that the UCONN \nwomen's basketball program has a 100-percent graduation rate among 4-\nyear players. This statistic is truly astounding given the amount of \ntime each of these women must spend meticulously perfecting her skills \non the court. Clearly, each of these women possesses an unquenchable \ndesire to succeed in everything she attempts, a characteristic that \nmakes the team's triumph all the sweeter.\n  Madam President, thank you for the opportunity to speak about the \naccomplishments of the Huskies, a committed group of young women, whom, \nit is safe to say, are the pride of the State of Connecticut. Nothing \ndemonstrates this better than the parade that was held in Hartford \nrecently to honor the Huskies on their victory. A staggering 25,000 \npeople came out to thank the coaches and team for their season. In \nConnecticut, the Huskies are as beloved, if not more so, than any other \nsports team. We are so proud of their victory and all these impressive \nyoung women have accomplished both on and off the court. So from all \nthe fans of the UCONN Huskies in Connecticut and throughout the country \nand indeed the world, I say congratulations on a tremendous season and \na wonderful accomplishment.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
