Mr. President, following this moment of silence, I think all \nof us on this morning are reflecting on where we were and what we were \ndoing on the morning of September 11, 2001. In this body, we are \nreflecting on the things that occurred thereafter that enabled us to \nrespond to that heinous terrorist attack.\n  I wanted to read some comments I wrote for the Arizona Republic that \nwere printed this morning:\n\n\n[[Page S9282]]\n\n\n       Eight years have passed since al Qaeda terrorists attacked \n     the United States. Today, we remember the thousands who lost \n     their lives and are reminded of the brutality and evil of our \n     enemy.\n       Terrorists have not struck on our soil since 9/11 because \n     we gained useful intelligence and have been able to thwart \n     attacks. This is due in part to intelligence improvements \n     implemented after a bipartisan commission investigated the \n     terrorist attacks and provided recommendations to protect \n     against future attacks. Known as the \n     9/11 Commission, it described in detail a lack of cooperation \n     among the Justice Department and members of the intelligence \n     community prior to 9/11 that made the United States more \n     vulnerable to attack. It also described how second guessing \n     of intelligence operations had caused intelligence agents to \n     be risk-averse and overly cautious in carrying out their \n     duties.\n       Following the release of the commission's report, Congress \n     and government agencies made critical changes to improve \n     intergovernmental cooperation and pushed the agencies to be \n     bold in acting to protect the American people. The result was \n     an intelligence community that was aggressive in tracking, \n     capturing, and interrogating terrorists, and devising other \n     technical means of gathering key intelligence.\n       The interrogation techniques employed during the post-9/11 \n     period produced information that saved lives. For example, \n     interrogations of Khalid Sheik Mohammed, the mastermind of \n     the September 11 attacks and the man the CIA has called its \n     ``preeminent source'' on al Qaeda, revealed plans to carry \n     out a September 11-type attack on the West Coast and attack \n     landmarks in New York, such as the Brooklyn Bridge.\n       But, the passage of time since 9/11 seems to have dimmed \n     memories of important lessons learned, as demonstrated by \n     Attorney General Eric Holder's recent decision to appoint a \n     prosecutor to reopen a previously closed investigation into \n     the techniques intelligence officers used to interrogate \n     terrorists. There is little doubt that this step, which could \n     lead to criminal charges against intelligence officers, will \n     drive a wedge between the Justice Department and the \n     intelligence community and discourage the intelligence \n     community from acting aggressively.\n       Intelligence officers will not be able to focus on their \n     critical responsibility if they are worried that actions they \n     take today will be subject to legal recriminations when the \n     political winds shift. Indeed, CIA director Leon Panetta has \n     sounded a similar warning--that he's become increasingly \n     concerned that this focus on what happened in the past will \n     distract intelligence officers from their core mission of \n     protecting America. It will also spur distrust between the \n     Justice Department and the intelligence community and return \n     us to the days when a virtual ``wall'' separated government \n     agencies charged with fighting terrorism.\n       The attorney general's decision to reopen this \n     investigation will have serious repercussions--and it is \n     wholly unnecessary. When he announced the appointment of the \n     prosecutor, the attorney general failed to acknowledge that \n     the Justice Department has already investigated the alleged \n     interrogation abuses that are the subject of this new probe. \n     One individual was prosecuted and convicted for abuses. Three \n     former attorneys general and numerous career prosecutors have \n     examined the evidence and determined that it does not support \n     further prosecution of intelligence officials.\n       The president himself has repeatedly said that he wants to \n     look forward, not backward on this issue. But, the actions of \n     his administration (over which he has control) are \n     inconsistent with his stated intent. I believe the nation \n     would be better served if the administration focused more on \n     supporting the intelligence community as it continues every \n     day to do the hard work of intelligence gathering, rather \n     than distracting it from its duties and chilling its \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9282-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9282-S9284]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REFLECTIONS ON THE PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to reflect on the speech President \nObama gave on Wednesday evening. We have had time to reflect on its \nmeaning, time to have the pundits give their views on it, time to see \nsome reaction by the American people, and time to visit with colleagues \nabout their reaction to answer the question of whether it moved us \nfurther along to a bipartisan solution to the health care challenges \nthat we all acknowledge face our Nation.\n  I must report this morning, with some disappointment, I do not \nbelieve it achieved that purpose. During the month of August, when we \nwere back home talking with our constituents, they spoke to us about \ntheir concerns and their fears about the plans that have been put forth \nby the House of Representatives and Senate committees, and we brought \nthose ideas back to Washington. I had hoped, with the thought that \nthere could be a readjustment--a pressing of the restart button, as it \nwere--to have these bills in the House and Senate more accurately \nreflect the will of the American people.\n  The public opinion surveys are virtually unanimous that public \nopinion does not favor the plans that have been presented to the \nCongress. In fact, by roughly 52 to 42, the surveys say the American \npeople disagree with or disapprove of those proposed solutions. But \nrather than reflecting on what the public has been saying, which the \nPresident did not do on Wednesday evening, it seemed he simply \nrecharged the same program he has been pushing for all these many \nmonths now and criticized those who disagreed with him and effectively \nthrew down the gauntlet and said it is going to be this way or no way.\n  I don't think that is the way to reach a bipartisan consensus or \nreflect the will of the American people. I am especially disappointed \nbecause, in the President's comments, there seems to be no room for \nhonest disagreement. I must tell you, after working with colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle for months, there are honest disagreements and \nsome honest disputes about some of the facts. There has to be room for \nthat honest debate, rather than simply calling each other by pejorative \nnames or condemning anything they say.\n  Let me quote some of the words the President used: ``partisan \nspectacle.'' The opposition's ``unyielding ideological camps''--trying \nto ``score short-term political points.'' He talked about the ``bogus \nclaims spread by those whose only agenda is to kill reform at any \ncost.'' Maybe some people believe that, but that is not the people in \nthis body or in the other body.\n  In order to reach out to those with whom there are disagreements, I \nthink the President has to use a different phraseology than suggesting \nthe only reason people disagree with him is to ``kill reform at any \ncost.'' He talked about lies from prominent politicians and arguments \nthat were false and said: ``To my Republican friends, I say that rather \nthan making wild claims about a government takeover of health care, we \nshould work together. . . .'' And so on.\n  Well, I talked to my constituents, and they are very concerned about \nthe role of government in their health care decisions and the decisions \nof their families and their doctors. When you read the legislation, I \ndon't think they are wild claims to say the role of government would be \nmuch greater than it is today and, to many people, to an extent that \ncauses great fear and concern.\n  The President talked about the ``demagoguery and distortion'' and \nsaid: ``So don't pay attention to those scary stories.'' Of course, he \nhad some pretty scary stories in his speech. There is nothing wrong \nwith pointing out serious problems in order to spur people to action. \nBut if it is OK for one side to do that, it ought to be OK for the \nother side--for those who disagree with him.\n  Finally, he said he is not going to ``waste time with those who have \nmade the calculation that it's better politics to kill this plan than \nimprove it.'' Certainly, that isn't the motivation of the people in the \nother body or this body with whom we disagree. He also said: ``If you \nmisrepresent what's in the plan, we will call you out.'' That is a \nthreat and the kind of Chicago-style politics that I don't think has a \nplace in the presentation in the House of Representatives, where I have \nheard five Presidents give speeches. Far and away, this was the most \npolitical. Therefore, I think it was the least effective in bringing \npeople together for a bipartisan solution.\n  Also, the most disappointing thing was what I would say is an \ninability to confront honest differences of opinion and have an honest \ndebate about those disagreements. The President is very good at what I \nhave called setting up a straw man. He sets up an argument that nobody \nhas made and then knocks it down and declares success. That is a \ndisingenuous way to make an argument.\n  I will illustrate this with maybe five different points he covered in \nhis speech. You have heard the President say for months that if you \nlike your insurance, you get to keep it. How many times have you heard \nthat? The problem is, it is not true--under either the House or the \nSenate bills. I will explain why in a moment. But it is not true. \nEventually, I think the President's advisers must have told him you \ncannot\n\n[[Page S9283]]\n\nsay that. Let's reform the way you say it so that what you say is \nlegally and technically true. Wednesday night, here is what the \nPresident said:\n\n       Nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to \n     change the coverage or the doctor you have.\n\n  Then he repeated that. Well, nobody ever said there was anything in \nthe bills that required you or your employer to change. We simply read \nthe bills and observed that, as a result of the legislative language, \nthey would change because their plans would no longer exist. Naturally, \nif your plans no longer exist or if your employer said: I am not going \nto cover you anymore because it is cheaper to go to the public option, \nthen you would lose your coverage. So the President changed the \nlanguage to be technically correct, leaving the impression that what he \nsaid before is still true when, in fact, it is not. Both the CBO and \nthe Lewin Group--a totally objective analysis--demonstrate that for two \nseparate reasons, it is still true if you like your insurance, you are \nnot going to be able to keep it. Most people are not.\n\n  The Lewin Group notes that of the over 100 million Americans--\nprobably close to 120 million Americans--who will go to the public \noption or government-run plan, as the President proposed, 88 million of \nthose will lose their employer-sponsored insurance because it is \ncheaper for the employer to drop their coverage, pay the fine, and \nallow them to enroll in the government program--88 million.\n  For senior citizens--and this is especially important in my State of \nArizona--7 million seniors, according to CBO, will lose their private \nMedicare plan coverage, and that is because the President's plan, these \nbills, drastically reduces the support that is provided to insurance \nplans called Medicare Advantage, where their primary purpose is to \nserve people in more rural and less populated areas, but they exist in \nurban areas as well.\n  Over 10 million seniors are enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans. In \nmy State, we have one of the highest rates of enrollment, with about 39 \npercent of Medicare beneficiaries in the Medicare Advantage plans.\n  The President and the Democrats who have written this legislation \nwould like to do away with those Medicare Advantage plans. As a result \nof the language of the bills, according to the CBO, at least 7 million \nseniors will be moved off Medicare Advantage because those plans will \nno longer be available.\n  The point being that while, of course, the President is correct that \nnothing in the plan requires you to leave your coverage if you like it, \nthe reality is that over 88 million people who have insurance through \ntheir employer and 7 million seniors who have Medicare Advantage plans \nwill lose their coverage because of the provisions of the bill.\n  The fact remains it is still not true, if you like your insurance, \nyou are going to be able to keep it--at least for almost 100 million; \nto be totally accurate, about 95 million Americans.\n  The President made another argument. He said: I know you Republicans \nhave been interested in medical malpractice reform, so I am going to do \nsomething about that.\n  I have to characterize it as a very disingenuous proposal. Everybody \nknows there is a huge amount of money that could be saved in health \ncare delivery if we did something to reform this jackpot-justice system \nthat requires physicians to pay, by one estimate, about 10 cents of \nevery health care dollar spent for their premiums for malpractice \ninsurance.\n  Another study demonstrated that over $100 billion a year is wasted in \nphysicians and hospitals practicing defensive medicine in order to \nprotect themselves from these liability suits, these malpractice suits.\n  We have been pushing for malpractice reform for years. What was the \nPresident's response? He is going to ask the Secretary of HHS, Kathleen \nSebelius, to look into an idea that the Bush administration was \npromoting after the Senate rejected, on almost partisan lines, medical \nmalpractice reform proposed by Republicans.\n  Secretary Sebelius was the director of the Kansas Trial Lawyers \nAssociation from 1978 to 1986. Some kind of encouragement to the States \nto develop some kind of alternative dispute resolution mechanism is \nhardly tort reform.\n  Given the fact that this is a huge problem, a lot of money could be \nsaved if we have meaningful tort reform. We believe it would be better \nto develop real tort reform and include it in the legislation rather \nthan simply direct the Secretary to look into something I think is \nbound to result in virtually nothing.\n  A third point I think is highly misleading--and this received a lot \nof publicity because of the unfortunate comments by a Member of \nCongress in a very uncourteous comment to the President--the President \nsaid:\n\n       The reforms I am proposing would not apply to those who are \n     here illegally.\n\n  In one sense, that is a true statement because there is not a \nprovision that says we are going to cover illegal immigrants. By the \nsame token, on repeated occasions when Members of the House of \nRepresentatives sought to ensure that illegal immigrants would not be \ncovered, amendments to ensure eligibility requirements and confirmation \nof eligibility by assuring only U.S. citizens would receive the \nbenefits of the program, those amendments were defeated.\n  So it has been proposed that maybe we can just resolve this question \nof who is right by agreeing to a simple amendment that says illegal \nimmigrants will not have the benefits of this program, and there is \ngoing to be enough confirmation of their eligibility or noneligibility \nto ensure that is the case. That is how we could resolve it.\n  We could do the same thing with regard to funding of abortions. There \nis an argument, are they or are they not? There is a very simple \nanswer. Instead of rejecting the Hatch amendment, which was done in \ncommittee, adopt the Hatch amendment that simply says no funding of \nabortions.\n  I think we are going to know pretty clearly if there is an intent to \ndeceive, to have the language seem to prevent illegal immigrants or \nfunding for abortions but in reality it ends up that they get the \ncoverage or that abortions are funded.\n  There is a very simple solution: adopt the Republican language that \nmakes it very clear. But, no, that has not been done, and we will see \nwhether it will be done.\n  I thought one of the most unfortunate phrases the President used was, \nin speaking to America's seniors:\n\n       Not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will be used to pay \n     for this plan.\n\n  The President acknowledged in his speech that about half of the cost \nof the almost $1 trillion expense of this plan will be by virtue of \ncuts in Medicare. I think he used the word ``savings'' in Medicare. The \nquestion is, what exactly are those cuts? What is that savings? What \nthe President said was, ``Not a dollar of the Medicare trust fund will \nbe used to pay for this plan,'' as if that answers the questions and \nseniors should not be worried.\n  First of all, nobody said the trust fund is going to be used. Does \nanybody know how much money is in the trust fund? I will tell you. Zip. \nThe trust fund is broke. Medicare is in big financial trouble. There \nisn't any money in the trust fund to pay for anything. Nobody ever \nsuggested that was the problem.\n  Here is the problem, twofold: One, they are going to get somewhere a \nlittle less than $200 billion by reducing the allocations to the plans \nthat provide Medicare Advantage. I talked about that earlier. They \ndon't like Medicare Advantage because it is a private alternative, so \nthey want to get seniors off Medicare Advantage. That is why seniors \nwho like Medicare Advantage are out of luck because they reduce the \nsupport for those plans by almost $200 billion. That is where part of \nit comes from. The rest of it, $300 billion or so, comes from getting \nrid of waste, fraud, and abuse. That is when I heard some laughter in \nthe Chamber because we have been trying to get rid of waste, fraud, and \nabuse for years, and it is very hard to do.\n  The President provided absolutely no specifics. None of the bills \nhave any specifics about this point. Nobody knows how this is going to \nbe done. It is very unrealistic to expect it will occur in any way \nexcept what some have acknowledged, which is that the payments to \nproviders--that is to say, doctors, hospitals, nurses, and others--will \nbe reduced. That is how we will\n\n[[Page S9284]]\n\n``save'' that money. Bear in mind, these are providers who today \nreceive on the order of 70 percent of reimbursement from Medicare, 70 \npercent of what it costs them to provide the services. That is why \nthose who buy private insurance have to pay more than 100 percent. They \nhave to subsidize the other 30 percent or thereabouts that Medicare \ndoes not cover.\n  What happens when that is reduced even further, when that is cut down \nto 60 percent, let's say, or 50 percent? It is going to raise the \npremiums of everyone else who has to increase their subsidy for the \ngovernment program, and it ends up reducing the care available for \nseniors. There are not as many doctors, the waiting lines get longer, \nthe care that is available decreases, and we end up with rationing. \nThat is what seniors are concerned about.\n\n  This is not a wild charge. This is not a falsity. It is in the bills. \nThe President attempts to distract attention from it by saying we are \nnot going to spend any money in the trust fund to pay for this. So \nwhat. There isn't any money in the trust fund.\n  The question is, are you going to hurt seniors' care by cutting \nphysician and hospital payments under Medicare and eliminating the \nsupport for Medicare Advantage bills? That is what is in the two bills. \nThat is what is going to hurt seniors.\n  There are a lot of arguments that do not really match up to the \nclaims made. They set up a straw man and knock down the straw man, but \nstill standing is the fact that the bills that are in the Congress will \ngive the government a much greater role in our health care decisions, \nwill increase premiums for millions of people, will result in rationing \nof care, and will put the government in charge of decisions with \nrespect to treatment. All of these are concerns people expressed during \nthe month of August and some before that need to be addressed.\n  Instead of simply doubling down, as some folks said, and saying: It \nis going to be my way or else we will call out those who disagree with \nus--I think we ought to listen to the American people. What I hear they \nhave said is the following: First of all, rather than taking on a \nmassive new spending program of close to $1 trillion, adding several \ntrillion to the debt over the next couple of decades, rather than \nincreasing our debt, rather than having another government takeover \nfollowing all those that have occurred so far, let's focus on the most \npressing problems facing Americans, and that is putting America back to \nwork, getting the economy going again, reducing our debt, and making \nsure we don't have new taxes. That is what we would like to have you \nfocus on.\n  To the extent there are specific problems with health care, deal with \nthose as well, but you can do that on a step-by-step basis in a way \nthat targets specific solutions to specific problems.\n  I mentioned the problem of defensive medicine costs, over $100 \nbillion a year in money we should not be spending but doctors force us \nto spend it, in fact, to protect themselves from this jackpot-justice \nsystem.\n  All right, the way to resolve that is with real medical malpractice \nreform. We do not need a demonstration project. I will give you a \ncouple--Texas and Arizona. By passing modest malpractice reforms in \nthose two States, significant progress has been made in reducing \nmedical costs, reducing premiums, and attracting doctors. I am told \nthat something like 7,000 doctors have moved into Texas in the last 4 \nyears pretty much as a direct result of the more benign climate in \nwhich they can practice medicine as a result of this malpractice \nreform. Premiums have been cut to--I forget precisely--I think it is 21 \nor 23 percent.\n  We know what works. Let's target a specific solution to a specific \nproblem. We don't have to worry about taking over the whole private \nsector system of health care delivery, putting at risk the insurance \npeople already have that serves them well.\n  Finally, I note that there is some discrepancy between what the \nPresident said about his plan and the bills that are pending in \nCongress. My colleague, Senator Corker, has written to the President \nand asked if we could get a copy of his bill because some of the things \nhe described are not in either the House or Senate bill. At least they \ndo not accurately describe those two bills.\n  I will give one example. He said:\n\n       I will not sign a plan that adds one dime to our deficits--\n     either now or in the future. Period.\n\n  That is great. Unfortunately, the House and Senate bills, according \nto the CBO, add to the deficit: the HELP Committee in the Senate about \n$750 billion worth, and in the House committee about $239 billion \nworth. Clearly, these two bills are not what the President is talking \nabout. Obviously, he has something else in mind. If he is going to be \nselling that to the American people, we need to see it. So I encourage \nthe White House to send up the legislation they have so we can see what \nit is they are talking about that is different from these other two \nbills.\n  I said finally, but one final point. The President did not talk about \nhow he was going to pay for it except for Medicare cuts. He did not \nmention the taxes on small businesses, the taxes on jobs, the taxes on \nemployers, the penalties individuals would have to pay if they do not \nbuy insurance as mandated here, even a tax on the chronically ill. \nSenator Baucus is proposing to limit flexible spending account \ncontributions to $2,000, which would raise about $18 billion. What it \nwould do is penalize those who have significant illnesses and would \nlike to make larger contributions to their flexible spending accounts.\n  Americans have a right to be concerned about the cost of this, the \nway it is paid for, the effect on their health care, and the effect on \ntheir family's future. I think we need to debate it in an honest and \nforthright way. I am not pulling any punches this morning, but I am \nhoping we can bring people together to recognize what the American \npeople are asking for is a step-by-step approach that targets solutions \nto specific problems and does not try to do it in the kind of \ncomprehensive way that results in a 1,300-page bill that, frankly, \nnobody will read except some staffers, and we won't know what is in it \nuntil well after the fact and which is very hard for Congress to get \nright.\n  The unintended consequences of that kind of legislation are always \nenormous. The costs are always far greater than anybody predicted, and \nthe impact on the American people can be very deleterious.\n  So my hope is that we will listen to the American people on this, \ntake our time to do it right, do it in a step-by-step approach, target \nour solutions, get away from this massive government intrusion--which \nis reflected in both of the bills that have been considered by the \nHouse and Senate--and, most importantly, focus first and foremost on \nwhat is most on the minds of the American people domestically; that is, \nthe economic situation here that will be made worse if we impose new \ntaxes on small businesses, for example. It will be made worse if we \ntake on massive new debt. We need to focus on putting people back to \nwork, not spending as much money, not adding to our debt, and then \ndecide what kinds of solutions we can afford with respect to health \ncare. If we do that, I think we will have complied with the request of \nour constituents, which, after all, is what we are here to do. We will \nhave done something good for the American people, and we will not have \nviolated that first principle of medicine, which is, of course, to \nfirst do no harm. I think the American people were pretty clear over \nthe month of August that they wanted us to start with that proposition, \nand it would be a good place for us to start in the so-called health \nreform we are about to take up over the next several weeks.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9284-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9284-S9286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SURGE THE AFGHAN ARMY\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today we mark a solemn anniversary. Eight \nyears ago this morning, our Nation was attacked by terrorist extremists \nmotivated by hatred and bent on destruction. It is always appropriate \nto reflect on the shock of that day, the innocent lives lost, and the \nefforts our Nation has made since that day to ensure that Afghanistan, \nthe nation that hosted those terrorists, cannot again become a safe \nhaven for terrorists seeking to attack us. But today is an especially \nappropriate occasion to take stock of those efforts and consider how \nbest to continue them.\n\n[[Page S9285]]\n\n  I recently returned from a trip to Afghanistan where I was joined by \nmy colleagues, Senators Jack Reed and Ted Kaufman. The situation in \nAfghanistan is serious. Security has deteriorated. But if we take the \nright steps, we can ensure Afghanistan does not revert to a Taliban-\nfriendly government that can once again provide a safe haven for al-\nQaida to terrorize us and the world.\n  The Obama administration's new strategy focusing on securing the \nAfghan population's safety and partnering with the Afghan security \nforces in that effort is an important start in reversing the situation \nin Afghanistan. The change in strategy has led our forces, in the words \nof General McChrystal's Counterinsurgency Guidance, to:\n\n       . . . live, eat and train together [with the Afghan \n     security forces], plan and operate together, depend on one \n     another, and hold each other accountable . . . and treat them \n     as equal partners in success.\n\n  The general's guidance goes on to say that the success of the Afghan \nsecurity forces ``is our goal.''\n  To achieve that goal, we should increase and accelerate our efforts \nto support the Afghan security forces in their efforts to become self-\nsufficient in delivering security to their nation before we consider \nwhether to increase U.S. combat forces above the levels already planned \nfor the next few months. These steps include increasing the size of the \nAfghan Army and police much faster than presently planned; providing \nmore trainers for the Afghan Army and police than presently planned; \nproviding them with more equipment than presently planned; and working \nto separate local Taliban fighters from their leaders and attract them \nto the side of the government, as we did in Iraq.\n  While the security situation in Afghanistan has worsened, we still \nhave important advantages there. The Afghan people hate the Taliban. \nPublic opinion polls there show support for the Taliban at about 5 \npercent. In addition, the Afghan Army is highly motivated and its \ntroops are proven fighters.\n  Despite those advantages, we face significant challenges. General \nMcChrystal believes--and I agree--that we need to regain the initiative \nand create a momentum toward success. General McChrystal worries, and \nrightly so, about the perception that we have lost that initiative and \nthe impact of that perception on the Afghan people, their government, \nal-Qaida, and the Taliban. By contrast, if we can dispel that \nperception, we have a chance to convince local and lower level Taliban \nfighters to lay down their arms and rejoin Afghan society.\n  I believe the most effective way to retake the initiative in \nAfghanistan is with a series of steps to ensure that the Afghan Army \nand police have the manpower, equipment, and support to secure their \nown nation.\n  First, we should increase troop levels for the Afghan Army and police \nfaster than currently planned. There are approximately 90,000 troops in \nthe Afghan Army now, and that number is scheduled to go up to 134,000 \nby October of 2010. The Afghan police are scheduled to reach a level of \n82,000 by the same time. For a long time, many of us have urged the \nestablishment of a goal of 240,000 Afghan troops and 160,000 Afghan \npolice by 2013. The Afghan Minister of Defense has strongly supported \nthose numbers. It now appears that our government and the Afghan \nGovernment are prepared to accept those goals. But the need for \nadditional Afghan forces is more urgent. I believe it both possible and \nessential to advance those goals by a year, to 2012.\n  Our own military in Afghanistan has repeatedly pointed to a need for \nmore Afghan forces. In one sector of Helmand Province we visited last \nweek, our marines outnumbered Afghan soldiers by five to one. A marine \ncompany commander in Helmand Province told the New York Times in July \nthat a lack of Afghan troops ``is absolutely our Achilles' heel.''\n  What do we need to do to increase the size of the Afghan Army and \npolice? According to Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, there is no lack \nof Afghan manpower. We have been assured it is available. But we will \nneed significantly more trainers. We asked General Formica, who is in \ncharge of the American effort to train Afghan security forces, whether \nsuch an increase is possible. He indicated he would make an assessment \nof what would be necessary in order to meet the earlier timetable. In \nthe meantime, we should press our NATO allies with much greater \nforcefulness to provide more trainers. If our NATO allies are not going \nto come through with the combat forces they pledged, at least they \ncould provide additional trainers.\n  Larger Afghan security forces will also require more mid-level Afghan \nofficers. In addition to supporting efforts to graduate more Afghan \nofficers from army academies, we should consider the recommendation of \nDefense Minister Wardak that previous midlevel officers who fought the \nwar against the Soviets return to service on an interim basis. Minister \nWardak emphasized that those men are well qualified and well motivated. \nAnd while they may not be trained in the most current tactics, they \nnonetheless could temporarily meet the need of the enlarged army while \nthe new group of officers is trained.\n  A larger Afghan force will need supporting infrastructure, such as \nbarracks. While the available infrastructure may not be the most \nmodern, it is adequate and exists in sufficient amounts.\n  Larger Afghan security forces will require additional equipment. \nThere must be a major effort to transfer a significant amount of the \nequipment that is coming out of Iraq to the Afghan Army and police. \nSuch a significant commitment to equip the Afghan security forces would \nalso help demonstrate U.S. determination to take the initiative and \ncreate momentum in the right direction. There is an enormous amount of \nequipment coming out of Iraq. Our military is calling it one of the \ngreatest transfers of military goods in world history. A significant \npart of it could be transferred to the Afghan forces, increasing their \ncapability without weakening our own readiness. Yet there does not seem \nto be that kind of a crash effort in place to do just that. We need to \nobtain, on an urgent basis, a list of the basic equipment needs of the \nAfghan forces and a list of how those needs could be met in a major \nprogram to transfer equipment leaving Iraq.\n\n  Rapidly expanding Afghan's military and police forces would address \none of the major problems and risks we now face. General McChrystal \ntold us he worries that waiting until 2013 for a larger Afghan force \ncreates a gap in capabilities that brings significant risk of failure. \nBut if we accelerate the training and equipment of Afghan forces by a \nyear, we address his concern. Depending on additional capability from \nAfghanistan, rather than U.S. forces, also addresses a major problem of \npublic perception in Afghanistan. The larger our own military footprint \nthere, the more our enemies can seek to drive a wedge between us and \nthe Afghan population, spreading the falsehood that we seek to dominate \na Muslim nation.\n  Finally, we should make a concerted effort to separate the local \nTaliban from their leaders. In Iraq, large numbers of young Iraqis who \nhad been attacking us switched over to our side and became the Sons of \nIraq. They were drawn in part by the promise of jobs and amnesty for \npast attacks and in part by the recognition that the status quo was \ncreating horrific violence in their own communities. In their own \ninterests and the interests of their nation, they switched sides and \nbecame a positive force.\n  That same prospect exists in Afghanistan. Afghan leaders and our own \nmilitary leaders say that local Taliban forces are motivated largely by \nthe need for a job, loyalty to the local leader who pays them, and not \nby ideology or religious zeal. They believe an effort to attract these \nfighters to the government side could succeed if they are offered \nsecurity for themselves and their families and if there is no penalty \nfor previous activity against us.\n  General McChrystal himself has emphasized the potential for such \nreintegration to accomplish the same result as was achieved in Iraq. \nHere is what General McChrystal said on July 28:\n\n       Most of the fight materials we see in Afghanistan are \n     Afghans, some with foreign cadre with them. But most we don't \n     see are deeply ideological or even politically motivated; \n     most are operating for pay; some are\n\n[[Page S9286]]\n\n     under a commander's charismatic leadership; some are \n     frustrated with local leaders. So I believe there is \n     significant potential to go after what I would call mid- and \n     low-level Taliban fighters and leaders and offer them \n     reintegration into Afghanistan under the constitution.\n\n  But this game-changing possibility was apparently not factored into \nGeneral McChrystal's assessment. There is no plan yet to put in place a \nSons of Iraq approach in Afghanistan. It is urgent that we lay out the \nsteps that need to be taken to involve local and national Afghan \nleaders in that effort. They alone can accomplish this crucial job, but \nfirst we and our Afghan allies must draft such a plan on an urgent \nbasis, and the potential positive impact of such a plan should be taken \ninto account as we consider the need for any additional U.S. military \nresources.\n  Afghanistan's people are grateful for our aid but also eager to \nassume responsibility for their own future. In a tiny village in \nHelmand Province, we were invited to meet with the village elders at \ntheir council meeting--called a shura. A group of 100 or so men sat on \nthe floor and chatted with us about their future and their country's \nfuture. When asked how long the United States should stay, one elder \nsaid: ``Until the moment that you make our security forces self-\nsufficient. Then you will be welcome to visit us not as soldiers but as \nguests.''\n  Helping Afghanistan achieve self-sufficiency and their own security \nis everybody's goal. On that, there is little difference of opinion in \nAfghan's village councils or in the corridors of this Capitol. Can we \nhelp Afghanistan reach self-sufficiency in security fast enough? Can we \nget there in a way that regains the initiative and creates the momentum \nwe need? Can we encourage those lower level Taliban to abandon an \ninsurgency headed by terrorists whose fanaticism they do not share? I \nbelieve we can, by supporting a far more rapid growth in the Afghan \nArmy and police, by providing more trainers more quickly, by a rapid \ninfusion of two Afghan units of equipment no longer needed in Iraq, and \nby rapidly adopting a plan for the reintegration of lower level Taliban \nfighters into Afghan society. In other words, we need a surge of Afghan \nsecurity forces. Our support of their surge will show our commitment to \nthe success of a mission that is clearly in our national security \ninterest, without creating a bigger U.S. military footprint that \nprovides propaganda fodder for the Taliban.\n  I believe taking those steps on an urgent basis, while completing the \npreviously planned and announced increase in U.S. combat forces, \nprovides the best chance of success for our mission--preventing \nAfghanistan from again being run by a Taliban government which harbors \nand supports al-Qaida, whose goal is to inflict additional catastrophic \nattacks on the United States and the world. I believe we should \nimplement those steps before considering an increase in U.S. ground \ncombat forces beyond what is already planned by the end of the year.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Ohio as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9286-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 2 nights ago the President of the United \nStates spoke in the Chamber down the hall on the other side of the \nCapitol. He did what he needed to do. As I have been in the House and \nSenate--the House for 14 years and the Senate now for 2\\1/2\\--it was \nthe best speech I had ever seen in my time, sitting and listening to \nthe last three Presidents. Most importantly, it explained why this \nhealth care bill is so important and why it works for those who already \nhave insurance as it builds consumer protections around those insurance \npolicies--no more preexisting conditions, no more cutting people's care \noff because they have been too expensive, no more discrimination based \non gender or disability or age or geography. It explained why this \nlegislation makes sense for people who do not have insurance, who have \nbeen without insurance or who have inadequate insurance. It really \nexplained well why this legislation is so important to small business.\n  I have come to this floor almost daily when we were in session the \nlast few months, to share stories of Ohioans. I know the Presiding \nOfficer, as he traveled in his State, in Northern Virginia and Richmond \nand Roanoke, has heard these stories and gets these letters, too, \nshowing the depth of the problem. So many people don't have health \ncare, and so many who do have insurance have seen significant problems. \nThey have paid their premiums month after month. Then they get very \nsick, they may have to take biologic drugs, they may have long hospital \nvisits, their health care may have cost $100,000 or $200,000, and their \ninsurance company simply cuts them off. How is that fair?\n  Let me share some of these letters today for 7 or 8 minutes and then \nmake some comments about them.\n  Yvon from Wakeman in Huron County in northern Ohio writes:\n\n       My husband, a union carpenter, was out of work for 7 months \n     straight. He just went back to work in June on a week-by-week \n     basis.\n       My husband must get 130 hours of work per month to get \n     insurance. Otherwise, we have to keep paying for COBRA, which \n     expires at the end of the year.\n\n  It is also expensive.\n\n       In June he earned 129\\1/2\\ hours and we were told that \n     because it was not the required 130 hours, we had to pay out \n     of pocket. We offered to pay for the \\1/2\\ hour and were told \n     no, we could not.\n       There is no way in the world we can afford to pay for \n     private insurance. If my husband does not have enough hours, \n     we will have no insurance. It goes month to month like that. \n     I am a wife, mother, sister, cousin and aunt. I want to live.\n\n  She loses her insurance and can't get her insurance out of a \ntechnicality. These things will simply not happen under this health \ninsurance legislation we are considering over the weeks ahead, where \ninsurance companies can deny care for a whole host of reasons, where \nsomebody might not qualify for health insurance. Yvon and her husband \nwill be able to go in the health care exchange. They will be able to \nget into private care. They can get insurance, if they choose, from \nAetna or BlueCross. They can work with their union plan that her \nhusband apparently has as a carpenter or they can go into public \noption. She would have those choices.\n  Bob from Cleveland has been an owner of a steel processing firm since \n1990 and has had to grapple with deteriorating health benefits over the \nlast 5 years. His firm employs 30 employees, 20 of whom depend on the \ncompany's depreciating health care coverage\n\n[[Page S9287]]\n\nwhile the remaining 10 have had to use alternative forms of insurance--\nperhaps a spouse who works has a good insurance plan. He is hoping that \nthe reform will address the burden shouldered by small businesspeople \nand that Congress will craft legislation that protects small businesses \nfrom high insurance deductibles and premiums.\n  The Presiding Officer was in business before he was Governor of \nVirginia and understands this as a business person. When you have a \nsmall number of employees, you pay a lot more per employee for \ninsurance than if you are a larger company. Even worse, if you have 20 \nor 30 employees and 2 or 3 of them get very sick and get very expensive \ncare, that small businessperson--the owner, the company--sees their \npremiums, their costs go way up or they sometimes get cut off entirely.\n  This legislation will allow Bob and his business to take his entire \nbusiness, if he so chooses, into the exchange and go to Signa or go to \nMedical Mutual in Cleveland--it is a not-for-profit Ohio company--or go \nto Aetna or go to BlueCross or go into the public option. Bob would \nhave that choice in his business. He also would be elegible for \nsignificant tax credits as a small businessperson.\n  Ricky from Garfield Heights, OH, writes:\n\n       My doctor tried to order a MRI for my back pain. The \n     insurance company declined the request, saying I had to try \n     therapy which only worsened [my condition]. Finally, \n     insurance approved an MRI.\n       But shortly after that, my employer could no longer afford \n     that insurance and had to switch to a new provider, which \n     also meant I had to find a new doctor.\n       Still suffering from back pain, the new doctor told me I \n     needed another MRI. I asked about using the first MRI, but \n     the new insurance company told me I had to get another one. \n     So I am back to square one, with a bulging disk in my back.\n\n  One of the important things in this legislation is you can keep what \nyou have. If you have a physician, you will not be forced into another \nplan and have to choose another physician or another hospital or \nanother physical therapist, as happened in Ricky's case, or another \noccupational therapist.\n  Sharon from Springboro, OH, between Dayton and Cincinnati, in Warren \nCounty.\n\n       My husband had a stroke in June 2009 and was released from \n     the hospital a few weeks ago. That's when the real problems \n     started. Our private insurer increased co-pays to $560 a week \n     for the therapy my husband needs. I also learned insurance \n     will stop by the end of the year.\n       There's been a lot of worry. We need help now.\n\n  That is the point. This legislation, some people have said--I had \ntownhall meetings, meetings all over my State, as many did here. \nTypically, more people were supportive, who showed up--more were for \nthe bill than against, but there was certainly a significant number of \npeople against it. But a lot of people said: You have to slow down; we \ndon't want to take this too fast.\n  As President Obama said the other night, Teddy Roosevelt wanted this \n100 years ago. Harry Truman, President Kennedy, President Johnson, \nPresident Nixon, President Clinton--so many people tried to do this. We \nhave been working on this legislation intensively all year. The Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee that Senator Kennedy chaired, \non which I sit, had 11 days of what is called markup, intensive debate, \nvetting--I have never seen a committee have that long a period of \nexamination of a bill like that. We accepted 160 Republican amendments, \nand I voted for most of those amendments. This bill has a lot of \nbipartisan aspects in it. On the big questions, there are philosophical \ndisagreements to be sure. The point is, every day we wait, 30 people in \nmy State lose their insurance--30 people every single day.\n  Sharon from Springboro doesn't want us to wait any longer. We waited. \nWe worked on this. We need to do this by the end of the year.\n  I will conclude with this one because I know Senator Bond wants to \ntake the floor in a moment.\n  Vondolee from Franklin County:\n\n       We need health insurance reform. My stepfather has \n     Medicaid, without which he would have died some time ago. As \n     a young man, he had routine shoulder surgery but was \n     transfused with blood that was contaminated with Hepatitis C. \n     He subsequently suffers from other health problems, including \n     deep bone ulcers. Thank goodness he had Medicaid because he \n     would not have been able to pay for his care and recovery.\n       Please help the people, not the insurance or pharmaceutical \n     companies.\n\n  Mr. President, your comment on the insurance and pharmaceutical \ncompanies--I was here in the House of Representatives when the Medicare \npartial privatization legislation was written 5 or 6 years ago. By and \nlarge, it was written by the drug and insurance companies. It provided \na lot of private dollars that went to both of those industries.\n  Frankly, there is a very strong insurance lobby here in this Congress \ntoday. The insurance industry is spending up to $1 million a day \nlobbying against it. Insurance companies don't like this legislation.\n  A lot of the myths we hear in our town meetings, the myths about \nillegal immigrants getting coverage under this plan, getting \nsubsidies--not true; the myths about death panels--not true; the myths \nabout euthanasia--not true. A lot of that comes from the insurance \ncompanies in this town. They have a lot to lose. If this legislation \npasses, the insurance companies will not do quite as well as they have \nbeen doing, but this bill is in the public interest, not in the special \ninterests.\n  Those are some of the letters I have received. I know many in this \nbody receive letters just like this from people all over their States.\n  This legislation is necessary. We need to work hard and move forward \non this in the weeks ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 8 years ago today, terrorists based in \nAfghanistan carried out the deadliest attacks on American soil since \nPearl Harbor. It was on that horrifying September morning in 2001 that \nAmerica's worst fears were realized. No longer was terrorism something \nthat only happened on the other side of the globe. Instead, those \nterrorist killers had struck the very heart of America here at home.\n  Long before 9/11, there were deadly warnings, warnings that for the \nmost part went unheeded. For over two decades, al-Qaida and other \nterrorists attacked our Nation, from the marine barracks bombing in \nBeirut in October 1983 to the Pan Am 103 bombing in 1988, from the \nfirst World Trade Center bombing in 1993 to the Embassy bombings in \n1998, to the USS Cole attacks in 2000. While al-Qaida declared war \nagainst the United States a long time ago, it took the tragedy of \nSeptember 11 and the loss of thousands of lives before America decided \nto fight back.\n  Today, as we reflect on the anniversary of 9/11 and the lives lost \nthat day, we can honor the victims and their families by finishing the \njob in Afghanistan and defeating the terrorists who are bent on death \nand destruction.\n  I agree with the comments of my colleague, the Senator from Michigan, \nwho said that we need to build the Afghan Army to 240,000. We need to \nbuild and strengthen the Afghan police. But we also must support \nPresident Obama's chosen general, GEN Stanley McChrystal, in his \nrequest for needed troops and resources.\n  President Obama has called Afghanistan an ``international security \nchallenge of the highest order.'' I agree. When the President stressed \nthat ``the safety of people around the world is at stake,'' he did not \noverstate the importance of succeeding in Afghanistan.\n  President Obama used even starker terms when he spoke to our veterans \nat this year's VFW convention and said:\n\n       Those who attacked America on 9/11 are plotting to do so \n     again. If left unchecked, the Taliban insurgency will mean an \n     even larger safe haven from which al-Qaida would plot to kill \n     more Americans. So this is not only a war worth fighting, \n     this is fundamental to the defense of our people.\n\n  I could not agree more. While the President has used this week to \npitch health care reform, I hope after reflecting on the anniversary of \nthe September 11 attacks, he will refocus his attention and that of the \nAmerican people on achieving victory in Afghanistan.\n  To repeat, terrorism is the premiere challenge of our time. If we \nfail to conquer this challenge, nothing else will matter much, not even \nhealth care reform. As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence \nCommittee, I can tell you that al-Qaida and other radical Islamic\n\n[[Page S9288]]\n\nterrorists have not stopped trying to strike Americans at home and our \nallies around the world.\n  It is critical that my own party, Republicans, support President \nObama in the fight against terrorists. We Republicans must demonstrate \nthat politics ends at the water's edge and strongly support the \nstrategy the President has laid out with his generals for victory in \nAfghanistan.\n  Let's avoid the politics we too often saw in Iraq, declaring defeat \nwhere our troops in theater were fighting for their lives and our \nfreedom; undercutting our President while he tried to help rally allies \nto join us in the battle.\n  For my Democratic colleagues, I hope they follow the stirring words \nof the leader of their party at the VFW and do not give in to the \npundits peddling pessimism. Do not give in to the leftwing that has \nprematurely declared defeat in Afghanistan, as they so readily declared \nin Iraq; much, I might add, to the grave concern of our troops in \nharm's way, which I heard firsthand by e-mail from my son in Fallujah.\n  Many of the naysayers are saying that victory in Afghanistan is not \npossible. We hear the refrain over and over: It has been 8 years. Why \nhave we not left? Unfortunately, our country has a history of \nabandoning Afghanistan.\n  Earlier this week in an interview, Defense Secretary Robert Gates \nacknowledged what a serious strategic mistake our Nation made turning \nour backs on Afghanistan after Soviet forces were defeated there two \ndecades ago. Sadly, under administrations of both parties America has \nrepeatedly ignored the lessons of history, repeatedly turned our backs \non Afghanistan. It is no wonder the people of Afghanistan doubt our \ncommitment to their defense.\n  The problems we face in Afghanistan today are in many ways more \ncomplex than those we faced on September 12, 2001. We know al-Qaida has \nfound sanctuary in Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas. The \nTaliban government is gone, but the Taliban insurgency has risen and \nhas grown in strength. This insurgency has prevented the new Afghan \nGovernment from establishing its writ throughout Afghanistan and \nthreatens Afghanistan's long-term stability.\n  If not stopped, this insurgency could once again allow a terrorist \nsafe haven, whether for al-Qaida or other terrorist groups, to flourish \nin Afghanistan. We cannot let that happen. President Obama's new \nstrategy, being implemented by General McChrystal, is our best chance \nof success.\n  Now, do not get me wrong. While we are on the right path to long-term \nvictory in Afghanistan, the road will not be easy. In fact, it is going \nto get worse before it gets better. We have seen evidence of this \nalready. The fighting has been tough in Afghanistan the last few \nmonths, and too many of our brave troops have been wounded or killed in \naction. Those recent casualties should not come as a surprise, however, \nto anyone who has been following events in Afghanistan. U.S. Marines \nrecently began clearing rural areas in southern Afghanistan that have \nserved as Taliban safe havens for years.\n  Before these operations began, our military commanders very clearly \nwarned Congress and the American people that taking southern \nAfghanistan back from the Taliban would be costly. As the father of a \nmarine who served two tours of duty in Iraq, I did not take this news \nlightly. But many of my colleagues in the Senate and I agreed then and \nagree now that defeating the militants is a job that must be done.\n  Our brave marines will no doubt succeed in clearing these areas in \nsouthern Afghanistan of terrorists, the same terrorists who brazenly \nthrow acid in the faces of young girls on their way to school and \ncoldly murder mullahs who have the audacity to disagree with their \nbrand of hatred. But even after this is accomplished, much work will \nstill need to be done in a country recovering from decades of war.\n  Key to our success is General McChrystal's recognition of the \nimportance of building sustainable security in Afghanistan through the \nuse of ``smart power,'' combining military power with economic \ndevelopment, education, and diplomatic strategies.\n  While we need military forces to build security in the short term, \nsustaining long-term security requires smart power. Before Afghans can \nchoose peace and the democratic process, they need enough food to eat \nand a stable community in which to live. That is exactly what ``smart \npower'' seeks to do. This same strategy is already proving successful \nin Afghanistan's Nangarhar Province.\n  During a visit to Afghanistan in 2006 with General Eikenberry, I \nheard from him and President Karzai of the need to improve and rebuild \nthe agricultural sector in Afghanistan. I tried to do so through the \ncreation of a land grant university consortium that would set up an \nagricultural extension service through USAID. Unfortunately, USAID \nlacked the capacity to implement this vision.\n  So I turned to my friends, the soldiers and airmen in the Missouri \nGuard who, in their civilian lives, were farmers and possessed other \nagricultural expertise to empower the Afghans. For over a year, the \nMissouri National Guard's Agricultural Development Teams, ADTs, have \nbeen helping Afghans harvest high-value alternatives to opium poppies \nand build irrigation systems and wells for clean water.\n  Decades of war in Afghanistan have left most of the country mired in \n18th century practices. These ADTs provide agricultural specialists to \nhelp the Afghans rebuild their agricultural know-how and literally sow \nthe seeds of peace in Afghanistan. Thanks to the ADTs' dedication and \nhard work, poppy production in Nangarhar has been virtually eliminated, \nwhere it was the second most prolific producer of poppies before.\n  The first of these teams started to work in Nangarhar in February of \n2008. The second rotation is underway. I just joined friends and family \nback in Missouri to celebrate the send-off of the third rotation of the \nADTs. By showing a consistent commitment to the people in Nangarhar, \nthese citizen soldiers have built relationships and trust at the local \nlevel, influencing hearts and minds to reject the deadly influence of \nthe radical extremists.\n  Like ``The Show Me State'' motto, Missourians have shown the way \nforward. Thanks to their leadership, 10 other States are now sending \nspecialized Agricultural Development Teams to provinces throughout \nAfghanistan.\n  These successes make it clear that we need to increase the investment \nin smart power strategies through these agricultural teams. Ten other \nState National Guards are now committed to the vital mission of \nbuilding sustainable economies, protecting them with military force \nprovince by province. We need appropriate military protection in every \nprovince in Afghanistan. The Guard is uniquely suited to this mission. \nBut we also need Federal military and economic efforts.\n  In addition to smart power, General McChrystal also understands that \na counterinsurgency strategy is key to success in Afghanistan. I have \nbeen disappointed to listen to the talking heads in Washington advocate \nrecently for an alternative approach, a mere counterterrorism strategy.\n  It is easy, of course, to play arm chair general from thousands of \nmiles away. But these talking heads seem to have forgotten that a \ncounterterrorism strategy alone failed in Iraq. Not surprisingly, it \nhas failed so far in Afghanistan.\n\n  Counterterrorism by remote control does not cut it. The so-called \nsurgical strikes, whether by air or ground, increase civilian \ncasualties and only allow insurgents, from the Taliban to the drug \nlords to al-Qaida, to filter back in once the attacks are over. This \napproach leaves the people in the country subject to retaliation if \nthey do not cooperate with the terrorists, which, not surprisingly, \nthey do.\n  Conversely, the counterinsurgency strategy will ensure the violent \ninsurgents are defeated and do not come back. I also agree with the \nadministration that part of this strategy must allow some of the ``day \nfighters,'' those who are hard-core al-Qaida supporters or Taliban \nideologues, to lay down their weapons and to return to peaceful lives.\n  If we are getting the job done right, we will naturally lure \ndesperate young men away from the false promises of extremism. A viable \nand appropriately resourced counterinsurgency strategy is not only \nessential for success in Afghanistan, it is pivotal in the future of \nPakistan.\n\n[[Page S9289]]\n\n  Driving terrorist safe havens out of eastern and southern Afghanistan \nis crucial, but not if al-Qaida and Taliban militants continue to find \nsanctuary in the remote border regions of west Pakistan. The threat \nthese transplanted terrorists pose has become even more real over the \nlast 6 months as the world watched Taliban militants creep closer to \nPakistani nuclear facilities.\n  We must support the Pakistan Government and its newly aggressive \nmilitary action to take out the terrorists threatening their country \nand Afghanistan.\n  The horrors of nuclear-armed terrorists would be put at risk and put \nat risk freedom-loving people everywhere. This is not a risk we or the \nworld can take. The stakes of turning our backs on this conflict could \nnot be higher. America ignored the fact that Afghanistan became one \ngiant camp for terrorists in the 1990s, and thousands of Americans died \non 9/11 as a result. And thousands of our brave troops have died in \ndefense of our Nation since then.\n  We face a similar threat today, 8 years after 9/11. Al-Qaida has \nshifted their terrorist sanctuaries from Afghanistan to the Federally \nAdministered Tribal Areas, FATA, of Pakistan. The Taliban, the same \npeople who sheltered Osama bin Laden and defied U.S. demands to hand \nhim over, now fight efforts by the international community to bring \nstability to Afghanistan.\n  Our U.S. withdrawal, in whole or in part, from Afghanistan now would \nbe a tacit yet unambiguous approval for the return of Taliban control \nover Afghanistan. In turn, this would lead to the establishment of safe \nhavens for many of the world's most violent and feared terrorists. \nAmerican abandonment of Afghanistan now could possibly hand over the \nkeys to a nuclear-armed kingdom to violence-loving terrorists.\n  I returned this past August from Denmark and Greece, two relatively \nsmall countries but steadfast allies in their resolve to support the \nNATO mission and stabilize Afghanistan. Declaring defeat in Afghanistan \ntoday would signal to our allies that Americans no longer have the \nresolve to defeat terrorists. Declaring defeat in Afghanistan today \nwould signal to our allies that simply by waiting us out, violent \nextremists can triumph over the combined military and economic might of \nthe international community. Finally, declaring defeat in Afghanistan \ntoday would signal to the families of those who died on September 11 \nand the troops who have fought since then in the years since in service \nto their country that their loved ones died in vain. These are not \nsignals our great Nation should ever send.\n  Instead, we must declare unequivocally our courage, resolve, and \npatience to provide needed resources and more troops to allow the smart \npower strategy of General McChrystal to succeed. This alone is the \nsignal America should send.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, before I make some comments \nabout our departed colleague, Senator Kennedy, I must comment on the \ngravity of the remembrance of this day in history several years ago.\n  There is not a person living who was old enough at the time on that \nfateful day in 2001 who does not remember exactly where they were when \nthe tragedy occurred and this Nation was struck by terrorists, struck \nfrom within.\n  Our Nation had grown up in its history of always having been \nprotected in the homeland, protected by geography, with two big oceans \nthat kept us insulated from attack from without. Then suddenly we were \nshocked into the realization that we could be attacked on our own \nhomeland. Of course, what America has done in reaction to that, in \nperfecting our defenses, in increasing our intelligence apparatus, so \nthat we get the information before the terrorists can carry out their \ndastardly deeds.\n  That has been significant in the protection of this Nation and its \npeople. Of course, we remember exactly that fateful day, every one of \nus. This Senator was only a few yards from this Chamber on the west \nfront of this U.S. Capitol building in a meeting with leadership. We \nwere aware that the Twin Towers had been struck with the first and \nsecond planes. Somehow we wanted to continue our meeting, even though \nour minds couldn't stay on the subject matter of the day, when someone \nburst in the room--I believe it is S-219--and said the Pentagon had \nbeen hit. We leapt to the window overlooking the Mall in the direction \nof the Pentagon and could see the black smoke rising.\n  It is interesting the reactions you have at a time such as that. My \nwife and I had, a few days before, moved into an apartment overlooking \nthe southwest corner of the Pentagon. It is called Pentagon Row. Of \ncourse, I leapt to a telephone to try to get a message to her to get \nout of the apartment and get into the basement garage. Being \nunsuccessful to reach her, I came back into the room everyone had \ndeserted and out into the hallway, seeing the hallway crowded with \npeople going down the stairs and hearing the Capitol policeman at the \nbottom of the stairs saying: Get out of the building, run, run, get out \nof the building. Of course, the report had come in that the fourth \nairplane was inbound for Washington.\n  It was a day that brought Senator Rockefeller and me together, as he \nbeckoned to me to get into his car and, as we drove away from the \nCapitol complex, scrambling with our cell phones, trying to get office \nstaff to tell them to get out of the buildings and get to a location \nwhere they could inform us away from the Capitol complex. Senator \nRockefeller and I wound through streets in Washington until we got to a \nlocation where we could wait to try to get additional information. \nSince then, of course, our Capitol police force and the Department of \nHomeland Security have come through with procedures and instructions \nthat are much more definitive than we had on that day.\n  I will never forget on that day when Senator Rockefeller and I \ndecided we needed to move away from the location we were--we wanted to \nget to a place we could get news; we went to his home--hearing not a \nsound in the sky since all air traffic had been ceased on order of the \nSecretary of Transportation, but then hearing that silent sky being \npierced by the sound of F-15s overflying the Capitol. It was a day that \nwe not only can remember but that we can take great lessons and \ninstruction from to prepare not to let it happen again, one we remember \ntoday and those people who sacrificed, those people who were the \nvictims.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9289-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9289-S9290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is equally a solemn subject \non which I rise to remember our friend and colleague Ted Kennedy who \ndied at the young age of 77. I say ``young age'' because it was another \none of our colleagues, Senator John Glenn, who flew on a 10-day \nspaceflight at age 77. Today, 11 years later, he still looks as young \nas he looked back then. So 77 is way too young an age for cancer to \ntake our friend Ted Kennedy.\n  From the funeral and the remembrances, we know that he was the \nyoungest of nine children. He had four brothers. He was born in 1932 \nand elected to the Senate in 1962. He spent 46 years in the Senate, \nlonger than all but two of our colleagues. He loved this institution, \nand he loved his fellow Senators. Of course, so many pieces of major \nlegislation affecting the well-being of the American people if they \ndon't have his name on it, certainly bear his fingerprints. Many of \nthose pieces of legislation reflect the work of his pen.\n  He fought tirelessly for the sick, the poor, the disabled, the \nchildren, the old. He was the driving force behind efforts to guarantee \nrights to the disabled, to provide family and medical leave, and to \nensure a fair minimum wage. He also remembered individuals, both his \ncolleagues, his staff, and his constituents. He was the first person to \ncall during hard times. Why do you think that yesterday, our most \nesteemed colleague, Senator Byrd, in his bent-over, physically disabled \ncondition now, was wheeled to this floor in his wheelchair, and his \nvoice rose to the occasion in memorializing his friend. I remember \nSenator Byrd telling me how thoughtful Senator Kennedy was on a major \nbirthday in his\n\n[[Page S9290]]\n\n80s, when Senator Kennedy had sent him the requisite number of roses.\n  Of course, no matter what your political persuasion, you could see \nTed Kennedy as an example of public service. He devoted his entire life \nto public service. He did so despite his easy financial condition. He \ndid so despite numerous opportunities elsewhere. He did so despite \nseeing his three brothers sacrifice their lives in service to their \ncountry.\n  I want to quote from our colleague Ted Kennedy, a quote from April \n2006. He said:\n\n       The defining aspect of our country is opportunity--the hope \n     that you can do better, that your children can do better. But \n     you need an even playing field. To do that, you can't be sick \n     and in school. You've got to have health care. You've got to \n     have an economy working to give people a chance to get ahead. \n     It is not guaranteed. But you do have to have an opportunity. \n     Our country is big enough and strong enough and wealthy \n     enough to give that kind of opportunity to everybody. That's \n     what I work on every day.\n\n  What an example for all of us. There is something else I wish to say \nabout our colleague, because much has been made of his flaws. But who \namong us does not have flaws? Maybe Senator Kennedy realized so much \nhis flaws that he decided despite those, he was going to do the best he \ncould do for his fellow humankind. So he dedicated his life to the \npoor, the sick, the young and old, and the disabled. He fought against \ndiscrimination of all types. Indeed, he stood up for the least among \nus. Who cannot admire that, in being a champion for the least among us.\n  Godspeed, Ted Kennedy.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I join my colleagues today in \nremembering the amazing life of Senator Edward Kennedy, a man beloved \nin the Senate and beloved in America.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife Vicki, his children, and \nhis whole family.\n  Like so many others, I consider myself lucky to have worked with him. \nHe was more than a colleague, he was a mentor and a friend.\n  I remember that he used to send me a message, ``The lantern is lit,'' \nwhen we would have late night votes. It was his way of beckoning me and \na small group of Senators--Senator Schumer, Senator Cantwell and maybe \none or two others--to his office in the Capitol where he would regale \nus with stories as only an Irishman would.\n  Ted Kennedy's wit and stories, his passion for a cause and his \ncountry and his love for the Senate made me want to go to work every \nday. He never gave up and he had a fiery zest for the legislative \nbattles that was always tempered by a bipartisan pragmatism.\n  I remember last year when we were working on the Medicare \nimprovements bill, which was absolutely critical to Medicare recipients \nacross the country.\n  Seniors were counting on us to pass this bill, but we were just one \nvote short of the 60 we needed. But Harry Reid knew how to find that \nlast vote. The afternoon of the vote, the doors of the Senate swung \nopen and in walked Senator Kennedy.\n  I will always remember watching him walk onto the Senate floor with \nthen-Senator Obama and his son Patrick on either side of him. Every \nsingle Senator had made their way to the floor, and the gallery was \nfull. Applause erupted as he walked out, even though it is against the \nSenate rules. Each of us gave him a tearful hug and kiss as he made his \nway to cast his vote.\n  His very presence seemed to open the floodgates. Suddenly, a bill \nthat was about to fail by one vote passed by nine as Republicans who \nhad spent weeks blocking the bill suddenly switched their votes after \nSenator Kennedy.\n  His presence was so persuasive that day because his colleagues knew \nthese were issues he believed in deeply, and had spent his life \nfighting for. He never gave up on the good fight.\n  Ted Kennedy, with his booming voice, gave a voice to the voiceless \nand stood up for those who had no one standing with them. As he said, \n``We are all part of the American family and we have a responsibility \nto help members of that family when they are in need.''\n  Ted Kennedy did more than just speak these words, he lived them. Day \nin and day out on the Senate floor, he fought for justice and equality \nand opportunity for all Americans.\n  I will give you just one example, after we tragically lost our friend \nand colleague Paul Wellstone, Senator Kennedy picked up his torch and \nhelped get the Mental Health Parity Act through the Senate.\n  His many achievements will be etched in the history books and his \nlegacy will live on in the hundreds of laws that bear his name.\n  But Ted Kennedy will be remembered for more than just his \nlegislation, he will remembered for his heart and his humor and his \nzest for life.\n  On a snowy winter day in Washington, DC, one year, one of my friends \ntook his family to go to sledding and who should he see? Senator \nKennedy and Senator Dodd across the way, sledding down by the National \nCathedral.\n  This is the Ted Kennedy I will remember, a man who made the most of \nlife, a man who loved his friends and his family and a man who worked \neach and every day to make this country stronger.\n  While he will no longer walk onto the Senate floor, he will remain \nwith us through the lessons he taught us and the memories he blessed us \nwith.\n  Today, let us honor his life by picking up his torch and continuing \nto fight the good fights, while also respecting those on the other side \nof us.\n  Let us fulfill his dream of ``an America where we can all contend \nfreely and vigorously, but where we will treasure and guard those \nstandards of civility which alone make this nation safe for both \ndemocracy and diversity.''\n  Ted Kennedy loved this country and was willing to work with anyone \nand find common ground in order to open the doors of opportunity for \nall Americans.\n  He carried the weight of history on his shoulders, but rose up to \nbecome the lion of the Senate and one of the greatest legislators in \nthe our country's history.\n  Although he is no longer with us, he will continue to inspire us.\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, September 11 is a day of the year that \nhas special resonance for all Americans and always should. Earlier this \nweek I was honored to stand with some of the family members of those \nwho died 8 years ago this morning on flight 93. They were here to mark \nthe establishment of a memorial to those brave men and women who gave \ntheir lives that day over a field in Pennsylvania and who in the \nprocess may very well have saved the lives of many of us here. Their \nrole in history will now be forever memorialized here in the Capitol, \nensuring that we never forget their sacrifice nor the sacrifice of the \nthousands of other innocent men and women who were taken from us on \nthat terrible day. This is just as it should be, because as I said \nduring the ceremony earlier this week, there are some moments in the \nlife of a nation that are worth remembering. There are others that are \nimpossible to forget. September 11, 2001, is both.\n  All of us who lived through that day know this to be true. We know \nthat with each passing year, the day itself may become more distant in \ntime but the memories do not. And yet it is important we mark that day \neach year with sadness for those whom we lost; with solemn pride in the \nheroes of 9/11; and with renewed determination to confront terrorism \nwherever it is found. The memory of the fallen impels us.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, like all Americans, I will never forget \nwhere I was on September 11, 2001, and I will never forget the way our \ncountry responded. In the face of great tragedy,\n\n[[Page S9291]]\n\nAmericans came together with courage and unity.\n  Eight years later, we continue to face great challenges. As a \ngovernment--and as a nation--we are working to improve our safety and \ntackle the many difficulties facing us today. The safety of all \nAmericans remains priority No. 1 for everyone in government. We still \nhave troops working hard to protect and defend our Nation. At the same \ntime, we continue to recognize that our diversity is also America's \ngreatest strength. Despite our many differences, in times of need we \nare always one nation united.\n  This year, for the first time, 9/11 has been designated a National \nDay of Service and Remembrance. It is with a heavy heart that I stand \non the floor of the Senate today marking this day with a cloak and \nwhite roses on the desk of our departed colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  Ted worked to designate this day as one of service, and in April the \nPresident signed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act making that \ngoal a reality. Ted would be proud of each and every American who took \nup that call.\n  The mission of this new designation is:\n\n       [T]o honor the victims of 9/11 and those who rose to \n     service in response to the attacks by encouraging all \n     Americans and others throughout the world to pledge to \n     voluntarily perform at least one good deed, or another \n     service activity on 9/11 each year. In this way we hope to \n     create a lasting and forward-looking legacy--annually \n     rekindling the spirit of service, tolerance, and compassion \n     that unified America and the world in the immediate aftermath \n     of the 9/11 attacks.\n\n  I cannot think of a better way to honor the memory of those who were \nlost than by taking a moment today to remember, and then performing a \ngood deed or act of service.\n  September 11 is not just a day of national loss but of personal loss. \nMy thoughts and prayers go out to everyone who lost a friend or loved \none. Your loss is our loss, and you are forever in our hearts.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise on this most solemn of occasions as \nour Nation pauses to commemorate the horrific September 11 terrorist \nattacks that were perpetrated against our country 8 years ago. With \nutmost reverence for the unimaginable loss experienced on that fateful \nmorning at the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and in a field near \nShanksville, PA, we remember with the heaviest of hearts all of those \ntragically taken too soon. And in my home State of Maine, we join \nfamilies who pay tribute to victims they knew and loved--Anna Allison, \nCarol Flyzik, Robert Jalbert, Jacqueline Norton, Robert Norton, James \nRoux, Robert Schlegel, and Stephen Ward. Their lives were deplorably \ncut short, but they will be eternally etched in our memory.\n  Indeed, this is a heartbreaking anniversary--one of inconsolable \nsorrow and anguish that recalls vicious and inhuman attacks against our \nfellow citizens and our nation. But this is also a time when all that \nmay divide us is set aside to focus on everything that unites us as we \ncoalesce together as a single and unconquerable voice against the \nforces of treachery and terror that sought to destroy us and break our \nspirit.\n  We share in the grief borne by those with family and friends who \nperished in these heinous acts of cowardice, and we join with them in \npaying homage to their memories and the legacies they leave behind. And \nwe recognize that even the march of time can never fully diminish the \nlitany of emotions we experience as we strive to comprehend how such \nmalice could exist in the world and could be committed so ruthlessly \nagainst innocent people.\n  Yet amid the trials and tribulations that this date in our history \nevokes, we take solace in the sacred truth that none of us grieves \nalone, that there are no strangers among us--only Americans.\n  We recall that, during one of the darkest days in our Nation's \nextraordinary and storied history, we also witnessed our Nation's \nmettle and solidarity, the inexhaustible courage and undaunted bravery \nthat provided us with boundless inspiration and hope that sustained us \nthen and inspires us today. And nowhere was that more evident than with \nthe first responders who, in the face of unspeakable adversity and \nperil, heroically ran toward the very dangers others were desperately \ntrying to escape, placing their lives in harm's way in the most \ncourageous and valiant of endeavors to save others without regard for \ntheir own safety.\n  The noble devotion of the firefighters, police officers, and rescue \nworkers has forever established a selfless example of seemingly \nordinary Americans performing extraordinary deeds in the service of \nothers. Those men and women of valor illustrated the lasting and \npowerful truism that the benevolent forces that seek to uplift \nhumankind will ultimately prevail over those base elements that would \nconspire to bring it down.\n  We also honor all who, in the days following September 11, searched \nfor survivors and worked in the devastation at Ground Zero, the \nPentagon, and in the wreckage of United flight 93. Many--indeed, far \ntoo many--of these fearless responders paid with their own lives or now \nlive with the indelible effects of having worked so closely to the \nrubble and ruin. They gave their all so that we could heal as a Nation \nand we will never forget their exceptional contributions.\n  Their service and sacrifice are also a vivid reminder of the \nexceptional men and women who have donned our country's uniform to \nsafeguard and defend our Nation. Whether on our shores or soil here at \nhome or around the globe, their steadfast sense of duty and love of \ncountry are an inspiration to us all, their commitment fortifies our \ndetermination, and their professionalism steadies our hands in an \nuncertain world.\n  Like every American, the details of the morning of September 11, \n2001, are powerfully seared in my mind from how it originated with \nbeautiful and clear blue skies to its conclusion with a grief-stricken \nNation in mourning and stunned disbelief. I watched the images on the \ntelevision along with the rest of the world, and later that day as the \nSun set over the National Mall--still capped by the billowing smoke \nfrom the wound in the side of the Pentagon--I joined my colleagues in \nthe House and Senate on the U.S. Capitol steps in singing, ``God Bless \nAmerica.'' It was an unmistakable message of unity and one that \ndemonstrated to the country and to the world that we would never be \ndeterred--that our freedoms could never be crushed by the blunt and \ntortuous instruments of terror that are no match against a resilient \npeople certain in the knowledge that good ultimately triumphs over \nevil.\n  The unending pain of loved ones lost does not ease with the passing \nof years, and yet out of the horrors of these atrocities emerged heroes \nwho were then and will forever be shining testaments to the very best \nof who we are as a nation. And so, today, we memorialize those whose \nlives were stilled on September 11, and at the same time, we cannot \nhelp but extol the unbounded courage and indomitable spirit exhibited \non that day and during the aftermath that continues to be the hallmark \nof this great land.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today marks the eighth anniversary of \nAmerica's war on terror--the day we began to fight back. But 9/11 was \nnot the day the war began. Radical Islamic terrorists were at war with \nthe United States long before that harrowing morning 8 years ago. That \nis crucial to remember now as the terror and tragedy of that day \nrecedes into the past.\n  This war did not begin with the 9/11 attacks or when we sent troops \nto Afghanistan and it will not end when we defeat terrorists on any \nbattlefield. Our goal cannot be merely to end one war but to win the \nwar on terror. We will not win by trying to appease the grievances of \nour enemies. They do not hate our policies--they hate us, our freedoms, \nand our way of life.\n  The 3,000 on 9/11 were the consequence of a broad bipartisan failure \nof American leadership to understand that hate. The consequences of \nforgetting now will be far worse. Our enemies' strategy is based on \nwhat they see as our short memory. As the terrifying images of 9/11 \nfade, our enemies believe we will lose our nerve and retreat back into \nthe false sense of security they exploited with those four jetliners on \n9/11.\n  We cannot let that happen. If we lose our resolve and surrender our \nvigilance, the next attack might not be in airplanes but something far \nmore devastating and lethal. Their plan depends on us forgetting, and \nso our challenge is to never forget.\n  We have sacrificed in blood and treasure. Thousands of families have \nlost what can never be replaced. From the men of Flight 93 to the \nmountains of Afghanistan to the sands of Iraq, heroes have fallen. \nToday we mourn their loss, honor their memory, and recommit to finish \nthe work they began, not just in foreign theaters of war but here at \nhome. The challenge of 9/11 is not just to win a war but to prevent the \nnext one. We will do that by remembering that our enemies are still \nhating and still planning. We must never forget.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.

Mr. President, there are a lot of things happening in the \nUnited States and the world today. There are many issues and challenges \nwe face. Obviously, the issue of health care reform has dominated the \nnews and our attention. We had a somewhat interesting joint session of \nCongress the night before last.\n  But there are also other issues facing the Congress and the Nation. \nOne of them, of course, is our strategy in Afghanistan. My colleagues \nhave been discussing and debating that, and we will, as has the \nPresident, continue to debate and discuss as the President makes some \nvery tough decisions concerning Afghanistan.\n  I have the greatest respect and regard for my colleague and friend, \nthe distinguished chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. He \nand I are in agreement on many issues. It is very clear that Senator \nLevin wants a larger Afghan National Army. I have long maintained we \nneed a larger Afghan Army. But I believe it is a false choice to try to \ngrow the Afghan National Army while holding back on any additional U.S. \ncombat troops.\n  I remind my colleagues that the lesson of Iraq, and the one General \nMcChrystal wants to put into place in Afghanistan, is we do not get \nvery far merely by putting individuals through a training course and \nreleasing them into combat. As a matter of fact, when we examine the \nhistory, the very unhappy history of our engagement and involvement in \nIraq, there was a time when the Iraqi Army was built up to a very large \nsize--as I recall, around a couple hundred thousand--and then it \nbasically collapsed, totally collapsed in the face of attacks from both \nShia and Sunni extremists.\n  I think the buildup of the Afghan Army is an important component but \nremember, the lesson of Iraq was that our troops went out and fought \nand lived and spent 24/7 with the Iraqi military and gradually, over \ntime, they became a far more capable fighting force and one of which \nall of us can be proud. It is mentorship at every level, including \npartnership in joint operations with U.S. forces, that will build a \nrobust and capable Afghan military and pave the way for our eventual \nsuccessful exit from Afghanistan. To do this\n\n[[Page S9293]]\n\nwe need more U.S. combat troops in Afghanistan.\n  There is a lot more I would like to say about it, but there are vital \nareas that are controlled by the Taliban and its allies today. It will \nrequire U.S. military force to shape, clear, hold, and build in those \nareas. If we await the day when the Afghan National Army is increased \nin size and is capable of carrying out all these operations fully on \nits own, it may well be too late. We are reaching a decisive moment in \nAfghan history and our own. I believe the United States must commit the \ndecisive force levels to bring about a significant change in the \nsecurity environment in Afghanistan with the aim of seeing real change \nover the next 12 to 18 months.\n  This issue will continue to be an issue of mounting concern and \nimportance to the American people. But I also want to point out, in the \nface of mounting reports of fraud and abuse carried out during the \nrecent Afghan Presidential elections, I have real concerns about the \nintegrity of the electoral process there. Yesterday, the Electoral \nComplaints Commission, a body backed by the United Nations, threw out \nvotes from 83 polling stations across three provinces due to fraud. It \nalso ordered recounts at hundreds of other polling stations and is due \nto examine irregularities in other areas of the country. These and \nother serious allegations of fraud undermine the perceived legitimacy \nof this election. I believe that perception is key to Afghan's \npolitical future. I believe we must urge the Electoral Complaints \nCommission to complete its work as soon as possible and to present a \nfull report with its assessment of the fairness of the election in its \nentirety.\n  The Afghan people desire and deserve a fair electoral process and a \nleader who is elected legitimately. This election must be breakthrough \nfor Afghanistan in terms of better governance, more competence, and \nless corruption. They have suffered from poor governance for far too \nlong. We should desire no less and take the necessary steps to ensure \nthat the government we are backing in Kabul is legitimate and has the \nsupport of the Afghan people and the international community.\n  I recall when it was fraud and an unfair election in Ukraine and the \nUnited States of America lent its weight and support of the then Orange \nRevolution and a free and fair election was held. We will wait until \nthe electoral commissions issue their findings, but I am very concerned \nalready about the information that we have concerning significant voter \nfraud. That may have called for a runoff election between President \nKarzai and his leading opponent, Abdullah Abdullah.\n  While all Americans take occasion today to commemorate the terrible \nattacks of 2001, each of us also has cause to reflect on some of the \nlessons our Nation learned in the wake of 9/11. Its often hard to think \nclearly about the days before those attacks, when the world seemed at \nonce a safer and more distant place, and our country a superpower in a \nsecure neighborhood. We saw before 9/11 that America had interests \nacross the globe, and we believed that our actions must be motivated by \nthe ideals that have made us great. Yet we also often assumed--\nwrongly--that the volatility that spilled across distant shores would \nnever wash over ours; that instability and repression in remote and \nobscure places was cause for tragedy but not for alarm.\n  We have learned a lot since that day. We have learned that history is \noften made in the very remote and obscure places that draw so little of \nour attention. We have learned that the degree of freedom and stability \nin other countries is connected to the security we enjoy at home. And \nwe have learned that we must remain the authors of history, or face \nbecoming its victims.\n  Today I would like to spend just a few moments discussing recent \nevents in one of those places which, I would bet, seems like a \nperipheral concern to most Americans. Few of us wake up in the morning \nscouring the papers for the latest news from Lebanon, or follow the ins \nand outs of politics in Beirut. Yet in recent days we, have seen the \nportents of new political crisis in Lebanon and, while all of us must \nhope that it will be resolved easily and peacefully, we know from the \nhistory of that country that it very well may not be.\n  Yesterday, Prime Minister-designate Saad Hariri stepped down, unable \nto form a national unity government some 2\\1/1\\ months after his \nelection in June. After his moderate and relatively pro-Western party \nwon the largest number of seats in the Lebanese parliament, Mr. Hariri \nproposed the formation of a broad based government that would even \naward a share of the cabinet posts to Hezbollah.\n  Yet Hezbollah has been intent on thwarting these efforts to form a \ncabinet.\n  Despite the fact that the Lebanese constitution confers on the \nPresident and Prime Minister the power to make cabinet appointments, \nand irrespective of Mr. Hariri's repeated attempts to form a \ngovernment, talks have broken down over the demand by a Hezbollah-\nallied party that it retain the Telecommunications Ministry. This may \nappear to be a small and insignificant point of contention, and surely \nnot one that would prompt an incoming Prime Minister to abandon his \npost, until we consider that Hezbollah badly wants to retain control \nover telecommunications and surveillance in Lebanon.\n  Hezbollah, of course, not only possesses a surveillance capacity and \nan independent communications and broadcasting system, but also retains \nvast weaponry befitting its status as an independent militia. Along \nwith its Syrian and Iranian sponsors, Hezbollah continues to both exert \ninfluence outside the constitutional process and invite foreign \nmeddling in Lebanese affairs.\n  I believe that the United States should take a strong stand in favor \nof respecting the outcome of the June democratic elections, and urge \nthe parties in Lebanon to form a government in a manner that respects \nthe constitutional process. Over the longer term, it is abundantly \nclear that there can be no durable peace in Lebanon, nor any long-term \nstability in the political process there, so long as Hezbollah \ncontinues to act freely as an armed, independent militia. According to \nsome reports, Hezbollah remains today the best armed force in the \ncountry, better armed, indeed, than even the Lebanese Armed Forces. \nSuch a situation invites further fighting at some point between \nHezbollah and Israel and suggests that Hezbollah will continue to use \nits military power to induce cooperation with its demands at home. \nSooner or later, one way or another, and as the U.N. Security Council \nhas demanded, Hezbollah must be disarmed.\n  We should also make perfectly clear to Syria that better ties with \nthe United States will require an end to its malign interference in its \nneighbor's affairs. The administration has made a major effort this \nyear to reach out Syria, sending a number of delegations to Damascus \nand making clear that better ties with the U.S. are possible if Syria \nchanges its ways. Yet we should recall that it has been just 4 years \nsince Mr. Hariri emerged onto the political stage after his father, \nRafik Hariri, was murdered in a bombing. Reports indicate that suicide \nbombers continue to cross the Syrian border into Iraq. And Syria \nmaintains its hostility to Israel and its close ties to the government \nof Iran. We must be clear that there must be real change on these \nissues in order for Syria to enjoy significantly warmer relations with \nthe United States.\n  Some Americans might reasonably ask why. Why should we care about the \nfreedom and democratic aspirations of the Lebanese people? What matter \nis it of ours? Don't we have enough problems here at home, without \nspending our time and attention on the affairs of a small country far \nfrom our shores?\n  In answering this, I would return to the theme with which I set out \nthese brief remarks. We have learned since the attacks of 9/11 that \ninstability in such places is not often confined to its borders. In \nlands where repression and despair are rife, intolerance and extremism \ngrows in the hearts of some, and violence in the minds of a few. In \nLebanon, as in so many other places around the world, the population \naspires to something better than to be pulled from side to side by a \nthuggish and cruel militia. The vast majority of the Lebanese people \nwant only that which we here in America desire, the freedom and \nsecurity to build, through their talents and industry, a better life \nfor themselves and their children. As Americans, we must demonstrate \nthat\n\n[[Page S9294]]\n\nwe stand beside them in this hope. As we commemorate today the terrible \nacts of a small group dedicated to extinguishing this very ideal \nthroughout the world, we should, I believe, rededicate ourselves and \nour policies to advancing this noble goal.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the \nremarkable accomplishments of the Logan County Little League All-Star \nteam. While I remember fondly the years I played America's pastime in \nmy youth, none of my experiences can compare to those of these 10 \nLittle Leaguers as they competed in this year's Little League World \nSeries.\n  Despite its small-town feel, Logan County has produced a number of \nnotable individuals, from astronauts and governors to NBA players and \nMajor League Baseball pitchers.\n  So it is not surprising that a community that has already produced \nsuch notable figures would rally behind a group of 11- and 12-year-old \nplayers who represented the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the Great \nLakes Region in this year's Little League World Series. As the first \nteam from Kentucky to reach this level of competition in 4 years, Logan \nCounty's All-Stars demonstrated their talent in the games leading up to \ntheir World Series bid.\n  When four players homered in the regional final in Indianapolis, the \nLogan County All-Star team set its sights on Williamsport, PA. \nThankfully, their vision found support in the community. In order to \nafford the sizable cost of travel and lodging, the Little Leaguers and \ntheir supporters raised funds in all manner of ways, from selling steak \nsandwiches and auctioning off signed baseballs to holding a telethon at \na local radio station.\n  The team played its first two games of the double elimination \ntournament against the West Region champions from Chula Vista, CA. \nWhile the Western team proved to be overpowering, Logan County's team \ndemonstrated remarkable sportsmanship. As the proud winning-bidder of \nan auctioned T-shirt put it, ``Their character is impeccable, and we \nknow a lot of them . . . they behave themselves and they represent \nLogan County and Kentucky perfectly.''\n  Regardless of what the scoreboard read, Logan County's All-Stars are \nwinners. Moreover, this experience stretches beyond moments played out \nbetween the chalk-marked lines of the field.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \ninform the Senate of the importance of the National Extension \nAssociation Family and Consumer Sciences, NEAFCS, and its network of \nassociates on its 75th anniversary. This organization educates and \nrecognizes Extension Service professionals who work to impact the \nquality of life for individuals, families, and communities. These \neducators provide practical, research-based education to help improve \nthe quality of life for families and individuals.\n  Providing adults and youth with the necessary skills and knowledge to \nhelp them achieve the best quality of life possible is paramount to \ncreating healthy families and a healthy American economy. The \nCooperative Extension System, part of the land grant university system, \nis a nationwide educational network funded cooperatively by the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture, State governments, and county governments. \nExtension system initiatives in nutrition, healthy lifestyles, early \nbrain development, food safety, financial management, and building \nstrong families enable citizens to gain knowledge and skills to lead \nfull and productive lives.\n  Cooperative Extension professionals and members of the National \nExtension Association of Family and Consumer Sciences have been \noffering educational workshops, seminars, publications, media outreach, \nand websites to help individuals and communities for 75 years. I \ncommend the NEAFCS on their 75th anniversary as well as the local \nfaculty and staff who provide education that is critical to the quality \nof life in many rural communities.\n  I also urge the President of the United States to issue a \nproclamation to commend this organization on its 75th anniversary. The \nAmerican people should become more familiar with these services and \ntake advantage of the educational opportunities that Family and \nConsumer Sciences educators offer through the extension system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9294-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9294]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING RICHARD CRITTENDEN\n\n Ms. KLOBUCHAR.

On that day, he made the \nultimate sacrifice in order to protect a citizen in danger.\n  Officer Crittenden was a dedicated officer who served the North St. \nPaul Police Department for 9 years. He is fondly remembered by those in \nthe community as a ``great cop.'' I join my House colleague, U.S. \nRepresentative Betty McCollum, in saying that we are forever grateful \nfor his service and bravery.\n  As we mourn his loss, let us also pay tribute to all the law \nenforcement officers who risk their lives every day to protect our \nlives. As a former prosecutor, I gained an unending respect for all \nmembers of the law enforcement community. They serve on the frontlines \nevery day to protect public safety and our communities. Let us never \nforget their service and their courage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9294-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9294-S9295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING TEX TECH INDUSTRIES\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, 8 years ago today, we witnessed the \nhorrendous attacks of September 11, 2001. Since that time, we have been \nengaged in a global fight against terrorism, and our Nation's military \nmen and women have defended our country admirably and bravely. As we \nrely on them for our Nation's protection, they, in turn, rely on \nhundreds of businesses nationwide to provide them with state-of-the-art \nsafety products. Today, as we mark this painful anniversary, I rise to \nrecognize a small Maine company that is working every day to keep our \nmilitary personnel safe by producing intricate textiles used to make \nbody armor.\n  Tex Tech Industries, headquartered in Portland with an additional \nfacility in the town of Monmouth, has been manufacturing textiles since \n1902. Several years ago, Tex Tech began transitioning itself from a \ntraditional textile mill into a dynamic, cutting edge leader in its \nfield, and the company presently makes over 7,000 different unique \nproducts involving textiles, in part due to its remarkable research and \ndevelopment capabilities.\n  Of note, Tex Tech is the world's largest producer of tennis felt, the \ngreen material used to cover tennis balls. It\n\n[[Page S9295]]\n\nis Tex Tech's work with high-tech fabrics, however, that has been most \nimpressive. From durable and well-engineered fireblocking protection \nfor mattresses, aircraft hulls, and school bus seats, to small and \nprecise components found in specialized machine parts like rollers for \nX-ray processing, Tex Tech's products have a functional, everyday use \nto them.\n  I am most grateful to Tex Tech for its stellar and critical work \ndeveloping specialized body armor used to protect our Nation's \nservicemembers. Tex Tech's ground-breaking Core Matrix Technology is \nused to produce hard and soft armor, safety products, and hard \ncomposites for ballistic structural reinforcement. This distinctive \ninvention effectively protects our Nation's law enforcement officers \nand military personnel facing danger. In particular, it is employed to \ncreate the body armor that is used on outer tactical vests worn by our \ncountry's soldiers in Iraq.\n  For its outstanding work and dedicated service, Tex Tech Industries \nhas received prestigious national recognition. In particular, the Small \nBusiness Technology Council honored Tex Tech with its 2006 Tibbetts \nAward as a result of the company's work with the Small Business \nInnovation Research, SBIR, and Small Business Technology Transfer, \nSTTR, programs, which provide critical seed funding for small \nbusinesses developing our Nation's next generation of innovations. The \naward specifically highlighted the company's contributions to the Maine \neconomy and research and development field in the State. The SBIR-STTR \nprograms are critical to the growth of thousands of companies \nnationwide, and I am proud of Tex Tech's success story.\n  Tex Tech has left an indelible mark on dozens of products we use \nevery day; but on a larger scale, it has also contributed to improving \nsafety for millions of Americans facing danger day in and day out. As \nour service men and women fight tirelessly to keep our country safe--\nand prevent another \n9/11--I thank Tex Tech Industries for doing its part to keep them safe. \nTheir commitment to our State and Nation are extremely laudable, and I \nwish them continued success in their multiple endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9295-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                    Enrolled Joint Resolution Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Byrd) announced that on today, \nSeptember 11, 2009, he had signed the following enrolled joint \nresolution, previously signed by the Speaker of the House:\n\n       S.J.

Res. 262\n\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is a cardiac condition in which \n     electrical pulses disrupt the regular beating of the atria in \n     the heart, hampering the ability of the atria to fill the \n     ventricles with blood, and subsequently causing blood to pool \n     in the atria and form clots;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac \n     malfunction and affects at least 2,200,000 people in the \n     United States, with increased prevalence anticipated as the \n     population of the United States ages;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased \n     long-term risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality from \n     all causes, especially among women;\n       Whereas, according to the Journal of the American College \n     of Cardiology, atrial fibrillation accounts for approximately \n     \\1/3\\ of hospitalizations for cardiac rhythm disturbances;\n       Whereas, according to the American Heart Association, 3 to \n     5 percent of people in the United States who are 65 years of \n     age and older are estimated to have atrial fibrillation;\n       Whereas, according to a study in the American Heart \n     Association journal ``Circulation'', atrial fibrillation is \n     recognized as a major contributor to strokes, with an \n     estimated 15 to 20 percent of strokes occurring in people \n     with atrial fibrillation;\n       Whereas the Journal of the American College of Cardiology \n     estimates that the treatment of atrial fibrillation costs \n     approximately $3,600 per patient annually, for a total cost \n     burden in the United States of approximately $15,700,000,000;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant risk factor for atrial \n     fibrillation;\n       Whereas better education for patients and health care \n     providers is needed in order to ensure timely recognition of \n     atrial fibrillation symptoms; and\n       Whereas more research into effective treatments for atrial \n     fibrillation is needed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of September 2009 as ``National \n     Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to educate people about atrial \n     fibrillation;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into \n     treatment for atrial fibrillation; and\n\n[[Page S9296]]\n\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe and support National Atrial \n     Fibrillation Awareness Month through appropriate programs and \n     activities that promote public awareness of atrial \n     fibrillation and potential treatments for atrial \n     fibrillation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9296-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9296]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2330.

Res. 262\n\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is a cardiac condition in which \n     electrical pulses disrupt the regular beating of the atria in \n     the heart, hampering the ability of the atria to fill the \n     ventricles with blood, and subsequently causing blood to pool \n     in the atria and form clots;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac \n     malfunction and affects at least 2,200,000 people in the \n     United States, with increased prevalence anticipated as the \n     population of the United States ages;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with an increased \n     long-term risk of stroke, heart failure, and mortality from \n     all causes, especially among women;\n       Whereas, according to the Journal of the American College \n     of Cardiology, atrial fibrillation accounts for approximately \n     \\1/3\\ of hospitalizations for cardiac rhythm disturbances;\n       Whereas, according to the American Heart Association, 3 to \n     5 percent of people in the United States who are 65 years of \n     age and older are estimated to have atrial fibrillation;\n       Whereas, according to a study in the American Heart \n     Association journal ``Circulation'', atrial fibrillation is \n     recognized as a major contributor to strokes, with an \n     estimated 15 to 20 percent of strokes occurring in people \n     with atrial fibrillation;\n       Whereas the Journal of the American College of Cardiology \n     estimates that the treatment of atrial fibrillation costs \n     approximately $3,600 per patient annually, for a total cost \n     burden in the United States of approximately $15,700,000,000;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant risk factor for atrial \n     fibrillation;\n       Whereas better education for patients and health care \n     providers is needed in order to ensure timely recognition of \n     atrial fibrillation symptoms; and\n       Whereas more research into effective treatments for atrial \n     fibrillation is needed: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the month of September 2009 as ``National \n     Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to educate people about atrial \n     fibrillation;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into \n     treatment for atrial fibrillation; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe and support National Atrial \n     Fibrillation Awareness Month through appropriate programs and \n     activities that promote public awareness of atrial \n     fibrillation and potential treatments for atrial \n     fibrillation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/11/senate-section/article/S9299-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9299]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR MONDAY, SEPTEMBER 14, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
