Madam President, last night, the President, to his \ncredit, reiterated what the American people have been saying for weeks: \nthat the Democratic health care proposals we have seen so far aren't \nwhere they need to be. I couldn't agree with him more. President Obama \nalso said that rising health care costs are an imminent threat to our \neconomy and that any reform must reduce these long-term costs.\n  The problems the President highlighted are real and, here again, \nRepublicans agree with him. Unfortunately, the solutions to these \nproblems are not in the Democrat plans now working their way through \nCongress. In fact, the bills we have seen would make these problems \neven worse. The director of the Congressional Budget Office has said \nthat these proposals would increase overall health care spending, not \nreduce it. All of us want health care reform. But we want reform that \nbrings down costs and long-term spending, not a so-called reform that \nmakes things even worse.\n  The President also said health care reform must not increase the \nnational\n\n[[Page S7946]]\n\ndebt. Republicans agree with that too. But, again, both Democrat bills \nwe have seen would saddle Americans with hundreds of billions of \ndollars of additional debt, making the situation even worse. Just \nyesterday, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve warned that unless we \nget serious about spending and debt, we are endangering not only our \nrecovery from the current recession but also endangering future \neconomic growth. That is why he said any health care reform must get \ncontrol of costs. Otherwise, it could bankrupt both our government and \neventually our entire economy.\n  So the last thing we need is a flawed health care bill that adds to \nthe national debt and increases long-term health care costs. Instead of \ntrying to rush through proposals that don't work, we need to take the \ntime to do it right and make the reforms the American people are asking \nfor--reforms that won't put us on the road to bankruptcy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S7946-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7946-S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DEBT AND SECURITY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, earlier this year I came to the \nSenate floor and outlined a number of foreign policy principles that \nhave served our Nation well in the past and which I believe would serve \nus well in the future. In doing so, it was my hope that these \nprinciples would serve as the basis of steady bipartisan cooperation \nbetween the Senate and the new administration. These principles \ntranscend party; they are time-tested; and they can be summed up in a \nsingle sentence: the cornerstone of U.S. National security policy lies \nin maintaining a strong and ready defense and in keeping our alliances \nstrong.\n  As the Senate continues to debate the Defense authorization bill, I \nwould like to take the opportunity to reiterate the importance of this \nfundamental principle of action and to highlight something that \nseriously endangers our ability to uphold it. I am referring to our \nNation's staggering National debt.\n  The national debt threatens our way of life; it threatens the value \nof our national currency; and it threatens our ability to pay for \nentitlements that millions of Americans depend on. Yet, just as \nimportantly, the national debt also endangers our position in the \nworld, the long term capabilities of our military, and the long-term \nviability of the all-volunteer force that is currently serving us so \nably and courageously in two very challenging wars. And that is why it \nis increasingly urgent that we focus on this growing threat and do \nsomething about it.\n  Let us put the current situation in context. The story of the \nAmerican military over the past century reflects what historians have \ndescribed as a feast or famine approach to defense. The pattern goes \nback at least as far as our entry into World War I and extends through \nour involvement in World War II, the Korean war, and Vietnam. In every \ncase, the U.S. military underwent an abrupt expansion of manpower and \narmaments only to be followed by calls for a drawdown in the size of \nour force and a reduction in defense spending. This pattern, though not \nalways well-advised, may have been understandable in some cases in the \npast. But the nature of our current threats and position in the world \nmakes it indefensible today.\n  With developments in weapons technology, America no longer has the \nluxury of isolation. And September 11 showed us that we can no longer \nleave ungoverned territories unwatched. The demands on today's military \nare constant. We are either on offense, or we are at risk. Feast or \nfamine and isolationism no longer work.\n  And this is why our ever-growing national debt is so perilous--\nbecause even those who believe as I do that a strong and ready defense \nis the cornerstone of our security will not be able to guarantee it if \ncurrent fiscal trends persist. Put simply: if we do nothing to pay down \nthis debt and address the needs of Social Security, Medicare, and \nMedicaid, then America risks finding itself so weakened financially \nthat some day in the not-too-distant future we just will not have the \nresources we need to equip and maintain our forces in the places they \nare needed most.\n  Consider the fact that the Federal Government is now spending an \naverage of $100 million a day just to pay the interest on a single \npiece of legislation, the $1 trillion stimulus bill that Congress \npassed earlier this year. Or that it is estimated we will pay $347 \nbillion in interest on just this one bill over the next 10 years. At \ncurrent rates of spending, that is enough to provide health care for \nour Nation's veterans for more than 5 years. It is enough to cover the \nsalaries and benefits of all our active-duty and reserve forces for \n2\\1/2\\ years. Or it is nearly $350 billion we could put back into the \npockets of the American people at a time when they could really use it.\n  And that is just one piece of legislation. Now imagine what it costs \nto finance our entire national debt. By the end of the decade, it is \nestimated that under the President's budget we will spend nearly $800 \nbillion a year just to cover the interest on the national credit card--\nnot reducing what we owe, but just keeping the creditors from knocking \non the door. Here is the frightening part of where we are: by 2017, the \namount of money we are expected to spend on interest alone will exceed \nthe amount of money we are expected to spend that year on all of \ndefense.\n  The implications of this for our national security are clear. More \nand more, our ability to deploy forces with state-of- the-art weaponry \nis in competition with our financial obligation to the countries that \nhold our debt, and we get closer to the day when countries that hold \nlarge amounts of U.S. debt, such as China and Saudi Arabia, could \ndirectly influence the foreign policy decisions of a future President.\n  We also get closer to the day when our allies and partners will \nrethink the value of a relationship with the United States.\n  Sooner or later, we will have to face the fact that we are on a path \nthat leads to some very unpleasant choices. Either we default on our \ndebts, which we will not do, print more money to cover those debts and \ntempt a massive inflationary spiral, or be forced to withdraw from our \nsecurity commitments, just as Great Britain did at the end of the \nSecond World War.\n  America's all-volunteer force costs a lot of money to maintain. \nIndeed, one of the major reasons we have been able to avoid \nconscription in this country since the Vietnam war has been our ability \nto maintain recruiting and retention policies through an attractive \nretirement system, recruiting bonuses, incentive pay and sensible \nhousing allowances. In current dollars, military personnel costs have \nincreased from $69 billion to $131 billion a year over the past decade.\n  But these necessary expenses will soon be crowded out by the growing \ncost of long-term entitlements and the growing principal and higher and \nhigher interest payments on our debt. And spending increases we now \nregard as necessary may no longer be possible. The choice is clear: in \norder to provide for the common defense, we must reform entitlement \nprograms that are consuming a larger and larger share of our budget and \nreduce the national debt.\n  Cutting $100 million here or there in discretionary costs will not do \nthe trick. In 1965, discretionary spending accounted for 62 percent of \nthe budget. Today, it accounts for just 38 percent. As discretionary \nspending has become a smaller and smaller part of the pie, mandatory \nspending on entitlements and debt has become a bigger and bigger part \nof the pie. In 1965, mandatory spending and interest accounted for 38 \npercent of the budget. Today, they account for 62 percent or nearly \ntwo-thirds of the entire budget.\n  This means that in order to face our problem head on, we will have to \naddress the problem of entitlement spending. And the only serious \noption on the table is the Conrad-Gregg proposal which would provide a \nclear pathway for fixing these long-term challenges by forcing us to \nget debt and spending under control.\n  I have had a number of good conversations about this proposal with \nthe President. Based on those conversations, I am hopeful it will be \ngiven serious attention. For the safety and security of our Nation, the \nConrad-Gregg proposal deserves broad bipartisan support.\n  Every Secretary of Defense must confront the tension between \nAmerica's near-term readiness and future investment. But some future \nDefense Secretary will no longer be able to make\n\n[[Page S7947]]\n\neither choice if we do nothing to address the problem of long-term \ndebt. Regardless of the global threats we face, we will be forced to \nfield a smaller and less capable force. The money will not be there.\n  When most Americans think about threats to our security, they come up \nwith a standard list. But few people include our growing national debt. \nThey should--because it is real and it is serious.\n  Based on current trends, it is quite possible to imagine some future \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff walking into the Oval Office one \nday and informing the Commander in Chief that he has no choice: he can \neither protect the sealanes in the Persian Gulf or he can protect the \nsealanes in the Sea of Japan, but he cannot do both. On that day the \nUnited States of America will no longer be the guarantor of the \ninternational trading system, sea lines of communication, the security \nof our allies, or even our own independence.\n  All of this should matter to Members of the Senate. Americans trust \nour Nation's intelligence and uniformed personnel to protect them from \ndistant threats. But it is incumbent upon the men and women of this \nbody--those of us who control the purse strings--to make sure the \nNation's resources are managed in a way that enables these forces to do \ntheir work. The men and women of the Senate must look beyond the narrow \ndemands of a single political term in office or the next election to \nthe long-term security of our Nation and, indeed, the world. No one \nelse can protect the American people from the diminishment of power and \ncapability that come with our dangerous and ever-increasing national \ndebt.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S7947-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Brian L. Gorham\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, with sadness I rise today to speak \nabout a fallen warrior from my home State of Kentucky. On December 31, \n2007, PFC Brian L. Gorham succumbed to injuries sustained earlier that \nmonth when an explosive device struck his vehicle while on patrol in \nAfghanistan.\n  Private First Class Gorham hailed from Woodburn, KY. He was 21 years \nold and was able to spend the last days of his life not halfway around \nthe world but back in America--in a hospital in Fort Sam Houston, TX, \nto be precise--surrounded by his loving family.\n  For his bravery in uniform, Private First Class Gorham received \nseveral medals, awards, and decorations, including the Army Good \nConduct Medal, the Purple Heart, and the Bronze Star Medal.\n  At Brian's funeral service in Franklin, KY, hundreds of people came \nto offer their sympathies to his family and friends. Brian's father, \nToney Gorham, said:\n\n       It's hard to believe that so many people, a lot of them I \n     don't know, walked up to me, shook my hand or patted me on \n     the back, and told me, ``We're proud that your son fought for \n     us and sacrificed for us.''\n\n  Maybe it is not so surprising if you know the dedication Brian put \ninto everything he did from a very early age. Jack Wright, Brian's \nSunday school teacher, remembers when Brian was a young middle school \nstudent who would participate in the two-hand touch football games that \nwere played after Bible study services on Wednesday nights.\n  ``Brian was never the biggest or fastest,'' Jack says, ``But no one \nput more effort into the game and no one enjoyed playing any better \nthan Brian.''\n  That enthusiasm carried over when Brian joined the football team at \nDrakes Creek Middle School. Brian also liked basketball and baseball \nand could often find a pickup game with the neighborhood kids many \nnights after school.\n  In high school, Brian joined the Junior ROTC Program, and just like \nin those football games, he put his all into becoming the best. He \nsucceeded by being in the first group to complete his ROTC Program's \nLeadership Academy.\n  That achievement was symbolized, on Brian's dress uniform, by a \nsilver band around his right shoulder. Jack Wright remembers Brian \nwould proudly wear his ROTC uniform to services at Woodburn Baptist \nChurch for many years.\n  Brian still found time for fun, of course. He loved to fish, explore \nthe caves near his house, and float down the creek in his friend's \nboat. One time Brian and some of his friends were racing go-carts and \ndecided to hold a contest to see who could drive through a huge mud \npuddle and come out the muddiest.\n  This is one contest Brian's parents are probably glad he did not win. \nAnother boy was so muddy that when his mom came to pick him up, she \nmade him ride home in the trunk rather than on the seat.\n  Brian was close to his sister Brandie and his brother Henry. When \nthey were kids, Brandie made Brian play dolls with her, although the \neasy-going Brian did not seem to mind. Henry was his big brother's \nlittle shadow. The two would watch wrestling together and act out the \nwrestling moves.\n  Henry remembers during one of his football games at school, both his \nparents were unable to attend. Henry was not doing so well until he \nheard his big brother Brian cheering him on from the sidelines. That \ngave him the extra confidence he needed.\n  Brian's mother Shirley also remembers a time when she and Toney went \naway for the weekend, and Brian called her to say he was cooking dinner \nfor some friends and not to worry, they were sharing the cost. He said \nhe would have food ready for them, too, when they got back.\n  So Shirley and Toney came home to find Brian had barbecued, and they \nsat down to a wonderful meal. It was not until the next day when \nShirley realized Brian had emptied out the freezer, and there was \nnothing left in the house to cook.\n  Brian graduated from Greenwood High School in 2003, and after serving \nas commander of his school's Junior ROTC Program, he enlisted in the \nArmy. He was assigned to Company D, 1st Battalion, 503rd Infantry \nRegiment, 173rd Airborne Brigade Combat Team, stationed in Vicenza, \nItaly.\n  Brian's family remembers how Brian loved what he was doing and took \npride in his work. His mother Shirley was proud of her son's \nhumanitarian work in uniform. In Afghanistan he distributed seeds to \nthe Afghan farmers and helped provide security for the engineers to \nbuild roads and rebuild the country.\n  Madam President, we must keep Brian's family and friends in our \nthoughts as I recount his story for the Senate today. We are thinking \nof his mother and father, Shirley and Toney Gorham; his sister Brandie \nDixon, and her husband Lawrence; his brother Henry; his maternal \ngrandparents, Roger and Esther Bunch; his paternal grandmother, Neil \nTabor; his aunt, Regina Peterson; and many other beloved family members \nand friends.\n  Madam President, Brian had a 1976 Chevy pickup that was passed down \nthrough the family. He called it Old Blue. He would often have a hard \ntime starting it and had to wake up his sister to start it for him on \nsome days.\n  When Brian was in the hospital in Texas, he told his father that he \nwanted the two of them to work on restoring Old Blue together. Brian \ndid not get to finish that task. But Toney has the pickup in his garage \nnow, and he promises to fulfill his son's wish.\n  Our country must also fulfill a promise to PFC Brian L. Gorham and \nforever honor his service. It is the least we can do after his \ntremendous sacrifice.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S7947-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7947]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

But I think the \nminority would want to see the language of any side-by-side before \nthere was an agreement to a time agreement. If not, I am happy to enter \ninto a time agreement on Senator Kyl's and any second degree or side-\nby-side at any time my good friend from Arizona wants to do that.\n  But in order for the convenience of the parties, if Senator Lieberman \nand Senator Bayh could come down now--if they can do that--I would like \nto inquire about that and dispose of their amendments first and then \ntake up the Kyl amendment with a time agreement--just to reverse the \norder of those two because of the Finance Committee's meetings this \nmorning, which Senator Kerry needs to attend.\n  I have not had a chance to talk to my friend from Arizona about this \njust because of the way the morning goes. That is what I would like to \nsuggest. If that can be done, it would simplify things.\n  There are also a number of other things we need to do. We have--and I \nthink the Senator from Arizona is familiar with this--an amendment on \nvoting rights for the troops which I think has been cleared. It is a \nbipartisan amendment which is going to need about 15 minutes of debate, \nI understand. That could be done as well, hopefully.\n  But my goal, if it is agreeable to the Republican manager, would be \nto basically flip the two, with time agreements for both, going first \nto the Lieberman and Bayh amendments, if they are able to do it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let me just say to my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman, all of our Members have very busy schedules. \nThe Senator from Arizona, whose amendment it is, happens to be the \nsecond ranking Republican and has heavy responsibilities. I would point \nout that we waited for a couple hours yesterday for the same Senator \nyesterday afternoon to be able to come to the floor to address another \namendment. At the same time, the clock is running because the majority \nleader has filed cloture on the bill.\n  So are we going to run the proceedings here, consideration of the \nauthorization bill, based on the priorities of one Senator or are we \ngoing to carry out what we all agreed to last night in the unanimous \nconsent agreement? There was no objection last night from the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts. He could have objected. So now we want to turn \neverybody else's schedules on their heads because one Senator has some \nother priorities.\n  Obviously, we are going to finish the bill because the majority \nleader filed cloture, and we have to close out the bill, after spending \nnearly a week on two issues, hate crimes and guns, neither of which had \na single thing to do with the Defense authorization bill--because, \nunprecedented in the 20-some years I have been a member of the Armed \nServices Committee, the majority leader of the Senate came to the floor \nand proposed a hate crimes bill that had not been through the committee \nof jurisdiction and was, obviously, very controversial on this side.\n  So after getting bollixed up for a week and a half--or at least a \nweek--on those two issues, we enter into a unanimous consent agreement \nwhen the majority leader files cloture to close off debate on this \nside. That is the reason it is done. So now we are supposed to \noverturn, some 10 hours later, a unanimous consent agreement because \none Senator cannot fit it into his schedule, when the sponsor of the \namendment is the No. 2 ranking member on this side? There is something \nwrong with that process.\n\n  I will be glad to discuss it with the distinguished chairman and we \nwill try and see if we can adjust to it. In the meantime, the clock \ncontinues to run and we have fewer and fewer amendments that will be \ngermane and be allowed to be discussed, because we find out this \nmorning, after a unanimous consent agreement which could have been \nobjected to last night, one Senator has a schedule that dictates we \nturn the unanimous consent agreement on its head.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if the Senator would withhold that \nrequest for a moment so I may comment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I withhold my request.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I was not suggesting that we not proceed \nthis morning; I was suggesting that we reverse the order to accommodate \na Senator who is going to be offering a second-degree amendment. If \nthat is not acceptable, we do not need to do that. I was simply trying \nto accommodate the Senator so that the second-degree or side-by-side \namendment that was in the unanimous consent proposal last night could \nbe offered by him. If that is not agreeable to the Republican side, \nthen I obviously am not going to make the suggestion. But it would not \ndelay anything; all it would do would be to change the order of events \nto accommodate us. If that is not acceptable to the minority, then I \nwill obviously not make that unanimous consent proposal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would ask the distinguished chairman, \nthen, in the spirit of compromise, can we arrange a time agreement on \nthe Lieberman amendment that is reasonable so that perhaps we could \ntake up the Kyl amendment later in the morning so that at least that \nmight not upset his schedule, since we are making accommodation for the \nsponsor of a second-degree amendment, which seems to be our priority.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, of course, that is exactly what I was \nproposing. I appreciate the willingness of the Senator from Arizona to \ntry to work that out.\n  There is no problem with the time agreement on the Lieberman-Bayh \nmatters because the reason we couldn't do that is that the Bayh \nlanguage was not available in time for the minority side to consider a \ntime agreement. We would be happy to have a time agreement of 1 hour on \nthe Lieberman amendment, 1 hour on the Bayh amendment; 2 hours \ntogether, in other words. We are happy to have a time agreement on \nSenator Kyl's amendment, but we were only suggesting that we reverse \nthe order to accommodate things here. It would not result in any \nadditional use of time; it would not delay anything; it would simply \nreverse the order for the accommodation of the Senator who needs to be \nhere to offer a second-degree amendment, if we are going to do it, or a \nside-by-side to Senator Kyl's first-degree amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, obviously, whatever is most convenient to \nthe chairman and ranking member is fine, subject to I had planned, \nbecause of our conversations last night, to be able to do this this \nmorning. By this afternoon, I am going to have a lot of conflicts. In \nfact, I too am on the Finance Committee where Senator Kerry is right \nnow and I am supposed to be there but made this arrangement.\n  I don't believe the business before the Finance Committee is going to \nlast very long at all. In fact, it was a very quick matter to be \nresolved. So as long as we can try to get the amendments relating to \nthe START treaty resolved before afternoon, I am perfectly willing to \nagree to anything that is acceptable to everybody else here, and it \nseems to me we should be able to accomplish that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n[[Page S7949]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, let me say we can have 1 hour for each \nside on the Lieberman amendment and then move directly to the Kyl \namendment, if that is agreeable.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, what we need to do along that line is to \nsee if we can get an agreement from Senator Lieberman and from Senator \nBayh on a time agreement on those two amendments. I would suggest, as \nthe Senator from Arizona did, that there be an hour equally divided on \neach, which will be a total of 2 hours, and then if the majority leader \nis agreeable to this----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe we need a quorum call for a moment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wanted to say that as the overnight \nproceeded, there are a number of people who want to come down and speak \non our side, so I wish to ask that on our amendment we have at least an \nhour and a half, perhaps two. I hope not to use it, but I think this is \ngoing to be a significant debate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I suggest that we seek an agreement that \nthere be 2 hours on the two amendments together, one equally divided \nbetween the Senator from Connecticut and the Senator from Indiana.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor consideration of amendments this morning be switched and that the \nSenate now consider the Lieberman amendment No. 1627 and the Bayh \namendment No. 1767; that the amendments be debated concurrently for a \ntotal of 150 minutes, with 90 minutes under the control of Senator \nLieberman and 60 minutes under the control of Senator Bayh; that no \namendments be in order to either amendment; that upon the use or \nyielding back of time, the vote in relation to the amendments occur at \na time to be determined, with the first vote in relation to the Bayh \namendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to the Lieberman \namendment, with 2 minutes of debate prior to the second vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer and I thank my colleagues \nfor working this out to try to accommodate all of us the best we can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1627\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I have consulted with the chairman of \nthe Armed Services Committee, Senator Levin, and the ranking member, \nSenator McCain, and they have urged me to go forward and call up my \namendment on the alternate engine and begin debating it to expedite \nmatters while we are awaiting Senator Bayh to come over. I call it up \nat this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, Mr. Reed, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \n     Dodd, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Cornyn, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1627.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to make certain \n   certifications with respect to the development of an alternative \n  propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program before \nfunds may be obligated or expended for such system and to provide, with \noffsets, an additional $282,900,000 for the procurement of UH-1Y/AH-1Z \n  rotary wing aircraft and an additional $156,000,000 for management \n          reserves for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program)\n\n       On page 39, strike lines 4 through 17, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 211. LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS FOR AN ALTERNATIVE \n                   PROPULSION SYSTEM FOR THE F-35 JOINT STRIKE \n                   FIGHTER PROGRAM; INCREASE IN FUNDING FOR \n                   PROCUREMENT OF UH-1Y/AH-1Z ROTARY WING AIRCRAFT \n                   AND FOR MANAGEMENT RESERVES FOR THE F-35 JOINT \n                   STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Use of Funds for an Alternative \n     Propulsion System for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter \n     Program.--None of the funds authorized to be appropriated or \n     otherwise made available by this Act may be obligated or \n     expended for the development or procurement of an alternate \n     propulsion system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program \n     until the Secretary of Defense submits to the congressional \n     defense committees a certification in writing that the \n     development and procurement of the alternate propulsion \n     system--\n       (1) will--\n       (A) reduce the total life-cycle costs of the F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter program; and\n       (B) improve the operational readiness of the fleet of F-35 \n     Joint Strike Fighter aircraft; and\n       (2) will not--\n       (A) disrupt the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program during \n     the research, development, and procurement phases of the \n     program; or\n       (B) result in the procurement of fewer F-35 Joint Strike \n     Fighter aircraft during the life cycle of the program.\n       (b) Additional Amount for UH-1Y/AH-1Z Rotary Wing \n     Aircraft.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 102(a)(1) for aircraft procurement for the Navy is \n     increased by $282,900,000, with the amount of the increase to \n     be allocated to amounts available for the procurement of UH-\n     1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft.\n       (c) Restoration of Management Reserves for F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter Program.--\n       (1) Navy joint strike fighter.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(a)(2) for research, development, \n     test, and evaluation for the Navy is hereby increased by \n     $78,000,000, with the amount of the increase to be allocated \n     to amounts available for the Joint Strike Fighter program (PE \n     # 0604800N) for management reserves.\n       (2) Air force joint strike fighter.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 201(a)(3) for research, \n     development, test, and evaluation for the Air Force is hereby \n     increased by $78,000,000, with the amount of the increase to \n     be allocated to amounts available for the Joint Strike \n     Fighter program (PE # 0604800F) for management reserves.\n       (d) Offsets.--\n       (1) Navy joint strike fighter f136 development.--The amount \n     authorized to be appropriated by section 201(a)(2) for \n     research, development, test, and evaluation for the Navy is \n     hereby decreased by $219,450,000, with the amount of the \n     decrease to be derived from amounts available for the Joint \n     Strike Fighter (PE # 0604800N) for F136 development.\n       (2) Air force joint strike fighter f136 development.--The \n     amount authorized to be appropriated by section 201(a)(3) for \n     research, development, test, and evaluation for the Air Force \n     is hereby decreased by $219,450,000, with the amount of the \n     decrease to be derived from amounts available for the Joint \n     Strike Fighter (PE # 0604800F) for F136 development.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This amendment I am introducing with Senator McCain as \nmy lead cosponsor, and with a strong bipartisan group of cosponsors, \nincluding Senator Reed of Rhode Island, and Senators Snowe, Schumer, \nInhofe, Dodd, Hutchison, Collins, Kyl, and Cornyn. I am very grateful \nfor that support.\n  To state it briefly, and then to go into some detail, this amendment \nwould remove funding from this bill that was added by way of amendment \nin the Armed Services Committee for $439 million to build a second \nengine for the Joint Strike Fighter plane.\n  I will argue, on behalf of the amendment I have introduced with \nSenator McCain and others, that it is a waste of $439 million to build \nfor a plane a second engine, which we don't need. In fact, estimates \nare that continuing acquisition of this second engine will cost over $6 \nbillion of taxpayer money that we don't need to spend because there has \nbeen a competition for the engine to be used in the Joint Strike \nFighter, which is now the heart and soul of America's hopes for the \nfuture when it\n\n[[Page S7950]]\n\ncomes to tactical aviation--particularly after the Senate terminated \nthe F-22 program the other day.\n  So there was a competition to build the engine for the Joint Strike \nFighter. General Electric, in its proposal, lost that competition. \nPratt & Whitney won that competition.\n  Now, by way of legislation, the proponents of the second engine for \nthis plane are trying to achieve, by legislation, what they could not \nachieve by competition. It is not only that it is an unnecessary \nexpenditure of $439 million in the coming year, and more than $6 \nbillion, for a second engine that we don't need for that plane, but it \nhas consequences. It is not just that we are spending taxpayer money, \nbut I will go into this in some detail in a moment.\n  Regarding putting that money to use on that second engine, a general \nfrom the Air Force overseeing this Joint Strike Fighter program told \nour committee it would delay the Joint Strike Fighter, which our \nservices are desperately waiting for. They need this tactical fighter. \nSo it would delay the program and, in fact, this Air Force general \ntestified to our committee that putting money into the bill for the \nsecond engine, and continuing to fund it, would result, over the next 5 \nyears, in a reduced capacity to build Joint Strike Fighters by 53 \nplanes.\n  So to spend the money to build a second engine for a plane, when we \ndon't need a second engine--because the first one won the competition \nand is performing very well--we are going to reduce the buy of this \ntactical fighter that our military needs by 53 planes over the next 5 \nyears.\n  How do my friends who support the second engine pay for it? Well, in \nthe Armed Services Committee bill, which is before us, which Senator \nMcCain, I, and others are trying to remove, they defund the acquisition \nof helicopters, which are desperately needed by our marines, \nparticularly those fighting in Afghanistan.\n  There will be an alternative proposal made this morning in the \namendment Senator Bayh will introduce, I presume, because there has \nbeen so much protest to defunding this acquisition of helicopters that \nthe marines need in battle in Afghanistan, in order to pay for a second \nengine, which is unnecessary, for the Joint Strike Fighter. Instead, \nthe amendment will defund the acquisition of C-130s, which are \nspecially fitted for our special operations forces. Again, they are \ncarrying out extremely dangerous and critical missions in Afghanistan, \nIraq, and other places, where they are courageously taking on \nparticularly the terrorists who attacked us on 9/11.\n  That is the essence of the argument. This second engine is a program \nPresident Obama has described as ``an unnecessary defense program that \ndoes nothing to keep us safe, but rather prevents us from spending \nmoney on what does keep us safe.''\n  That warning from President Obama about the consequences of funding \nthe second engine for the Joint Strike Fighter is realized already in \nthe part of the bill Senator McCain and I and others are trying to \nwithdraw and in the amendment my friend from Indiana will introduce \nbecause it takes money from the Marines and the Air Force special \noperations community in areas they and we desperately need.\n  I wish to add that, this morning, I was grateful and honored to \nreceive a letter from Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, in which the \nSecretary of Defense strongly and clearly expresses his opposition to \nthe alternate engine, the second engine, an unnecessary engine--the $6 \nbillion unnecessary engine for the Joint Strike Fighter--and his \nsupport for the amendment that Senator McCain and I and others have \nintroduced.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter from Secretary Gates be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             Defense Pentagon,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 22, 2009.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The Department of Defense supports \n     striking from legislation any provision that would require \n     the development or procurement of an alternative propulsion \n     system for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n       The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 \n     test hours. In addition, the risks associated with a single \n     engine provider are manageable as evidenced by the \n     performance of the F-22 and F/A-18E/F, both Air Force and \n     Navy programs supplied by a single engine provider. The Air \n     Force currently has several fleets that operate on a single \n     engine source. Thus, further expenditures on a second engine \n     are unnecessary and will likely impede the progress of the \n     overall F-35 program.\n       It is my belief that the JSF program presented in the \n     President's budget request is in the best interests of \n     national security. If a final bill is presented to the \n     President containing provisions that would seriously disrupt \n     the F-35 program, the President's senior advisors will \n     recommend that the President veto the bill.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates,\n                                             Secretary of Defense.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I will read from the letter. It is three paragraphs:\n\n       The Department of Defense supports striking from \n     legislation any provision that would require the development \n     or procurement of an alternate propulsion system for the F-35 \n     Joint Strike Fighter.\n       The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 \n     test hours. In addition, the risks associated with a single \n     engine provider are manageable as evidenced by the \n     performance of the F-22 and F/A-18/F, both Air Force and Navy \n     programs supplied by a single engine provider. The Air Force \n     currently has several fleets that operate on a single engine \n     source.\n\n  I draw back from the letter. What is unusual is to have a second \nengine. Logically, if we want to buy a car, it would be nice to have a \nsecond engine in the garage but would we pay the extra money for it if \nwe had a perfectly good engine in the car? Back to the letter:\n\n       Thus, further expenditures on a second engine are \n     unnecessary and will likely impede the progress of the \n     overall F-35 program.\n       It is my belief that the JSF program presented in the \n     President's budget request is in the best interests of \n     national security. If a final bill is presented to the \n     President containing provisions that would seriously disrupt \n     the F-35 program, the President's senior advisors will \n     recommend that the President veto the bill.\n\n  I intend to show in my argument this morning that, in fact, this \nArmed Services Committee bill--if the amendment Senator McCain and I \nare proposing is not adopted--will seriously disrupt the F-35 program, \nthe Joint Strike Fighter program and, therefore, will be occasion for \nthe President's advisers to recommend he veto this entire and \ncritically necessary bill.\n  I thank Secretary Gates for expressing support for the amendment \nSenator McCain and I and others--Senator Schumer, Senator Dodd, Senator \nKyl--have offered to strip this unnecessary expenditure of money from \nthe bill.\n  Our amendment, as I have said, would restore funding that was taken \nfrom the U.S. Marine Corps helicopter, the Huey, when the committee \nvoted to fund the alternate engine. The vote to cut 10 Marine Corps \nhelicopters comes at a time the Marines are conducting a major \noffensive in the mountains of Afghanistan where the high altitudes and \nhot weather require the best capabilities Congress can provide them, \nincluding these Hueys.\n  In fact, in recent statements from the Joint Staff and Marine Corps \nleadership, it is clear how urgently the Marines need the enhanced \ncapabilities of the UH-1 Huey on the battlefield. Speaking before the \nArmed Services Committee of the Senate on Thursday, July 9, the Vice \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Cartwright, said to the members \nof the committee:\n\n       Those helicopters are, in fact, critical.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       The helicopter for the Marines is one of their most lethal \n     weapons. They are the most effective in the battlefield, \n     particularly in the counterinsurgency arena.\n\n  They are effective in built-up urban areas and in compounds because \nthey can be discreet, so the value of those helicopters is significant.\n  The day after General Cartwright appeared, I received a letter from \nthe Commandant of the Marine Corps, GEN James Conway.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter from General Conway.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sir: The Marine Corps greatly appreciates your \n     interest in the UH-1Y/AH-1Z program. Procurement of less than \n     the optimum\n\n[[Page S7951]]\n\n     ramp of 28 H-1s during Fiscal Year 2010 will lead to \n     continued reliance on aging helicopters that should have been \n     retired from the inventory years ago. This happens at a time \n     when the Secretary of Defense appears poised to issue \n     guidance to the Military Departments to increase rotary-wing \n     assets to conduct current and future Irregular Warfare \n     conflicts.\n       As we focus on operations in Afghanistan, sustaining the \n     introduction of the H-1 is vital to our future success. We \n     have prioritized UH-1Y deliveries early in the program in an \n     effort to quickly replace our aging fleet of UH-1N \n     helicopters. While the UH-1N has served us well for many \n     decades, it has now reached the point where its available \n     power and key aircrew systems are simply not adequate for \n     robust combat operations. As typically configured, UH-IN \n     loads are often reduced to just two or three combat \n     configured Marines when operating at high density altitudes. \n     Because of these severe operational limitations, we have been \n     very aggressive in transitioning to the significantly \n     improved capabilities of the UH-1Y. Our frist Marine \n     Expenditionary Unit detachment of three new aircraft deployed \n     to the Central Command AOR this year when only ten UH-1Ys had \n     been delivered to the fleet. In November 2009, we plan to \n     deploy our first full squadron to Afghanistan where the UH-\n     1Y's improved payload and airspeed in that challenging \n     environment will serve our Marines well.\n       Once we deploy the UH-1Y to theater, we want to keep it \n     there. However, in order to sustain our anticipated combat \n     deployment schedule, production must remain on track. With \n     recent deliveries occurring well ahead of schedule and \n     substantial contractor investments in tooling and long-lead \n     materials, there is tangible evidence that the production \n     rate of 28 helicopters contained in the President's budget \n     request can be met.\n       I greatly appreciate the opportunity to correspond with you \n     and expand on this important subject. The supporting \n     documentation you requested is attached. If you have any \n     additional questions, please do not hesitate to call on me. I \n     also thank you for your leadership and longstanding efforts \n     on behalf of our men and women in uniform.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              James T. Conway,\n\n                                       General, U.S. Marine Corps,\n                                   Commandant of the Marine Corps.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, in his letter, General Conway writes:\n\n       Procurement of less than the optimum ramp up of 28 H-1s in \n     fiscal year 2010 will lead to continued reliance on aging \n     helicopters that should have been retired from the inventory \n     years ago. As we focus on operations in Afghanistan, \n     sustaining the introduction of the H-1 is vital for our \n     future success.\n\n  He continues:\n\n       Because of the severe operational limitations of the Corps' \n     legacy helicopters, the Marines are transitioning toward the \n     significantly improved capabilities of the UH-1Y.\n\n  General Conway points out that the Corps has already sent three UH-1Y \nto Afghanistan and will deploy its full squadron of them this November. \nThis is a plane the Marines desperately need in combat today.\n  I also want to read from a letter I received from Major General \nBockel, retired, Army Reserve, now acting director of the Reserve \nOfficers Association. General Bockel says in his letter to me:\n\n       The Reserve Officers Association, representing 65,000 \n     Reserve Component members, supports the Lieberman-McCain \n     Alternate Engine Amendment. This amendment restores critical \n     funding to procure helicopters that the United States Marine \n     Corps urgently needs in Afghanistan.\n\n  I suspect the Reserve Officers Association will no more support an \neffort to ask our special operations forces, as the second-degree or \nside-by-side amendment Senator Bayh will offer, to pay the bill for an \nunnecessary second engine than he was to see our Marines foot the bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Major General \nBockel's letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 Reserve Officers Association,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Joseph Lieberman,\n     Hart Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman: The Reserve Officers Association, \n     representing 65,000 Reserve Component members, supports \n     Lieberman-McCain Alternate Engine Amendment. This amendment \n     restores critical funding to procure helicopters that the \n     United States Marine Corps (USMC) urgently needs in \n     Afghanistan.\n       In the Senate Armed Services Committee's mark of the \n     National Defense Authorization Act, the bill would cut funds \n     for the procurement of Marine Corps UH-1Y helicopters and the \n     AHI-Z Super Cobra in order to fund an unnecessary ``alternate \n     engine'' for F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n       The Bell UH-1Y Venom is a twin-engine medium size utility \n     helicopter, part of the USMC's H-1 upgrade program, replacing \n     the Marines aging fleet of UH-IN Twin Huey light utility \n     helicopters first introduced in the early 1970s. The Corps' \n     current fleet of utility helicopters face noticeable \n     operational limitations at high altitudes, which is not a \n     problem for the new UH-1Y. Because of the severe limitations, \n     which can have an impact on operational agility, the USMC is \n     aggressively transitioning to the new aircraft.\n       The Pentagon had requested 28 AH-1Z and UH-1Y helicopters, \n     but NDAA markups have reduced these numbers to offset \n     funding. This amendment would restore $482.9 in funding that \n     was stripped from the U.S. Marine Corps UH-1Y program, which \n     is an action that ROA supports.\n       Thank you for your efforts on this key issue, and other \n     support to the military that you have shown in the past. \n     Please feel free to have your staff call ROA's legislative \n     director, Marshall Hanson, with any question or issue you \n     would like to discuss.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              David R. Bockel,\n\n                                    Major General, USAR (Retired),\n                                        Acting Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, let me talk now about what this \namendment would do. It would essentially remove the funding for the \nsecond engine, but it does it in a way that I think is thoughtful. It \nrequires that there be no obligation of any funds on the development of \na second engine for the Joint Strike Fighter unless and until the \nSecretary of Defense certifies to Congress that the development and \nprocurement of such an engine will reduce the total life-cycle costs of \nthe program, improve the operational readiness of the F-35 fleet, and \navoid either disrupting the Joint Strike Fighter Program or resulting \nin procurement of fewer Joint Strike Fighter aircraft during the life \ncycle of the program.\n  Why do we propose these conditions? Because they are the benefits the \nproponents of the second engine claim it will deliver. So we ask that \nthe second engine be judged on its alleged merits. And I hope my \ncolleagues will agree that this is a fair way to go at this.\n  I have spoken already at the outset about the fact that there was a \ncompetition for the engine for the Joint Strike Fighter that took place \nin 1996. Ultimately, one engine won the competition while the other \nlost. Understandably, but not acceptably, the makers of the engine that \nlost have come back to achieve by legislation--or attempt to--what they \ncould not achieve by competition.\n  The proponents of the second engine have also claimed that it would \nlower costs on the Joint Strike Fighter Program overall. I have cited \nnumbers that come from the Pentagon and elsewhere arguing on the other \nhand that this program will cost over $6 billion of taxpayer money \nwithout any showing, really, that it will save money. Developing a \nsecond engine, quite logically and following common sense, would \nrequire the Department of Defense to maintain two logistics operations \nto support it--tails, as it is called in the military, two tails, two \nsets of training manuals, two sets of tooling component improvement \nparts. These additional and unnecessary expenses would raise operations \nand sustainment costs for the Joint Strike Fighter throughout the life \ncycle of the program.\n  I want to get to the impact funding a second engine--an unnecessary \nengine, a costly engine--would have on the Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram.\n  On June 9, the Armed Services Committee Subcommittee on Air and Land, \nwhich I have the honor of chairing, heard testimony from LTG Mark \nShackelford, Military Deputy Officer to the Secretary of the Air Force \nfor Acquisition. He is in charge of acquisition. I asked General \nShackelford whether development of a second engine would disrupt the \nJoint Strike Fighter Program. His explanation is detailed but important \nto hear. It has a very strong message:\n\n       The fiscal year 2010 production quantity for the joint \n     strike fighter is 30 aircraft, split between three variants.\n\n  That means with three different services.\n\n       If forced to pay for the alternate engine, we would have to \n     reduce that to two to four, depending on which of the \n     variants. That has a negative effect on the unit cost of the \n     remaining aircraft if you are buying fewer. It also ripples \n     into next year's quantities, and then as we take that 2010 \n     increment of dollars and extend that out through the future \n     year defense program--\n\n  Which is the 5-year so-called fit up that the Pentagon does planning \non--\n\n     there are equal decrements in terms of the numbers of \n     aircraft that we can buy with the remaining dollars.\n\n\n[[Page S7952]]\n\n\n  After hearing that--decrements, decreases, reduction in the number of \naircraft we can buy--I asked General Shackelford how many fewer Joint \nStrike Fighters would be purchased over that 5-year period if we went \nahead with the second engine. He responded:\n\n       Over the 5-year period, it would be 53.\n\n  I cannot emphasize that enough--53 fewer aircraft that we otherwise \nwould have purchased for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps that are \ndesperately in need of them over the next 5 years; 53 fewer planes \nbecause we are going to spend that money buying a second engine we do \nnot need. That really would be a major disruption to the Joint Strike \nFighter Program. But it is avoidable, and it is avoidable by adopting \nthe amendment Senator McCain and I, Senator Schumer, Senator Dodd, \nSenator Kyl, Senator Hutchison, Senator Collins, and Senator Snowe--a \nvery broad bipartisan group--have offered.\n  I close this opening statement in support of our amendment and in \nopposition to the amendment my friend from Indiana will offer with this \nquote from President Obama when he sent the defense budget to us on May \n15. Here is the quote from the President:\n\n       We're going to save money by eliminating unnecessary \n     defense programs that do nothing to keep us safe but rather \n     prevent us from spending money on what does keep us safe. One \n     example is a $465 million program to build an alternate \n     engine for the joint strike fighter. The Defense Department \n     is already pleased with the engine it has. The engine it has \n     works. The Pentagon does not want and does not plan to use \n     the alternate version.\n\n  President Obama concludes:\n\n       That is why the Pentagon stopped requesting this funding 2 \n     years ago.\n\n  That is why I respectfully ask my colleagues, in the interest of the \ntaxpayers, in the interest of the Joint Strike Fighter Program, to \nprotect funding for the Marines, for the Hueys, the special operations \nforces of the Air Force, for the C-130s, to protect the Navy, Air \nForce, and Marines, who are waiting for the Joint Strike Fighter. I ask \nyou to vote against the amendment offered by my friend from Indiana and \nfor the amendment I have the honor to offer.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Indiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1767\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up my \namendment No. 1767.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Indiana [Mr. Bayh] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 1767.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide for the continued development of a competitive \n propulsion system for the Joint Strike Fighter program and additional \namounts, with an offset, for UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft and Joint \n              Strike Fighter program management reserves)\n\n       On page 39, strike lines 4 through 17, and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 211. CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF COMPETITIVE PROPULSION \n                   SYSTEM FOR THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) In General.--Of the amounts authorized to be \n     appropriated or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2010 \n     for research, development, test, and evaluation for the F-35 \n     Lightning II aircraft program, not more than 90 percent may \n     be obligated until the Secretary of Defense submits to the \n     congressional defense committees a written certification that \n     sufficient funds have been obligated for fiscal year 2010 for \n     the continued development of a competitive propulsion system \n     for the F-35 Lightning II aircraft to ensure that system \n     development and demonstration continues under the program \n     during fiscal year 2010.\n       (b) Additional Amount for UH-1Y/AH-1Z Rotary Wing \n     Aircraft.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 102(a)(1) for aircraft procurement for the Navy is \n     hereby increased by $282,900,000, with the amount of the \n     increase to be allocated to amounts available for the \n     procurement of UH-1Y/AH-1Z rotary wing aircraft.\n       (c) Restoration of Management Reserves for F-35 Joint \n     Strike Fighter Program.--\n       (1) Navy joint strike fighter.--The amount authorized to be \n     appropriated by section 201(a)(2) for research, development, \n     test, and evaluation for the Navy is hereby increased by \n     $78,000,000, with the amount of the increase to be allocated \n     to amounts available for the Joint Strike Fighter program (PE \n     # 0604800N) for management reserves.\n       (2) Air force joint strike fighter.--The amount authorized \n     to be appropriated by section 201(a)(3) for research, \n     development, test, and evaluation for the Air Force is hereby \n     increased by $78,000,000, with the amount of the increase to \n     be allocated to amounts available for the Joint Strike \n     Fighter program (PE # 0604800F) for management reserves.\n       (d) Offset.--The amount authorized to be appropriated by \n     section 103(1) for aircraft procurement for the Air Force is \n     hereby decreased by $438,900,000, with the amount of the \n     decrease to be derived from amounts available for airlift \n     aircraft for the HC/MC-130 recapitalization program.\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I wish to begin by thanking my colleague \nfrom Connecticut and my friend, Joe Lieberman. We have worked together \non so many issues and so well that I find this to be an odd set of \ncircumstances today where we have a difference of opinion on this \nissue. But even here, we have worked collegially to call up our \nrespective amendments in a timely manner.\n  I regret the order of offering the amendments was changed because I \nknow the Senator had speakers on his approach to this issue, as I had. \nI wish their voices could be heard. I am grateful Senator Levin will be \nspeaking shortly in support of my approach. I think the fact he is \nchairman of the Armed Services Committee lends some credence to our \napproach. I thank the Senator for his cooperation and courtesy. I so \nmuch enjoy, as with Senator McCain as well, our working together on so \nmany different issues. I thank Senator McCain for his courtesy in \ntrying to respect the time of the various Members who planned their \nschedules and planned to speak here. I thank Senator Lieberman for all \nthat. We do, however, have a difference of opinion on this important \nissue.\n  This amendment will restore funding for Marine Corps helicopters and \nthe Joint Strike Fighter management service reserves. Let me repeat for \nmy colleagues who are concerned about funding for the Marine Corps \nhelicopters or the number of Joint Strike Fighters which will be \npurchased, my amendment deals with those concerns. So many of the very \nappropriate comments Senator Lieberman was making about the Marine \nCorps, about the helicopters, about the testimony of the services in \nfavor of those helicopters, those are no longer relevant. Under my \namendment, the helicopters are provided for, so many of his comments \nabout the need for Joint Strike Fighters and the number of tails, the \nnumber of planes, those comments are no longer relevant. We have full \nfunding for the number of Joint Strike Fighters.\n  I know this debate has proceeded rapidly, it has changed rapidly, but \nall of that commentary about helicopters and the number of Joint Strike \nFighters has been taken care of by my amendment and is no longer \nrelevant to the consideration of the underlying issue, which is the \nimportance of competition and how best to go about saving money and \nprocuring engines for this vitally important program.\n  I should also say that a number of statements were read about the \nPresident and his points of view. I think it is important for my \ncolleagues who care about the comments from the President's staff about \na recommendation of a veto to point out that in those comments, they \nwere speaking directly to the number of planes, which has now been \ntaken care of. That has now been addressed. They were not referring to \nthe underlying opinion of the GAO and the whole fiscal aspect of this, \nwhich is a legitimate debate, but those comments and concerns were not \nraised as legitimate grounds for a veto threat by the President of the \nUnited States. So that has been taken care of as well.\n  What is on the table is preserving competition in the Joint Strike \nFighter Engine Program. My friend and colleague's amendment No. 1627 \nstrikes funding for this commonsense program. I wish to set the record \nstraight by preserving this competition.\n  The Joint strike Fighter is a massive acquisition program. By 2030, \nthis fighter will make up the vast majority of our tactical air fleet. \nInvesting now to ensure competition over the life of the JSF is good \ngovernment and sound management practice. Understanding\n\n[[Page S7953]]\n\nthis, my colleagues in the Armed Services Committee prudently included \n$439 million to continue development of the competitive engine.\n  As most of our colleagues know, I am very concerned with our Nation's \ngrowing deficit. I have consistently opposed bills that spend too much, \nincluding the omnibus spending bill and the recent budget. I have \nsupported amendments to strike wasteful spending.\n\n  I understand the importance of restraint, and I would not be here \ntoday if I did not truly believe this competitive engine strategy will \nsave the taxpayers money.\n  I am not alone in this view. In 1996, Congress initiated the F-136 \ncompetitive engine program because we knew then, as we still know now, \ncompetition results in lower cost, improved performance, increased \nreliability, and greater contractor responsiveness. Since then, \nCongress has maintained unwavering support for this program for 13 \nconsecutive years.\n  I want to be clear that there was never a competition for the GSF \nengine development. I heard the word ``competition'' used repeatedly by \nmy friend and colleague. I hold in my hand copies of the contracts, the \ncontracts for the engine that has just been alleged to have been let \ncompetitively. The first contract was on January 23, 1997, to Pratt & \nWhitney, in the sum of $804 million. It sets in bold print ``this \ncontract was not competitively procured.''\n  Let me repeat that in plain English. This contract for the engine \nprogram about which it was just stated repeatedly that there was a \ncompetition, was, in fact, not competitively let. It is in plain \nEnglish. A Federal Government document refutes that contention.\n  The second contract, dated October 26, 2001, once again to Pratt & \nWhitney, in the sum of $4,830,000--this contract was not competitively \nprocured. There was no competition for the engine program. It is a \nmatter of public record in plain black and white. If you care about \ncompetition, you will support my approach to dealing with this issue.\n  This is an engine program whose total cost will top $100 billion. \nThere is simply no justification for awarding a sole-source \nnoncompetitive contract in this area. The General Accounting Office has \nconsistently supported funding a second engine as a fiscally \nresponsible approach that would yield long-term cost savings for \ntaxpayers.\n  On May 20 of this year, the GAO reaffirmed this view when discussing \nthe cost to complete the second engine and stated:\n\n       A competitive strategy has the potential for savings equal \n     to or exceeding the amount across the life cycle of the \n     engine. Prior experience indicates it is reasonable to assume \n     that competition on the GSF engine program could yield \n     savings of at least as much. As a result, we remain confident \n     the competitive pressures could yield enough savings to \n     offset the costs for competition over the GFS program's life.\n\n  GAO went on to elaborate on the nonfinancial benefits of procuring a \nsecond amendment:\n\n       Our prior work, along with studies by the Department of \n     Defense and others, indicate there are a number of \n     nonfinancial benefits that may result from competition, \n     including better performance, increased reliability, and \n     improved contractor responsiveness.\n\n  The long history in the Department of Defense is that when you award \nsole-sourced, noncompetitive contracts to a single provider, costs go \nup, responsiveness goes down, the taxpayers suffer. That is what my \namendment will avoid.\n  Further, in light of the increased investment Secretary Gates and the \nadministration have chosen to make in the GSF program, limiting the \nDepartment of Defense to a single source has implications for our \nreadiness and strategic posture. If we have problems with the primary \nengine, we will have no alternative. There will be no second supplier \nwith any ability to produce a comparable engine. Production delays or \nengine failures could prove catastrophic for an already thin tactical \nair fleet.\n  Anybody who thinks that a large contract to a single vendor without \ncompetition--again I reiterate, as the contracts specifically indicate, \nthey were not competitively bid--anyone who thinks that is a good way \nfor the government to do business should support the Lieberman \namendment.\n  Some may very well argue that my amendment constitutes business as \nusual or is, in fact, wasteful, but many of these individuals have, in \nfact, supported this approach as good public policy in the past. They \nwere right then. I am right today.\n  We need to keep the primary contractors honest and the only way to do \nthat is through competition. There was no competition in the award of \nthese contracts. We now maintain that competition through the adoption \nof this amendment.\n  There were several other Senators who were intending to speak on \nbehalf of this amendment. Because of the change in schedule, they may \nnot be able to be with us. We will have to wait and see about that, but \nagain I thank Senator McCain for his courtesy in attempting to ensure \nthat they could speak. I know there were some in opposition to my \napproach who wanted to speak as well. Senator Kennedy cosponsors my \namendment and is fully supportive. Because of health care concerns he \ncould not be here today. I do wish to share with our colleagues and for \nthe record a statement he issued on June 24, as a part of the Armed \nServices Committee markup on this issue, in support of my approach.\n  Senator Kennedy, a longstanding member of the Armed Services \nCommittee:\n\n       For the fourth year in a row, the Department of Defense \n     continues to ignore the will of the Congress on the \n     production of an alternate Joint Strike Fighter engine in \n     order to reduce risk to our forces, protect against any cost \n     overruns, preserve the U.S. industrial base and support our \n     international partners.\n\n  That is what our amendment is designed to accomplish and that is why \nSenator Kennedy supports it. He goes on to say:\n\n       I remember well the ``Great Engine Wars'' of the 1980s, and \n     the development of an acquisition strategy, considered \n     controversial at the time, that ultimately delivered stronger \n     and more cost-effective fighter aircraft to the nation. That \n     issue began a decade earlier, when the decision to sole-\n     source the F-15's F100 engine resulted in rushed development \n     to meet program timelines, inadequate responses to program \n     shortfalls, and mounting frustration over our inability to \n     address these discrepancies without additional resources. \n     Ultimately, the Air Force, the Navy and Congress agreed that \n     the short-term and long-term benefits of industrial \n     competition would meet these challenges and deliver results.\n       That experience is as relevant today as it was then, \n     because we face a similar challenge. The Joint Strike Fighter \n     is one of the largest military aircraft programs in history, \n     with $100 billion allocated for engines alone. In light of \n     recent defense acquisition challenges and the growing \n     ``fighter gap'' in our air forces, these decisions could not \n     be more important, or their results more far-reaching.\n       Critics emphasize the short-term cost savings of the sole-\n     source procurement strategy and cite reports showing \n     different timelines to re-coup program costs. But dramatic \n     long-term opportunity costs are missing from this debate, and \n     are conspicuous in their absence.\n\n  That is what the GAO was referring to in the study I cited before.\n\n       Competition for the Joint Strike Fighter engine has \n     compelling advantages and avoids past pitfalls. Dual-sourcing \n     will build vital operational redundancy into the fleet, \n     avoiding a single point of failure for the engine \n     malfunctions and spare parts shortages experienced in the \n     past with other fleet-wide groundings. Competition delivers \n     an inherent incentive for manufacturers to absorb and contain \n     cost growth, even as it encourages responsiveness by \n     contractors, continuous product improvement, and innovation. \n     All of these factors are less evident in sole-source \n     contracts.\n       The alternate engine program appropriately diversifies \n     capability and capacity across the U.S. industrial base and \n     ensures that sustained production, maintenance, and \n     availability of critical components are not concentrated in a \n     single provider. In addition, the F136 alternate engine \n     program considers the sustained participation of key \n     international partners and stakeholders, especially the \n     United Kingdom, and Australia, Canada, Denmark, Italy, the \n     Netherlands, Norway, and Turkey as well. Their commitment is \n     important to the future of the Joint Strike Fighter program \n     and our basic security relationships.\n       For these reasons, I strongly support the addition of $438 \n     million in the FY 2010 National Defense Authorization Act to \n     sustain the F136 alternate Joint Strike Fighter engine \n     program.\n\n  Those are the words of Senator Kennedy.\n  In conclusion and by way of summary, the Marine Corps helicopter \nissue has been taken care of. That is no longer an issue. We fully \nprovide for that.\n  Allegations about the number of procurements for the Joint Strike \nFighters has been taken care of. That is no longer an issue.\n  Statements by the President's staff with regard to a possible \nPresidential\n\n[[Page S7954]]\n\nveto related to the potential reduction in the number of fighters, that \nissue has been taken care of.\n  As I mentioned, the contracts for the engines themselves, in black \nand white, given to Pratt & Whitney on the dates in these legal \ndocuments, say very clearly, and I quote once again: ``This contract \nwas not competitively procured.''\n  That is a matter of public record. This debate is about competition, \nthe benefits of competition. I support them. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support our amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time? The Senator from \nArizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I rise in support of the amendment which \nhas been described by the proponent and opponent. Obviously, it would \nstrip from the Defense authorization bill a provision that authorizes \nfunding for an alternate engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter.\n  Underscoring Senator Lieberman's point and as was the case with the \nprovision this body addressed in the F-22 program, funding for an \nalternate engine for the JSF at this time is something the Department \nof Defense has not asked for and does not want. It is not reflected in \neither the President's budget request or any of the Services' unfunded \npriorities list.\n  I believe there is good reason why neither the Department nor any of \nthe services at this time want an alternate engine for the JSF. That \nreason is perhaps best expressed in a letter that Senator Lieberman has \nalready quoted from and had printed in the Record, from Secretary \nGates. He concludes by saying:\n\n       It is my belief that the Joint Strike Fighter Program \n     presented in the President's budget request is in the best \n     interests of national security. If a final bill is presented \n     to the President concerning provisions that would seriously \n     disrupt the F-35 program, the President's senior advisers \n     will recommend that the President veto the bill.\n\n  Before I go much further, I would like to apologize to all Members \nwho had planned to speak on this very important amendment and had \narranged their schedules to do so. We have obviously changed the \ntiming, despite the unanimous consent agreement to the contrary, \napparently to accommodate one Senator's schedule.\n  I hope, because this is a very important issue, that Senators both in \nsupport of Senator Bayh's position and in support of this amendment \nwould seize the opportunity to come down and address this issue.\n  Some have cited the benefits of competition as a reason to pursue a \nsecond engine for the Joint Strike Fighter, but a competition for this \nengine was already conducted. It was already conducted as a part of the \noriginal flyoff competition for the Joint Strike Fighter itself. The \ncurrent airframe manufacturer and engine team won.\n  In 1996, Lockheed Martin, Boeing, and McDonnell Douglas originally \ncompeted for the two Joint Strike Technology Concept Demonstration \nAwards. In connection with that, each of those airframe manufacturers \nsolicited engine proposals from Pratt & Whitney and General Electric. \nPratt & Whitney won the competition as to Lockheed Martin and Boeing, \nand General Electric won separately as to McDonnell Douglas. Lockheed \nMartin and Boeing were selected to proceed to concept demonstration--\nwhere Lockheed Martin ultimately won in 2001.\n  That is exactly how most military aircraft engines are selected--as a \nteam, combining an airframe with a powerplant. That makes sense, I \nmight say. Obviously, we do not want them being developed separately. \nSo with regard to a second engine, we are not talking about \ncompetition, we are actually talking about another bite at the apple.\n  I hope the great engine war is over. I know of no data or analysis \nthat supports that taxpayers will see any net savings from subjecting \nthe engine for the JSF to any further competition.\n  I do not believe there is anybody who believes more in competition \nthan the Senator from Connecticut and me, including the chairman. We \nneed to have competition. But there comes a point where you have to \nmake a decision in the development of both the aircraft and the engine \nand move forward. At some point you have to abandon the alternate \nengine or, in some cases, there have been advocates of an alternate \naircraft itself, to perform the same mission, as in the case of the \ntanker, and to move forward in order to proceed in a fashion which is \nin the best interests of the taxpayers and the defense of the country.\n  That is why the Secretary of Defense feels so strongly on this issue \nthat he says the President's senior advisers will recommend that the \nPresident veto the bill if the Lieberman amendment is not adopted.\n  The fact is also funding an alternate engine over the next 6 years \nhas been estimated to cost the program about $5 billion, the equivalent \nof 50 to 80 aircraft, according to the program manager.\n  Also, given that continuing development of a second engine would \nrequire in excess of $600 million in fiscal year 2010 alone, according \nto the Military Deputy to the Assistant Secretary of the Air Force for \nAcquisitions, GEN Mark Shackelford. Paying for the engines in just that \nyear would require cutting production of at least two Joint Strike \nFighters this year alone.\n  There may be some nonfinancial benefits to subjecting the engine \nprogram for the Joint Strike Fighter to additional competition--\nimproved contractor performance at the margins, for example.\n  Like Senator Lieberman, I am not persuaded those benefits are worth \nan additional cost of $5 billion to the Joint Strike Fighter's bottom \nline over the next 6 years. Certainly there are more cost-effective \nways of ensuring contractor performance.\n  In my view, the possibility of a fleetwide grounding due to a single \nengine--that is another argument that is made by proponents of a second \nengine--is overstated. In fact, the only other U.S. military aircraft \nwith an alternative engine is the F-16. All other aircraft have single-\nengine sources and have worked well.\n  There is no doubt the cost growth of the engine has been a huge \nproblem. From fiscal year 2007 to 2008, the engine costs have grown \nspecifically to meet the needs of the Marine Corps for a version \ncapable of short takeoff and vertical landing. But I suggest the \nchallenge there is to ensure that development costs leading to \nproduction remain stable, not to introduce a new engine to the program \nthat will most assuredly add more uncertain testing requirements, \ncomplexity, and ultimately cost to the program.\n  So I believe the provision currently in the bill would be seriously \ndisruptive because one of the offsets it uses to fund developing and \nbuying a second engine derives from research, development, and testing \nand evaluation efforts supporting the program itself.\n  Also, it is my understanding the offset is of the C-130, which \nobviously is very much required in our operations in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. Remember, Secretary Gates restructured the Joint Strike \nFighter Program this year precisely to provide for more robust \ndevelopmental testing over the next 5 years to ensure that the program \nstays on its planned budget. Taking money out of the program's \nresearch, development, and testing and evaluation effort will, in my \nview, most assuredly disrupt the program.\n  One of the lessons of history on this program is its stability in \nfunding is absolutely vital to executing that program soundly, the \ninstability in funding--the disruption that the provision introduces \ninto the bill--brings the bill within the scope of a veto threat.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment \nunder consideration and prohibit any additional funding for an \nalternate engine program for the Joint Strike Fighter.\n  Let me also point out to my colleagues, I think this Secretary of \nDefense has decided, in an incredible act of courage, to take on \ncertain institutions and the way we do business. I think this Secretary \nof Defense has decided to take on--and I know he has--the military-\nindustrial-congressional complex which lards on porkbarrel projects and \nunnecessary spending which, in many respects, places parochial \ninterests over the national interests. Obviously, he feels so strongly \nabout it that he would recommend a veto by the President of the United \nStates. That would be regrettable, obviously, because we have so many \nimportant provisions in this bill for the\n\n[[Page S7955]]\n\nmen and women who are serving this country, from the wounded warriors, \nto a pay raise, for so many things--to the amendment of Senator \nLieberman's that we adopted yesterday that we would provide an \nadditional 30,000 members of the U.S. Army so we can better pursue the \nconflict in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  So, obviously, as of yesterday, the Secretary of Defense feels so \nstrongly on this issue that he would recommend that the President veto \nthe entire bill. Does that mean it would kill a bill? No. But it does \nmean there would be a significant period of delay in passing this \nlegislation and therefore delay the ability of the Pentagon and the \nmilitary to implement some of the very important provisions of this \nlegislation.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to examine this issue carefully, as I \nam sure they do all of the issues before this body. Also I would hope \nthey would take into consideration the views of our distinguished \nSecretary of Defense.\n  I do not agree on every issue with the Secretary of Defense, and \nneither does my colleague, Senator Lieberman. But I think he is on the \nright track. I think he can bring about change, at least on how we \nacquire weapons and how we spend money, and end these atrocious, \noutrageous cost overruns we have experienced in literally every single \nweapon system in recent years, which have cost the taxpayers incredible \namounts of money, and end this earmarking and porkbarrel process that I \nwill talk more on today.\n  Every day just about we pick up a paper and hear about, or go on line \nand hear about, some organization that got an earmark and their waste, \nmismanagement, and in some cases criminal behavior as far as use of the \ntaxpayers' dollars are concerned. We have to do the big things and the \nsmall things. This is a big thing.\n  I respect, enormously, the Senator from Indiana. There has been no \nmore valuable member of the Armed Services Committee than Senator Bayh. \nI respect his views. I understand where he is coming from in the name \nand sake of competition.\n  Senator Lieberman's and my argument is that the time for competition \nis over, and it is time to move forward with a tested engine that will, \none, accelerate the development and operational entrance by the F-22, \nand also save some $5 billion of the taxpayers' money.\n  So I hope my colleagues will examine this issue very carefully and \nsupport the Lieberman amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I wanted to speak very briefly because I note the \npresence on the floor of the Senator from Ohio. I want to speak simply \nto thank Senator McCain for his very strong and thoughtful statement. I \nam honored that he is the cosponsor of the amendment.\n  Senator McCain has enormous credibility in two areas that have come \ntogether in this amendment. The first is his support of the men and \nwomen of our military. The second is his opposition to wasteful \nspending of taxpayer dollars. And the two come together here.\n  Of course, as he has argued so compellingly, there are a lot of times \nwhen the wasteful spending of taxpayer dollars for military \nacquisitions is not only harmful in itself because it is wasteful, but \nit takes money away from things we need more.\n  That is the case here. The money that will be spent, $5, $6, $8 \nbillion over the next 6 years by various estimates, will result in 50 \nto 80 fewer Joint Strike Fighters produced in that time. The Navy, Air \nForce, and Marines are waiting with anxiety for these tactical \nfighters.\n  In addition to that, the folks who want to fund this second engine \nhave to find the money somewhere. They find it not only by delays in \nthe Joint Strike Fighter Program, but by either, as the amendments \ntoday give the alternative--the first one was to take it from the \nMarine Corps for helicopters that are needed in Afghanistan.\n  The one that Senator Bayh has before us will take the money from the \nAir Force special operations community for C-130s that they need for \nIraq, Afghanistan, and throughout the world. It is not worth it.\n  I thank Senator McCain for his strong statement and for his \ncosponsorship.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Who is managing this side of the debate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Bayh and Senator Lieberman.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask unanimous consent that I take some of the time \nof Senator Bayh, who is supposed to be managing.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today to speak in support of \nthe competitive sourcing for the Joint Strike Fighter engines. Senator \nBayh's compromise amendment continues our support for competition for \nthe Joint Strike Fighter engines and restores the funding for the \nMarine Corps helicopters that I know a number of my colleagues are \nconcerned about.\n  From my understanding of what happened is that in the Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator Bayh was concerned that the committee did not have \nmoney in the budget for competition for the Joint Strike Fighter. As a \nresult of that, he moved to amend and took money away from the \nhelicopters that Senator Lieberman is so concerned about.\n  Today we are here because the Senator from Connecticut wants to \nrestore that money for those helicopters, and at the same time, those \nof us who are concerned about competition would like to see the money \nincluded so we can continue competition for the Joint Strike Fighter.\n  As most of you know, I am a former Governor and mayor who has been an \nardent champion of fiscal responsibility and total quality management \nin government. I am not a Johnnie-come-lately to this whole business of \nefficiency in terms of our defense budget.\n  Since 1990, the Department of Defense acquisition management has been \nunder GAO's high risk list, and that is why, in my capacity as chair \nand now ranking member of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Government \nManagement, I strongly supported reforms at the Defense Department that \naddress contracting weaknesses and promote good business practices to \nsupport our men and women in uniform.\n  I want everyone to understand, this is not the F-22. This is about \ncompetition, fiscal responsibility, and good government management. \nWhen I came to the Senate, I remember Dwight D. Eisenhower talked about \nthe military-industrial complex. I must say, since I have been a \nSenator, he had it wrong. It is the military-industrial-congressional \ncomplex.\n  If you watch how things are done on the floor of the Senate, a lot of \nit has got to do with protecting the business in our States, even \nthough in some instances it is not in the best interests of our \ncountry. I am proud to say, in spite of the fact that in my State we \nlost about 500 jobs, I voted to eliminate the F-22.\n  That is what we should see more of here. But too often, when we make \nour decisions, it has got more to do with the corporations in our \nrespective States and the jobs than it has to do with what is in the \nbest interests of the country or what is fiscally responsible.\n  I think all of us should be concerned about it. I am going to leave \nhere at the end of next year. But it seems to me if we do not start \npaying more attention to that, we are going to continue to be in \ntrouble.\n  In testimony before the House Armed Services Committee this past May, \nthe Government Accountability Office stated that competition, \ncompetition for the Joint Strike Fighter engine will yield long-term \ncost savings for taxpayers.\n  Does that mean it is not going to cost a little more at the front end \nbecause we are going to have more than one company competing for that \nengine? Of course it is going to cost a little bit more. But that \ntestimony GAO gave cited an example of engine competition for the F-16. \nOK? We had competition for the F-16. Let's remember that this Joint \nStrike Fighter is going to be the fighter for all of the Federal \nagencies. It is going to be with us for the next 25 or 30 years.\n  That testimony for the F-16 said: It reduced engine costs for the F-\n16 by\n\n[[Page S7956]]\n\nover 20 percent. In other words, by putting a little money up front and \nhaving competition between the companies that wanted to do the engines, \nwe, over the contract, saved 20 percent.\n  I commend to my colleagues the GAO testimony before the Subcommittee \non Air and Land Forces, Committee on Armed Services, House of \nRepresentatives. This is quite a report. For those who are really \ninterested in the subject, I ask them to read this or have their staff \nlook at it. It is entitled ``Joint Strike Fighter Strong Risk \nManagement Essential as Program Enters Most Challenging Phase.''\n  It is interesting the way the company that was originally chosen to \ndo this has had cost overruns even in the beginning--and the two \ncompanies that were competing with them have been on budget and on time \nfor the Record. By the way, it is right here in this GAO report. All \nyou have to do is read the report. It is there.\n  Let me read what the report says:\n\n       A competitive strategy has the potential for savings equal \n     to or exceeding that amount across the life cycle of the \n     engine. Prior experience indicates that it is reasonable to \n     assume that competition on the Joint Strike Fighter engine \n     program could yield savings. . . . As a result, we remain \n     confident that competitive pressures could yield enough \n     savings to offset the [upfront] costs of [development] over \n     the JSF program's life.\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       As a result, we remain confident that competitive pressures \n     could yield enough savings to offset the [upfront] costs of \n     [development] over the [Joint Strike Fighter] program's life. \n     Most of us understand competition.\n\n  We have laws against antitrust, trying to make sure that one company \ndoesn't get an advantage over another. I think most of my colleagues \nunderstand competition brings out the best and the lowest price.\n  The GAO testimony goes on to address the impact competition has on \nquality of product and incentives to perform:\n\n       Our prior work, along with studies by the [Department of \n     Defense] and others, indicate there are a number of \n     nonfinancial benefits that may result from competition, \n     including better performance, increased reliability, and \n     improved contractor responsiveness.\n\n  I heard the Senator from Arizona speak eloquently about all of the \noverruns and expenses and everything else about it. If he were here, I \nwould say to him: Hey, what we want to do is have some competition on \nthis engine so we get the best price, the best quality, the most \nresponsiveness.\n  We don't need the GAO to confirm common sense. We all know that \ncompetition leads to lower cost, improved performance, increased \nreliability, and helps to keep our contractors honest. Without a \ncompetitive engine, over 90 percent of our fighter aircraft will be \npowered by one engine by 2030. Think about that. One company will have \nthat contract. Giving an extraordinarily large contract to a single \nvendor without competition is reckless and irresponsible. Our \ngovernment has an obligation to keep our contractors honest, and the \nsurest way to achieve that honesty is through competition. I urge \ncolleagues to support the Bayh compromise amendment that preserves \ncompetitive sourcing for the Joint Strike Fighter engine.\n  We have an opportunity. I can understand the Senator from Connecticut \nwas upset because we took money out of the helicopters to maintain the \ncompetition. What Senator Bayh is trying to do is come up with an \namendment that will restore the money so we can buy the helicopters \nand, at the same time, maintain competition on the Joint Strike \nFighter.\n  I urge my colleagues to study this issue. Please, if they have a \nchance, they or their staffs ought to look at this report by the GAO. \nIt substantiates the reasons why we are so ardent in terms of our \nsupport for competition for the Joint Strike Fighter.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I need \nfrom the time allotted.\n  Let me respond to a few points made in this debate.\n  First, as was clear, the original place that proponents of this \nsecond engine, which I believe is an unnecessary engine or unnecessary \nexpenditure of taxpayer money, the place from which they would take the \nmoney originally for the Huey helicopters for the marines, I think \nthere was a lot of upset about that. So the choice that Senator Bayh \nhas put before us today would cut the HC-130 and MC-130 aircraft which \nwould seriously impact both the Air Force's air combat command and the \nspecial operations command. This is a late-breaking development this \nmorning, the change of source of the funding, but we asked for a \nresponse from the office of the Secretary of Defense and it was this, \nthat this ``take'' from these two variants of the C-130s that the Air \nForce special operations command is using in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nelsewhere, wherever they are needed in the world, the Secretary of \nDefense says this would slow down the rate at which the aircraft would \nbe delivered.\n  The argument Senator Bayh made is that in the supplemental we adopted \nearlier, three additional MC-130s and four HC-130s were included, seven \nplanes. But the Air Force says to us this morning: Based on the JROC \nvalidation requirements--that is the joint operating committee that \ndetermines acquisition--the Air Force has validated requirements for 37 \nMC-130s and 78 HC-130s.\n  The Air Force, including the Air Force special operations command and \nair combat command, is grateful for the seven the supplemental gave \nthem, but they need many more. They need 115 total, and so far we have \ngiven them 7. Removing the nine planes that were in the President's \nbudget for the Air Force to fund the unnecessary second engine is not a \ncostless move. It would do damage to the Air Force and its program.\n  I know Senator Reed is here and wants to speak on the amendment \nbefore us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I rise in support of the Lieberman-McCain \namendment. I commend both of them for their efforts in this regard. \nThis represents part of what I believe Secretary Gates is trying to do, \nwhich is to focus on immediate consequential threats and necessary \nequipment while we continue to maintain deterrents for the future.\n  This second engine has not been fully validated by the Secretary of \nDefense. This amendment requires such validation. In addition, one of \nthe aspects of the underlying legislation is that the alternate engine \nfor the Joint Strike Fighter would be paid for in part by taking away \nfunds to purchase additional UH-1Y helicopters for the Marine Corps. \nThis request was in the President's budget. These helicopters are \nabsolutely critical to ongoing operations in Afghanistan and throughout \nthe world. The wear and tear on equipment, particularly in Afghanistan \nand Iraq, has been considerable. If we don't upgrade or repair these \npieces of equipment on a regular basis, we will not have the lift to \ncombat our opponents across the globe.\n  By comparison, right now in Great Britain there is an argument about \nthe sufficiency of helicopters their forces have. We don't want to get \ninto such an argument down the road. We want to make sure our forces in \nthe field have the equipment they need to carry the fight to our \nopponents.\n  I think this amendment is extremely well crafted. It puts the money \nwhere it should be to help our tactical airlift, marines particularly, \nhelicopter airlift. It requires the Secretary to justify and validate \nthat a second engine would reduce the whole life cycle cost and improve \nthe operational readiness of the F-35. We should go forward with \nhelicopters and let the Secretary make a judgment about the efficacy of \nthe second engine.\n  I thank the Senator for yielding to me.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Rhode Island, \nSenator Reed, for taking the time to come over to the Chamber. I know \nthe schedule changed. We had to adjust things. His presence and the \nstrength of his statement--he is a senior member of the Armed Services \nCommittee--and his support mean a lot to this cause.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield myself 10 minutes of the time of Senator Bayh.\n\n[[Page S7957]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I oppose the Lieberman amendment that \nwould eliminate funding for the Joint Strike Fighter alternate engine. \nThe committee voted 12 to 10 to keep this competition going. I \nemphasize, this is not a new engine that is being introduced. This \neffort is to have a competitive engine. This effort has been supported \nby Congress for many years. Indeed, our Armed Services Committee had a \nvote on this 2 years ago where we determined to maintain the \ncompetition. This year's vote was 12 to 10.\n  A fundamental tenet for reforming the Defense Department's \nacquisition system is ensuring competition throughout the development \nand production cycle of major acquisition systems, whenever and \nwherever that makes sense. In the case of the Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram, Congress has concluded repeatedly that competition makes sense \nbecause of the size of this buy.\n  The JSF program is planned to be one of the largest acquisition \nprograms ever undertaken by the Defense Department. The Defense \nDepartment intends to buy more than 2,400 JSF aircraft, with our \nforeign partners slated to buy at least another 600. That means we are \ntalking about a program of more than 3,000 aircraft. That means more \nthan 3,000 engines. The cost of the engines alone will exceed $50 \nbillion over the life of the program. This is not an issue such as \nwhether we add F-22s. This is a matter of whether we are going to have \ncompetition in a program everybody supports and where we intend to \npurchase about 3,000 planes.\n  A number of studies have been done trying to estimate the economic \ncosts and benefits of developing a second engine. The analysis of our \nGovernment Accountability Office, which Congress directed to review \nthis, came out a few years ago. Michael Sullivan, GAO Director of \nAcquisition and Sourcing Management, testified as follows in March 2006 \nbefore the House Armed Services Committee:\n\n       The current estimated remaining life cycle cost for the JSF \n     engine under the sole-source scenario is $53.4 billion. To \n     ensure competition by continuing the JSF alternate engine \n     program, an additional investment of $3.6 billion to $4.5 \n     billion may be required.\n\n  This was back in 2007. It is a lot less than that now to complete \nthis program.\n  Continuing from the testimony:\n\n       However, the associated competitive pressures from this \n     strategy could result in savings equal to or exceeding that \n     amount across the life cycle of the engine. The cost analysis \n     that we performed suggests that a savings of 10.3 to 12.3 \n     percent would recoup that investment, and actual experience \n     from past engine competitions suggests that it is reasonable \n     to assume that competition on the JSF engine program could \n     yield savings of at least that much. These results are \n     dependent on how the government decides to run the \n     competition, the number of aircraft that are ultimately \n     purchased, and the exact ratio of engines awarded to each \n     contract. In addition, DOD-commissioned reports and other \n     officials have said that non financial benefits in terms of \n     better engine performance and reliability, improved \n     industrial base stability, and more responsive contractors \n     are more likely outcomes under a competitive environment than \n     under a sole-source strategy. [Department of Defense] \n     experience with other aircraft engine programs, including \n     that for the F-16 fighter, has shown competitive pressures \n     can generate financial benefits of up to 20 percent during \n     the life cycle of an engine program and/or the other benefits \n     mentioned. The potential for cost savings and performance \n     improvements, along with the impact the engine program could \n     have on the industrial base, underscores the importance and \n     long-term implications of [Department of Defense] decision \n     making with regard to the final acquisition strategy.\n  A few months ago, before the Armed Services Committee, in May of \n2009, that same Mr. Sullivan of the GAO said that his study of 2007 is \nstill relevant and the same conclusions can be drawn.\n  This is not a new engine which is being introduced. This is an engine \ndevelopment program to provide competition which has been long \nunderway. The Department of Defense and Congress have approved, \nauthorized, and appropriated spending so far of $2.5 billion for this \nalternate engine. The most important point I think I can make is this \nis not $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion additional funds we are \ntalking about. In order to complete the development of this competitive \nengine, it will require $1.8 billion. So that $2.5 billion is already \nsunk into this engine development program. That is probably two-thirds \nof its cost already sunk into it. The question is, do we complete the \ndevelopment of this alternative engine at a cost of about $1.8 billion? \nThat would conclude the cost for the engine contractor and other \ngovernment costs for that program, for testing activities and for \noversight. So again, the issue is not whether to introduce a new \nengine. The question is, do we complete the development of a second \nengine which is already two-thirds paid for?\n  We received a letter this morning--I received a letter this morning--\nfrom the Secretary of Defense, and the letter concludes that if the \nfinal bill presented to the President contains provisions that would \nseriously disrupt the F-35 program, the President's senior advisers \nwill recommend that the President veto the bill.\n  If the final bill presented to the President contained provisions \nthat would seriously disrupt the F-35 program, I would recommend to the \nPresident that he veto the bill. There is no serious disruption to the \nF-35 program that would occur whether or not the Bayh amendment is \nadopted. The Bayh amendment makes triply sure there will be no \ndisruption at all, even a minute disruption, in the F-35 program. It is \nnot going to be disrupted at all.\n  The funding for this alternate engine in the bill which the committee \napproved came from a Marine helicopter program, a part of which could \nnot be produced this year. So the committee determined that it could \nsafely take funds that were requested for that program, which could not \nbe spent this year. A question has been raised about that. There is no \none on this committee, there is no one in this Senate, who wants to \nslow down a Marine helicopter program. None of us will permit that to \nhappen. That program is a vital program. We have spent a lot of money \non it. It is critically necessary.\n  The decision, which was made by the Armed Services Committee, was to \nsimply take funds which could not be spent for that program, because of \ndevelopment delays, and to spend that, instead, for the second engine. \nHowever, what the Bayh amendment does is to make triply sure, to \nreassure everybody there cannot possibly be any impact on a Marine \nhelicopter program, by finding a separate, a different, a distinct \nsource, an alternate source, for this second engine.\n  So the Bayh amendment removes any question about Marine helicopters. \nIf adopted, that will be off the table. It was off the table in any \nevent. But everybody wants to assure the Marines, assure our people \nthat there is not going to be any impact on a Marine helicopter program \nfor any reason, much less a second engine.\n  There is another question which some have raised about whether two \nengines--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Acting President pro tempore.\n  Madam President, how much time is left for Senator Bayh?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-seven minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would, in that case, conclude my statement. If there is \nadditional time for Senator Bayh, I will then ask at a later point for \nsome of that time. But for those reasons, and more, which I have not \nyet been able to reach, I very much support the Bayh amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Georgia, \nMr. Chambliss, such time as he requires.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, if I could ask the Senator from Georgia, \nabout how much time does he believe he would be using?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. No more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that after that \n10-minute time is used Senator Kerry be recognized for a period of up \nto 10 minutes on Senator Bayh's time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n\n[[Page S7958]]\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Connecticut \nfor yielding time on this critically important issue.\n  As we have been here debating on the floor for the last 2 weeks now \nthe respective issues relative to the priorities from a Defense \nauthorization standpoint, we have done everything other than going from \nincreasing pay for our military personnel to the termination of what I \nargued on the floor last week and this week of the latest, most \ntechnologically advanced warfighting machine that has ever been \nproduced by mankind. But the decision was made to terminate the F-22.\n  The F-22, not only from a technology standpoint, was providing \nvaluable test material for the follow-on fighter, but it also is \npowered by two engines, one engine of which is going to be on the F-35. \nAnd here we are now talking about the issue of whether we should \ncontinue with a competitive second engine for an airplane that now has \nan engine that is being flown, has been flown, has been tested by the \nAir Force on the F-22. It has successfully flown on the F-22 for years \nnow, and also has flown successfully in what limited testing has been \ndone on the F-35.\n  We have put all of our eggs in the F-35 basket now. As I said during \nthe debate on the F-22, I am a big supporter of the F-35. It is a great \nairplane. I know it is going to succeed. But we are at a point, with \nrespect to the cost of all weapons systems, where we have to look more \ntoward where we are going to be in future years from a cost standpoint \nand with regard to what we are able to provide our men and women.\n  When you look at items that need to be included in the mix from a \ncompetition standpoint, there is nobody who supports competition more \nthan I do. That is the reason I supported the second engine--up to a \npoint in time. But when it came up again last year, it was pretty \nobvious we were at a point where the engine, manufactured by Pratt & \nWhitney--two of which fly on the F-22; only one of which is needed for \nthe F-35--is a good engine. It is doing the job. It has passed the \ntest. So I decided last year we needed to move away from the spending \nof the money on the second engine, and let's concentrate on providing, \nobviously, the two engines for the F-22, and the one engine on the F-\n35.\n  We have something else thrown into the mix. I did not support Senator \nBayh's amendment in committee, for what I still think are all of the \nright reasons from the standpoint of: Do we need competition for an \nengine that is successful? For an engine we know is working? For an \nengine for which we know what the cost is today?\n  Why do we need the second engine? Well, I know detractors have said--\nand they have made the argument to me--that: Look, that engine may \nfail. Something may happen to that engine. I agree for a point in time \nthat could have happened. But we have been at this with respect to the \nengine that is powering the F-35 for years now, and it is a success. So \nI reached a point in time last year when I decided we did not need the \nadditional competition from the standpoint of the second engine and, \nobviously, the committee reached that same result this year.\n  Now we are changing horses a little bit more. Instead of using the \ndiscontinuance of the helicopters, the Marine helicopters, we are \ntaking money from six C-130Js to fund the competitive second engine for \nthe F-35, and the competition is going to be between the new engine we \nhave tested and have had in production now for several years against an \nengine we know to be successful.\n  Well, the issue has gotten even more sensitive to me because I know \nhow critically important the C-130J is to our men and women who are in \ncombat today--not those who might be going into combat and might need \nthis weapon system somewhere down the road. Our men and women in \ntheater today depend every single day on the C-130J, and on the C-\n130Hs, even, that are old airplanes, that are in theater, that are \nflying our men and women. They are looking to get the new C-130Js to \nhelp them transport themselves as well as equipment from one part of \nthe theater to the other, from outside the theater into the theater. \nOur special operations men and women are looking to the C-130J for the \ngunship operations they carry out.\n  Here we are going to say to those men and women: Well, we think it is \nmore important to have competition for a second engine against an \nengine we know is successful than it is to provide you with the latest, \nmost technologically advanced airlift capability we can give you. That \nmakes no sense whatsoever to me from a national security standpoint.\n  All of us have been to Iraq and Afghanistan at some point or another. \nI have been to Iraq eight times. I have been to Afghanistan twice. When \nwe go over there, we fly into either Kuwait or Jordan or some \nneighboring country. Then we are transported from that country into \nIraq or into Afghanistan. What have we flown on? I would say not 99 \npercent of the time but 100 percent of the time when we are transported \ninto theater, we fly on C-130s. All of us have had the experience of \nseeing date plates on C-130s we are flying on into theater, where \nrockets are being fired occasionally at those weapons systems, and we \nhave had some issues relative to that. But the date plates on those \nairplanes we fly on almost consistently are in the 1960s or 1970s.\n  So today what we are asking our men and women to do is to fly C-130s \nthat are 40 years old, 30 years old, or whatever it may be, that are \nnot equipped with the latest, most technologically advanced weapons \nsystems, and here we are saying to those men and women that we are \ngoing to take away from you the entrance of additional C-130Js into \ntheater because we think it is important we have competition for a \nsecond engine on the F-35.\n  This makes absolutely no sense from either a fiscal standpoint or a \nnational security standpoint. The C-130J is a great airplane. We have \nnine of them in this authorization bill. This particular amendment \ntakes six of those nine out of the bill and pays for the funding--the \nremainder of the funding--on the second engine. That second engine is a \ngreat engine. It has performed magnificently. But it is competing with \nan engine that also is performing magnificently.\n  So to say we now ought to take a weapons system, such as the C-130J \nthat our men and women depend on every single day to fly them around \nwithin Afghanistan--because they need these airplanes to land, they \nneed an airplane that can land on a short runway; and the C-130 has \nthat capability to fly our men and women around Iraq, to fly our men \nand women who carry out special operations and missions and have the \ngunships--the guns that are mounted on the C-130J to be transformed \ninto a gunship--we are going to take away that capability and that need \nfrom our men and women to fund a second engine for an airplane that \nalready has an engine on it, that is performing well, that we know is \nsuccessful, for which we know how much it costs today. It is not like \nwe are going to see a reduction in price on the engine of the F-35 \nbecause we complete the testing and the procurement of an alternative \nengine. That is not going to happen, and that is not the issue. The \nissue comes down to the point of are we going to take, in this case, a \nweapon system away from our men and women to fund a second engine to \ncompete with an engine that is already successful.\n\n  I would say that, obviously, I felt very strongly and was very \nemotional about the discontinuance of the F-22 for all of the right \nreasons, but this is one of those issues that makes even less sense \nthan the discontinuance of the F-22. We need to make sure we spend tax \nmoney wisely. We have had the competition on the F-35. It is time we \nmove down the road of building and procuring as many of those as we \ncan. With the ramp-up this bill calls for, under the direction of the \nchairman, we are going to be buying a lot of F-35s in a short period of \ntime. They have a great engine on them today. It works. It is \nsuccessful. That is where we need to concentrate. That is where we need \nto spend our money. We don't need to spend the money on the second \nengine, nor do we need to take six C-130 airplanes out of this budget \nto pay for an engine we are probably never going to buy.\n  So I would simply urge my colleagues to vote in support of the \nLieberman amendment and to vote against the Bayh second-degree \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n[[Page S7959]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I rise to join my colleague, Senator \nKennedy, in opposing the Lieberman amendment to eliminate funding for \nthe Joint Strike Fighter alternative engine. I disagree with the \narguments that were just made by the Senator from Georgia who actually \nis inaccurate by saying it is going to take away a weapon system from \nour military at the current time. It doesn't take any weapon system \naway whatsoever. It simply changes the schedule of production with \nrespect to the C-130s, but all of the C-130s will be built. So no \nsystem is taken away. It is important to try to be accurate about what \nis at stake here.\n  As does Senator Kennedy and a lot of other people, including Senator \nBayh and others, I believe the alternative engine is critical to reduce \nrisks to our forces, to protect against cost overruns, to preserve the \nU.S. industrial manufacturing base, and to support our international \npartners. It is a little strange, I might add, to have some of our \nfriends on the other side of the aisle who are usually quick to come up \nhere and support competition in the American marketplace arguing that \nwe shouldn't have competition and that we ought to have a single-source \nproduction for engines, where we have already seen that there are \nproblems frequently in those single-source production lines.\n  I strongly support the second-degree amendment offered by Senator \nBayh and Senator Kennedy that would provide more than $156 million for \nthe management reserves of the Joint Strike Fighter Program and more \nthan $280 million for the Marine Corps helicopter fleet. This will \nallow the Senate to preserve funding for the vital Marine Corps \nhelicopters without eliminating competition for the Joint Strike \nFighter's competitive alternative engine program.\n  Let me say the funding for the Joint Strike Fighter alternative \nengine has been important to Senator Kennedy for a long period of time. \nAs we all know, he is being treated back in Massachusetts and is not \nhere today, but his statement in support of the amendment he is \noffering with Senator Bayh has already been put into the Record by \nSenator Bayh. I wish to simply reference one thing Senator Kennedy has \nsaid:\n\n       Competition for the Joint Strike Fighter engine has \n     compelling advantages and avoids past pitfalls. Dual-sourcing \n     will build vital operational redundancy into the fleet, avoid \n     a single point of failure for the engine malfunctions and \n     spare part shortages experienced in the past with other \n     fleet-wide groundings. Competition delivers an inherent \n     incentive for manufacturers to absorb and contain cost \n     growth, even as it encourages responsiveness by contractors, \n     continuous product improvement, and innovation.\n\n  All of us know that is the way we are most effective at producing all \nof our goods in this country. We do it through competition. It is that \nkind of competition that spurs innovation, and it avoids cost overruns. \nSenator Kennedy is 100 percent accurate in his analysis of this issue, \nand I hope Senators will weigh his measurement of this based on his \nyears of experience on the Armed Services Committee as well as on the \nfacts regarding this particular engine proposition.\n  The alternate engine program spreads capability and capacity across \nthe U.S. industrial base. What it does is it ensures the production, \nmaintenance, and availability of critical components so they are not \nconcentrated in the hands of one single producer.\n  Why does that matter? Well, the current engine for the Joint Strike \nFighter has had testing issues. It is simply not appropriate to stand \nhere and suggest that everything is absolutely hunky-dory with the \nsingle-source program. The fact is, there have been two engine blade \nfailures within the past 2 years requiring a redesign, remanufacture, \nand delays in the flight test program. In fact, the engine has yet to \neven be flight tested in the most stressing flight regime--the vertical \nlanding mode. Those tests have been delayed for up to 2 years, and they \nare now scheduled to take place in September.\n  It is precisely that kind of delay that begs for this kind of \nalternative engine program. In fact, the 2007 Institute of Defense \nAnalysis study concluded:\n\n       Competition has the potential to bring benefits in addition \n     to reduced prices, including force readiness, contractor \n     responsiveness, and industrial base breadth.\n\n  So I don't believe it is in the best interests of our military to \nhave the major part of the fighter fleet dependent on a single-engine \ntype provided by a single manufacturer. It is simply too risky, and \nexperience tells us it is too risky.\n  In the 1970s, many of the F-15s and F-16 fleets were grounded as a \nresult of reliability and durability issues because the aircraft were \ndependent on one engine type. Similarly, the AV-8 Harrier was grounded \nfor 11 months due to engine problems. With over 2,400 F-35s currently \nplanned for procurement and each of the services going to be dependent \non one engine and one aircraft type for the vast majority of its \ncapability, it simply doesn't make sense to put all of it into one \nengine manufacturer--one engine and one producer. We certainly don't \nwant to take the risk of the entire F-35 fleet being grounded. \nCompetition will avoid that potential.\n  So I ask my colleagues to oppose the Lieberman amendment, support the \nBayh-Kennedy amendment to provide additional funding to the Joint \nStrike Fighter Program and to the Marine Corps helicopter fleet. I \nbelieve that is the way we best eliminate risk and best serve the armed \nservices and the needs of this particular aircraft.\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of the time to Senator Bayh. \nDoes the Senator from Ohio wish to speak?\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I wish to speak to thank Senator Bayh for \nhis work and Chairman Levin and Senator Kerry in opposition to the \namendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I yield the Senator such time as he may \nuse on behalf of Senator Bayh.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I wish to thank Chairman Levin for his \nleadership and Senator Bayh for his work.\n  This debate is about competition. It is about how our government \nspends money.\n  Earlier this year, the Senate passed a comprehensive DOD procurement \nreform law. Now we are debating a Defense authorization bill of more \nthan $660 billion. We need to continue to reform the procurement \nprocess. We need to make sure Congress is not just a rubber stamp.\n  We are debating today whether we should end a near monopoly on \nengines and long-term maintenance for the Joint Strike Fighter to one \ncompany. The Department of Defense created the alternative engine \nprogram in the mid-1990s because DOD knew such a program would foster \ncompetition between engine manufacturers. Competition fosters cost \nsavings and improved performance and flexibility. Now we are debating \nwhether the Senate should create a monopoly in buying just one engine \nfor more than 2,400 aircraft.\n  What would happen if we end the alternative engine program? One \nengine manufacturer, frankly, would have us over a barrel. The \ngovernment would have no option. The government would have no \nbargaining power. That is what we are talking about today. We are \ndebating whether we should clear the field and have no competition, not \neven the threat of competition, for our Nation's most important aerial \ndefense program.\n  What would happen if performance standards changed? I tell my \ncolleagues, we will become price-takers. The company will tell us how \nmuch they want for making the required changes. We will have to accept \nit. What would happen if the manufacturer decided they can't deliver \nthe engine at the agreed price? We would be price-takers again.\n  What if we needed to ramp up production to defend our Nation but we \nhave only one production line? We would be in trouble. What if there \nare skyrocketing costs in production? We would have to pay them.\n  If this amendment passes, we are setting the stage for inflated \ncosts. We are setting the stage for inadequate capacity.\n  So as we work to find ways to save money in this bill, as we work to \nreduce our budget deficit, we are contemplating cutting funding for a \nprogram that could lower the cost of the JSF and save our government \nbillions of\n\n[[Page S7960]]\n\ndollars while creating a more reliable aircraft, and we are debating \nwhether to limit the military's ability to pick the best engine \npossible.\n  We have been talking about an alternate engine program, but that is a \nbit of a misnomer. It is not an alternate engine; it is a competition \nbetween engines to ensure we pick the right one. Remember the famous \ncompetition between engine manufacturers for the F-16. The so-called \ngreat engine war saved our government billions of dollars and provided \nour military with the best engine possible.\n  The F-16 has kept our Nation safe for a generation. It is in large \npart because the military was able to pick the best possible engine. \nThat competition made it possible to avoid massive cost overruns, to \navoid production problems, to avoid performance issues. That is why we \nhave a competitive engine program now. We are not talking about one \nalternate engine; we are talking about two engine alternatives. It is \nan important distinction. It is about competition.\n  What we are debating is an effort by some to declare the competition \nover, even though this body has provided funding for two engines over \nand over. We are going to buy more than 2,400 Joint Strike Fighters and \ncosts will keep going up. According to news reports, we are talking at \nleast $300 billion.\n  We need to make sure we spend this money wisely. By eliminating the \nalternate engine program just to save a few dollars today, we are \njeopardizing billions later--$300 billion, 2,400 planes, the next \ngeneration aircraft that will serve the entire military for decades.\n  We have to get this right the first time. There are no do-overs. The \nJSF is a single-engine fighter. Any problem with its engine could \nground the entire fleet. This would waste billions of tax dollars, and \neven more importantly, it would jeopardize our military's ability to \ndefend our Nation.\n  We need to get this right. We need to make sure we are not granting a \nmonopoly today that we are going to be stuck with for 10 years or 20 \nyears or 30 years from now. Let's keep the second engine program going. \nLet's have a competition. Let's make sure our military has the best \nplane possible.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I wish to respond to a few of the \nstatements that have been made by the proponents of the second engine \nwhich I feel very strongly is a costly waste of taxpayer money and is \nunnecessary.\n  The argument has been made: why stop competition? I can't say it \noften enough that there has been competition. There was a competition \nin the 1990s between these two great engine manufacturers: Pratt & \nWhitney and General Electric. Pratt & Whitney won the competition fair \nand square. They did it, as Senator Chambliss said, with an engine that \nhas now had an enormous amount of experience. The Air Force has had \nexperience with it in the F-22, and it has worked extraordinarily well.\n  Secretary Gates, in his letter to us today, says the current engine \nis performing well with more than 11,000 test hours. So there has been \na competition. General Electric, which manufactures the second engine \nwhich lost the competition, is trying, in my opinion--I love this \ncompany. I respect them. They are headquartered in Connecticut, but \nthey are trying to achieve through legislation what they could not \nachieve through competition, and it is costly.\n  It is costly. It delays the Joint Strike Fighter Program. Earlier \nthis week, we terminated the F-22 technical air fighter program. That \nmeans we are all in the Joint Strike Fighter Program. This is our \nsingle hope and the specific program to take us to the future for \nAmerican tactical air war combat.\n  This second engine--the money for it--according to testimony before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee will cost the Air Force between 50 \nand 83 fewer Joint Strike Fighters for the Air Force, Army, and Navy \nover the next 5 years. That is a lot to pay for.\n  There has been competition and it is over. This engine that has been \nselected is a good one, and it will continue to perform well and not \ndelay the program.\n  I want to say a few other things about what has been said. There has \nbeen some citing of a GAO report issued in May of this year that \nsuggested that, in the long term, a second engine might result in \nsavings. I think it is important to say that the opinion of the GAO is \nnot documented in their report on that matter, and it is not shared by \nother authorities who have done independent analyses.\n  The Institute for Defense Analyses says flat out that GAO \nunderestimated the required government investment to develop an \nalternative engine by nearly $4 billion. One of the supporters of the \nsecond engine earlier said that we have already spent over $2 billion \non it, and there is only a need to spend another $1.5 billion or $1.8 \nbillion. Of course, any dollar we spend on an engine that I believe we \ndon't need should go to other programs in the Department of Defense. It \nis a waste of dollars.\n  In the GAO report itself, which is cited by proponents of the second \nengine, it is quite clear that they say an additional investment of \n$3.5 billion to $4.5 billion in development and production costs may be \nrequired for this program.\n  That means an additional $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion, in the coming \nyears totaling over $6 billion--some say even more--for a second \nengine, which would be nice to have, like it would be nice to have a \nlot of things, but we cannot afford it.\n  The fact that we cannot afford it is demonstrated by the amendments \nintroduced by the proponents of the second engine. We will have to \ncannibalize, or take from the Marine Huey helicopters and from the Air \nForce C-130s being used by the special operations and Air Force combat \ncommand in battle today.\n  Let me go to this GAO argument. My friend from Massachusetts cited an \nInstitute of Defense Analyses statement offered in testimony before the \nHouse in March of this year. There is another line in that that makes a \nvery powerful point on the question of savings from the second engine. \nTo break even financially, according to the Institute of Defense \nAnalyses--I am quoting from that:\n\n       To offset fully the estimated $8.8 billion investment to \n     establish the alternative JSF engine would require a savings \n     rate, during the production phase, of 40 percent on a net \n     present value basis.\n\n  That is a little complicated. Here is the key from the independent \nInstitute of Defense Analyses:\n\n       Savings of this magnitude are implausible, considering the \n     11 to 18 percent savings realized in other competition.\n\n  So it is way beyond what we have seen before. I want to quote from \ntestimony received in our committee, a very interesting exchange \nbetween Senator Begich, a member of our subcommittee, and the \nrepresentative of the Navy and the Air Force. Senator Begich, in \nreference to the GAO report cited, indicated that the F-136, the second \nengine, had better efficiency and opportunity, ``but you seem to \ndisagree with that,'' the Senator says to the witnesses, and I believe \nthat the current Joint Strike Fighter engine is the course you are \ntaking. Vice Admiral Architzel of the Navy says:\n\n       While we generally support competition, the cost of \n     continuing to develop a second engine versus being able to \n     use that in procurement dollars for aircraft or in the cost \n     also to maintain the 2 engines, the Navy supports the \n     Department of Defense in just having this one F-35 engine.\n\n  Lieutenant General Shackleford, from the Office of Acquisition of the \nAir Force, says a very important quote regarding the GAO report that \nhas been cited by proponents of the second engine:\n\n       In this particular case, the analysis that the Office of \n     the Secretary of Defense did to look at the costs associated \n     with a second engine yielded a different result from what the \n     GAO reported, which basically says the costs associated with \n     development of a second engine would be something that we \n     would consider unaffordable in the current timeframe, while \n     we would be doing the development. That benefit down the \n     road, in terms of comparative costs, would be more of a wash \n     than the more optimistic version of what the GAO report said.\n\n  So when we look at balancing the risk of having one engine versus the \ncosts of paying for the second--be it costs within the program, which \nwould be taken out of production aircraft with a negative effect in \nterms of unit\n\n[[Page S7961]]\n\ncosts, or even having to source these dollars someplace else within the \nAir Force--we don't consider the purchase of a second engine to be an \naffordable solution.\n  Again, competition has occurred. It is over. We have to really go \nforward with the Joint Strike Fighter Program, not delay it, or waste \nmoney on it or take money from other programs to fund this one.\n  I will introduce this for the Record. I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record two letters, one from Military Families United, \nand another from the Vets for Freedom.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Joe Lieberman,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: On behalf of Military Families \n     United and the military families throughout the country we \n     represent, I am writing today in support of restoring funding \n     to the FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act to procure \n     additional UH-1s and HC-130s.\n       As we continue to increase deployments of our forces in \n     Afghanistan, the strain on our military hardware will greatly \n     increase thus making it more necessary that we continue to \n     procure and recapitalize vital equipment at a sustainable \n     rate. Without this equipment America's brave men and women in \n     uniform will be put in greater danger. They deserve the best \n     equipment available to defend themselves and successfully \n     complete the mission they have been asked to accomplish. \n     Providing the necessary funds for the procurement and \n     recapitalization of both the UH-1 and the HC-130 will afford \n     our Armed Forces the ability to successfully execute our \n     military engagements overseas.\n       Our warfighters deserve the very best equipment we can \n     provide them. To that end, Military Families United \n     aggressively supports this effort to restore funding for the \n     procurement and recapitalization of these vital weapons \n     systems. We must never forget the sacrifices the brave men \n     and women of our Armed Forces make every day in the service \n     of our nation and for the cause of Freedom. I look forward to \n     working with your office to get this important legislation \n     passed.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                   Brian Wise,\n\n                                               Executive Director,\n     Military Families United.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Lieberman: Vets for Freedom has always fought \n     for the success of the mission and fielding the needs of war-\n     fighters serving our country in harms way. Recently, we've \n     seen attempts made in Congress to strip funding from the \n     Marine Corps H-1Y Huey helicopter program and from the \n     Special Operations Command's C-130 fleet.\n       Both pieces of equipment play a key role in making both our \n     troops more effective and lethal on the battlefield: by both \n     transporting Marines into the fight and allowing our Special \n     Operations Forces to take the fight to the Taliban and Al-\n     Qaeda around the country. Both of the H-1Y Huey and HC/MC-130 \n     Hercules are mission critical assets for the fight we are in \n     today and tomorrow--and the Secretary of Defense and \n     Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps agree.\n       Vets for Freedom calls on the Senate to fund these two \n     critical programs and ensure that our troops have the \n     equipment and support they need to successfully accomplish \n     their current mission.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Pete Hegseth,\n                                       Chairman, Vets for Freedom.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. This is from Bryan Wise, executive director of \nMilitary Families United:\n\n       . . . I am writing today in support of funding to the \n     FY2010 National Defense Authorization Act to procure \n     additional UH-1s and HC-130s.\n       . . . Providing the necessary funds for the procurement and \n     recapitalization of both the UH-1 and the HC-130 will afford \n     our Armed Forces the ability to successfully execute our \n     military engagements overseas.\n       . . .

We must \n     never forget the sacrifices the brave men and women of our \n     Armed Forces make every day in the service of our Nation and \n     for the cause of freedom.\n\n  The second letter, from the Vets of Freedom, is signed by Pete \nHegseth, a distinguished and decorated veteran, who is chairman of Vets \nfor Freedom. He says:\n\n       Vets for Freedom has always fought for the success of the \n     mission and fielding the needs of war-fighters serving our \n     country in harm's way. Recently, we've seen attempts made in \n     Congress to strip funding from the Marine Corps H-1Y Huey \n     helicopter program and from the Special Operations Command's \n     C-130 fleet.\n       Both pieces of equipment play a key role in making our \n     troops more effective and lethal on the battlefield: by both \n     transporting Marines into the fight and allowing our Special \n     Operations Forces to take the fight to the Taliban and al-\n     Qaida around the country. Both of [these programs] are \n     mission critical assets for the fight we are in today and \n     tomorrow--and the Secretary of Defense and Commandant of the \n     U.S. Marine Corps agree.\n\n  I appreciate these letters. They speak volumes, and I hope they will \nlead my colleagues to oppose the Bayh amendment and support the \namendment we have introduced.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise in support of Senator Lieberman's \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2010, which would eliminate funding for an alternate engine for the F-\n35 Joint Strike Fighter, JSF.\n  President Obama singled out the alternate engine as wasteful \ngovernment and he specifically did not request funding for an \nalternative engine in his budget proposal to the Congress. On May 7, \nPresident Obama said that ``we're going to save money by eliminating \nunnecessary defense programs that do nothing to keep us safe--but \nrather prevent us from spending money on what does keep us safe. One \nexample is a $465 million program to build an alternate engine for the \nJoint Strike Fighter. The Defense Department is already pleased with \nthe engine it has. The engine it has works. The Pentagon does not \nwant--and does not plan to use--the alternative version. That's why the \nPentagon stopped requesting this funding two years ago.''\n  In fact, the administration has already stated its intention to veto \na defense authorization bill that is presented to the President that \nincludes funding for an alternative engine. The June 24, 2009 Statement \nof Administration Policy on HR 2647, the House Defense authorization \nbill, which also includes funding for development of an alternative \nengine, noted that ``. . . the Administration objects to provisions of \n[HR 2647] that mandate an alternative engine program for the JSF. The \ncurrent engine is performing well with more than 11,000 test hours. \nExpenditures on a second engine are unnecessary and impede the progress \nof the overall JSF program. Alleged risks of a fleet-wide grounding due \nto a single engine are exaggerated. The Air Force currently has several \nfleets that operate on a single-engine source.''\n  In addition, the Secretaries and Chiefs of the Air Force and Navy \nhave all said that they do not need or want a second engine for the \nJSF. When Air Force Chief of Staff General Schwartz testified before \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee on May 21, 2009, he said that if he \nwere asked where he would put his next available dollar for the F-22 \nprogram, ``it would not be in a second engine.'' Chief of Naval \nOperations Admiral Gary Roughead is also opposed to the second engine, \nstating, ``. . . keeping parts for two engines on the decks of aircraft \ncarriers is not advisable. Therefore you can put me solidly in the one-\nengine camp.''\n  It has been suggested that competition for these engines would be \ngood for the military. Quite simply, there has already been a \ncompetition and it was won by Pratt & Whitney. In 1996, the Pratt & \nWhitney engine was the engine of choice for two of three competitors \nfor the Joint Strike Fighter: Boeing and Lockheed Martin. The third \ncompetitor, McDonnell Douglass, selected the General Electric engine. \nWhen McDonnell Douglass was not selected for a key milestone in the JSF \ndevelopment, concept demonstration, while Lockheed Martin and Boeing \nwere selected, the General Electric engine was eliminated as a future \nengine for the JSF. In fact, the P engine was well positioned for \nthis competitive success in the JSF competition by previously besting \ncompeting engines in 1991 for use in the F-22. Moreover, the only other \naircraft in the U.S. military inventory that has a dual source for \nengines is the F-16. All other military aircraft have a single source \nengine, and it is a strategy that works. Single source jet engines are \nthe rule, not the exception.\n  In terms of the industrial base, the leaders of the potential \nalternate engine teams would suggest that without an alternate engine \nthey might be shut out of the military aircraft engine business. \nHowever, these teams already provide engines for multiple military \naircraft platforms. In contrast, Pratt &\n\n[[Page S7962]]\n\nWhitney will only make aircraft engines for the Joint Strike Fighter \nwith the closing of the C-17 and F-22 lines. In a sense, the reverse \nwould be more accurate.\n  This is especially important to me since much of the JSF engine work \nwill go through the Pratt & Whitney facility in my home State of Maine. \nThe 1,375 highly skilled employees at the P North Berwick facility \nshould not have their jobs jeopardized for an unnecessary competition. \nA competition that they already won.\n  This debate should not even be occurring. The President and the U.S. \nmilitary say they do not want or need this alternate engine. There is \nno reasonable justification for spending on a second engine when the \nfirst engine is performing admirably. I urge my colleagues to support \nSenator Lieberman's amendment.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the alternate \nengine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The Armed Services Committee, \nwhich has reviewed the program carefully, made the sensible move in \nrestoring the almost $440 million necessary this year to continue \ndesign and development of the alternate engine, known as the F136 \nengine, made by General Electric Aviation.\n  The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter Program will likely emerge as the \nlargest tactical aircraft program in the Nation's history.\n  Given developments in unmanned aerial vehicles, it could also be the \ncountry's last major tactical aircraft program. The F-35 will provide a \ntremendous general purpose capability to replace the Air Force's aging \nF-16s, the Marine Corps' AV-8Bs, and older versions of the F/A-18. We \nhave to get development of this aircraft right. The kind of delays and \ncost overruns that have plagued development of so many other defense \nprograms recently would be absolutely unacceptable in this far-reaching \nprogram.\n  An alternate engine would create competition. Competition would force \nboth production teams to deliver a better product at a better price to \nthe government.\n  An alternate engine would prevent a single-point failure in the F-35s \ncontinued development. If one program reaches insurmountable obstacles, \nthe Department of Defense will be able to rely on the other engine. \nFinally, an alternate engine would ensure that the country has more \nthan one military engine manufacturer.\n  Several nonpartisan, rigorous studies from groups such as the \nInstitute for Defense Analyses and the Government Accountability Office \nhave underscored the benefits of an alternate engine.\n  There is some question as to whether the existence of a second engine \nand the resulting competition would save money over the life of the \nprogram. One need only look to the history of the F-16 engine in the \n1970s and the 1980s for an answer, which is a resounding yes. In that \ncase, the availability of two engines resulted in a decline in price \nfor the overall aircraft, allowing the government to buy more for less. \nOpponents of the alternative engine claim that cutting the engine will \nallow more planes to be built, when in fact what will happen is that \nthe overall cost of the program will increase and incentives to build \nthe best engine will be eliminated.\n  Real cost savings, improved performance: these are the reasons that \nwe simply must continue development of the Alternate Engine for the \nJoint Strike Fighter. And it is these reasons that I will vote to \ncontinue forward with this absolutely essential investment that ensures \nwe are getting the best product for our troops and at the best price \nfor taxpayers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, what is the time situation?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Connecticut has \n26 minutes. The Senator from Indiana has 14 minutes. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Might I ask my friend from Oklahoma how much time he \nneeds?\n  Mr. INHOFE. A couple minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I yield to the Senator from Oklahoma up to 5 minutes \nof my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I look at this issue and think about not \njust the hours and days and months but years we have talked about this. \nA lot of people have changed their mind and have gone back and forth on \nit. I think at the time Senator Warner was here, he actually took a \ncouple of positions.\n  I look at it simply. I have been concerned about the funding and \nabout some of what we need to have. We all had different ideas on the \nadditional F-22s. I look at this and I see that the only current U.S. \nmilitary aircraft with a new engine source is the F-16. All the rest \nhave single engine sources. It has worked well, and there is no \nmilitary requirement for the alternate engine.\n  I have come to the conclusion it would cost over $5 billion to fund \nthe alternate engine and, over the next year, it will cost the \nprogram--I have seen estimates from 50 to 80 aircraft, according to the \nprogram manager.\n  Congress has directed three studies on the alternative engine, and we \nhave gone over studies in our Armed Services Committee. Two out of the \nthree studies of the alternate engine stated there would never be any \ncost savings associated with the competition.\n  There has never been actual data--only anecdotal--that proves there \nwas ever any cost savings brought about by what someone called the \n``great engine war'' on the F-16s.\n  It seems to me it is a savings without the alternate engine, which \nwill allow us to have more capability, more aircraft.\n  I strongly support the Lieberman-McCain amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. How much time remains on our side, Madam President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 23 minutes. \nThe Senator from Indiana has 14 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I want to add some additional comments \nabout the $438 million that would be taken from the HC/MC 130s \nrecapitalization program to fund development of the alternate engine.\n  I don't think there is any doubt that given the conflict in \nAfghanistan, as well as Iraq, but particularly now in Afghanistan, as \nwe move into the southern part of the country, the HC/MC 130s are \ncritical weapons systems. Their platforms are designed to specifically \nsupport our special operations warriors, which is the kind of fight we \nare in. It is an irregular fight, and it puts increasing demands on our \nspecial forces.\n  As we know, these aircraft are specialized C-130s that are \nspecifically designed for that fight. They have capabilities, such as \naerial refueling and gunship weaponry, that meet the requirements of \nthe special operations command.\n  I would be very reluctant and strongly opposed to taking funding away \nfrom special operations and using it to fund the second motor for the \nJoint Strike Fighter. It is a time, obviously, when we are fighting two \nirregular wars, and it is not a time to take this funding away.\n  According to the Defense Department, the current military requirement \nfor the HC/MC 130s aircraft is 60. The Department recently recognized \nthat the need to modernize the aging, worn-out special operations and \ncombat search and rescue fleets is urgent.\n  According to the Office of the Secretary of Defense, ``the cut to \nthese aircraft would slow down deliveries to the warfighter of the HC-\n130 and the MC-130 impacting both the Air Force's Air Combat Command \nand Special Operations Command.''\n  According to the Air Force ``based on the JROC validated requirements \nfor 37 MC-130s and 78 HC-130s, the Air Force, including the Air Force \nSpecial Operations Command and Air Combat Command, would benefit from \nan even greater acceleration of the recapitalization rate of all 9 \naircraft that remain in the President's budget.\n  Taking that money out of this program would delay the delivery of new \naircraft to the warfighter. I think that if General McChrystal were \nhere, and our other leaders, they would make it very clear that in the \nvery difficult situation we face in Afghanistan--large areas of \ngeography that need to be traveled and controlled--these aircraft are \nvery much needed. I hope my colleagues will also take that into \nconsideration as we consider this vote.\n  I congratulate the Senator from Indiana for a very eloquent argument \non behalf of his position. Again, I state\n\n[[Page S7963]]\n\nmy appreciation for the very important role he plays as a member of the \nArmed Services Committee. This is one of the few times we disagree, but \nI think he has presented his side of the argument with eloquence.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Indiana.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, perhaps I should quit while I am ahead \nfollowing those very generous remarks by my friend and colleague from \nArizona. I am compelled, however, to save a few minutes of my time for \nSenator Levin, who is the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and \nis supportive of our amendment, for him to offer a few additional \nobservations. I do want to close with a few closing remarks.\n  First, I thank Senator Kennedy, who could not be with us today but \nwho is a strong supporter of our amendment, and Senators Kerry, \nVoinovich, Brown, and Senator Levin I have mentioned, who spoke in \nsupport of this amendment. I thank them.\n  I do want to address a couple of points that have been raised, first \nwith regard to the issue of the Marine Corps helicopters. Again, for \nthose who care about the helicopters, for those who care about \nsupporting the Marine Corps, we have taken care of that issue. The \nMarine helicopters will be fully funded. So that is off the table. For \nthe assertions made in the reduction of the number of Joint Strike \nFighters to be procured, we fully funded the administration's request, \nand there will be no reduction because of my amendment. We have taken \ncare of that issue. That is no longer relevant.\n  The President's staff recommending a veto was premised on the \npresumption that there would be a reduction in the number of planes \npurchased. Since that has been taken care of, the veto threat is no \nlonger relevant. It has been taken care of.\n  There have been comments made about the C-130 procurement. I, too, \nsupport the C-130 procurement. We have fully funded--fully funded--the \nadministration's request. It was passed in the supplemental. The money \nis there, in recognition of that. That is why the House of \nRepresentatives fully eliminated the account we are using to fund the \nsecond engine.\n  For those who care about the C-130, as do I--and I thought Senator \nMcCain's comments were very appropriate about the need for that \nimportant plane--that has been fully funded. In fact, what has been \nproposed in our authorization is a duplicate funding, a double funding. \nSo for those of us who care about duplication, this, in fact, would \nsave the taxpayers money, which I understand is one of the premises \nunderlying the Lieberman amendment. Accepting their premise, this is a \nfully appropriate funding source.\n  Finally, I would like to address this issue of competition once \nagain. It has been asserted and alleged over and over that there was a \ncompetition, that the competition was run by Pratt & Whitney, that \nthere was competition, competition, competition. I hold in my hands \ncopies of the contracts given to Pratt & Whitney. I hold them right \nhere. Cover page, January 23, 1997, Pratt & Whitney, $804 million, et \ncetera, in bold type:\n\n       This contract was not competitively procured.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       This contract was not competitively procured.\n\n  The second contract is for the engine dated October 26, 2001, Pratt & \nWhitney, in this case $4.8 billion. Once again, in bold type--bold \ntype--so people can read it and understand:\n\n       This contract was not competitively procured.\n\n  It could not be any plainer than that for those of us who can read \nthese documents. There was not a competition with regard to this \nengine. It is a sole-source contract.\n  Therein lies the issue. It is not about helicopters. It is not about \nthe number of planes that are procured. It is not about the C-130. All \nof those things have been taken care of. It is about your belief that \ncompetition is in the best interest of the taxpayers--and quality. If \nyou believe that, you support this amendment. If you believe single-\nsource, noncompetitively bid contracts, such as these, are in the best \ninterests of quality and protecting the taxpayers, then you will \nsupport Senator Lieberman's amendment. That is what this is all about.\n  Since I don't have much time--how much time do I have, Madam \nPresident?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 10\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I don't want to exhaust it all. I quoted \nat length in my previous comments from the General Accounting Office, \nand there are a variety of studies. It is asserted that GAO did not \noffer much reasoning for their comments. I point out once again that \nthey state very clearly the savings from this competition; the second \nengine has the potential to be equal to or exceeding its cost. Prior \nexperience, they indicate, points to this and that they are confident \ncompetitive pressures could yield these kinds of savings. The GAO is \nwell on record. I understand there is a dispute from other entities and \nother studies, but that is the GAO's opinion.\n  This all comes down to competition, whether my colleagues embrace it, \nin which case they support our amendment, or if they do not--and I \nsuppose there may be legitimate arguments in favor of noncompetitive \nbidding--they will support the other amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, will the Senator from Indiana yield me 3 \nminutes?\n  Mr. BAYH. Absolutely.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me confirm what the Senator from \nIndiana said. This issue does not involve 130s. Congress has put all \nthe money in for 130s that the President requested. The reason this \nmoney for 130s was in our committee report is because we did not know \nat the time that the supplemental appropriations bill would put money \nin for the 130s. So we do not need this money for the 130s to fully \nfinance the request of the President of the United States for 130s.\n  I wish to reiterate one point I made earlier. This is not an issue of \nwhether we insert a new engine, whether we start down the road with a \nsecond engine. That issue was resolved years ago by Congress when we \nstarted to fund a second engine for the purpose of competition. We have \nalready put $2.5 billion into this second engine. Roughly $1.8 billion \nmore is needed. So our sunk costs are approximately two-thirds of the \ncost of this second engine.\n  We have consistently supported it in the Armed Services Committee. \nThis is not new. We feel the value of competition will more than make \nup for all of the costs and surely far more than make up for the final \ncosts which we need in order to complete the development of this second \nengine.\n  I do support the Bayh amendment. I think it makes sense in terms of \nthe fundamental point of competition, it makes sense fiscally, and it \nmakes good sense in terms of the quantity we are buying. There is a \nhuge buy, 2,500 planes, engines, and perhaps 500 more in terms of the \nexport market. It is a huge buy. With this size buy and given the \nprecedent of other planes--at least three that have had two engines \navailable for them--with that precedent and with these savings, I hope \nthe Bayh amendment is accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, be added as a cosponsor \nto the amendment Senator McCain and I and others have offered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I thank my friend from New Hampshire \nfor joining us on this amendment. We have a dispute about whether there \nwas competition. I guess it depends on what you describe as \ncompetition.\n  There clearly was competition for the Joint Strike Fighter plane \nengine in the 1990s. In 1996, Pratt & Whitney and General Electric each \nsubmitted engine proposals to the three airframe manufacturers that \nwere competing for the Joint Strike Fighter contract: Lockheed, Boeing, \nMcDonnell Douglas. Two of the three selected the Pratt & Whitney \nengine, and it happened that those two airframe manufacturers were \ndown-selected for the final competition. Ultimately, in 2001, Lockheed \nwas selected to start the design and development with the Pratt & \nWhitney engine.\n\n[[Page S7964]]\n\n  I believe there was a competition. General Electric lost. It has gone \nthe other way on other occasions. And this is a legislative attempt to \nachieve by legislation what could not be achieved through competition.\n  Secondly, my dear friend Senator Levin, the chairman, and I may have \nan effectual disagreement on how much more going for the second engine \nwill cost. He believes it will be $1.8 billion. I cited earlier in this \ndebate statistics that show it will be between $4.5 and $5.5 billion. \nThat is not the main point. Madam President, $1.8 billion is a lot more \nto spend on an engine I have submitted to my colleagues we do not need. \nNot only do we not need it, the Air Force testified before our \ncommittee that if we spend this money on a second engine, we are going \nto get, by General Shackelford's testimony to us, 53 fewer Joint Strike \nFighters in the next 5 years. We will not be able to afford them. That \nis a serious consequence.\n  What about this engine that has been selected? The F-135 engine has \nflown over 11,000 test hours and delivered 12 flight test engines. The \nF-135 uses a core that has been delivered and is being used in the F-\n22. It will have close to 1 million flight hours by the time this \nselected engine, the Pratt & Whitney F-135, enters operational service \nin 2012. That is quite a remarkable record and one that justifies what \nSecretary Gates said to us in a letter he sent to us this morning: \n``The current engine is performing well with more than 11,000 test \nhours.'' I think the record is a clear one.\n  I, again, respectfully thank my friend from Indiana. Senator McCain \nsaid he has argued well. He is a dear friend. We would rather be on the \nsame side on issues. We both feel strongly about this issue. Therefore, \nI respectfully urge my colleagues to vote against the Bayh amendment \nand for our amendment which would end funding for a second unnecessary \nengine.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, unless my friend and colleague from \nArizona has something new and shocking to say, I am going to yield back \nthe remainder of my time.\n  First, I thank both of my colleagues for the tenor of the debate. We \nhave some honest differences of opinion. I find myself much more \ncomfortable working with my colleague, Senator Lieberman, in a variety \nof capacities. Senator McCain and I are one of a hearty band of a few \nwho come to the floor in agreement to oppose wasteful measures. I look \nforward to resuming that partnership in the future even though we have \na respectful difference of opinion today. I only wish all our debates \ncould be as focused and collegial as this has been.\n  Having said that, I thank my colleagues. Unless Chairman Levin has \nanything additional to say, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, has all the time been yielded back?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I ask my friend from Arizona if there is anything more \nhe would like to say.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I think we are prepared to vote.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I will say very briefly, to wind up, \nthe Bayh amendment does remove the 130s from the Air Force. It is true \nthey got money in the supplemental, but statements we got this morning \nfrom the Air Force and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, the 130s \nthey got in the supplemental, which are critically needed, leave open--\nin other words, they are nowhere near their requirements for that plane \nwhich is critically important to the Air Force and particularly to our \nspecial operations forces in Afghanistan, Iraq, and throughout the \nworld in the war on terrorism.\n  I would just close by reading a statement from President Obama, when \nhe introduced his defense budget on May 15.\n\n       We are going to save money by eliminating unnecessary \n     Defense programs that do nothing to keep us safe but rather \n     prevent us from spending money on what does keep us safe. One \n     example is a $465 million program to build an alternate \n     engine for the Joint Strike Fighter. The Defense Department \n     is already pleased with the engine it has. The engine it has \n     works. The Pentagon does not want and does not plan to use \n     the alternate version. That is why the Pentagon stopped \n     requesting this program funding 2 years ago.\n\n  And then from Secretary Gates, just today:\n\n       It is my belief the Joint Strike Fighter program presented \n     in the President's budget request is in the best interest of \n     national security. If a final bill is presented to the \n     President containing provisions that would seriously disrupt \n     the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter program, the President's senior \n     advisers will recommend that the President veto the bill.\n\n  That is from Secretary Gates' letter.\n  So I submit to my colleagues, I believe we have shown today that the \nsecond engine funding will seriously disrupt the Joint Strike Fighter \nProgram. Again, I respectfully ask my colleagues to oppose the \namendment from our good friend from Indiana and support the amendment \nwe have offered.\n  I thank the Chair, and if there is no one else who wants to speak, I \nyield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:35 \np.m., all time remaining for debate with respect to these amendments, \nNos. 1627 and 1767, having been yielded back, the Senate then proceed \nto vote in relation to the amendments in the order previously entered, \nwith the second vote 10 minutes in duration and all other provisions of \nthe previous order remaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I modify that unanimous consent request \nand ask that the vote begin immediately at 12:34 and a half p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1767 offered by the \nSenator from Indiana. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1627, offered by the Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent, with the \nconcurrence of the proponents and the opponents, that the 2 minutes be \nyielded back and that this be voice voted.\n\n[[Page S7965]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. All time \nis yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1627.\n  The amendment (No. 1627) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. CARPER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1760\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, let me take a moment to indicate to \ncolleagues where we are at the moment. The pending business is my \namendment, amendment No. 1760, dealing with the START treaty. We need \nto have our nuclear weapons program modernized consistent with the \nSTART treaty.\n  What we are thinking of doing is to start the debate with about 2 \nminutes of conversation, and then if we are able to work out an \nagreement with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and other \nmembers who have an interest in this, we can avoid a long, protracted \ndebate and potentially a lot of votes on alternatives as well as this \namendment.\n  In the meantime, other business on the bill could be conducted. I \nthink the next business the chairman intends would be for Senator \nSchumer to speak. So what I would suggest is that we move forward to \ntry to work out an agreement. The essence is simply this, for my \ncolleagues who are interested in this START treaty: We know there is a \ntreaty, or at least we hope a treaty is going to be submitted to the \nSenate late this year.\n  We would be reducing the number of nuclear warheads and delivery \nsystems in an agreement with the Russians. That makes it even more \nnecessary to put some money into our current nuclear program, the \ninfrastructure and our nuclear stockpile, to bring it up to snuff, to \nmodernize it, and to ensure that it meets the test for safety, \nsecurity, and credibility.\n  We need to have a plan for doing that, that is at least no later than \nthe point at which the treaty would be submitted to the Senate so we \nknow what we are going to be able to support. Hopefully, what we would \ndo is convey to the administration jointly, Democrats and Republicans, \nour desire to have that submittal to the Senate to have a study we \ncould put into law as a part of this bill that would call for bringing \nin that modernization program and thereby avoid voting specifically on \nthe amendment No. 1760 I have proposed.\n  We are trying to work out the details of that. If we can do that, we \ncan probably save quite a bit of time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, let me thank my friend from Arizona. \nFirst of all, we are trying to work out an approach which would be \nsatisfactory to the issue and will save a lot of time if we can work it \nout. If we cannot, we can go to a vote on his amendment. The regular \norder would be to go back to the Kyl amendment as I understand it at \nthis point. We are going to ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nNew York be recognized to introduce an amendment, that it be in order \nfor him to do so, and that after 15 minutes we vote.\n  I ask unanimous consent that after 15 minutes of debate, with no \namendments being in order to the amendment, we then proceed to a vote, \nunderstanding it would be a voice, and then the regular order would be \nrestored, which is the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Reserving the right to object, if the chairman would \nagree, the Senator from Montana wants to take some time to talk about \nhis amendment which is germane, but he wants to talk about it. We have \nnot had a chance to examine it. Then we could go back to the Kyl \namendment, pending hopefully an agreement.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I would modify my unanimous consent request that after the \ndisposition of the Schumer amendment, then Senator Tester be recognized \nfor 10 minutes to talk about his amendment, without the consent to \noffer it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Reserving the right to object, is there a time \nagreement on the Schumer amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Fifteen minutes is what I reserved.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Thank you. I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New York is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1764\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that absent uniformed services voters and overseas \nvoters are aware of their voting rights and have a genuine opportunity \n to register to vote and have their absentee ballots cast and counted, \n                        and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent to set aside the pending \namendment so we can call up amendment No. 1764.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New York [Mr. Schumer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1764.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The text of the amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text \nof Amendments.'')\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I ask unanimous consent I be yielded 5 minutes of the \n15; Senator Bennett, the ranking member of the Rules Committee, be \ngiven 5 minutes; and Senator Chambliss be given 5 minutes, divided that \nway.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I rise to talk about Amendment No. 1764, called the MOVE \nAct, The Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act of 2009. I first \nwish to thank my colleague, Senator Bennett, for his hard work. He was \nindispensable in getting this done, as were Senator Chambliss and \nSenator Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Senator Cornyn, who had previous \nlegislation that was similar. I also wish to thank the Chairman, \nSenator Levin, as well as Senator McCain, for helping us.\n  The MOVE Act is a bipartisanship solution to a serious, yet all too \nfamiliar, problem. The bottom line is, our soldiers overseas have a \nvery difficult time in voting. With the MOVE Act, with 58 cosponsors, \nwe can tackle this problem head on and make voting for our military \noverseas men and women easier.\n  We chaired a hearing in the Rules Committee that brought up the \nproblems, and they are shocking. The bottom line is very simple. If you \nare in the military, it is very difficult to comply with State \nregistration laws. You have to go through two post offices, military \nmail, and then the regular post office. There is no availability of \nnotaries. Many States require notaries.\n  There is also the problem, of course, that you have to do everything, \nby many State laws, by mail. And the mail takes forever when you are \noverseas.\n  Couple that with the fact that for absentee voting, which by \ndefinition these voters have to use, there are serious deadlines. All \ntoo often our soldiers get their absentee ballot after the deadline has \npassed to send them in. All too often, even more frequently, the voting \nballot does not arrive by the deadline the State has set.\n  So these are serious problems. The bottom line is, with technology, \nthey all could be overcome. We have faxes, we have e-mails, we have \ncomputers, and we do not use them for our soldiers overseas. They can \nrisk their lives for us, we can at least allow them to vote. They take \norders from the Commander in Chief. They are the first people who ought \nto be allowed to elect and vote for a Commander in Chief.\n  If we can deploy tanks and high-tech equipment and food to the \nfrontlines, we can figure out a way to deliver ballots to our troops so \nthey can be returned and counted. That is what the MOVE Act does, \ncorrecting the many\n\n[[Page S7966]]\n\nflaws that riddle absentee ballots for overseas voting.\n  The numbers are very troubling. More than a quarter of all ballots \neither come in too late or are not counted. That is a serious problem. \nWhen our soldiers who have so much else on their minds go out of their \nway to get the absentee ballot cast, then it is not counted. That is \nfrustrating. That is wrong. That is not American.\n  So our bill--and the details are available in the Record--deals with \nthat issue. One soldier sent to the Overseas Vote Foundation a letter \nwhich said: ``I hate that because of my military service from overseas, \nI was precluded from voting.''\n  That soldier continues: ``Of all people, deployed servicemembers \nshould have a guaranteed ability to vote.'' That sums it up. That sums \nit up.\n  The MOVE Act will ensure it by allowing ballots to be sent \nelectronically, dealing with the time gaps and all the other problems \nwe face. It is bipartisan. Again, both Senator Bennett and I on the \nRules Committee support it. Senator Chambliss and Senator Ben Nelson, \nwho have done such a good job, are the cosponsors of this legislation. \nWe can finally solve this problem, which is unacceptable, by moving \nthis legislation.\n  I ask my colleagues, how can a marine in Fallujah find a notary? Why \nare we making things so hard? How can somebody who goes out of his or \nher way to cast a ballot have that ballot not counted? This legislation \nsolves the problem in a fair, measured way that is cognizant of the \nrights of States to set the voting laws as they wish. I hope we will \nhave unanimous support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I am happy to cosponsor the bill Senator \nSchumer has just discussed, the Military and Overseas Voters \nEmpowerment Act or the MOVE Act. As the ranking member of the Rules \nCommittee, I have served alongside Chairman Schumer and commend him for \nhis decision to make this a priority and move it through the committee. \nOur military personnel make tremendous sacrifices for this country, and \nwe need to make sure they are able to exercise their right to vote. I \nthank Senator Schumer's staff as well for the cooperative way in which \nwe have moved this forward and for his willingness to deal with two \nother colleagues on the committee, Senator Chambliss and Senator \nNelson.\n  When the legislation was introduced in its original form, I raised \nconcerns with Senator Schumer about some of its provisions. He worked \nwith me and my staff to address those concerns, and the amendment \nbefore us today effectively does so. That is why I am pleased to now be \na cosponsor of the bill.\n  The difficulties our service personnel face in attempting to vote \nhave been well documented. The Senator from New York has described \nthem. I believe this amendment deals with them in a proper fashion.\n  I want to clarify several points for the record. We recognize that \nelection administration is carried out at the local level, and we have \nno intention of transferring those functions to the State in this \nlegislation. The amendment makes clear that States may comply with the \nobligations imposed on them hereunder by delegating their \nresponsibilities to other jurisdictions in the States, just as they \nhave for so many years in complying with the Uniformed and Overseas \nCitizens Absentee Voting Act. Also, the amendment requires States \nseeking Federal funds to meet the requirements imposed by this \namendment to update their State plans which have been previously \nsubmitted pursuant to HAVA, the Help America Vote Act. The amendment \nclarifies that only States seeking the funds authorized by and \nappropriated pursuant to this amendment are obligated to update their \nState plans.\n  With that clarification, I thank Senator Schumer and my other \ncolleagues who worked so hard on this legislation: the two I mentioned, \nSenators Chambliss and Nelson, as well as Senator Cornyn, who is not a \nmember of the committee but who has worked on it. I appreciate their \nbringing the issue before the Senate. I am proud to support it and look \nforward to its unanimous passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise to express my strong support for \namendment No. 1764 offered by the Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer. \nWith the leadership of Senator Schumer and Senator Bennett, we have \ncrafted one of the most substantive and comprehensive military and \noverseas voting reforms we have seen in years. This amendment tackles \nsome very tough issues while taking States rights into account.\n  In May of this year, Senator Bennett was consumed with another issue, \nand he asked me to cochair a hearing with Senator Schumer on military \nand overseas voting. We heard testimony from numerous witnesses \nregarding the difficulty of military and overseas voting. This \namendment addresses some of those concerns and is a significant step \ntoward ensuring that military and overseas voters are not \ndisenfranchised.\n  The amendment establishes uniform standards for the request and \ndelivery of blank balloting material that takes into account all \navailable technologies. It makes sure all overseas voters have time to \nvote by requiring States to send out ballots to military and overseas \nvoters at least 45 days before election day. It utilizes expedited mail \ndelivery services for our uniformed members serving overseas, ensuring \na timely delivery of completed ballots. It establishes a requirement \nfor service Secretaries to designate voter registration agencies at \nmilitary installations to assist with voter registration and aid our \nvoting assistance officers. It lays the groundwork to gather needed \ninformation to continue to improve the overseas absentee voting process \nand will help existing voting oversight organizations gather key voting \nmetrics to help make key decisions ahead of future elections.\n  Not since the passage of the Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee \nVoting Act in 1986 have we proposed such significant legislation \ndesigned to help the men and women of the military who time and time \nagain are called upon to defend the rights and freedoms we Americans \nhold so sacred.\n  Unfortunately, our military is one of the most disenfranchised voting \nblocks we have. Today we have the opportunity to correct this problem. \nI am extremely pleased with this legislation and proud to have been a \npart of the team that put this amendment together.\n  There are 57 other cosponsors which is representative of the strong \nsupport for this amendment and significant concern around the country \nregarding this issue. I thank Senator Schumer and his staff for leading \nthis effort and helping make this legislation become a reality. I thank \nSenator Ben Nelson, my good friend and colleague, on the Armed Services \nCommittee, for his efforts in this matter. It would not have happened \nwithout his strong leadership.\n  I also thank Senator Bennett and his staff for their strong efforts \nin putting this bill in the proper perspective and making sure that all \nissues were properly addressed. I also thank Senator Cornyn for his \nleadership over the years on this issue. Senator Cornyn is not a member \nof the Rules Committee, but he has been very engaged on this issue over \nthe last several years. His input was valuable. There is no question \nthat his support for the amendment and contributions he and his staff \nhave made to the amendment have made what was a good amendment a much \nbetter one.\n  Lastly, I thank the secretary of state of the State of Georgia, Karen \nHandel, also a very valuable asset to us as we went through the process \nof putting this bill together. She and her staff responded very timely \nand were honest in the feedback we got from them. Their contributions \nhelped make sensible changes that make the amendment better. Their \npartnership on this effort will move us forward in the right direction \ntoward ensuring every overseas voter wishing to vote will be able to do \nso.\n  Again, to my colleague from New York, it has been a pleasure to work \non this. It is one other asset that we can give to our men and women in \nuniform; that is, to make sure they have the ability to participate in \nwhat we all take for granted but a very precious right, that being the \nright to vote.\n\n[[Page S7967]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of \namendment No. 1764, better known as the Military and Overseas Voter \nEmpowerment Act. I wish to express my appreciation to Senators Schumer \nand Chambliss for their leadership and excellent work on this issue and \nacknowledge the outstanding support and contributions of Senators \nBennett and Cornyn, whose involvement has improved this bill and whose \nongoing support will help us enact it into law. This effort has been \nconstructive and bipartisan all the way, as evidenced by our list of 58 \nbipartisan cosponsors, and I am very proud of the bill we have \nproduced.\n  We owe it to our men and women in uniform to protect their right to \nvote. And for military and overseas voters, that right is only as good \nas their ability to cast a ballot and have it counted. For years, we \nhave known of the obstacles these brave Americans face in exercising \ntheir right to vote, often when far from home and in harm's way. I \nfirmly believe this legislation will make a huge impact in empowering \nour military and overseas voters to have their votes counted, no matter \nwhere they find themselves on election day.\n  Simply put, the status quo for these voters is unacceptable. It is \nhard for military families to keep their voter registration information \ncurrent, and it is often difficult to deliver ballots to overseas \nvoters in enough time for them to vote and return the ballot by the \ntime the polls close.\n  The poor results from recent elections speak for themselves. In 2008, \nstatistics from the seven States with the greatest number of deployed \ntroops show that one in four military and overseas voters were unable \nto have their vote counted. In 2006, the situation was even worse: \naccording to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, up to two-thirds \nof ballots requested by voters under the Uniformed and Overseas \nCitizens Voting Act were either not cast or not counted.\n  We discussed these numbers and heard testimony from State and local \nofficials at a hearing in the Rules Committee earlier this year. The \nchallenges we face are significant, but a number of very excellent \nrecommendations were made at that hearing, and Senators Schumer and \nChambliss and I immediately got to work on a commonsense bill to \nimprove and streamline the process for these voters. The bill we came \nup with was amended and reported unanimously by the Rules Committee \nlast week. The product of that effort is now before the Senate as an \namendment to the Defense bill.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment, and I will push for it to be \nenacted into law in this bill, because as State and local election \nofficials know, voting reforms need to be put in place well in advance. \nThe way they see it, the next Federal election is right around the \ncorner. Now is our chance to make a difference for 2010.\n  This legislation harnesses technology to speed up the voting process \nby allowing registration and ballot requests to be sent electronically. \nIt ensures that military and overseas voters have time to vote by \nrequiring ballots to be sent out 45 days before the election and \nallowing blank ballots to be sent electronically. It also provides some \nflexibility to States that cannot meet the 45-day deadline, as long as \nthey come up with an alternative plan to ensure time to vote. In \naddition, it will harness the creativity of States and local officials \nby authorizing pilot projects to test new voting technology, with \nappropriate safeguards for privacy and security. The legislation also \nrequires the Department of Defense to play a more significant role in \nfacilitating voter registration and in collecting and returning voted \nballots in cooperation with the Postal Service.\n  The MOVE Act, as we call it, has the support of the Alliance for \nMilitary and Overseas Voting Rights, which is a coalition of over 30 \nmilitary associations, nonprofit organizations, elected officials, and \nstudent groups dedicated to ensuring that Americans abroad have an \nequal right and opportunity to vote. We also have the support of many \nother groups, including the National Association of County Officials, \nwhich is especially important because having the support of State and \nlocal officials means that our efforts are endorsed by the people who \nactually carry out elections in this country, which can often be a \nthankless job.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank all 57 of the amendment's \ncosponsors, especially Senators Schumer and Chambliss and the others I \nmentioned who have shown real leadership on this issue. This amendment \nis bipartisan, noncontroversial, and necessary to solve a persistent \nproblem that has dogged our troops and overseas voters for years. We \ntackle those problems head-on, and I think we will see real, tangible \nresults from this legislation.\n  Mr. President, it is our responsibility to ensure the right to vote \nfor the men and women of our Armed Forces and others serving overseas; \nthey protect our rights, and we have an opportunity today to return the \nfavor by passing the MOVE Act. I urge the amendment's adoption.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I will note that this amendment passed \nunanimously out of the Committee on Rules, which has joint \njurisdiction, last week.\n  I yield back all remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1764.\n  The amendment (No. 1764) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1564\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to say a few \nwords about amendment No. 1564, an amendment I am seeking agreement on, \nand hopefully we will achieve agreement between the majority and \nminority. This amendment will allow but not require the Secretary of \neach service branch to allow family members of fallen servicemembers to \nattend one memorial service as a way of helping to honor those who give \ntheir lives to our Nation. Although the Defense Department's current \nregulations permit the services to provide transportation of family \nmembers to the burial service of a servicemember killed on Active Duty, \nthe regulations do not allow travel to memorial services. This can be \nparticularly painful when a parent or sibling cannot afford to travel \nto a memorial service held by a unit or even other family members.\n  Although some charity groups have been able to help families attend \nmemorial services for their fallen loved ones when servicemembers die \nin service to their country, it is the government's moral obligation to \nhelp their families in every possible way. This is not an abstract \nproblem; it is all too real to some families.\n  A little over a year ago, on May 1, 2008, a soldier with a family in \nboth Montana and Arizona was seriously wounded while serving in Iraq. \nFour days after being injured he was being transferred from an Army \nhospital in Germany to Walter Reed. While en route, the soldier's \ninjuries worsened and the plane was diverted to Halifax, Nova Scotia. \nIt was there that he passed away on May 15.\n  Like too many children today, this soldier grew up with divorced \nparents. His father is a constituent of mine. His mother is a \nconstituent of the distinguished ranking Republican on the Armed \nServices Committee. When his family and friends in Phoenix organized a \nmemorial service for him, his father asked the casualty affairs officer \nassigned to him if the Army could pay for him to attend the memorial \nservice. He was told, no; that it is not an authorized expense. The \nArmy cannot pay for such a plane ticket.\n  My office was contacted, and we were able to work out with a \nnonprofit organization to obtain a plane ticket for the soldier's \nfather to attend the memorial service but only after considerable \nfrustration and pain.\n  This amendment would make travel to a single memorial service an \nauthorized expense. It is supported by the Gold Star Mothers.\n  Our troops and veterans have earned every benefit and every paycheck \nthey get from our country. Every single Member of the Senate has been \nsteadfast in that support. But the families of folks who serve this \ncountry have earned our Nation's support and respect as well. Sometimes \nwe do not do\n\n[[Page S7968]]\n\nenough to recognize the sacrifice that comes along with having a loved \none in the Armed Forces. This amendment provides the families of our \nservicemembers one small measure of support and appreciation.\n  I thank Senators Levin and McCain for the work they have done on this \nbill and, hopefully, the work they did to get this amendment accepted.\n  I also wanted to take some time this afternoon to speak about a dire \nsituation in Columbus, MT. At this moment there are 1,300 employees of \nthe Stillwater Mining Company who are going to work wondering about the \nfuture of their company and the future of their jobs. Yesterday a \nbankruptcy court in New York nullified a contract between Stillwater \nMine, the only palladium and platinum producer in the United States, \nand General Motors. General Motors petitioned the bankruptcy court to \ndrop its precious metals contract with the Montana mining company so it \ncan instead use foreign, cheaper suppliers based outside this country, \nspecifically in Russia and South Africa. I would have a big problem \nunder any circumstances for an American corporate icon to choose \nforeign suppliers over a viable American option, but when we consider \nthat General Motors only exists today due to the direct assistance of \nthe American taxpayer, this decision is appalling and weakens our \nAmerican manufacturing base.\n  As a member of the Senate Banking Committee, I attended the marathon \nhearings late last year where the domestic automakers pleaded for \ngovernment assistance. On November 18 of last year, I relayed to \nexecutives from Ford, Chrysler and, yes, GM the importance of spending \ntaxpayer funds in the United States. I said I would have to ask: Where \nis the money going to be spent, who is it going to be spent on, and \nwhat country is it going to be spent in? Those are all critically \nimportant questions.\n  If we are using taxpayer dollars, from my perspective, it ought to be \nspent in the United States. In response, I was assured that taxpayer \nfunds would be spent domestically to rebuild the auto manufacturers. By \nnegating Stillwater's contract, GM is not investing domestically. They \nare not investing in American jobs. They are not investing in this \ncountry. It goes against the grain when we see a viable company that \nhas recently gotten into trouble, such as GM, go against what they told \nme in committee.\n  When General Motors came pleading to the Senate late last year, they \nspoke of the fate of their employees, but they also spoke of the fate \nof small parts manufacturers, miners, dealerships, and other \ninterconnected businesses dependent on GM.\n  I voted against giving taxpayer dollars to the auto manufacturers, \njust as I voted against the Wall Street bailout. The auto manufacturers \ndidn't convince me they would spend the money wisely and that they \nwould spend it in the United States. I wish I were wrong, but they are \nnot spending the taxpayer dollars wisely, in my opinion, and they are \nnot spending the taxpayer dollars in the United States. And it is the \nfolks at Stillwater, like many auto dealerships in Montana and across \nrural America, who are hurting.\n\n  With its $50 billion in taxpayer funds, General Motors recently \nemerged from bankruptcy, and with its first repayment on the $50 \nbillion owed to the American taxpayer, the new GM has decided to dump \nits only domestic supplier of palladium. They have failed to present a \nsignificant need to do business with foreign suppliers when they can \ncontract with a company right here in America that employs more than \n1,300 hard-working Americans.\n  For the last decade, Stillwater has supplied GM with palladium and \nrhodium, which are used to make catalytic converters that filter \npollutants from vehicle exhaust. The palladium sales to auto companies \naccounted for 42.8 percent of Stillwater's revenue last year.\n  General Motors' rejection of its contract with Stillwater will result \nin company losses of about $500,000 per month and almost certainly \nmeans losing countless good-paying American jobs--and those American \njobs, in this case, happen to be in Montana.\n  Stillwater is one of Montana's largest employers. The economic well-\nbeing of 1,300 Montanans at Stillwater who work at the mines in Nye and \nBig Timber is no doubt in serious trouble. GM's actions threaten the \nwell-being of families, numerous small communities, and dozens of \ninterconnected Montana businesses.\n  Immediately after the court ruled against Stillwater and its \nemployees, I joined with the senior Senator from Montana, Max Baucus, \nin urging General Motors to reconsider their decision to choose foreign \nsuppliers over a proven domestic partner.\n  I still hope they make the right decision and realize the new GM only \nexists today because of the American taxpayers--taxpayers such as the \nMontanans who work at the Stillwater mines. Maybe they do not care \nabout placing American jobs at risk, but the fact is--as I do, and we \ndo--they should.\n  I cannot express adequately today the disappointment I have had and \nthat I have with GM's decision to negate the contract with Stillwater \nMining. It is part of that manufacturing base that I think is so \ncritically important to this country, and they are turning their back \non it.\n  With that, I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask unanimous consent to engage \nin a colloquy for a minute with the distinguished chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I understand we are hopefully close to an \nagreement on the Kyl amendment and then we could set up, following that \nagreement, the Burr amendment, followed by an Akaka amendment, and our \nstaffs will be working on further amendments so our colleagues will \nknow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Our goal is precisely that. We are trying to work out an \nagreement with Senator Kyl. Staffs are trying to work out a time \nagreement. The order, though, hopefully will be Senator Burr and then \nSenator Akaka. But we have to make sure the proper committees are \nnotified that are involved in those amendments, and then we could, I \nthink, have a unanimous consent agreement. That is our goal.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman. For the benefit of our colleagues I \nstill think it is possible--and I think the chairman would agree--to \nfinish up by tonight, if we could have expeditious handling of the \namendments but which may require us to finish by tomorrow, I hope.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am very pleased to hear the optimistic assessment. I \ncan't honestly say I share that optimism, but I will be delighted to be \nsurprised.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business while we are waiting for the outcome of the \nnegotiations that I had a colloquy with the chairman about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Earmark Reform\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I have long spoken about the broken \nappropriations process and the corruption it breeds. I remain deeply \nconcerned over the damage done to our country and, indeed, this \ninstitution by their continued abuse. I ask my colleagues: How many \nmore pay-to-play scandals will it take before we enact comprehensive \nand meaningful earmark reform?\n  Look at the scandals over the last 5 years alone: Former U.S. \nRepresentative Randy Cunningham sits in a Federal prison today for \nselling earmarks. Among the many bribes Cunningham admitted receiving \nwas the sale of his house at an inflated price; the use of a yacht, \nfree; a used Rolls Royce; antique furniture; Persian rugs; jewelry; and \na $2,000 contribution for his daughter's college graduation party. In \nreturn, he earmarked untold millions of dollars and pressured the \nDepartment of Defense to award contracts to his coconspirators.\n  Of course, Senator Dorgan and I spent nearly 2 years investigating \nthe Indian lobbying practices of Jack\n\n[[Page S7969]]\n\nAbramoff, who reportedly dubbed appropriations committees ``a favor \nfactory.'' One former Senate staffer pled guilty to accepting gifts in \nexchange for helping Mr. Abramoff's team on appropriations matters. An \nex-official in the Department of Justice pled guilty to accepting \nbribes for helping Mr. Abramoff's client secure millions of dollars to \nbuild a jail. In all, over 20 people--including an ex-Congressman, \nadministration officials, congressional staffers, and lobbyists--have \nbeen indicted, convicted or pled guilty.\n  The Department of Justice investigation into this matter still \ncontinues to this day.\n  We have today multiple pay-to-play scandals unfolding before our \neyes. We read weekly, almost daily, news article after news article \nabout numerous criminal investigations revolving around earmarks. Take, \nfor example, the ongoing criminal investigation into the PMA Group. \nMost Americans have probably never heard of the PMA Group. The PMA \nGroup was a DC lobbying firm with deep ties to Capitol Hill and a \nreputation for securing lucrative earmarks for its clients, especially \ndefense earmarks. As I have said many times, it is the ``Willie Sutton \nSyndrome,'' because when he was asked why he robbed banks, he said: \n``That's where the money is.'' The reason why a lot of these corrupting \nearmarks came out of defense is because that is where the money is.\n  The PMA Group boasted more than $15 million in revenue last year. The \nPMA Group clients reportedly received $300 million in defense earmarks \nfor fiscal year 2008 and $317 million for fiscal year 2009. The PMA \nGroup and its clients spread around a lot of campaign contributions in \nan attempt to curry favor with lawmakers.\n  Last November, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided PMA's \noffices and the home of its founder, Paul Magliocchetti. According to \nnews reports, prosecutors were initially focused on whether Mr. \nMagliocchetti used a Florida wine steward and a golf club executive as \na front to funnel illegal donations to lawmakers. The Washington Post \nexamined campaign contributions reportedly given by employees of the \nPMA Group and found listed in donor records ``several people who were \nnot registered lobbyists and did not work for the lobbying firm,'' \nincluding a 75-year-old California man who had never even heard of the \nfirm.\n  Since then, the Department of Justice has raided the offices of a \nnumber of PMA clients and their business partners. A Federal grand jury \nreportedly subpoenaed records from one U.S. Representative's \ncongressional and campaign offices and the FBI is interviewing his \nstaffers.\n  Last week, we read about yet another scandal involving people and \nfirms in PMA's orbit. According to a July 15 Associated Press news \narticle, the former head of the defense contractor, Coherent Systems \nInternational, pled guilty in Federal court to defrauding the U.S. \nGovernment and accepting kickbacks. Two former PMA clients are \nreportedly caught up in the scandal.\n  According to court documents, in October of 2005, the Air Force \nResearch Lab awarded Coherent an $8.1 million contract to deliver four \nGround Mobile Gateway Systems. An $8.2 million earmark contained in a \ntsunami relief bill funded the contract. Get that: It was for a Ground \nMobile Gateway System included in a tsunami relief bill. Not \nsurprisingly, Coherent had lobbied for that earmark. At the time, \nCoherent was represented by a firm called KSA Consulting.\n  Coherent submitted to the government at least $1.8 million in \npurchase orders outside the scope of the Air Force contract. What did \nthe government get for its $1.8 million? Coherent paid two \nsubcontractors, which were also represented by KSA Consulting, almost \n$600,000 for software that was not called for under the Air Force \ncontract. What did Coherent do with the software? It literally threw \nthe software in a closet where it sat collecting dust.\n  Coherent paid another subcontractor $650,000 for the delivery of five \nprototypes, also not part of the prime contract. Some reports suggest \nthat this is the same subcontractor that allegedly bribed Coherent's \npresident and whose offices the FBI raided earlier this year.\n  Coherent also paid Schaller Engineering, a former PMA client, \n$200,000 for technology that was never delivered. We now know where the \nmoney went. On July 21, 2009, Roll Call reported that the former Air \nForce contracting official, on the Mobile Common Data Link Gateway \nprogram, pled guilty to ``skimming money from an earmark that was \nprovided to a Pennsylvania defense contractor.'' In his plea agreement, \nthe official admits to approving invoices that were not part of the \ncontract and then taking the kickback from the defense contractor.\n  This is outrageous, but I also believe it is only the tip of the \niceberg. We will undoubtedly see the continued march of news reports \nabout further indictments and guilty pleas.\n  Earmarks breed corruption, purely and simply. The current earmarking \nprocess doesn't stop it or adequately guard against it. So I ask my \ncolleagues: How many more scandals must we suffer before we enact \nmeaningful earmark reform? How low must Congress's approval rating sink \nbefore we act to repair this institution's reputation? How many more \nlawmakers, staffers, government officials, and contractors have to go \nto jail before we actually fix this process?\n  Unfortunately, Congress's earmarking practices have grown worse, not \nbetter, just about every year I have served in the Senate. This year \npromises to be the worst. We began the year by passing a $400 billion \nOmnibus appropriations bill with almost 9,000 earmarks in it. Contrary \nto his promise to the American people to stem the tide of earmarks, the \nPresident refused to veto that pork-laden bill. In fact, he signed it \nin a quiet room far from the public eye, I might add, using the \nrationale it was ``last year's business,'' even though it was passed \nthis year.\n\n  Two weeks ago, the Senate approved a $44 billion Department of \nHomeland Security appropriations bill. It was over $200 million more \nthan last year's bill and almost $100 million more than the President's \nbudget request. It, too, was laden with numerous unrequested, \nunauthorized earmarks added at the direction of members of the \nAppropriations Committee in the Senate. Rest assured, we will see more \nearmarks in the other appropriations bills that come to the floor later \nthis year. Even the pending fiscal year 2010 national defense \nauthorization bill is not insulated from the practice.\n  Americans all over the country are hurting. People are losing their \njobs, their savings, and their homes. So what do we do? We continue \nthis disgraceful earmarking process, elevating parochialism and \npatronage politics over the true needs and welfare of this Nation. The \nPresident pledged during his campaign he would work to eliminate \nearmarks. The Speaker of the House promised to drain the swamp. Given \nthe abysmal state of our economy, Americans can no longer wait for them \nto make good on their promises. Earmark reform is needed and it is \nneeded now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following articles be \nprinted in the Record:\n  July 21, 2009: ``Ex-Air Force Employee Pleads Guilty in Case Tied to \nMurtha Earmark.''\n  The Hill, July 21, 2009: ``Second Contractor Pleads Guilty in Earmark \nProbe.''\n  July 21, 2009: ``Inquiries Focus on Subcommittee Ties.''\n  July 15, 2009: ``Ex-Defense Contractor CEO Enters Fraud Guilty \nPlea.''\n  Washington Post, February 14, 2009: ``Despite Listing, Donors Don't \nWork For Firm Being Probed.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Roll Call, July 21, 2009]\n\n   Ex-Air Force Employee Pleads Guilty in Case Tied to Murtha Earmark\n\n                            (By Paul Singer)\n\n       A former Air Force employee pleaded guilty Monday to \n     skimming money from an earmark that was provided to a \n     Pennsylvania defense contractor by Rep.

Gensym and VidiaFusion were \n     both clients of KSA as well.\n       O'Hair also approved a payment of $650,000 to Kuchera \n     Industries--a firm close to Murtha that was raided by the FBI \n     earlier this year for products that were not part of the \n     Gateway contract, and $200,000 to Schaller Engineering for \n     ``target tags'' that were never provided. Schaller was \n     represented by the PMA Group lobbying firm, which was raided \n     by the FBI in November.\n       Richard Schaller, the founder of Schaller Engineering, then \n     distributed the $200,000 to O'Hair though another company he \n     created and to his business partner Thomas Sumrall, according \n     to the plea agreement. Sumrall has also pleaded guilty in the \n     case, but Schaller has not.\n       Richard Ianieri, the former CEO of Coherent Systems, \n     pleaded guilty July 14 to charges linked to the same scheme. \n     He has also pleaded guilty in a Pennsylvania court to taking \n     kickbacks from a subcontractor referred to as ``K'' for \n     favorable treatment under government contracts.

John Murtha (D-Pa.) pleaded guilty in a kickback \n     scheme, leading to new questions about Murtha's role in \n     getting earmarks for his brother's lobbying business. FBI \n     agents raided a Florida company linked to Rep. Bill Young (R-\n     Fla.), leading Young to withdraw a $4 million funding request \n     for the firm the next day. And Rep. Pete Visclosky (D-Ind.) \n     asked the Federal Election Commission for permission to use \n     his campaign funds to pay legal bills of current and former \n     staffers as part of the investigation into the PMA Group, a \n     lobbying shop that specialized in defense earmarks.\n       None of these lawmakers, who oversee more than $500 billion \n     in Pentagon spending, have been accused of wrongdoing, and no \n     one other than Visclosky and his former chief of staff, \n     Charles Brimmer, has even been subpoenaed at this point.\n       But this web of legal actions, all focused on suspicious \n     ties between lobbying, military contractors and the billions \n     in funding they receive, has once again cast a negative light \n     on the relationship between lawmakers and earmark recipients.\n       At this point, it's unclear whether the separate Justice \n     Department actions are part of one broad investigation into \n     earmarking and government contractors or are separate probes \n     on different tracks.\n       But the Department of Justice has certainly focused on some \n     of the most powerful members of Congress. Murtha is chairman \n     of the Defense Subcommittee, while Young, who chaired the \n     full Appropriations Committee for six years, is currently \n     ranking member of the panel. In addition to serving on \n     Defense, Visclosky is chairman of the Appropriations Energy \n     and Water Subcommittee.\n       All three lawmakers have consistently pushed tens of \n     millions of dollars in earmarks for companies back in their \n     districts. While Murtha may be the most well-known \n     practitioner of the trade, both Young and Visclosky are \n     masters of earmarking, as well.\n       ``The chickens are coming home to roost,'' said Steve \n     Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a \n     government watchdog group that opposes earmarking.\n       The Justice Department is ``beating the drums, that's for \n     sure. They're really stirring things up,'' said a former \n     Appropriations Committee staffer turned lobbyist. ``Everyone \n     is kind of waiting for the next shoe to drop.''\n       And while the criminal investigations heat up at DOJ, House \n     Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is not protecting her \n     members, letting ethics inquiries move ahead inside the \n     House. The ethics committee has begun a preliminary review of \n     lawmakers' ties to PMA, after Democrats initially blocked \n     such a probe.\n       ``We are going to let the chips fall where they may,'' said \n     a top aide to one Democratic leader. ``If they did something \n     wrong, they are going to have to pay for it. We're not going \n     to cover anything up for them.''\n       The seemingly constant questions about Murtha and his \n     relationship with legally troubled contractors have caused \n     the most political headaches for Pelosi, who pledged to stop \n     the ``culture of corruption'' she believes thrived under the \n     Republican-controlled Congress.\n       In November, the FBI raided the offices of the PMA Group. \n     Murtha has received more than $2.7 million in campaign \n     donations from PMA, its lobbyists and clients over the past \n     decade, but there have been no charges filed until now. The \n     PMA search was followed in January by another federal raid on \n     Kuchera Defense Systems, a Pennsylvania firm that has \n     received more than $50 million in federal contracts via \n     Murtha earmarks.\n       Last Wednesday, Richard ``Rick'' Ianieri, former CEO of \n     Coherent Systems International, pleaded guilty to taking \n     $200,000 in kickbacks from a subcontractor on an $8.2 million \n     Air Force contract earmarked by Murtha. Coherent's lobbyist \n     was Robert ``Kit'' Murtha, the congressman's brother, who \n     helped them win that earmark.\n       ``We had no knowledge of these disturbing transactions, and \n     if they are true, then the individuals and companies in \n     question should be held accountable under the law,'' said \n     Matt Mazonkey, Murtha's spokesman.\n       On the same day that Ianieri pleaded guilty, federal agents \n     raided Conax Florida Corp. of St. Petersburg, Fla. Young has \n     earmarked more than $28 million for Conax, a maker of safety \n     devices for NASA and the Pentagon, since 2005, according to \n     the St. Petersburg Times.\n       According to the Federal Election Commission record, Young \n     received $6,000 in campaign contributions from Conax \n     employees.\n       Young has never attracted the same kind of scrutiny for his \n     earmarks as Murtha, although the St. Petersburg Times \n     reported last year that Young steered more than $73 million \n     in federal funds to a defense firm and nonprofit groups where \n     two of his sons work.\n       ``You're going to have a hard time, with Young, finding \n     people to say he's somehow dirty or put him in the same \n     category as Murtha,'' said a former Appropriations Committee \n     aide.\n       Visclosky, the least well-known of the defense \n     appropriations trio, meanwhile, is searching for ways to \n     cover his legal bills--and those of his staffers snared by \n     his investigation.\n       Visclosky and Brimmer were issued subpoenas last month by a \n     federal grand jury in Washington that is investigating PMA.\n       ``It is possible that additional subpoenas or requests for \n     information could be forthcoming for additional current and/\n     or former staff members,'' wrote Michael Malczewski, \n     Visclosky's treasurer.\n       With his reputation harmed by the PMA controversy, \n     Visclosky has temporarily stepped aside from overseeing the \n     energy and water spending bill. He has also given up $18,000 \n     in PMA-related contributions.\n       While this swirl of legal action around companies and \n     lobbyists looks bad for these lawmakers, it's important to \n     point out that none of them have been accused of enriching \n     themselves personally--and that's what brought down lawmakers \n     in other recent cases.\n\n[[Page S7971]]\n\n       The charges against former Reps.

He \n     could face up to 15 years in prison.\n       A nine-page plea agreement that Ianieri signed says the \n     government will urge a lighter prison sentence if he provides \n     substantial assistance ``in the investigation or prosecution \n     of other persons who have committed offenses.''\n       Following Ianieri's plea, Murtha spokesman Matthew Mazonkey \n     said it is not the congressman's job to oversee companies and \n     that ``if they broke the law, then they should be held \n     accountable for their actions.''\n       Murtha, D-Pa., has directed hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in government contracts over the years to Coherent and other \n     defense contractors through a process called earmarking.\n       ``This case isn't about earmarks,'' said Mazonkey. ``It's \n     about individuals within the defense industry and the Defense \n     Department accused of defrauding the government.''\n       Executives at Coherent and two other companies named in \n     court papers in Ianieri's Florida case have donated over \n     $95,000 to Murtha's re-election campaigns and his political \n     action committee since 2002, according to Federal Election \n     Commission records.\n       One of the companies is Kuchera Industries Inc. of Windber, \n     Pa about 10 miles from Murtha's political home base of \n     Johnstown.\n       A felony information filed in Pittsburgh states that \n     Ianieri was given two kickbacks totaling nearly $200,000 from \n     a company identified only as ``K'' for ``improperly obtaining \n     and rewarding favorable treatment'' regarding a defense \n     subcontract.\n       In an April 2006 news release, Murtha announced that \n     Coherent and Kuchera Defense Systems were working ``virtually \n     as one company'' on 14 contracts worth $30 million to develop \n     high-tech military gear.\n       Kuchera's offices were raided by federal agents in January. \n     Kuchera built high-tech military components that Coherent \n     designed.\n       The Florida charges concern a Coherent contract given \n     through the Air Force Research Laboratory to deliver four \n     Ground Mobile Gateway Systems, which are designed to help \n     soldiers and pilots trace U.S. units and cut down on friendly \n     fire.\n       The United States paid Coherent $5.9 million to build the \n     systems. According to federal court papers, Coherent \n     subsequently paid about $1.8 million to subcontractors for \n     the delivery of software and materials that were not part of \n     the contract.\n       Ianieri was charged with presenting purchase orders to the \n     Air Force that he knew were ``false, fictitious and \n     fraudulent,'' court records state.\n       Murtha also has ties to lobbyists for some of the companies \n     under scrutiny. His brother worked from 2004 to 2006 for KSA \n     Consulting, of Rockville, Md., which lobbied for Coherent. \n     Another lobbying firm, PMA Group, represented two of the \n     companies involved in the Florida investigation.\n       Founded by a lobbyist who has long been close to Murtha, \n     PMA and its defense contractor clients have donated over $2 \n     million to Murtha's re-election campaigns and to his \n     political action committee over the years.\n       Ianieri's attorney, W. Thomas Dillard, of Knoxville, Tenn., \n     declined to comment after the hearing. He would not address \n     questions regarding whether Murtha had sponsored an $8.2 \n     million earmark that included the money for Coherent. \n     Murtha's spokesman also has refused to say whether the \n     congressman was the sponsor.\n       Dillard also refused to say whether his client could \n     implicate Murtha or other members of Congress in allegedly \n     illegal conduct.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From The Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2009]\n\n        Despite Listing, Donors Don't Work for Firm Being Probed\n\n                         (By Carol D. Leonnig)\n\n       Marvin Hoffman is listed in campaign finance records as one \n     of the many lobbyists with the powerful PMA Group donating \n     money to lawmakers. But Hoffman is a soon-to-retire \n     information technology manager in Marina del Rey, Calif., who \n     has never heard of the Arlington lobbying firm or the Indiana \n     congressman to whom he supposedly gave $2,000.\n       ``It's alarming that someone is stealing my identity \n     somewhere,'' Hoffman, 75, said in an interview. ``I've never \n     heard of this company.''\n       Another contributor listed as a PMA lobbyist is, in fact, a \n     sales manager for an inflatable boat manufacturer in New \n     Jersey. John Hendricksen said he did make campaign donations \n     but never worked at PMA and does not know how he ended up \n     listed in records that way.\n       These errors, along with other unusual donations linked to \n     the firm, come as the Justice Department examines allegations \n     that PMA may have violated campaign finance laws. The offices \n     of PMA, which ranked last year as the 10th-largest Washington \n     lobbying firm by earnings, were raided in November by FBI \n     agents and Defense Department investigators.\n       Federal investigators are focused on allegations that PMA \n     founder Paul Magliocchetti, a former appropriations staffer \n     close to Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), may have reimbursed \n     some of his staff to cover contributions made in their names \n     to Murtha and other lawmakers, according to two sources \n     familiar with the investigation. PMA has long had a \n     reputation for securing earmarks from congressional \n     appropriators, particularly for defense contractors, and it \n     has donated generously to influential members of Congress. \n     Magliocchetti personally gave $98,000 in campaign donations \n     last year, according to campaign records.\n       Federal election laws limit the amount of money individuals \n     may contribute to candidates, but lobbying firms often show \n     their clout by collecting and bundling contributions. It is \n     illegal for employers to reimburse donors for their \n     contributions.\n       The Washington Post examined contributions that were \n     reported as being made by PMA employees and consultants, and \n     found several people who were not registered lobbyists and \n     did not work at the lobbying firm. It is unclear whether the \n     donors misidentified as PMA associates are part of the \n     federal probe.\n       A PMA spokesman said the firm's management does not know \n     Hoffman or Hendricksen and does not know how the errors were \n     made in reports to the Federal Election Commission.\n       ``It's up to the campaigns to report contributions in their \n     FEC filings,'' said PMA spokesman Patrick Dorton.\n       FEC spokeswoman Mary Brandenberger said she has not often \n     seen such misidentified donations, but if a complaint were \n     received, the commission would first question the campaign \n     about its record-keeping.\n       Jan Witold Baran, a campaign finance and ethics expert and \n     Wiley Rein lawyer, said the errors pose serious questions and \n     should be cleared up.\n       ``It's true that candidate campaigns have the \n     responsibility for disclosure, but the information they \n     obtain usually comes from the contributor or the person who \n     solicited from the contributor,'' Baran said. ``The question \n     is: Where did that information come from?''\n       Murtha aide Matthew Mazonkey said the congressman was not \n     the recipient of the erroneous donations.\n       PMA, founded in 1989 by Magliocchetti, a former Murtha aide \n     to the House Appropriations Committee, has enjoyed a high \n     success rate in winning earmarks for its clients, which \n     include such major defense contractors as Lockheed and \n     General Dynamics. PMA also represents a circle of lesser-\n     known but also successful contractors such as Argon ST, MTS \n     Technologies, DRS Technologies and Advanced Acoustic \n     Concepts. Many PMA clients have opened offices in Murtha's \n     western Pennsylvania district, donated generously to him, and \n     received millions in earmarks requested by the congressman.\n       In the last election cycle, PMA and its clients donated \n     $775,000 to Murtha's campaigns. Last year, those clients \n     received earmarks worth $299 million and arranged by Murtha \n     and his colleagues.\n       The majority of PMA's 35 lobbyists had worked on Capitol \n     Hill or at the Pentagon. Several of the top lobbyists were \n     also PMA directors and had ties to lawmakers.\n       Two men listed in campaign finance reports as together \n     giving $30,000 to lawmakers and being part of the PMA Group \n     team are not Washington lobbyists at all. They live and work \n     in the Florida resort community of Amelia Island, where PMA \n     founder Magliocchetti has a beachfront condominium. Both are \n     listed as directors of PMA.\n       John Pugliese had been a sommelier at the posh Ritz-Carlton \n     Hotel on the island, his family said. Jon C. Walker is in \n     charge of golf marketing at the neighboring Amelia Island \n     Golf Club, according to club personnel and its Web site. They \n     each donated identical amounts to the same lawmakers, in 12 \n     installments each, almost always on the same date.\n       Walker and Pugliese did not return repeated phone calls and \n     messages.\n       Pugliese is listed as a PMA Group ``associate,'' and Walker \n     is a PMA Group ``consultant'' in finance records.\n\n[[Page S7972]]\n\n       Rebecca DeRosa, who is listed as a part-time accountant at \n     PMA and director, recently married Magliocchetti and has \n     given generously on PMA's behalf for several years. Last year \n     alone, she personally gave $73,000 to lawmakers and \n     congressional political action committees, records show. For \n     most of those donations, she is listed as a PMA employee. Her \n     donations included $22,000 to the Democratic Congressional \n     Campaign Committee and $4,250 to Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D-\n     Va.).\n       DeRosa did not answer her phone or return calls to the \n     Gaithersburg office of the DRS subsidiary, where she is \n     listed as an employee.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. So I wish to tell my colleagues, I will be coming to the \nfloor a lot and talking about this, sometimes with charts. This \npractice has to stop. We cannot afford not only the earmarking because \nof the costs, but we can't afford to have the continued corruption that \nis associated with this.\n  I know some of my colleagues are offended when I use the word \n``corruption,'' but when former Members of Congress are residing in \nFederal prison and their aides and former staffers and others are \nindicted and convicted in Federal court, I don't know how you can \ndescribe it as anything else.\n  So we will be talking a lot more in the days and weeks ahead. The \nAmerican people are sick and tired of it and so am I.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an amendment I filed. \nI ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 12 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I appreciate the time to speak about this \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year \n2010 to implement a number of essential reforms to cost comparison \nstudies at the Department of Defense.\n  There is an old expression, principally in the legal community, in \nour system of justice, where they say ``justice delayed is justice \ndenied.'' That theme--not the same concept necessarily--is part of what \nI am talking about. When we are studying how government agencies are \ndelivering services to the taxpayers, sometimes we study too long, and \nespecially in the context of what I am about to speak of. I do thank \nthe cosponsors of this amendment, several Senators, including Senators \nBrown, Schumer, Mikulski, Kennedy, Murray, Gillibrand, and Feingold.\n  The reforms included in the amendment will achieve two very important \ngoals: First, it will save taxpayer dollars, and it will enhance \nprotections for workers across the Department of Defense.\n  I had the great honor to serve the people of Pennsylvania for 8 \nyears--two terms as auditor general of the State--where I was a fiscal \nwatchdog looking after money spent, and I audited and sometimes \ninvestigated how money was spent; then 2 years as State treasurer. So I \nhave a sense of what government studies and reviews entail. Sometimes \nthey take too long and defeat the purpose because of their length. \nSometimes they should be doing their jobs every day instead of \nresponding to an endless study.\n  Some of the language is a little arcane, but when you talk about \ncompetitive sourcing, which is known, as a lot of these things are in \ngovernment--I hate to use acronyms or short phrases--but competitive \nsourcing, in this context, is known as the A-76 process.\n  Here is basically what it is. You don't need to know the numbers. We \nneed to know what we are talking about. It is a government-wide \ninitiative that subjects functions performed by government employees to \npublic-private competition. We are all for competition and always have \nbeen. I believe many of my colleagues know in this context we have some \nreal problems.\n  This privatization process has been marked by controversy at great \ncost to taxpayers. Many workers in the Federal Government bring years \nof experience, dealing with problems and dealing with particular \nprograms; and they also, because of that experience, bring a particular \nkind of expertise and skill to that work. We all know what happened \njust 2 years ago at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. The list could go \non and on, but here are a couple examples: appalling conditions for \nthose who serve our country, and run down facilities and inadequate \ncare for our returning veterans.\n  All of this was uncovered back then, and I know improvements have \nbeen made. Part of the problem rested with a 6-year cost comparison \nreview, which had an impact on the center's staffing. In 2006, the \nGarrison Commander, who was responsible for managing base operation \nsupport activities at Walter Reed, wrote that as a ``direct'' result of \nthe A-76 study, ``we face the critical issues of retaining skilled \nclinical personnel for the hospital and diverse professionals for the \nGarrison, while confronted with increased difficulties in hiring.''\n  Continuing with the quotation, ``Due to the uncertainty associated \nwith this issue,'' meaning the review underway, ``Walter Reed continues \nto lose other highly qualified personnel.''\n  That was then, at the time; he wrote that a few years ago.\n  The point is, even something as grave and serious as the problems we \nexperienced at Walter Reed, part of the reason for that can be traced \nto the problems with these kinds of studies.\n  Despite the heroic efforts by Senator Mikulski from Maryland, the \nstudy continued and the problems persisted at the facility. In 2008, \nGAO conducted reviews of the cost comparison process at the Department \nof Labor and the Forest Service, finding it impossible to verify cost \nsavings. They concluded at that time that the problems with the A-76 \nprocess were systemic.\n  Today, the Department of Defense is the only agency with A-76 studies \nin the process. According to the DOD, there are almost 30 A-76 studies \nstill in process, involving about 3,600 employees. By next month, \nthree-quarters of these studies will be at least 2 years old. A couple \nof examples bring this issue into clear life.\n  Currently, the Defense Logistics Agency is reviewing 279 employees \nwho perform installation management services in my home State of \nPennsylvania and also in Virginia and Ohio. Prior to the study, this \nmanagement of this agency said the A-76 study would be disruptive and \nrecommended an internal effort instead, believing it would lead to \ngreater savings. However, as is the common practice, the savings for \nthis study have already been counted, and the people who ran the A-76 \nprogram refused the request from the agency management to scrap the \nstudy, as they should have. If it is not saving money and helping the \ntaxpayers, it should be scrapped. Therefore, 279 employees, some of \nwhom work in Pennsylvania, are uncertain of their future and have been \nforced to put off major life decisions.\n  A similar situation is ongoing at West Point, where two studies \ncontinue despite requests to terminate them. These decisions to proceed \nwith studies in the face of unyielding and reasonable opposition and \nalternatives are indeed troubling.\n  The amendment before the Senate addresses these issues in a number of \nways.\n  First, the amendment establishes a Department of Defense-specific, 1-\nyear suspension of new A-76 studies, consistent with the government-\nwide suspension included by Senator Durbin in the financial services \nappropriations bill.\n  Secondly, my amendment closes the loophole that currently allows \ncertain DOD functions to be given to contractors by converting smaller \nfunctions to contractors without conducting any cost comparisons.\n  Third, our amendment establishes a 24-month time limit for how long \nstudies can last--from the beginning of preliminary planning to the \nfinal award decision. Currently, there are no established time limits \non A-76 studies, which only increases the costs.\n  Fourth, the amendment addresses issues pending with A-76 studies and \ndirects DOD to suspend these studies and determine, based on several \ncriteria, whether their completion is justifiable.\n  Fifth, the amendment improves the process for workers by adding \nbriefings\n\n[[Page S7973]]\n\nto affected employees about contracting out decisions.\n  Finally, the amendment makes technical corrections to ensure that \nFederal employees have bid protest rights, building on previous efforts \nby Members of the Senate.\n  The A-76 process is about cost comparison. Due to the ambiguity \naround the timelines and the process, these lengthy studies often fail \nto create promised long-term savings.\n  This amendment addresses these lingering issues with A-76 studies by \nlending necessary clarity to the process. In addition, these reforms \nwill improve conditions for workers. Lengthy studies have been shown to \ncompromise the capacity of agencies to perform their missions by \nplacing both the critical functions of the agency and employees who \nperform these functions in limbo.\n  Finally, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment for this \nreason: It will promote fiscal responsibility, save money for \ntaxpayers, while ensuring those who have the experience, expertise, and \nskill are able to carry out their tasks in the Department of Defense.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Burr \nbe recognized next to offer an amendment. I understand there is not \ngoing to be opposition on this side and that he will accept a voice \nvote on it.

Mr. President, this is a very simple amendment. Under \ncurrent law, our military men and women, about every 3 years, are \nrepositioned in the country or out of the country. Their orders change. \nWhen they make that change, it is beneficial to them, and I believe to \nsociety, that their spouses and children go with them.\n  Years ago, we made accommodations for those military personnel so \nthey could pick a State of residency, even though they moved \nfrequently. They could choose the State in which they grew up or the \nState they might retire in or a State they had visited during their \nassignments that they thought was the best or most advantageous place \nfor them to claim residency. That provided that every State they went \nto, they didn't have to change their driver's license or voter \nregistration or basically change everything in their lives.\n  Now with the size of our military and the constant deployments we are \nin--this continuation of every 3 years, getting reassigned to a \ndifferent post--what we realized from a quality-of-life standpoint was \nthat we forgot about the spouses as it relates to the accommodations of \na new surrounding. When we think about it, spouses who leave and go \nwith the servicemember, they go into a community unemployed. They have \nto look for a job. They have to go to the DMV, the department of motor \nvehicles, and get a driver's license and reregister to vote. I might \nalso say their husband or wife could claim residency somewhere, and \nthey may not be on the title of the house they own or the property they \nown.\n  The fact that the spouse cannot claim a State of residency consistent \nwith the servicemember means they are at a tremendous disadvantage from \nthe standpoint of what they own. It is easier to put it in the \nservicemember's name because they are protected regardless of where \ntheir orders send them.\n\n[[Page S7974]]\n\n  Very simply, this amendment extends the same privilege to a spouse \nthat it does to a servicemember, so they can claim that State of \nresidency, keep that one constant driver's license, and they can pay \njoint taxes in a State versus being forced to file separate taxes where \nthere may be tax implications so that those military families pay more \ntaxes than if they could file jointly. They still have the challenge of \nwalking into a community unemployed, and they might leave a business \nbehind because they believe the fabric of their family is that \nimportant.\n  That is what we ask all of our military families to deal with. This \nis a simple way to make life a little easier on the spouses of our \nservicemembers and to make sure they don't have to change everything in \ntheir lives just because their spouse has been reassigned but only \ncertain things that they will have to deal with.\n  I remind my colleagues there is a stand-alone bill, S. 475. It had a \nhearing in the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It was passed unanimously \nout of the Veterans' Affairs Committee. It is identical to my amendment \ntoday.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. With the Chair's \nagreement, I ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1554.\n  The amendment (No. 1554) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I understand under the previous order, the \nSenator from Hawaii is now to be recognized to call up his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1522\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending amendment \nand call up amendment No. 1522 to enhance the retirement security of \nFederal employees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Hawaii [Mr. Akaka], for himself, Ms. \n     Collins, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. \n     Begich, Mr. Kohl, Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. \n     Webb, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment numbered 1522.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as chairman of the Subcommittee on \nOversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the \nDistrict of Columbia, I am proud to join with Senators Collins, \nLieberman, Voinovich, Murkowski, Begich, Kohl, Mikulski, Cardin, \nInouye, Webb, and Warner in this bipartisan effort to correct certain \ninequities in the Federal Government retirement system.\n  This amendment is very similar to an amendment that was included in \nthe House-passed fiscal year 2010 national Defense authorization bill. \nEach of these revisions is much needed and has been thoroughly debated \nby the appropriate committees in the House and Senate. Many of the \nchanges were requested by the administrators of the retirement plans \nand are strongly supported by many organizations. The list of \nsupporters is too long to read here, but it includes every major \nFederal employee union, postal unions, supervisors, and postmasters, \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and several \ngovernment managers groups. I spoke in more detail last evening about \nthe substance of the amendment.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, the \nFederal retirement reform provisions, and the bill as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment by Senator Akaka, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, I would \nimagine has some very good and helpful provisions associated with it. \nIt also applies to Federal employees and perhaps some Department of \nDefense employees are included in that. But it is a very large \namendment. It is composed of six retirement-related provisions and some \nexpenditure of funds.\n  As I understand the bill, there is not provision for paying for it. I \nmay be wrong. Let me point out that the Chair and ranking member of the \nHomeland Security Committee have looked at these issues as well. I am \nwondering why it was not included then on Homeland Security. We just \nfinished doing the Homeland Security appropriations.\n  It would reduce mandatory spending by $36 billion over 10 years. It \nhas significant costs that will have to be appropriated, at least $2.5 \nbillion over the next 10 years. Because they would be added on this \nbill, it would add to the cost of the National Defense Authorization \nAct and would exceed our budget allocation. Properly, it would be \nsubject to a budget point of order which the Senate would then speak on \nwhether it is an appropriate budget point of order.\n  There has been no strong opposition from the administration, and \nthese costs were not included in the administration's budget request.\n  I understand that a lot of these provisions, because of the large \nnumber of employees, fall under the Department of Defense. I don't \nthink it is a good idea to have a bill of this magnitude, although \ncertainly the amendment is in order--but I am not sure it is \nappropriate that a bill of this magnitude should be tacked on to the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  I say that fully aware that we are tacking on a hate crimes bill \nwhich has even a lot less to do with the Department of Defense.\n  I say to my friend, I will be glad to have a vote on this amendment. \nPerhaps there is going to be a budget point of order raised on this \namendment. But hopefully we can alert our colleagues and give them the \nopportunity in the next few minutes to raise a budget point of order or \nask for a recorded vote. If there is no objection, then we would have a \nvoice vote.\n  I wish to point out to my colleagues, this is fairly large \nlegislation which does fall under the proper authority of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, may I further comment that these \nprovisions, without question, are much needed in Hawaii, Alaska, and \nthe territories. COLA rates, and with them the pay of Federal \nemployees, are slated to go down later this year if we do not act. This \nis the reason we are trying to move it at this time. Most of these \nemployees in Hawaii are defense employees, as in these other States and \nterritories as well.\n  The provisions on this issue are nearly identical to the bill that \npassed the Senate by unanimous consent last year. Most of the \nprovisions are in the House Defense authorization bill.\n  Again, Hawaii, Alaska, and the territories received untaxed cost-of-\nliving allowances that do not count toward retirement instead of \nlocality pay that other Federal employees receive.\n  This bill grew out of a Bush administration proposal in response to \nrepeated litigation over the different systems. This transition will \ncost a substantial amount of money for several reasons. The budget \nimplications are better than they appear. A large portion of \nappropriated costs of the COLA provisions are intergovernmental \ntransfers from Federal employers to either the annuity or the Social \nSecurity trust fund. According to the CBO report, employer \ncontributions, intragovernmental transactions, do not affect the \ndeficit.\n  Many employees in Hawaii and Alaska and the territories, of course, \nare looking at this as something that is necessary as they continue to \nwork in the Federal Government in this area.\n  Again, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n\n[[Page S7975]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we set \naside consideration of the Burr amendment and that I be able to call up \namendment No. 1657.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object--and I will need to object--\nwe are working through unanimous consent agreements and amendments are \nlined up on both sides. We have not reached that point yet. There are \nother amendments that have to come first from the Senator's side, and \nthat would be up to Senator McCain. I have to object at this time. \nObviously, we will try to accommodate the Senator getting his amendment \nup, but Senator McCain would need to consider the Senator's proposal. I \nhave to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I understand the difficulties Senator \nLevin has, but we are moving to final passage. Cloture has been filed. \nIt is important that this amendment be considered. I get a little \nnervous when things are not moving along in a way that I think they \nshould or at least in a way that could cause this amendment not to be \nconsidered. I wish to speak briefly about it so it will be clear what \nit is we are talking about.\n  The amendment I sought to bring up would preempt any Federal \nExecutive, that is Presidential, requirement that our troops in the \nfield, in Afghanistan and Iraq, read Miranda warnings to al-Qaida \nterrorists whom they capture.\n  The amendment would also clarify that nothing in Federal law requires \nthat our soldiers read Miranda warnings or give any other kind of \nwarning to captured terrorists, and it preempts any efforts to enforce \nsuch a requirement through an exclusionary rule. That is, denying \nadmissibility of evidence if it does not occur.\n  Miranda is the warning, as most watchers of television detective \nprograms know, in which an individual who is detained by a police \nofficer in the United States on suspicion of some crime is told they \nhave a right to remain silent and they have a right to have a lawyer, \nor have one appointed for them.\n  The question is, How did we get to the point that we are now having \nsoldiers in the field being asked to give Miranda warnings?\n  One person, I think, who would agree with me--although recent \nactivities cause me concern--is our Commander in Chief, President \nObama. In a recent interview on the TV show ``60 Minutes,'' he was \nasked about the terrorist detainees, and this is what President Obama \nsaid:\n\n       Do these folks deserve Miranda rights? Do they deserve to \n     be treated like a shoplifter down the block? Of course not.\n\n  ``Of course not.'' I couldn't have said that with more clarity \nmyself. Of course, we should not be giving Miranda warnings to captured \nterrorists on the battlefield. Unfortunately, not all of the \nsubordinates in the current administration seem to understand this \nmessage.\n  A recent article in the magazine the Weekly Standard describes why \nthe amendment is necessary. As this article explains, the current \nadministration appears to be requiring our soldiers to read Miranda \nwarnings to terrorists whom they capture in the field in Afghanistan. \nAnd the article further notes, according to former CIA Director George \nTenet, who was appointed originally by President Clinton and served \nunder President Bush, that we would not have obtained the valuable \ninformation we did from Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the planner of the 9/11 \nattacks, if he had been given his Miranda rights--or been given Miranda \nrights, not his, because we have never given Miranda rights to captured \nsoldiers in any kind of conflict in the history of the Republic.\n\n  The following is from the Weekly Standard:\n\n       When 9/11 mastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was captured on \n     March 1, 2003, he was not cooperative. ``I'll talk to you \n     guys after I get to New York and see my lawyer,'' he said, \n     according to CIA Director George Tenet. Of course, Khalid \n     Shaikh Mohammed did not get a lawyer until months later, \n     after his interrogation was completed, and Tenet says that \n     the information the CIA obtained from him disrupted plots and \n     saved lives. ``I believe none of these successes would have \n     happened if we had had to treat KSM like a white-collar \n     criminal--read him his Miranda rights and get him a lawyer, \n     who surely would have insisted that his client simply shut \n     up.\n\n  That was Mr. Tenet's view as stated in his memoirs just a couple of \nyears ago.\n  If Mr. Tenet is right, it is a good thing KSM was captured before \nPresident Obama became President, for the Justice Department has \nquietly ordered the FBI to read Miranda rights to high-value detainees \ncaptured and held at U.S. detention facilities in Afghanistan.\n  According to a senior Republican on the House Intelligence Committee:\n\n       The administration has decided to change the focus to law \n     enforcement. Here's the problem. You have foreign fighters \n     who are targeting U.S. troops today--foreign fighters who go \n     to another country to kill Americans. We capture them, and \n     they're reading them their rights--Mirandizing these foreign \n     fighters.\n\n  That was a quote from Representative Mike Rogers, who recently met \nwith the military and intelligence and law enforcement officials on a \nfactfinding trip to Afghanistan.\n  Rogers, a former FBI special agent and a U.S. Army officer, says the \nObama administration has not briefed Congress on the new policy. He is \nquoted as saying:\n\n       I was a little surprised to find it taking place when I \n     showed up because we hadn't been briefed on it. I didn't know \n     about it. We're still trying to get to the bottom of it, but \n     it is clearly a part of this new global justice initiative.\n\n  Representative Pete Hoekstra, the ranking Republican on the House \nIntelligence Committee, said this:\n\n       When they Mirandize a suspect, the first thing they do is \n     warn them that they have the right to remain silent. It would \n     seem the last thing we want is Khalid Shaikh Mohammed or any \n     other al-Qaida terrorist to remain silent. Our focus should \n     be on preventing the next attack, not giving radical \n     jihadists a new tactic to resist interrogation--lawyering up.\n\n  According to Mike Rogers, that is precisely what some human rights \norganizations are now advising detainees to do. He says:\n\n       The International Red Cross, when they go into these \n     detention facilities, has now started telling people--``Take \n     the option. You want a lawyer.''\n\n  And Rogers adds:\n\n       The problem is you take that guy at 3 in the morning off of \n     a compound right outside of Kabul, where he's building bomb \n     materials to kill U.S. soldiers, and read him his rights by \n     4, and the Red Cross is saying take the lawyer, you have now \n     created quite a confusion amongst the FBI, the CIA and the \n     United States military. And confusion is the last thing you \n     want in a combat zone.\n\n  This is from Congressman Rogers, a former FBI agent and a former Army \nofficer.\n  So one thing is clear: A detainee who is not talking cannot provide \ninformation about future attacks. Had Khalid Shaikh Mohammed had a \nlawyer, Tenet wrote in his book, `` . . . I am confident that we would \nhave obtained none of the information he had in his head about the \neminent threat against the American people.''\n  Mr. President, one thing we have to get straight in our minds is that \nwe are in a state of war against al-Qaida types and others around the \nworld, and that calls for an entirely different approach to dealing \nwith the people you capture. In fact, before you capture them, you have \nthe authority to shoot them and kill them. We have the ability to drop \nbombs on them, which results in death. You don't do that in law \nenforcement situations against drug dealers or against white-collar \ncriminals. These are not criminals, they are unlawful enemy combatants. \nThey are not lawful because they do not operate according to the rules \nof war.\n  The Geneva Conventions require that a lawful combatant, an enemy \nsoldier, or any kind of soldier from any country wear their uniform so \nthat you can identify them by their uniform and do not target civilian \npersonnel gratuitously. Among other requirements, these are some of the \nrules of war. But they have never been given the rights of a common \ncriminal.\n  So I feel strongly about this issue. And I would note parenthetically \nthat the Supreme Court has not held that Miranda is even a \nconstitutional requirement. They passed it as a prophylactic policy to \nhelp police officers do a better job, the Court thought, in doing their \nwork. It is not a requirement. So\n\n[[Page S7976]]\n\nit is a big mistake. I believe it is a road we should not go down, \nrequiring these warnings, and if we do, it is an absolutely clear \nsignal that we are confused about the nature of the deadly enterprise \nin which we are engaged, which is defending this country and our allies \nfrom attack by a violent, determined enemy.\n  I thought after 9/11 there was a consensus in this body that \nterrorists and enemy combatants were different from criminals. I \nthought the 9/11 Commission went into that, and I thought there was a \nbipartisan consensus on that. So I am concerned about it. It suggests \nto me that we are confused about the nature of this life-and-death \nstruggle we are in. We are confused about the risk our soldiers are \nbeing subjected to every day on the battlefield. And they ought not to \nbe placed in a situation where an additional burden is put on them that \nis not justified by law or common sense.\n  So I hope we get a vote on this, and I hope we are able to send the \nmessage that this is not the right policy and we need to make sure we \nstop it and nip it in the bud.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, if I could just have Senator McCain's \nattention for a minute, I think we have a unanimous consent agreement.\n  Mr. President, has the Akaka amendment been disposed of?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It has not.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Akaka amendment be \ntemporarily set aside, that we then move to an amendment on European \nmissile defense, which is a Lieberman amendment with many cosponsors, \nwhich we have worked very hard on and which is ready to be propounded.\n  There is at least one additional speaker on it. Senator Sessions \nwants to speak on it as well. But I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nLieberman be recognized now to introduce that amendment; that after he \nspeaks, Senator Sessions be recognized; that I will then be recognized, \nand then Senator McCain, if he wishes to be recognized.\n  I believe the intention here is that we may be able to adopt this by \na voice vote; is that correct? That is the hope, anyway. Well, I will \nleave that part alone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1744\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 1744.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself, \n     Mr. Sessions, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Vitter, Mr. Nelson of Nebraska, \n     Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Martinez, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Begich, and \n     Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 1744.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate on and reserve funds for \n  the development and deployment of missile defense systems to Europe)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 245. SENSE OF SENATE ON AND RESERVATION OF FUNDS FOR \n                   DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE \n                   SYSTEMS IN EUROPE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     Bucharest Summit Declaration of April 3, 2008, the Heads of \n     State and Government participating in the meeting of the \n     North Atlantic Council declared that ``[b]allistic missile \n     proliferation poses an increasing threat to Allies' forces, \n     territory and populations. Missile defence forms part of a \n     broader response to counter this threat. We therefore \n     recognize the substantial contribution to the protection of \n     Allies from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by \n     the planned deployment of European-based United States \n     missile defence assets''.\n       (2) The Bucharest Summit Declaration also stated that \n     ``[b]earing in mind the principle of the indivisibility of \n     Allied security as well as NATO solidarity, we task the \n     Council in Permanent Session to develop options for a \n     comprehensive missile defence architecture to extend coverage \n     to all Allied territory and populations not otherwise covered \n     by the United States system for review at our 2009 Summit, to \n     inform any future political decision''.\n       (3) In the Bucharest Summit Declaration, the North Atlantic \n     Council also reaffirmed to Russia that ``current, as well as \n     any future, NATO Missile Defence efforts are intended to \n     better address the security challenges we all face, and \n     reiterate that, far from posing a threat to our relationship, \n     they offer opportunities to deepen levels of cooperation and \n     stability''.\n       (4) In the Strasbourg/Kehl Summit Declaration of April 4, \n     2009, the heads of state and government participating in the \n     meeting of the North Atlantic Council reaffirmed ``the \n     conclusions of the Bucharest Summit about missile defense,'' \n     and declared that ``we judge that missile threats should be \n     addressed in a prioritized manner that includes consideration \n     of the level of imminence of the threat and the level of \n     acceptable risk''.\n       (5) Iran is rapidly developing its ballistic missile \n     capabilities, including its inventory of short-range and \n     medium-range ballistic missiles that can strike portions of \n     Eastern and Southern North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     European territory, as well as the pursuit of long-range \n     ballistic missiles that could reach Europe or the United \n     States.\n       (6) On July 8, 2008, the Government of the United States \n     and the Government of the Czech Republic signed an agreement \n     to base a radar facility in the Czech Republic that is part \n     of a proposed missile defense system to protect Europe and \n     the United States against a potential future Iranian long-\n     range ballistic missile threat.\n       (7) On August 20, 2008, the United States and the Republic \n     of Poland signed an agreement concerning the deployment of \n     ground-based ballistic missile defense interceptors in the \n     territory of the Republic of Poland.\n       (8) Section 233 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417; \n     122 Stat. 4393; 10 U.S.C. 2431 note) establishes conditions \n     for the availability of funds for procurement, construction, \n     and deployment of the planned missile defense system in \n     Europe, including that the host nations must ratify any \n     missile defense agreements with the United States and that \n     the Secretary of Defense must certify that the system has \n     demonstrated the ability to accomplish the mission.\n       (9) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama, speaking in \n     Prague, Czech Republic, stated, ``As long as the threat from \n     Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense \n     system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian \n     threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for \n     security, and the driving force for missile defense \n     construction in Europe will be removed.''.\n       (10) On June 16, 2009, Deputy Secretary of Defense William \n     Lynn testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate that the United States Government is reviewing its \n     options for developing and deploying operationally effective, \n     cost-effective missile defense capabilities to Europe against \n     potential future Iranian missile threats, in addition to the \n     proposed deployment of a missile defense system in Poland and \n     the Czech Republic.\n       (11) On July 9, 2009, General James Cartwright, the Vice \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that the Department \n     of Defense was considering some 40 different missile defense \n     architecture options for Europe that could provide a \n     ``regional defense capability to protect the nations'' of \n     Europe, and a ``redundant capability that would assist in \n     protecting the United States,'' and that the Department was \n     considering ``what kind of an architecture best suits the \n     defense of the region, the defense of the homeland, and the \n     regional stability''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should continue developing \n     and planning for the proposed deployment of elements of a \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, including a \n     midcourse radar in the Czech Republic and Ground-Based \n     Interceptors in Poland, consistent with section 233 of the \n     Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2009;\n       (2) in conjunction with the continued development of the \n     planned Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, the United \n     States should work with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies to explore a range of options and \n     architectures to provide missile defenses for Europe and the \n     United States against current and future Iranian ballistic \n     missile capabilities;\n       (3) any alternative system that the United States \n     Government considers deploying in Europe to provide for the \n     defense of Europe and a redundant defense of the United \n     States against future long-range Iranian missile threats \n     should be at least as capable and cost-effective as the \n     proposed European deployment of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system; and\n\n[[Page S7977]]\n\n       (4) any missile defense capabilities deployed in Europe \n     should, to the extent practical, be interoperable with United \n     States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense \n     systems.\n       (c) Reservation of Funds for Missile Defense Systems.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated \n     or otherwise made available for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 \n     for the Missile Defense Agency for the purpose of developing \n     missile defenses in Europe, $353,100,000 shall be available \n     only for the purposes described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Use of funds.--The purposes described in this paragraph \n     are the following:\n       (A) Research, development, test, and evaluation of--\n       (i) the proposed midcourse radar element of the Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense system in the Czech Republic;

Mr. President, may I ask Senator Lieberman to yield for a \nmoment?\n  First of all, I ask unanimous consent that no second-degree \namendments be in order to this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair, and I thank the chairman of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. President, I rise to offer this amendment, along with the Senator \nfrom Alabama, Mr. Sessions, and a broad bipartisan group of cosponsors. \nThis amendment concerns the deployment of missile defenses in Europe.\n  I am very pleased to say, as Chairman Levin suggested, that there has \nbeen a lot of work done on this issue by a lot of people, including \nChairman Levin, Ranking Member McCain, their staff, and our staff. I \nthink we have reached a very important agreement here which holds up \nsome standards of what is most important to our national security \nregarding the deployment of missile defenses to Europe.\n\n  If I may, the administration, as we know, is now evaluating \nalternatives to the planned European deployment of a Ground-based \nMidcourse Defense, or GMD, system to Poland and the Czech Republic. In \nthe context of that policy review, this amendment states that any \nalternative to the GMD deployment to Poland and the Czech Republic must \nbe as effective and affordable as the current plan. We think this is a \nreasonable standard by which to judge any alternative and I am hopeful \nand grateful my colleagues seem to agree.\n  Let me now go forward to explain why Senator Sessions and I and \nothers think it is so important to set a standard for the alternatives \nthat are now under consideration, and why the growing Iranian threat \nrequires us to deploy an effective missile defense in Europe.\n  Last year the United States reached a pair of groundbreaking \nagreements with two of our closest European allies on the deployment of \nelements of a Ground-based Midcourse Defense, GMD, system to protect \nEurope and the United States from Iran's growing ballistic missile \nthreat.\n  When I say ``and the United States,'' they don't have the ability \nnow, or the ballistic missile, to reach the United States, but they are \nclearly investing in a ballistic missile program whose range they hope \nwill grow and grow to a point where they will be able to reach the \nUnited States.\n  Specifically, on July 8, 2008, the United States and the Czech \nRepublic agreed on establishing an American ballistic missile defense \nradar site on Czech territory. Two months later, on August 20, the \nUnited States and the Government of Poland reached a similar agreement \nunder which we would deploy 10 ground-based interceptors to Poland. \nJust less than a year after these agreements, at a June 16 hearing at \nour Senate Armed Services Committee, Deputy Secretary of Defense Bill \nLynn told the members of the committee:\n\n       We think there are a number of ways to address [the \n     Iranian] threat and one of the options is to deploy the \n     missiles in Poland and the radar in the Czech Republic, and \n     we are certainly evaluating that option as well as other \n     possible options.\n\n  We heard other testimony before our committee, including from the \nVice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General Cartwright, along the same \nlines, that though the agreements were entered into with Poland and the \nCzech Republic, the administration is evaluating other options.\n  To help place the other options that are under consideration into \nperspective, and to explain why Senator Sessions and I and the others \nwho have joined us as cosponsors introduce this amendment today, I want \nto go to a Congressional Budget Office study that was released earlier \nthis year, in February. It is titled ``Options for Deploying Missile \nDefenses in Europe.'' This study was requested by then-Congresswoman \nEllen Tauscher, in her capacity as Chair of the House Armed Services \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee. It examined the potential cost and \ndefense capability of the European ground-based defense system in \nPoland and the Czech Republic, as well as alternatives to it.\n  What are the alternatives? These include deployment of sea-based \ninterceptors on Navy ships around Europe, or using mobile land-based \ninterceptors in Europe. The study also considered the possible benefits \nof closer cooperation on missile defense with the Russian Federation.\n  The findings of this report clearly demonstrate that the Ground-based \nMidcourse Deployment in Poland and the Czech Republic is the most \neffective and affordable option that is before us today. I am \nparticularly struck by the report's conclusion that the alternatives to \nthe GMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic would significantly \nreduce America's ability to provide a layered defense for our American \nhomeland against the eventual threat of intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles launched by Iran or anyone else in that region against the \nUnited States of America.\n  I want to be clear about this and what it means. Whereas the GMD \ndeployment to Poland and the Czech Republic would provide, according to \nthe report, a so-called shoot-look-shoot capability for the defense of \nthe entire continental United States, the alternatives that the \nCongressional Budget Office considered would leave most of our country \nwithout such a layered defense.\n  Let me explain. Shoot-look-shoot is an operational concept that is \nactually the cornerstone of our increasingly successful missile defense \nprogram. It is the idea that we should be able to shoot at an incoming \nmissile, assess whether that shot was successful, and then shoot again. \nThis shoot-look-shoot capability dramatically increases the \neffectiveness of our missile defense system.\n  You might say it is redundant. Most of our military systems are \nredundant because of what is on the line. I cannot think of a place \nwhere I would rather have redundancy than the situation we are dealing \nwith, with an incoming ballistic missile, presumably containing a \nnuclear weapon, perhaps chemical or biological. I know people watching \nthis debate may think this is far off and unrealistic, but these are \nthe realities we do have to deal with in our world because we know a \ncountry such as Iran, whose leaders regularly lead tens of thousands of \ntheir citizens in shouting ``death to America'' is in fact investing in \na growing intercontinental ballistic missile system.\n  What does shoot-look-shoot mean with regard to this amendment? If you \nhave a GMD system in Europe and a missile that is fired from Iran, we \nhave\n\n[[Page S7978]]\n\na first opportunity to take a shot at that missile. We then obviously \nhave a chance to look and see whether we hit it. If we did not, we have \na second opportunity utilizing the ground-based missile defense system \nthat we have now installed in California and Alaska. That is an \nimportant redundancy in the God-awful circumstance that a rogue nation, \nan anti-American nation, is actually firing missiles at the United \nStates.\n  I want to draw the attention of my colleagues to a pair of maps that \nI think indicate the differences as CBO found them between the planned \nGMD system in Poland and the Czech Republic and the proposed land-based \nSM-3 block IIA system that I think is a favored alternative--a possible \nalternative--I don't mean it is selected, but one looked at with great \ninterest by the Defense Department.\n  Incidentally, these maps were prepared by the Congressional Budget \nOffice and included in the study I just mentioned, which I would \ncommend to my colleagues to read in full.\n  On the first map here we can see the planned GMD system in Poland and \nthe Czech Republic would provide a layered defense for the entire \ncontinental United States. In other words, this is the area that would \nbe defended. Most of Europe, if a missile were fired from Iran, and all \nof the United States would be covered. That means the concept of shoot-\nlook-and-shoot would be in effect a defense for our entire population.\n  The second map shows the capabilities of a prospective land-based SM-\n3 IIA block system, which is quite different. You can see that this \none, as the CBO estimated, only covers a portion of the United States. \nI note it does cover Connecticut, but there is a lot of the rest of the \nUnited States--even though there are those of us who love this small \nState--a lot of the rest of the United States we do not want to leave \nunprotected by this redundancy.\n  In fact, on a population basis, because there is a concentration of \npopulation, of course, on the east coast, almost 80 percent of the \npopulation would be left uncovered by this redundant defense. All \nStates west of the Mississippi, for example, would not be defended by \nthis system.\n  In terms of operational capability, it is also important to note that \nthe components of the proposed GMD system for Europe are much farther \nalong in their development and purchase closer to being proven to work \nthan the proposed SM-3 Block IIA interceptor, which may not be \navailable until close to 2020. So the consequences of pulling away from \nthe Poland and Czech Republic system are serious in the near term.\n  As for the question of cost, the Congressional Budget Office in this \nstudy estimates that the two alternate systems would cost nearly the \nsame to develop, deploy, and operate. In other words, if we opt for an \nalternative to ground missile defense, CBO will be telling us we will \nbe paying the same amount of money but for a less capable defense and a \ndramatically less comprehensive coverage of the population and \nterritory of the United States.\n\n  Another question under consideration, I know by the administration, \nis the possibility--and was with the last administration, too--the \npossibility of partnership between the United States and Russia through \nthe joint use of two Russian radar stations, as well as the sharing of \ninformation and data. I support very much the exploration of this \nopportunity of cooperating with Russians on missile defense, but I \nbelieve we have to have a clear understanding of its potential benefits \nand limitations.\n  Let me begin with some of the benefits. Obviously, closer cooperation \nwith Russia on missile defense could increase our early warning \ndetection capability for missile launches from the Middle East, based \non their radar. With this capability we could send a clear message to \nIran that not just the United States but the world, including Russia, \nis opposed to its weapons of mass destruction and intercontinental or \ncontinental ballistic missile systems. So I support the objective of \nnegotiating and discussing this with the Russians.\n  But I want to say there are also limitations that are in this \nproposal. The Russian radar stations that are most discussed as part of \na joint United States-Russian ballistic missile system as a technical \nmatter cannot be a substitute for a European-based GMD system. Although \nthese radars would give us additional early warning capabilities, as I \nindicated, they would not provide any additional targeting capability \nwhich, of course, is a critical component to reducing threats. Radar \nhelps to target, sends the message to the interceptors in Poland and to \nthe other system, and that facilitates an accurate shoot-down.\n  As the CBO pointed out in its February report, the radars face south \nand any missiles facing south and any missiles targeted toward Europe \nand the United States would, according to the report, ``tend to fly \nthrough and out of the Russian radar's field of regard very early in \ntheir trajectories.'' Though this system would provide us with early \nwarning, it is also very important, really critical, to have targeting \ncapability.\n  The amendment Senator Sessions and I and the others have proposed \nwould not in any way prohibit the possibility of cooperation, or even \ndeter the possibility of cooperation with the Russian Federation--\ncertainly not with regard to sharing radar data, and I hope we can all \nagree we should not seek an agreement with Moscow that leaves the \nUnited States more vulnerable to the threat from Iran.\n  Very briefly, what about that threat? Some may ask, Why do we still \nneed to be investing so much in missile defense? The answer, simply \nput, is because our most unpredictable and irresponsible adversaries, \nin particular rogue states such as Iran and North Korea, are investing \nvery aggressively in ballistic missiles. That is why we need ballistic \nmissile defense. The investments we make in missile defense will quite \nliterally provide greater personal security to the coming generations \nof Americans, our children and their grandchildren and beyond. As LTG \nMike Maples, then Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, \ntestified before our Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year:\n\n       The threat posed by ballistic missile delivery systems is \n     likely to increase over the next decade. Ballistic missile \n     defenses with advanced liquid or solid propellant propulsion \n     systems are becoming more mobile, survivable, reliable, \n     accurate, and possess greater range.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from the former head of the Defense \nIntelligence Agency.\n  In the last few months we have seen graphic reminders of the progress \nour enemies are making toward fielding intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles. In February, Iran launched its first satellite into orbit \nusing the same technologies that Tehran can draw upon to develop the \ncapacity to build an intercontinental ballistic missile that could \nstrike the continental United States.\n  In May, Iran carried out its first successful test flight of a two-\nstage solid fuel ballistic missile, a development that the White House \nCoordinator for Arms Control and WMD Terrorism, Gary Seymour, warned \nwas ``a significant step forward in terms of Iran's capability to \ndevelop weapons.''\n  Iran's growing ballistic capabilities are made, of course, even more \nthreatening when coupled with its nuclear weapons development program. \nOf course, we all hope the United States and the rest of the \ninternational community can persuade Iran, through diplomacy and \neconomic sanctions, to abandon both its nuclear and ballistic ambitions \nand programs.\n  Missile defense is an important component of that effort on the \npremise that we may be able to convince Iran it is not worth spending \nthose countless millions of dollars on perfecting these weapons if its \nleaders come to realize that we in the West are determined to stay one \nstep ahead of them in neutralizing their strategic impact with a \nmissile defense system.\n  As the Department of Defense now undertakes its review of the planned \nGMD deployment to Europe and possible alternatives, this amendment \nwould express the Senate's opinion of what we expect our missile \ndefenses in Europe to deliver, generally.\n  It would state that the United States expects those missile defenses \nto be the most capable and affordable and give a defense in the short \nterm, not just to our allies in Europe but to our fellow citizens \nthroughout the United States of America.\n\n[[Page S7979]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to join my colleague, Senator \nLieberman, in introducing amendment No. 1744, concerning the deployment \nof missile defenses in Europe, and also thank him for his leadership on \nthis issue over many years. He is clearly one of the most effective \nspokesmen for clear and strategic thinking and has helped us for many \nyears to establish good defense policy for our Nation.\n  As Senator Lieberman has explained, this amendment would state it is \nthe sense of the Congress that the administration should continue to \ndevelop the planned missile defense deployment through Poland and the \nCzech Republic, even as it considers other alternatives.\n  Further, it would state that any alternative to the current plan must \nbe as effective and affordable, and, most important, must be able to \ndefend the United States as well as Europe against long-range ballistic \nmissiles.\n  This amendment is important at this time because the administration \nis now considering alternatives to the plan long pursued by the Bush \nadministration to station ground-based interceptors in Poland, a \nmissile-tracking radar system in the Czech Republic. Both Poland and \nthe Czech Republic have signed agreements to host these missile defense \nassets after being told by the United States that we believed the plan \nis important to protect Europe and the United States from rogue states, \nmore specifically, Iran's developing missile capability.\n  After much effort and political capital has been expended, both in \nthe United States and by our Polish and Czech Republic allies and \nfriends, now the project has been put in somewhat of a limbo, I am \nafraid.\n  Russia and the domestic left opposed this plan from the beginning. \nThey lobbied the people and members of Congress in Poland and the Czech \nRepublic to not do it. But they have gone forward with it today. If the \nobjections of the United States to this system arise from Czech \nreasons, then I would refer my colleagues to a February 2009 CBO study \nSenator Lieberman cited, ``Options for Deploying Missile Defense in \nEurope,'' which came to the conclusion that a ground-based interceptor \ndeployment in Poland and the Czech Republic is the most effective and \naffordable option available for the foreseeable future.\n  The CBO concluded: ``This is the most effective and affordable option \nfor the foreseeable future.''\n  Other options apparently now under consideration include the \ndeployment of a land- or sea-based version of the Standard Missile 3, \nSM-3 which is now deployed on Aegis ships of the United States.\n  The CBO found that this option, the SM-3, will not available until \nlate in the next decade, is no less expensive than the GBI option and \ndoes not provide protection for the United States against long-range \nIranian missiles. In other words, while the deployment of a land- or \nsea-based version of SM-3 may be suitable to protect Europe against \nmedium- and intermediate-range missile threats, it would not contribute \nto the defense of the United States which could occur from the launch \nof an ICBM, an intercontinental ballistic missile, which would travel \nat a much higher altitude.\n  Likewise, Admiral Stavridis, the new commander of the U.S. European \nCommand, testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee during a \nhearing last month:\n\n       Sea-based and transportable land-based assets are integral \n     components of a comprehensive ballistic missile defense \n     system but cannot defeat the entire range of threats by \n     themselves. Sophisticated sensors are required for early \n     acquisition and target determination, and ground-based \n     interceptors are needed to defeat longer-range missiles.\n\n  The missile Iran seeks to develop, and is moving forward to develop, \nwould be capable of hitting the United States. Now they are seeking to \ndevelop ICBMs, and they are actively pursuing nuclear weapons, as we \nall know.\n  Why, I would ask my colleagues, would we want to consider \nalternatives to the proposed GBI deployment in Europe that would not \nsave any money and would not provide additional protection for the \nUnited States?\n  I would recall the comments former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger \nmade a few years ago about missile defense and whether we should \ndeploy. His comment was: I have never heard of a nation whose policy it \nis to keep itself vulnerable to attack.\n  Well, we do not need to be kept vulnerable to attack. We have the \ncapability to defend ourselves and protect against incoming missiles. \nSome have suggested that such additional protection is not needed, that \ncurrent ground-based interceptors deployed at our missile defense site \nin Fort Greely, AK, can provide complete protection for the United \nStates against Iranian threats.\n  But that argument does not tell the complete story. The truth is, \ndeploying GBIs in Europe would provide an early opportunity to \nintercept Iranian missiles headed to the east coast, which could then \nbe followed by an intercept attempt by Alaska, providing the United \nStates an extra layer of protection. Just 10 missiles could provide a \ngreat additional protection for the United States. That is what is \nneeded, an integrated, layered, ballistic missile defense shield that \neffectively protects America and her allies from rogue attack.\n  Most Americans think we are adequately protected. I do remember a \ntownhall meeting I held, and I asked the people there: What would \nhappen if a missile was launched at the United States? They said: We \nwould shoot it down. Well, that was before our system was up and \nrunning in Alaska, and it was not accurate. People think we do have a \nfully operational system, but we only have a few of those missiles up \nin Alaska, and we need this additional shield in Europe.\n  Without the site in Poland, the United States would have only one \nopportunity to engage Iranian missiles headed for certain portions of \nour country. Why should we take that risk?\n  Although the search for alternatives may please the Russians, it \nwould perversely send the wrong message to our NATO allies and, in \nparticular, to our friends in Poland and the Czech Republic who, \ndespite pressure and threats from Russia, have agreed and stood firm \nand expressed their willingness to host these missile defense assets on \ntheir territory.\n  I would remind my colleague that NATO, the North Atlantic Treaty \nOrganization, the most successful defense treaty in the history of the \nworld, endorsed the current plan at the April 2008 Bucharest Summit and \nnoted in their declaration:\n\n       We therefore recognize the substantial contribution to the \n     protection of Allies from long-range ballistic missiles to be \n     provided by the planned deployment of European-based United \n     States missile defense assets.\n\n  I also understand the Polish and Czech Parliaments have yet to ratify \nthe agreements, and the ambivalence presented by the Obama \nAdministration now regarding what was a firm policy of the United \nStates, means, frankly, it is unlikely they will do so until our \nadministration completes its consideration of alternatives. This has \nplaced our situation in limbo. I am not happy with that. I think it was \na mistake.\n  After all, why should those parliaments take up an agreement that the \nUnited States may pull off the table? This unfortunate event was \nobvious from the beginning when we backed away from our plan and \nstarted showing uncertainty. It is obvious the political support in \nCentral Europe may erode.\n  I am left to conclude that the reason the administration is pursuing \nalternatives in this current plan is its hopes it will address Russian \nobjections about the proposed deployment as part of a grand strategy to \nreset relations with Russia and conclude a follow-on to the START \nnuclear reduction agreement. I am not confident in this effort. In \nfact, it seems to, instead of moving our relations forward, have moved \nthem backward.\n  Let me make note of some recent events. Just days after the United \nStates and Russia reached a broader agreement on arms reductions and \nmissile defense cooperation at the July 6 Moscow summit, Reuters News \nAgency reported, on July 10, 4 days later, that Russian President \nMedvedev threatened the United States that if it did not reach \nagreement with Russia on our joint NATO/Polish/Czech plans for\n\n[[Page S7980]]\n\nmissile defense systems, Moscow would deploy rockets in an enclave near \nPoland.\n  Typical Russian bluster, threat. Likewise, Russian Foreign Minister \nSergey Lavrov has threatened to end arms control talks with the United \nStates if we pursue cooperation with our allies on missile defense, a \nsystem that in no way threatens Russia's massive nuclear capability, \nand they know it.\n  Ten interceptors of the United States in Europe are going to somehow \nhave a capability to stop the thousands of Russian missiles and nuclear \nweapons that they have? Russia knows that our defenses would be no \nmatch.\n  As reported by the Associated Press, just 1 day after the summit, \nLavrov stated:\n\n       If our partners make a decision to create an American \n     missile defense system with global reach, then that will \n     doubtless place a big question mark over the prospects for \n     further reduction in strategic offensive weapons.\n\n  Again, this is, unfortunately, a regressive approach by Russia on \nissues that I do not think is justified. It seems we are falling back \ninto a darker approach to world affairs with threats instead of working \ntogether to build a more peaceful and prosperous, harmonious world.\n  If, in fact, there were technical arguments in favor of alternative \ndeployments, which there are not, Russian belligerence would now indeed \nbe an argument for proceeding, nevertheless.\n  The former Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, Mirek Topolanek, put \nthe issue in its proper perspective when he stated:\n\n       The moral challenge is clear and simple: If we are not \n     willing to accept in the interests of the defense of the \n     Euro-Atlantic area such a trifle as the elements of a missile \n     defense system, then how shall we be able to face more \n     difficult challenges that may come?\n  That is an important statement. Are we losing confidence in \nourselves? He is not alone in that view. Just last week, 22 prominent \nEastern European political figures of important historic importance, \nincluding Poland's Lech Walesa and the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel, \npublished an open letter to President Obama expressing their uneasiness \nover U.S. maneuvers with Russia. This letter was sent to address their \nconcerns in light of what appears to them to be Russia's attempt to \nreassert its influence over Russia's former Eastern European \nsatellites. These are independent nations. They have been freed from \nSoviet domination. It is not their desire to kowtow to Russia and to \nhave to seek Russia's permission over whether to put a radar site in \ntheir country. They are sovereign nations.\n  These leaders noted in their letter that America's planned missile \ndefense installations in Poland and the Czech Republic have become ``a \nsymbol of America's credibility and commitment in the region.'' They \nfurther warned that:\n\n       The Alliance should not allow the issue to be determined by \n     unfounded Russian opposition. Abandoning the program entirely \n     or involving Russia too deeply in it without consulting \n     Poland or the Czech Republic can undermine the credibility of \n     the United States across the whole region.\n\n  I don't think that is no small matter. These are historic figures in \nEastern Europe who suffered under the Communist boot. They do not want \nto go back. They are sending us a message. They are great American \nallies. They believe in freedom and democracy. This is not an academic \nmatter to them, it is very real.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SESSIONS. On March 5, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \n``applaud[ed] the decision by the people of the Czech Republic and \ntheir government--as well as the people and Government of Poland--for \nproceeding with missile defense on their soil.'' That was just in March \nof this year. The United States should honor this commitment by \nproceeding with the missile defense deployment as planned and not be \naffected by Russia's unfounded objections. I remain baffled by their \nobjections, other than, perhaps, this is a way they think they can \nextract concessions from the United States as a bargaining chip.\n  As the CBO study referenced above makes clear:\n\n       Only the Polish and Czech deployments can protect the \n     United States and Europe. Any other option costs more and \n     defends the U.S. less, if at all.\n\n  I ask my colleagues to support this message. It will be good for our \ncountry to be clear on this question and for Congress to speak up.\n  I express a concern about what has happened in this budget to \nnational missile defense. It represents a major reduction in spending \nfor missile defense. We intend to deploy 44 missiles in Alaska. The \nbudget proposes, I believe, now just 30. It was proposed and part of \nthe agenda for the last number of years to place a multikill vehicle on \ntop of these interceptors so it could take out dummies and decoys and \nmultiple missiles. That was zeroed out, ended in this budget. For a \nnumber of years, we have been funding research and development of the \nkinetic energy interceptor. That is a high-speed system that can take \nout missiles in the launch phase, which is the best phase to do so. \nThat was zeroed out. There was the airborne laser which has the \ncapability of shooting down missiles in their launch phase when they \nhave so much heat coming out of them. It is funded for 1 more year, and \nit will be ended, apparently. Of course, now the 10 interceptors in \nEurope are in question.\n  We need to be sure we understand how seriously we are impacting the \nlong-term strategy of the United States. We have spent $20 billion to \ndevelop a system that will actually work at incredible rates of speed, \nwith hit-to-kill technology to knock down an incoming missile. After \nall of these investments and all these years, for $1 billion we could \ncomplete the program. We are saving about $150, $200 million this year \nthat would have kept us on track. Maybe we can keep the system going \nforward. I hope so with this resolution and some other things.\n  But the American people need to know that we are not talking about a \nminor retrenchment of national missile defense in the budget that has \ncome forward out of our committee. It represents the biggest reduction \nof missile defense funding during my time in the Senate, over 12 years.\n  I hope that as the months go along we will be able to reevaluate what \nwe are doing and make sure we don't abandon the progress we have made \nand take full advantage of decades of research and development that has \nproduced a system that will work to protect us.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                            [July 15, 2009]\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  An Open Letter to the Obama Administration from Central and Eastern \n                                 Europe\n\n (By Valdas Adamkus, Martin Butora, Emil Constantinescu, Pavol Demes, \nLubos Dobrovsky, Matyas Eorsi, Istvan Gyarmati, Vaclav Havel, Rastislav \n    Kacer, Sandra Kalniete, Karel Schwarzenberg, Michal Kovac, Ivan \nKrastev, Alexander Kwasniewski, Mart Laar, Kadri Liik, Janos Martonyi, \n   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Adam Rotfeld, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Alexandr \n                          Vondra, Lech Walesa)\n\n       We have written this letter because, as Central and Eastern \n     European (CEE) intellectuals and former policymakers, we care \n     deeply about the future of the transatlantic relationship as \n     well as the future quality of relations between the United \n     States and the countries of our region.

While our \n     contribution may at times seem modest compared to your own, \n     it is significant when measured as a percentage of our \n     population and GDP. Having benefited from your support for \n     liberal democracy and liberal values in the past, we have \n     been among your strongest supporters when it comes to \n     promoting democracy and human rights around the world.\n       Twenty years after the end of the Cold War, however, we see \n     that Central and Eastern European countries are no longer at \n     the heart of American foreign policy. As the new Obama \n     Administration sets its foreign-policy priorities, our region \n     is one part of the\n\n[[Page S7981]]\n\n     world that Americans have largely stopped worrying about. \n     Indeed, at times we have the impression that U.S. policy was \n     so successful that many American officials have now concluded \n     that our region is fixed once and for all and that they could \n     ``check the box'' and move on to other more pressing \n     strategic issues. Relations have been so close that many on \n     both sides assume that the region's transatlantic \n     orientation, as well as its stability and prosperity, would \n     last forever.\n       That view is premature. All is not well either in our \n     region or in the transatlantic relationship. Central and \n     Eastern Europe are at a political crossroads and today there \n     is a growing sense of nervousness in the region. The global \n     economic crisis is impacting on our region and, as elsewhere, \n     runs the risk that our societies will look inward and be less \n     engaged with the outside world. At the same time, storm \n     clouds are starting to gather on the foreign policy horizon. \n     Like you, we await the results of the EU Commission's \n     investigation on the origins of the Russo-Georgian war. But \n     the political impact of that war on the region has already \n     been felt. Many countries were deeply disturbed to see the \n     Atlantic alliance stand by as Russia violated the core \n     principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris, \n     and the territorial integrity of a country that was a member \n     of NATO's Partnership for Peace and the Euroatlantic \n     Partnership Council--all in the name of defending a sphere of \n     influence on its borders.\n       Despite the efforts and significant contribution of the new \n     members, NATO today seems weaker than when we joined. In many \n     of our countries it is perceived as less and less relevant--\n     and we feel it. Although we are full members, people question \n     whether NATO would be willing and able to come to our defense \n     in some future crises. Europe's dependence on Russian energy \n     also creates concern about the cohesion of the Alliance. \n     President Obama's remark at the recent NATO summit on the \n     need to provide credible defense plans for all Alliance \n     members was welcome, but not sufficient to allay fears about \n     the Alliance's defense readiness. Our ability to continue to \n     sustain public support at home for our contributions to \n     Alliance missions abroad also depends on us being able to \n     show that our own security concerns are being addressed in \n     NATO and close cooperation with the United States.\n       We must also recognize that America's popularity and \n     influence have fallen in many of our countries as well.\n       Public opinions polls, including the German Marshall Fund's \n     own Transatlantic Trends survey, show that our region has not \n     been immune to the wave of criticism and anti-Americanism \n     that has swept Europe in recent years and which led to a \n     collapse in sympathy and support for the United States during \n     the Bush years. Some leaders in the region have paid a \n     political price for their support of the unpopular war in \n     Iraq. In the future they may be more careful in taking \n     political risks to support the United States. We believe that \n     the onset of a new Administration has created a new opening \n     to reverse this trend but it will take time and work on both \n     sides to make up for what we have lost.\n       In many ways the EU has become the major factor and \n     institution in our lives. To many people it seems more \n     relevant and important today than the link to the United \n     States. To some degree it is a logical outcome of the \n     integration of Central and Eastern Europe into the EU. Our \n     leaders and officials spend much more time in EU meetings \n     than in consultations with Washington, where they often \n     struggle to attract attention or make our voices heard. The \n     region's deeper integration in the EU is of course welcome \n     and should not necessarily lead to a weakening of the \n     transatlantic relationship. The hope was that integration of \n     Central and Eastern Europe into the EU would actually \n     strengthen the strategic cooperation between Europe and \n     America.\n       However, there is a danger that instead of being a pro-\n     Atlantic voice in the EU, support for a more global \n     partnership with Washington in the region might wane over \n     time. The region does not have the tradition of assuming a \n     more global role. Some items on the transatlantic agenda, \n     such as climate change, do not resonate in the Central and \n     Eastern European publics to the same extent as they do in \n     Western Europe.\n       Leadership change is also coming in Central and Eastern \n     Europe. Next to those, there are fewer and fewer leaders who \n     emerged from the revolutions of 1989 who experienced \n     Washington's key role in securing our democratic transition \n     and anchoring our countries in NATO and EU. A new generation \n     of leaders is emerging who do not have these memories and \n     follow a more ``realistic'' policy. At the same time, the \n     former Communist elites, whose insistence on political and \n     economic power significantly contributed to the crises in \n     many CEE countries, gradually disappear from the political \n     scene. The current political and economic turmoil and the \n     fallout from the global economic crisis provide additional \n     opportunities for the forces of nationalism, extremism, \n     populism, and anti-Semitism across the continent but also in \n     some of our countries.\n       This means that the United States is likely to lose many of \n     its traditional interlocutors in the region. The new elites \n     replacing them may not share the idealism--or have the same \n     relationship to the United States--as the generation who led \n     the democratic transition. They may be more calculating in \n     their support of the United States as well as more parochial \n     in their world view. And in Washington a similar transition \n     is taking place as many of the leaders and personalities we \n     have worked with and relied on are also leaving politics.\n       And then there is the issue of how to deal with Russia. Our \n     hopes that relations with Russia would improve and that \n     Moscow would finally fully accept our complete sovereignty \n     and independence after joining NATO and the EU have not been \n     fulfilled. Instead, Russia is back as a revisionist power \n     pursuing a 19th-century agenda with 21st-century tactics and \n     methods. At a global level, Russia has become, on most \n     issues, a status-quo power. But at a regional level and vis-\n     a-vis our nations, it increasingly acts as a revisionist one. \n     It challenges our claims to our own historical experiences. \n     It asserts a privileged position in determining our security \n     choices. It uses overt and covert means of economic warfare, \n     ranging from energy blockades and politically motivated \n     investments to bribery and media manipulation in order to \n     advance its interests and to challenge the transatlantic \n     orientation of Central and Eastern Europe.\n       We welcome the ``reset'' of the American-Russian relations. \n     As the countries living closest to Russia, obviously nobody \n     has a greater interest in the development of the democracy in \n     Russia and better relations between Moscow and the West than \n     we do. But there is also nervousness in our capitals. We want \n     to ensure that too narrow an understanding of Western \n     interests does not lead to the wrong concessions to Russia. \n     Today the concern is, for example, that the United States and \n     the major European powers might embrace the Medvedev plan for \n     a ``Concert of Powers'' to replace the continent's existing, \n     value-based security structure. The danger is that Russia's \n     creeping intimidation and influence-peddling in the region \n     could over time lead to a de facto neutralization of the \n     region. There are differing views within the region when it \n     comes to Moscow's new policies. But there is a shared view \n     that the full engagement of the United States is needed.\n       Many in the region are looking with hope to the Obama \n     Administration to restore the Atlantic relationship as a \n     moral compass for their domestic as well as foreign policies. \n     A strong commitment to common liberal democratic values is \n     essential to our countries. We know from our own historical \n     experience the difference between when the United States \n     stood up for its liberal democratic values and when it did \n     not. Our region suffered when the United States succumbed to \n     ``realism'' at Yalta. And it benefited when the United \n     States used its power to fight for principle. That was \n     critical during the Cold War and in opening the doors of \n     NATO. Had a ``realist'' view prevailed in the early 1990s, \n     we would not be in NATO today and the idea of a Europe \n     whole, free, and at peace would be a distant dream.\n       We understand the heavy demands on your Administration and \n     on U.S. foreign policy. It is not our intent to add to the \n     list of problems you face. Rather, we want to help by being \n     strong Atlanticist allies in a U.S.-European partnership that \n     is a powerful force for good around the world. But we are not \n     certain where our region will be in five or ten years time \n     given the domestic and foreign policy uncertainties we face. \n     We need to take the right steps now to ensure the strong \n     relationship between the United States and Central and \n     Eastern Europe over the past twenty years will endure.\n       We believe this is a time both the United States and Europe \n     need to reinvest in the transatlantic relationship. We also \n     believe this is a time when the United States and Central and \n     Eastern Europe must reconnect around a new and forward-\n     looking agenda. While recognizing what has been achieved in \n     the twenty years since the fall of the Iron Curtain, it is \n     time to set a new agenda for close cooperation for the next \n     twenty years across the Atlantic.\n       Therefore, we propose the following steps:\n       First, we are convinced that America needs Europe and that \n     Europe needs the United States as much today as in the past. \n     The United States should reaffirm its vocation as a European \n     power and make clear that it plans to stay fully engaged on \n     the continent even while it faces the pressing challenges in \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan, the wider Middle East, and Asia. \n     For our part we must work at home in our own countries and in \n     Europe more generally to convince our leaders and societies \n     to adopt a more global perspective and be prepared to \n     shoulder more responsibility in partnership with the United \n     States.\n       Second, we need a renaissance of NATO as the most important \n     security link between the United States and Europe. It is the \n     only credible hard power security guarantee we have. NATO \n     must reconfirm its core function of collective defense even \n     while we adapt to the new threats of the 21st century. A key \n     factor in our ability to participate in NATO's expeditionary \n     missions overseas is the belief that we are secure at home. \n     We must therefore correct some self-inflicted wounds from the \n     past. It was a mistake not to commence with proper Article 5 \n     defense planning for new members after NATO was enlarged. \n     NATO needs to make the Alliance's commitments credible and \n     provide strategic reassurance to all members. This should \n     include contingency planning, prepositioning of forces, \n     equipment, and supplies for reinforcement in our region in \n     case of crisis as originally envisioned in the NATO-Russia \n     Founding Act.\n       We should also re-think the working of the NATO-Russia \n     Council and return to the practice where NATO member \n     countries enter\n\n[[Page S7982]]\n\n     into dialogue with Moscow with a coordinated position. When \n     it comes to Russia, our experience has been that a more \n     determined and principled policy toward Moscow will not only \n     strengthen the West's security but will ultimately lead \n     Moscow to follow a more cooperative policy as well. \n     Furthermore, the more secure we feel inside NATO, the easier \n     it will also be for our countries to reach out to engage \n     Moscow on issues of common interest. That is the dual track \n     approach we need and which should be reflected in the new \n     NATO strategic concept.\n       Third, the thorniest issue may well be America's planned \n     missile-defense installations. Here too, there are different \n     views in the region, including among our publics which are \n     divided. Regardless of the military merits of this scheme and \n     what Washington eventually decides to do, the issue has \n     nevertheless also become--at least in some countries--a \n     symbol of America's credibility and commitment to the region. \n     How it is handled could have a significant impact on their \n     future transatlantic orientation. The small number of \n     missiles involved cannot be a threat to Russia's strategic \n     capabilities, and the Kremlin knows this. We should decide \n     the future of the program as allies and based on the \n     strategic plusses and minuses of the different technical and \n     political configurations. The Alliance should not allow the \n     issue to be determined by unfounded Russian opposition. \n     Abandoning the program entirely or involving Russia too \n     deeply in it without consulting Poland or the Czech Republic \n     can undermine the credibility of the United States across the \n     whole region.\n       Fourth, we know that NATO alone is not enough. We also want \n     and need more Europe and a better and more strategic U.S.-EU \n     relationship as well. Increasingly our foreign policies are \n     carried out through the European Union--and we support that. \n     We also want a common European foreign and defense policy \n     that is open to close cooperation with the United States. We \n     are the advocates of such a line in the EU. But we need the \n     United States to rethink its attitude toward the EU and \n     engage it much more seriously as a strategic partner. We need \n     to bring NATO and the EU closer together and make them work \n     in tandem. We need common NATO and EU strategies not only \n     toward Russia but on a range of other new strategic \n     challenges.\n       Fifth is energy security. The threat to energy supplies can \n     exert an immediate influence on our nations' political \n     sovereignty also as allies contributing to common decisions \n     in NATO. That is why it must also become a transatlantic \n     priority. Although most of the responsibility for energy \n     security lies within the realm of the EU, the United States \n     also has a role to play. Absent American support, the Baku-\n     Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline would never have been built. Energy \n     security must become an integral part of U.S.-European \n     strategic cooperation. Central and Eastern European countries \n     should lobby harder (and with more unity) inside Europe for \n     diversification of the energy mix, suppliers, and transit \n     routes, as well as for tough legal scrutiny of Russia's abuse \n     of its monopoly and cartel-like power inside the EU. But \n     American political support on this will play a crucial role. \n     Similarly, the United States can play an important role in \n     solidifying further its support for the Nabucco pipeline, \n     particularly in using its security relationship with the main \n     transit country, Turkey, as well as the North-South \n     interconnector of Central Europe and LNG terminals in our \n     region.\n       Sixth, we must not neglect the human factor. Our next \n     generations need to get to know each other, too. We have to \n     cherish and protect the multitude of educational, \n     professional, and other networks and friendships that \n     underpin our friendship and alliance. The U.S. visa regime \n     remains an obstacle in this regard. It is absurd that Poland \n     and Romania--arguably the two biggest and most pro-American \n     states in the CEE region, which are making substantial \n     contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan--have not yet been \n     brought into the visa waiver program. It is incomprehensible \n     that a critic like the French anti-globalization activist \n     Jose Bove does not require a visa for the United States but \n     former Solidarity activist and Nobel Peace prizewinner Lech \n     Walesa does. This issue will be resolved only if it is made a \n     political priority by the President of the United States.\n       The steps we made together since 1989 are not minor in \n     history. The common successes are the proper foundation for \n     the transatlantic renaissance we need today. This is why we \n     believe that we should also consider the creation of a Legacy \n     Fellowship for young leaders. Twenty years have passed since \n     the revolutions of 1989. That is a whole generation. We need \n     a new generation to renew the transatlantic partnership. A \n     new program should be launched to identify those young \n     leaders on both sides of the Atlantic who can carry forward \n     the transatlantic project we have spent the last two decades \n     building in Central and Eastern Europe.\n       In conclusion, the onset of a new Administration in the \n     United States has raised great hopes in our countries for a \n     transatlantic renewal. It is an opportunity we dare not miss. \n     We, the authors of this letter, know firsthand how important \n     the relationship with the United States has been. In the \n     1990s, a large part of getting Europe right was about getting \n     Central and Eastern Europe right. The engagement of the \n     United States was critical to locking in peace and stability \n     from the Baltics to the Black Sea. Today the goal must be to \n     keep Central and Eastern Europe right as a stable, activist, \n     and Atlanticist part of our broader community.\n       That is the key to our success in bringing about the \n     renaissance in the Alliance the Obama Administration has \n     committed itself to work for and which we support. That will \n     require both sides recommitting to and investing in this \n     relationship. But if we do it right, the pay off down the \n     road can be very real. By taking the right steps now, we can \n     put it on new and solid footing for the future.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I very much support the pending amendment. \nIt is the product of a lot of work by a lot of people. Senator \nLieberman, in particular, was considering offering an amendment during \nour markup in the committee. He agreed that he would hold off until we \ngot to the floor to try to get broad bipartisan agreement on a very \nimportant subject. He did that. We are grateful to him for doing so.\n  This amendment is consistent with the administration's policies for \nmissile defense in Europe, including its consideration of a variety of \noptions and architectures for defending Europe, including the so-called \nthird site in Poland and the Czech Republic. The main purpose of these \nefforts in Europe is to act against an Iranian missile threat should it \nmaterialize. It is very important that we do so.\n  Earlier this month, General Cartwright, Vice Chairman of the Joint \nChiefs, testified before the Armed Services Committee that the \nDepartment of Defense is considering a number of missile defense \noptions in Europe.\n  This amendment is also consistent with the administration's efforts \nto pursue missile defense cooperation with Russia as part of our \nefforts to address the Iranian missile threat. Those missiles, of \ncourse, potentially could be armed with nuclear warheads. This \npotential Iranian missile threat is a threat that confronts not just \nEurope as NATO but also Russia as well, obviously, and a number of \nother countries. It is a real threat. Everything we can do to deter \nthat, everything we can do to defend, should it ever materialize, is \nsomething we must do. It is a major threat.\n  In one of its findings, NATO recognizes this Iranian threat. This is \nthe way NATO recognized this Iranian threat and the importance of \ntrying to work together to deter, to try to prevent it from happening, \nand then, should it happen, to defend against it, to make it useless. \nHere is what NATO said in April:\n\n       We support increased missile defense cooperation between \n     Russia and NATO, including maximum transparency and \n     reciprocal confidence-building measures to allay any \n     concerns. We reaffirm our readiness to explore the potential \n     for linking United States, NATO and Russian missile defense \n     systems at an appropriate time and we encourage the Russian \n     Federation to take advantage of [U.S.] missile defense \n     cooperation proposals.\n\n  Back in April, I led a delegation, with Senators Collins and Bill \nNelson, to visit Russia, Poland, and the Czech Republic to discuss \nmissile defense and the potential for a cooperative approach. What we \nfound is that there appears to be real potential for a cooperative \napproach and for having missile defense be a uniting issue against a \ncommon threat instead of a dividing issue. If we can find a way to \ncooperate with Russia on missile defense, it would send an \nextraordinarily powerful message to Iran that we are united against \ntheir continued development of nuclear technology and long-range \nballistic missiles.\n  That is the point of missile defense in Europe, to address the \nIranian missile and nuclear program in order to enhance their security \nand our security. This amendment will authorize prior year's funds for \na variety of cost-effective and operationally effective missile defense \noptions that could protect Europe and the United States from Iranian \nmissiles of all ranges, current and future. The amendment is designed \nto command and hopefully attract strong bipartisan support. I hope it \ndoes just that.\n  I believe a voice vote may be possible after Senator McCain speaks. I \nhope that is the case, given the schedule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Lieberman \namendment expressing the sense of the Senate that the U.S. Government \nshould continue developing and planning for the proposed deployments of \nelements of a\n\n[[Page S7983]]\n\nground-based midcourse defense system. I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for this amendment and his willingness to work with all \nparties, which will then allow us to voice vote this very important \namendment.\n  Obviously, there are a lot of strong feelings on the issue of missile \ndefense in Europe. I believe this amendment addresses and expresses our \nconcerns and our goals, including a midcourse radar in the Czech \nRepublic and ground-based interceptors in Poland, as well as the \nreservation of funds for the development and deployment of missile \ndefense systems in Europe.\n  As rogue nations, including North Korea and Iran, push the nuclear \nenvelope and work tirelessly to develop delivery vehicles capable of \nreaching America and its allies, we must aggressively develop the \nsystems necessary to counter such belligerent efforts. Enhancing \nmissile defense capabilities in Europe is an essential component to \naddressing rogue state and in-theater threats we face and expect to \nface in the future.\n  As Iran works to develop ballistic missile capabilities of all \nranges, the United States must reaffirm its commitments to its allies \nand develop and deploy effective missile defense systems. The Iranian \nballistic missile threat is real and growing. During the NATO summit in \nBucharest in April of 2008, the allies cited the threat of ballistic \nmissile proliferation as one of great concern to their forces, \nterritory, and populations. Missile defense in Europe, according to \nNATO ``forms part of a broader response to counter this threat . . . \n[a] substantial contribution to the protection of Allies from long-\nrange ballistic missiles to be provided by the planned deployment of \nEuropean-based United States missile defense assets.''\n  Uncertainty about the future of missile defense in Europe, some \nstemming from perceptions, whether wanted or not, that Russia will have \na say or veto power over the disposition of our missile defense \narchitecture, has caused concerns both here in the Senate and among \nsome of our closest European allies. I urge the administration to \nprovide some clarity on how it plans to honor the commitments the \nUnited States has made to Poland and the Czech Republic.\n  The last administration recognized the importance and need for a \nEuropean component to our missile defense system, reached out to the \nGovernments of Poland and the Czech Republic, and asked that they make \nwhat many at the time perceived as an unpopular agreement. Despite \nunwanted threats from Russia, both governments recognized the \nimportance such a capability would provide to their citizens and to \nEurope as a whole and agreed to allow the United States to place \nground-based interceptors in Poland and a midcourse radar site in the \nCzech Republic.\n  Given the perception, one that has been strengthened by the testimony \nof administration officials before the Armed Services Committee, that \nthe United States is preparing to back away from its commitments to our \nPolish and Czech allies, this amendment comes at an important moment. \nIt was only a year ago, after all, that the United States and the Czech \nRepublic affirmed that:\n\n       Within the context of, and consistent with, both the North \n     Atlantic Treaty and the Czech Republic . . . the United \n     States is committed to the security of the Czech Republic. \n     [And that] the Czech Republic and the United States will work \n     together to counter emerging military or non-military threats \n     posed by third parties or to minimize the effects of such \n     threats.\n\n  Similarly, on August 20, 2008, the United States signed an agreement \nwith Poland stating that the:\n\n       United States is committed to the security of Poland and of \n     any U.S. facilities located on the territory of the Republic \n     of Poland. . . .The United States and Poland intend to expand \n     air and missile defense cooperation. In this regard, we have \n     agreed on an important new area of such cooperation involving \n     the deployment of a U.S. Army Patriot air and missile defense \n     battery in Poland.\n\n  Our Polish friends are clearly uneasy and have been quite vocal. \nDuring a forum earlier this year in Brussels, Polish Foreign Minister \nRadoslaw Sikorski said:\n\n       We hope we don't regret our trust in the United States.\n\n  I urge the administration and my colleagues in the Senate to join me \nin reiterating our commitment to the security and freedom of these \nnations as well as deterring and defending them against any threats to \ntheir security.\n  With respect to Russia and the ongoing START negotiations, I urge the \nPresident to continue to reject any Russian attempt to link reductions \nin offensive strategic nuclear weapons with defensive capabilities such \nas missile defense. Russia, too, must recognize that the current \nIranian path is unsettling to the global interests of all peace-seeking \nnations. Missile defense in Europe is not and should not be viewed in \nMoscow as some new form of post-Cold War aggression. It is, rather, a \nreasonable and prudent response to the very real threats the Iranian \nregime continues to pose to the United States, Europe, and the world.\n  Again, I thank my good friend from Connecticut for offering this \namendment, and I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, very briefly, I want to thank Senator \nLevin and Senator McCain for their very thoughtful statements in \nsupport of this amendment. I thank their staffs for the work that has \nbeen done with all of my staff, Senator Sessions, and others to reach \nthis agreement. It is an important statement of policy about our \nnational security in the years ahead. I appreciate all that has been \ndone by everyone here in the spirit of unity.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1744) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that Senator \nDorgan be recognized for up to 15 minutes and then we return to regular \norder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me thank the chairman of the \ncommittee, Senator Levin, and Senator McCain, for their work on this \nbill.\n  We talk about a lot of things in this bill: jet fighters, bombers, \ntankers, submarines, unmanned aerial vehicles--lots and lots of \nsubjects. The subjects are about the defense of our country, what \nprovides national security for our country, so these are all very \nimportant. I wish to speak, however, about one piece of this \nlegislation that probably is not mentioned much but I think is very \nimportant; that is, the reduction of the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  There is something over $400 million in this bill that deals with the \nefforts to try to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons.\n  I have had at my desk in the Senate for a long while some pieces of \nequipment. I ask unanimous consent to show them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this is a piece of a wing of a Soviet \nBackfire bomber. We did not shoot this plane down. This was sawed off \nof a wing of a Backfire bomber that would have carried nuclear weapons, \npresumably, to threaten our country. But under something called the \nNunn-Lugar Cooperative Threat Reduction program that we engaged in with \nthe countries of the former Soviet Union, bombers were destroyed--oh, \nnot by bullets, but they were sawed in half and the wings were taken \noff and so on.\n  This is a tube of copper, I show you, from the electrical wiring of a \nRussian submarine that carried nuclear weapons targeting this country. \nThis was\n\n[[Page S7984]]\n\nground up by the Cooperative Threat Reduction program. The submarine \nwas not destroyed by American bullets. This is part of the Cooperative \nThreat Reduction effort.\n  This, I show you, is a hinge from a nuclear weapon on top of a \nmissile that was in the Ukraine, presumably aimed at an American \ntarget. Where this missile once sat now grows sunflowers in the \nUkraine.\n  The Cooperative Threat Reduction Program--now, why is that important?\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of threats to this country, but none is \nas great as the threat of a nuclear warhead being exploded in a major \nAmerican city or any metropolitan area of this world, for example.\n  Here, as shown on this chart, is how many nuclear warheads we have. \nThis is from the Carnegie Endowment in 2009. They estimate the number \nof nuclear warheads that exist on the planet--Russia, about 14,000 \nnuclear weapons; the United States, 10,500 nuclear weapons; China, \nabout 125; France, about 300; Britain, about 160 nuclear weapons; \nIsrael, 80; India, 50; Pakistan, 60, and so on.\n  Let me tell you a story, if I might. It is a story that has been \nwritten about extensively. In fact, it was the lead for a book called \n``Nuclear Terrorism,'' written by Graham Allison.\n  It was 1 month after 9/11/2001. It was October 11, 2001, when, at the \nPresidential daily briefing to President George W. Bush, George Tenet, \nthe then-head of the CIA, informed the President that a CIA agent code \nnamed Dragonfire had reported that al-Qaida terrorists possessed a 10-\nkiloton nuclear weapon, evidently stolen from the Russian arsenal. \nAccording to Dragonfire, the CIA agent, it had been smuggled into an \nAmerican city, probably New York City. Again, at the President's daily \nbriefing, 1 month to the day after 9/11, it was said that al-Qaida had \nsmuggled a 10-kiloton stolen nuclear weapon into perhaps New York City.\n  The CIA had no independent confirmation of it, but in the hours that \nfollowed, the Secretary of State, the National Security Adviser, and \nothers struggled with the question of whom do you call to talk about \nthe threat and how do you do it without the news media putting out a \nbulletin that there is a rumor that a stolen 10-kiloton Russian nuclear \nweapon is in an American city without causing panic and mass exodus?\n  So they tried to determine what to do about this and analyzed: Was it \nplausible, possible that al-Qaida terrorists had stolen a 10-kiloton \nnuclear weapon? The answer is yes. Did the Russians possess 10-kiloton \nnuclear weapons? Yes. Did they have good command and control over them, \nabsolute command and control? No. Was it possible, having stolen it, \nthat the terrorists could have smuggled it into New York City or, \nperhaps, Washington, DC? Yes. And could the terrorists detonate it? The \nanswer is yes. If it were trucked, for example, to Times Square and \nexploded, would half a million people be killed instantly? Yes.\n  But they did not tell anybody. They did not tell the mayor of New \nYork. They sent nuclear weapons search teams to New York. The President \nsent teams to New York but did not inform anybody, for obvious reasons.\n  About a month later, while there were a lot of people having an \napoplectic seizure about this prospect, it was determined that perhaps \nthe report by the CIA agent, Dragonfire, was not credible.\n  Now, think of that. Think of the unbelievable angst about the \npotential of one rather small nuclear weapon, a 10-kiloton nuclear \nweapon, having been stolen on a planet where there are 25,000 of them--\nmost of them much larger than that. Think of the angst about the \npotential of having one stolen by a terrorist group and exploded in the \nmiddle of an American city. That is just one weapon, and there are \n25,000.\n  There are a lot of people who are good thinkers and very experienced \nin these areas who will tell you, including former Defense Secretary \nPerry and others, that there is a very high probability that within the \ncoming 10 years there will be a nuclear weapon exploded in a major \ncity.\n  So with all of the talk about planes and ships and all of the issues \nin this bill, this issue of the threat reduction, with $400 million-\nplus in this bill--the threat reduction that allowed us to dismantle \nnuclear weapons, cut off the wings of an adversary's bombers, grind up \nthe wiring, and destroy the submarines--that is critically important. \nThe question for us is, What are we going to do to reduce the number of \nnuclear weapons and to stop the spread of nuclear weapons around the \nworld? Because almost certainly there will be an explosion of a nuclear \nweapon in a metropolitan area at some point in the future unless we \nprovide the leadership in arms talks and arms reductions. It is our \nresponsibility to lead. It falls on our shoulders to bear this burden \nto lead.\n  I know there are some who would say: Do you know what, that is a sign \nof weakness to be talking about reducing nuclear weapons. I am not \nsuggesting reducing America's strength or allowing America to be \nundefended. I am suggesting the world will be a much safer place if we \ndo not have 25,000 nuclear weapons, and this world will be a much safer \nplace if we find a way to stop the spread of nuclear weapons. Every day \nnow, we see the spectacle of Iran. Iran possessing a nuclear weapon? \nThat is scary. North Korea. We do not know how many weapons North Korea \nhas, but the Carnegie Endowment says perhaps less than 10.\n  But what do we do now? What do we do to decide we are going to be \ninvolved in a very aggressive way leading the world in the \nnonproliferation of nuclear weapons and beginning to reduce the number \nof nuclear weapons?\n  We are operating now under what is called the Strategic Offensive \nReductions Treaty, also known as the Moscow Treaty, that our last \nPresident negotiated. It required the United States and Russia to have \nno more than 2,200 operationally deployed nuclear weapons. It does not \nmean that is the limit. That is just the operationally deployed limit. \nThey can have far more nuclear weapons than that. By 2012, they had to \nbe down to 2,200 operationally deployed. It does not restrict delivery \nvehicles of any kind--missiles, ships, planes. It does not have any \nverification measures, and it expires in 2012.\n  There is another treaty called the START Treaty, which was superseded \nby the treaty I just described. But some parts of the START Treaty are \nstill in force because it does have verification and onsite monitoring \nand confidence-building measures and it does limit delivery vehicles. \nBut that limitation is going to expire, and that START Treaty expires \nat the end of this year.\n  So the point I want to make today simply is this: We are talking \nabout a lot of very important things, and I think the bill put together \nby the chairman and ranking member, this Defense authorization bill, is \nvery important. I understand that. We need an Army, a Navy, the \nMarines, the Air Force. We need them well equipped. This is a troubling \nworld in some corners. We face an enormous threat of terrorism. We face \na lot of different threats. We must keep our eye on the ball. We, above \nall, here in the United States have a responsibility to provide the \nleadership that is necessary to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and \nto try to push and push and push for agreements that would reduce the \nnumber of nuclear weapons.\n\n  As I said before, when, again, a CIA agent code named Dragonfire \nshows up and says to the CIA, I have picked up information which \nindicates there is one nuclear weapon that has been stolen and it is in \nthe hands of terrorists, and it is now in New York City, ready to be \ndetonated, when that happens next, we had better worry a great deal if \nwe haven't prevented it, if we haven't taken all of the steps necessary \nto say, that can't happen. That report in October of 2001 turned out to \nbe false, but all of the post mortems by experts understood that it \ncould well have been true, and all of the elements could have been \naccurate. A weapon could have been stolen, smuggled into the city, \ndetonated and a half a million people within three-quarters of a mile \nof Times Square would have died immediately. If that would have \nhappened the world would never be the same. Everything will have \nchanged.\n  So it seems to me we have a responsibility to aggressively pursue \narms control agreements. We have an opportunity now, and a \nresponsibility to pursue aggressively, even in legislation such as \nthis, the reduction of nuclear weapons and delivery vehicles to try to\n\n[[Page S7985]]\n\nsee if we can step back from the abyss and actively engage with other \nnuclear powers to do things that will tighten controls, and in a very \nsignificant way, prevents the opportunity from other nations, and \nespecially rogue nations, and especially, most especially, terrorist \ngroups, from acquiring nuclear weapons.\n  We know, we have the history, that Osama bin Laden has been \nfascinated with and has wanted to acquire the mechanics for nuclear \nweapons and the materials for nuclear weapons for a long time. We know \nthat. Al-Qaida is still there. As far as we know, Osama bin Laden is \nstill leading al-Qaida. It is pretty unbelievable to think about that. \nOn 9/11 we were told there isn't one acre on this Earth that would be \nsafe for the person who designed the attack against our country, but it \nis now 8 years later and we are told in the public briefings by our CIA \nthat the greatest threat to our homeland is al-Qaida, a reconstituted \nal-Qaida. The terrorist threat which is the greatest threat to our \nhomeland is a reconstituted al-Qaida with training camps where they are \ndesigning attacks against our country.\n  Let us hope that we are able to make the kinds of efforts and provide \nthe kind of leadership that singularly says to the world: It is this \ncountry that leads the way to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and \nit is our country that wants to reduce the number of nuclear weapons on \nthis planet. No, that won't make us weaker; I don't suggest any \napproach that would ever weaken this country relative to its \nadversaries. But it will certainly strengthen the future of this planet \nif we reduce the number of nuclear weapons below the 25,000 nuclear \nweapons that now exist as well as take very significant steps to stop \nother countries and certainly to prevent forever rogue nations and \nterrorist organizations from acquiring nuclear weapons. That needs to \nbe job one. We don't talk nearly enough about it. We don't talk about \nthe subject as much as we should. But I wanted to bring this issue to \nthe floor during this discussion because it is in this bill, \nCooperative Threat Reduction, which we know works and which we have \nfunded in the past and will continue to fund in this bill again, and is \nsomething that addresses the issue of not just building more weapons \nbut actually finding ways to engage with our adversaries to reduce the \nweapons that can, frankly, threaten the existence of this planet.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Akaka amendment \nNo. 1522.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1519\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 1519.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object. I will not \nobject--of course--this would be the next amendment which would be in a \nline of amendments that Senator McCain and I are trying to work out \nalternating between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr], for himself and \n     Mrs. Hagan, proposes an amendment numbered 1519.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit the establishment of an outlying landing field at \n               Sandbanks or Hale's Lake, North Carolina)\n\n       On page 565, after line 20, add the following:\n\n                       Subtitle D--Other Matters\n\n     SEC. 2481. PROHIBITION ON OUTLYING LANDING FIELD AT SANDBANKS \n                   OR HALE'S LAKE, NORTH CAROLINA, FOR OCEANA \n                   NAVAL AIR STATION.\n\n       The Secretary of the Navy may not establish, consider the \n     establishment of, or purchase land, construct facilities, \n     implement bird management plans, or conduct any other \n     activities that would facilitate the establishment of an \n     outlying landing field at either of the proposed sites in \n     North Carolina, Sandbanks or Hale's Lake, to support field \n     carrier landing practice for naval aircraft operating out of \n     Oceana, Naval Air Station, Virginia.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, most Members don't know much about this \namendment. If you are not from Virginia or if you are not from North \nCarolina or you are not on the Armed Services Committee, this amendment \nwill probably not make a lot of sense. This is about the proposed \nacquisition of land in North Carolina for an outlying landing field for \ncarrier-based aircraft to practice their touch and goes for the \npurposes of night takeoffs and night landings.\n  This is not new to North Carolina. Let me say to my colleagues, I \ndon't think there is a State more friendly to the military than North \nCarolina. We are home to Fort Bragg, the Pentagon of the Army; we are \nhome to Camp LeJeune, the east coast hub of the Marine Corps; Seymour \nJohnson Air Force Base. Our communities don't just welcome the \nmilitary, they support the military. I think it is the most military-\nfriendly State you can find. There is no military family that is \nstationed within North Carolina that has not been extended in-State \ntuition regardless of how long they are there or whether their kids are \nstill in education once their parents might have been deployed \nelsewhere.\n  This is not an issue of ``not in my backyard.'' There are two \nproposed sites. One thing my amendment very clearly does is it \nprohibits the establishment of an outlying landing field at the \nproposed Hale's Lake, Camden County/Currituck County landing sites and \nthe Sandbanks, Gates County sites in North Carolina. It says to the \nNavy: You have to take them off your list; you can't include them.\n  The Navy is proposing to construct an outlying landing field for \ntheir carrier-based fixed-wing aircraft squadrons stationed in Virginia \nBeach at the Naval Air Station Oceana. They propose to acquire 30,000 \nacres. So they get 30,000 acres to allow for the accommodation of fee-\nsimple purchases, the purchase of restrictive use or through \nconservation easements.\n  Approximately 2,000 acres would be used for the core area, which \nwould include an 8,000-foot runway. Think about 30,000 acres relative \nto the airport that is in your local community and you get an idea of \nhow much bigger this footprint is.\n  I said earlier this is not about ``not in my backyard.'' As a matter \nof fact, North Carolina has proffered to the Navy currently a Marine \nair station in Cherry Point as a potential OLF site where we already \nhave squadrons of Marine aircraft. We have the capacity and, more \nimportantly, we have a community that wants to have this site. The Navy \ndoesn't support the Cherry Point proposal, supposedly because it is \nconsidered to be in a location too far from Oceana. Well, let me \ndescribe for my colleagues, when you draw the line that says anything \noutside of this is too far, Cherry Point falls 20 miles outside of the \nline they have drawn. Twenty miles is the glidepath to land and the \nglidepath to take off. We are not talking about a big distance. It \ndoesn't seem to make sense why the Navy is looking to condemn 30,000 \nacres for the purposes of constructing a new facility instead of using \nan existing facility, an existing military base that would be much more \nefficient and cost effective for the Navy and, more importantly, cost \neffective for taxpayers.\n  Why am I here? Why is Senator Hagan offering this amendment? Because \nthe people in Gates County, in Currituck County, in Camden County, \ndon't want it. The Navy went into this process saying: If people don't \nwant us, we won't go there. The truth is it doesn't stop there.\n  I wish to enter into the Record, if I may--on May 27, 2009, the North \nCarolina General Assembly unanimously passed a bill, House bill 613, \nwhich states that the consent of the State is not granted to the \nFederal Government for acquisition of land for an outlying landing \nfield in a county or counties which have no existing military base \nwhere squadrons are stationed. I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record this document, as well as a letter from the president of \nthe North Carolina Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S7986]]\n\n            GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF NORTH CAROLINA, SESSION 2009\n\n                  Session Law 2009-20, House Bill 613\n\n     An Act providing that consent of the State is not granted to \n         the United States for acquisition of land for an outlying \n         landing field in a county or counties which have no \n         existing military base at which aircraft squadrons are \n         stationed\n       The General Assembly of North Carolina enacts:\n       Section 1.

This new law, which the Governor signed April \n     30th, will make it more difficult for the Navy to force an \n     OLF into Camden, Currituck, or Gates Counties and sends a \n     strong, unified message of opposition from our state. We are \n     including a copy of the legislation for your information.\n       All along, we have known that an OLF in northeastern North \n     Carolina would benefit the people of Virginia and would be \n     built to alleviate noise and congestion at Naval Station \n     Oceana in Virginia Beach. For years, the Navy has refused to \n     admit this very basic rationale for their proposed OLF.\n       Therefore, we respectfully ask you, as our federal \n     representatives, to urge the Navy to move some of the \n     squadrons based at Oceana to the Marine Corps Air Station at \n     Cherry Point. This would alleviate the need for an OLF in \n     northeastern North Carolina and our state would benefit from \n     the employment surrounding these additional squadrons. If an \n     OLF is needed, North Carolina's new law would allow one near \n     Cherry Point, in an area of our state that wants it and \n     receives the economic benefits as well.\n       North Carolina is the most military-friendly state in the \n     nation and we intend to remain so. It is our hope that we can \n     work toward a solution that allows the Navy to meet its \n     training needs and continues the proud tradition of \n     cooperation between the military and our state.\n           Sincerely,\n     Marc Basnight,\n       President pro tempore.\n     Bill Owens,\n       Representative.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, an OLF at any of the proposed sites in North \nCarolina and Virginia would create 52 jobs. Fifty-two jobs, for a \n30,000-acre footprint. The location at the Hale's Lake site is a \n38,000-acre farm that currently employs 90 employees and has a local \neconomic impact of approximately $6.5 million. Let me say that again. \nWe are being asked to consider a 30,000-acre footprint at Hale's Lake \nwhere we are going to take 90 jobs and we are going to replace them \nwith 52 jobs, where they have $6.5 million worth of economic impact and \nwe are going to go to a situation where the Federal Government doesn't \npay property taxes.\n  The core of the Sandsbank outlying landing field site contains 1,269 \nacres of wetland. Let me say this again. The core of the Sandsbank \n30,000 acres contains 1,269 acres of wetlands. In October of 2007, the \nNorth Carolina Division of Water Quality recommended that the Sandsbank \nsite not be pursued. Why? Because of the significance of wetlands.\n  I say to my colleagues--and I think we will probably lose this \namendment and we will have a voice vote on it--I think it is important \nto understand, North Carolina has taken option after option after \noption to the Navy. As a matter of fact, this is our second round after \nthey shortcut an environmental impact study and the courts got involved \nfor a site they had picked and had already purchased the land. They are \nnow in the unusual position of having a lot of land and they can't \nbuild the site there based upon where the environmental impact study \nsent them because they were trying to put it next to one of the largest \nmigratory bird areas on the east coast. Not a smart thing when you want \nto have pilots taking jets in. It has to go through the environmental \nimpact study whether they pick the Sandsbank site or whether they pick \nthe Hale Lake's site. So I am not sure if the EIS will allow them to go \nto Sandsbank where there are 1,269 acres of wetlands that will be \nincorporated into this. Those are all out there.\n  We have communities today that are being affected. They are being \naffected by the fact that property can't sell, that people don't want \nto move there because they don't know whether there is going to be a \nnaval jet base. They don't know whether there is going to be a 30,000-\nacre protected area where all night long you are going to have aircraft \ngoing in, and it only produces 52 jobs for the local community. Not a \nvery good trade-off on the part of North Carolina. Not a very good \naction on the part of the military.\n  I ask my colleagues--I think we probably know the outcome of the \nvote, but\n\n[[Page S7987]]\n\nwe have to be vigilant. North Carolina is an incredible State when it \nrelates to our military. That doesn't mean that the military can walk \nin and make a decision that is inconsistent with what is good for our \nState, and potentially forces an adverse relationship between the State \nand the military. They pushed it in and that is why the General \nAssembly did what they did. It is my hope that as this bill moves \nthrough conference, since the House has this provision in it, at least \nthis provision will prevail.\n  I thank my colleagues, I thank the Chair, and I thank the ranking \nmember for their understanding and allowing me to bring this amendment \nup. It is important that every Member understand what is involved and \nat the core of this. It is the lives of the people in North Carolina. \nIt is the ability to have predictability in the future and not \nnecessarily a decision that may linger for 6 or 7 or 10 years with \nindividuals not knowing what the disposition of the Navy decision is \ngoing to be and, therefore, a market for their property or the plans \nfor the next generation of farmer as it might relate to Hale's Lake, \nnot knowing exactly how to plan their lives.\n  I would suggest that we call the question on this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in reluctant opposition to the \namendment offered by my friend from North Carolina. He and the other \nSenator, the junior Senator from North Carolina, argued passionately \nand, to some degree, persuasively in the markup of this legislation.\n  I think it is very appropriate that they are reacting to local \nconcerns and perhaps even the fact that I think, in straight talk, \nperhaps the Department of the Navy has not approached some of these \ncommunities in a way that would gain the cooperation of the \ncommunities.\n  I agree also with Senator Burr that the people of North Carolina are \namong the most patriotic that we have in our Nation. But facts are \nfacts, and the Navy needs a field to train carrier pilots stationed on \nthe east coast within the range of both Naval Air Station Oceana and \nMarine Corps Air Station Cherry Point in North Carolina. The Navy needs \nto field trained pilots in order for us to have the best qualified \npilots in the world. Part of that training, of course, is to learn \nlanding on aircraft carriers, among other types of training.\n  Again, a lot of local communities in North Carolina and Virginia have \nexpressed concern about noise, about hours, and about the impact it \nwill have on their communities. During the markup we adopted an \namendment by the Senator from Virginia, Mr. Webb, that basically \nrequires the Navy to do extensive consultation with local communities, \nto consider assistance to local communities in case there is \nsubstantial economic impact, and to do everything they can to reach an \nagreement with the local communities as they go through this siting \nprocedure.\n  Madam President, I cannot change geography. I think this committee \ncan do a lot of things, but we cannot change the map. The map is that \ntwo of our major air stations, Oceana and Cherry Point, are where our \npilots and air wings are stationed. They have to have the ability to \ntrain, and they have to train someplace within a reasonable range.\n  So I believe after a spirited discussion in committee, the Senator \nfrom Virginia came up with a very excellent amendment that basically \nrequires a lot more participation in the local communities, a lot more \nconsideration and consultation, and even--I have never seen this \nbefore--some economic assistance to the local communities, if \nnecessary. Nobody likes to be awakened at 1 or 2 a.m. by the sound of \njet engines. I understand that. But I also understand--and I hope our \ncolleagues do--that on the entire east coast, because of population and \nthe location of these two major bases--Cherry Point and Oceana--we \ndon't have much choice but to look in Virginia and North Carolina. We \ncannot let, over time, that requirement be overridden forever. We can \ntry to accommodate and understand, and we can try to do whatever is \nnecessary to ease the burden. But the fact is, our pilots have to \ntrain.\n  I appreciate the fact that both Senators from North Carolina were \neloquent in stating the concerns their local communities have, which \nmay be under consideration for the location of an airfield--just as the \nSenator from Virginia was concerned; but the Senator from Virginia, I \nthink, in his amendment, laid out some parameters that I think will \nlead to a fair process, which will take into consideration the very \nunderstandable concerns of the local communities.\n  With reluctance but concern for the ability of our Navy and Marine \nCorps pilots to train and be adequately prepared to fight, I oppose \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I also reluctantly oppose this amendment. \nSenator Burr and Senator Hagan have both been very eloquent in their \npositions, and it is understandable how they and their States feel in \nthis matter. The Navy has not done a particularly good job.\n  Senator Webb, in committee, suggested some important language that \nwill, hopefully, be helpful. Senator Webb was equally eloquent in his \nposition. We adopted that report language. I think we should stand with \nit. It is simply not good public policy for Congress to prematurely \nlimit training locations--particularly when those sites have not been \nfully considered by the military.\n  So it is, hopefully, going to prod the Navy to do a lot better in \nterms of its consultation and communications with our communities in \nNorth Carolina, Virginia, and around the country. I also must oppose \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1519) was rejected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I move to reconsider that vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I see the Senator from Oklahoma here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we set \naside the current pending amendment for the consideration of Inhofe \namendment No. 1559.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1710\n\n(Purpose: To provide for classified information procedures for military \n  commissions, and to provide for interlocutory appeals by the United \n        States of certain orders and rulings of military judges)\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be laid aside temporarily and that it be in order for me to \noffer an amendment on behalf of myself, Senator Graham, and Senator \nMcCain.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin] for himself, Mr. \n     Graham, and Mr. McCain, proposes an amendment numbered 1710.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in the Record of Wednesday, July 23, 2009, \nunder ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the amendment I now offer, along with \nSenators Graham and McCain, would modify the procedures for the \nhandling of classified evidence by military commissions. This is \nlanguage that was requested by the administration witnesses at our \nhearing on military commissions procedures a few weeks ago.\n  We have worked closely together, and we have worked closely with the \nadministration on the language. It is our\n\n[[Page S7988]]\n\nunderstanding that this amendment will fully address the \nadministration's concerns. It has the support of the Justice Department \nand the Department of Defense.\n  Section 1031 of the bill, which addresses military commissions, is \nbased on the standard established by the Supreme Court in the Hamdan \ncase that military commissions should be conducted in a manner \nconsistent with the procedures applicable in trials by courts-martial, \nand that any deviation from those procedures be justified by ``evident \npractical need.'' For this reason, the procedures now in the bill for \nthe handling of classified information are based on the procedures \nestablished in the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\n\n  However, the witnesses at our July 7 hearing on military commissions \nmade a persuasive case that the procedures for the handling of \nclassified information in Federal court--the Classified Information \nProcedures Act, or CIPA--would provide a better model for handling \nclassified information. The reason is, the Federal courts have far more \nexperience handling classified information and far more precedent \napplicable to the difficult issues raised by classified information in \ndetainee cases. DOD general counsel Jeh Johnson explained the issue as \nfollows:\n\n       [W]e note that the legislation incorporates certain of the \n     classified evidence procedures currently applicable in \n     courts-martial, where there is relatively little precedent \n     and practice regarding classified information.\n\n  Mr. Johnson continues:\n\n       We in the administration believe that further work could be \n     done to codify the protections of classified evidence, in a \n     manner consistent with the protections that now exist in \n     Federal civilian courts. We believe that those protections--\n     --\n\n  Referring to the Federal civilian court protections----\n\n     would work better to protect classified information, while \n     continuing to ensure fairness and providing a stable body of \n     precedent and practice for doing so.\n\n  VADM Bruce McDonald, the Judge Advocate General of the Navy, \ntestified in a very similar way. He said:\n\n       Section 949d provides for the use of rules of evidence in \n     trials by general courts-martial in the handling of \n     classified evidence. This is consistent with our overall \n     desire to use those procedures found within the UCMJ . . . \n     whenever possible. However, experience has shown that \n     practitioners struggle with a very complex and unclear rule \n     within the Military Rules of Evidence. The military rules do \n     not have a robust source of informative or persuasive case \n     law. Frankly, prosecutions using Military Rule of Evidence \n     505 are rare. In developing the rules for the handling of \n     classified material during a military commission, it would be \n     more prudent to rely upon the Classified Information \n     Procedures Act (CIPA) used in Article III courts as a \n     starting point.\n\n  Since the time of the hearing, we have been working on a bipartisan \nbasis with the administration to produce new language on the handling \nof classified information, consistent with the recommendations of our \nwitnesses. In accordance with those recommendations, and our own \nthinking and discussion, the language in the amendment we are \nconsidering today tracks very closely with CIPA. In a few areas, we \nhave chosen to codify standards that are applicable case law under CIPA \nto provide additional clarity.\n  The amendment is consistent with the intention of the bill to apply \nestablished procedures to military commissions and to deviate from \nthose established procedures, where justified, by evident practical \nneed. There is an evident practical need here. We have a good \nexperience under CIPA, and we decided that is the better model to \nfollow.\n  We also believe the procedures in this amendment will facilitate the \nhandling of classified information in trials by military commissions in \na way that is fair to both sides.\n  I have a letter from the Department of Justice on this matter which I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       U.S. Department of Justice,\n\n\n                                Office of Legislative Affairs,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Carl Levin,\n     Chairman.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Armed Services, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain: This letter \n     expresses the strong support of the Department of Justice for \n     the Levin-Graham-McCain amendment to S. 1390, the ``National \n     Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010,'' regarding \n     classified information procedures for military commissions.\n       The amendment would establish a system for addressing \n     classified information issues in military commissions that is \n     similar to the system provided by the Classified Information \n     Procedures Act (``CIPA'') for criminal cases prosecuted in \n     Federal court. Although CIPA might need to be updated in some \n     respects to address terrorism cases more effectively, we \n     believe it has generally worked well both in protecting \n     national security and ensuring fair proceedings. The Levin-\n     Graham-McCain amendment adapts CIPA to the military \n     commissions context, with some modifications to reflect \n     lessons learned from past terrorism prosecutions. The \n     amendment expressly provides that the judicial construction \n     of CIPA shall, in most instances, be authoritative in \n     interpreting the analogous provisions in the amendment. It \n     sets substantive standards for providing the defense access \n     to classified information in the discovery phase, and for the \n     use of classified information at trial. It also establishes a \n     range of tools and procedures, such as protective orders, ex \n     parte hearings, alternatives to disclosure of classified \n     information, expanded interlocutory appeal rights, and \n     sanctions for failure to comply, that will provide \n     appropriate guidance to military judges in handling these \n     complex issues as they arise in the course of military \n     commission proceedings.\n       The Department of Justice consulted at length with \n     committee staff as they developed this amendment, and we are \n     grateful for their work on this important issue. We believe \n     the amendment will advance the President's objective of \n     reforming the commissions and ensuring that they are a fair, \n     legitimate, and effective forum for the prosecution of law of \n     war offenses.\n       The Office of Management and Budget has advised us that, \n     from the standpoint of the Administration's program, there is \n     no objection to the submission of this letter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Ronald Weich,\n                                       Assistant Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Again, I thank Senator Graham and Senator McCain. Senator \nGraham is an expert we all look to in matters such as this. He has not \nonly personal experience but he has a vast amount of personal knowledge \nfrom study, as well as his own experience in this area, and it is \ninvaluable to us. It does help make possible the conclusion we offer \nthe body.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I would like to, once again, thank \nChairman Levin for the work he has done in this bill on the structure \nof military commissions. I appreciate his working closely with me and \nwith Senator Graham, and I believe that the changes in this bill put \nour military commissions framework on a solid footing so that our \nnation will be ready to proceed with the trials of terrorist detainees \nby military commission.\n  In the same vein, I am pleased to cosponsor Senator Levin's amendment \nNo. 1710, which deals with the protection of classified information \nused in military commissions. This amendment is based on extensive \nmeetings between our staffs and the professional prosecutors who wish \nto ensure that classified information receives the fullest possible \nprotection in the course of these trials.\n  The amendment is based in large part on the Classified Information \nProcedures Act, CIPA, which includes protections for the use of \nclassified information in trials. Based on 20 years of experience with \nCIPA, and with 3 years of experience with the Military Commissions Act, \nthe protections contained in this amendment are what the professional \nprosecutors believe they need to ensure that classified information is \nnot improperly disclosed and to allow trials to proceed more \nefficiently by providing military judges with an extensive body of law \nbased on CIPA upon which to base their decisions. Avoiding the \nunauthorized disclosure of classified information is a key to ensuring \nthe protection of our national interests, and so I am pleased to \nadvocate the adoption of this amendment. I note that the Departments of \nDefense and Justice concur with the language contained in this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support its adoption.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the Classified Information Procedures \nAct, CIPA, provides a framework for using classified information in \ncriminal cases. It is a valuable and flexible tool that allows courts \nto review classified information and provide for the protection of such \nmaterial while ensuring a defendant's right to a fair trial. And it \nworks. For close to 30 years, Federal courts have used CIPA to \nsuccessfully\n\n[[Page S7989]]\n\nhandle complex criminal cases, including hundreds of terrorism-related \ncases since 9/11, and still protect sensitive information from public \ndisclosure.\n  I reintroduced the State Secrets Protection Act this Congress, \nlegislation that would allow the Government to claim the State secrets \nprivilege while ensuring that a judge would review the evidence the \nGovernment is relying upon to determine whether the privilege applies. \nThis concept mirrors CIPA and our bill draws heavily from CIPA \nprocedures. But our bill does not water them down.\n  I was encouraged to see that Senator Levin, along with Senators \nGraham and McCain, proposed an amendment to the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 that would provide procedures in \nline with CIPA for handling classified information in military \ncommissions. One of the complaints that we have heard about commissions \ninvolves procedural confusion, including how to approach the handling \nof classified information. As Senator Levin pointed out, ``the unique \nprocedures and requirements hampered the ability of defense teams to \nobtain information.''\n  In recent testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Vice \nAdmiral MacDonald, the Judge Advocate General for the U.S. Navy, \ndiscussed the difficulty that prosecutors have had using military rules \nfor classified evidence and acknowledged:\n\n       [T]he military rules on the use of classified information \n     fall short of our overall goals. On the other hand, for over \n     20 years, Article III courts have relied upon the Classified \n     Information Procedures Act, or CIPA.\n\n  David Kris, the Assistant Attorney General for the Department of \nJustice's National Security Division, agreed that CIPA ``has generally \nworked well in both protecting classified information and ensuring \nfairness of proceedings'' and that drawing on CIPA would ``allow \nmilitary judges to draw on a substantial body of CIPA case law and \npractice that has been developed over the years.''\n  I agree that, especially with this novel use of military commissions, \nit is crucial that we draw on evidentiary standards supported by \nprecedent and a proven track record. However, I am concerned that some \nof the modifications proposed by this amendment would depart from the \ntraditional protections provided by CIPA. For example, CIPA requires \nthe Attorney General to certify that the disclosure of certain \ninformation would cause identifiable damage to the national security of \nthe United States. Here, an unidentified ``knowledgeable United States \nofficial'' would make that declaration, instead. This amendment also \nimports a new standard that would require a judge to consider whether \ndisclosure of information would be ``detrimental to national \nsecurity.'' It would further prohibit the accused from appealing a \ncourt order allowing the Government to withhold access to information \nbased on an ex parte proffer by the Government. This marks a serious \ndeparture from CIPA's framework for allowing defendants to reconsider \nsuch rulings in order to ensure that they are allowed meaningful access \nto evidence and can present a thorough defense.\n  I support the administration and Senator Levin's goal of using more \narticle III standards in military commissions, and the use of CIPA \nprocedures is certainly a marked improvement. However, it is important \nthat we not minimize the protections and standards that make tools like \nCIPA effective in protecting both classified information and the rights \nof the accused. Until we have a more thorough review and understanding \nof why these changes are necessary, I believe we should proceed \ncautiously before we depart from the standards that have served us well \nfor so long in our Federal jurisprudence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his kind \ncomments. I have been a military lawyer for a while, but I am smart \nenough to know what I don't know.\n  The bottom line is judge advocates, to a person, have indicated the \nprocedures as outlined by Senator Levin would be the best way to go. \nUnder the civilian Classified Information Procedures Act, there is a \nrobust body of cases. Military rule of evidence 505(b) is not used very \noften in courts-martial. What we have tried to do is interject into the \ncommissions some reforms that will make the trials go forward in a \nmanner that the courts are likely to approve the work product.\n  I think everybody involved--military judges, defense counsel, \nprosecutors--welcome this change. Senator Levin and his staff and our \nstaffs have worked with the White House. I think we found a way to \nreform the military commissions that would provide balance when it \ncomes to admission of classified evidence to protect the Nation at \nlarge and also allowing the people accused of a crime as much access as \npossible.\n  Every military lawyer who is going to be involved in the commissions \nsupports this change. I think it is one way to make the commissions \nbetter. This whole effort to make the commissions better is bearing \nfruit. I appreciate what Senator Levin has done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, there is now pending an amendment that I \nhave offered on behalf of myself, Senator Graham, and Senator McCain \nrelative to the protection of classified information; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1710, offered by Senator Levin, \nis pending, yes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I think we are now ready to vote on this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1710) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The pending matter now would be to return to the Akaka \namendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am sorry I couldn't be down here this \nafternoon, and I apologize to my colleagues that we will have a delay \non this bill, probably with cloture, until tomorrow morning. My \nstatement is in no way meant to reflect any ill will on Senator Akaka \nor Senator Collins or Senator Voinovich or Senator Lieberman, but we \nhave before us in this amendment something that is intolerable to the \nunemployed people in this country today, or should be intolerable to \neverybody.\n  In fact, what we are going to do is take $3.1 billion and give it to \nFederal employees in their retirement systems and adjustments to \nretirement systems when we have 9.5 percent unemployment and we have \nsix States with over 15 percent. What we should be doing is taking that \n$3 billion and making sure we are creating jobs so people have jobs in \nthis country rather than paying Federal workers.\n  I want to enter into the Record what the average pay and benefits are \nfor Federal employees because most Americans are unaware.\n  The average Federal pay and benefit for an employee of the Postal \nService is $80,353 a year. If you work at the Pentagon, but you are not \na soldier, your average pay and benefit is $89,000 a year. If you are a \nsoldier, it is about $25,000 less than that. The guy taking the bullets \nis making $25,000 less than the civilians working in the Pentagon. Then \nyou have all the rest of the Federal employees, and their average is \n$113,000. That is twice what the average wage in this country is, and \nwe have attached this amendment to this bill--an amendment which has \nnothing to do with the Defense Department, it has to do with adjusting \npension benefits for Federal employees outside of the Defense \nDepartment.\n\n[[Page S7990]]\n\n  I think our Federal employees are valuable, and I do not mind paying \nthem. But I do mind spending more money at that level now when we have \na large number of people who are unemployed. If we count people who are \nnot looking for work anymore because they are so discouraged, we have \nover 15 percent unemployment. The very idea that we would take $3.2 \nbillion from our grandkids to add to a program, when we have millions \nand millions of Americans not collecting a paycheck at all, to me, is \ninappropriate. We can't afford it because we are going to charge it to \nthe next two generations. We don't have the money.\n  That reminds me. If we go back and talk about where we are in this \ncountry, we have the first $4 trillion budget ever, this year. That is \nwhat is going to be spent--$4 trillion in 1 year. We are spending $1 \ntrillion more this year in the last 7 months than we did last year in \nthis country. We have passed bill after bill after bill after bill that \nwe can't afford to buy things that we don't need with money we don't \nhave.\n  Let me, for my colleagues, read the unemployment rates throughout the \ncountry: Alabama, 10.1 percent; Alaska, 8.4; Arizona, 8.7; Arkansas, \n7.2; California, 11.6; Colorado, 7.6; Connecticut, 8 percent; Delaware, \n8.4 percent; Washington, DC, 10.9 percent; Florida, 10.6 percent; \nGeorgia, 10.1; Hawaii, 7.4 percent; Idaho, 8.4 percent; Illinois, 10.3 \npercent; Indiana, 10.7 percent; Iowa, 6.2; Kansas, 7 percent; Kentucky, \n10.9 percent unemployment; Louisiana, 6.8; Maine, 8.5 percent; \nMaryland, 7.3 percent; Massachusetts, 8.6 percent; Michigan, 15.2 \npercent.\n  What would the people of Michigan do with $3 billion to invest in \njobs in Michigan right now?\n  Minnesota, 8.4 percent; Mississippi, 9 percent; Missouri, 9.3 \npercent; Montana 6.4 percent; Nebraska, 5 percent; Nevada, 12 percent; \nNew Hampshire, 6.8 percent; New Jersey, 9.2 percent; New Mexico 6.8 \npercent; New York, 8.7 percent; New York, 11 percent; North Dakota, 4.2 \npercent; Ohio, 11.1 percent; Oklahoma, 6.3 percent; Oregon 12.2 \npercent; Pennsylvania, 8.3 percent; Puerto Rico, 14.5 percent; Rhode \nIsland, 12.4 percent; South Carolina, 12.1 percent; Tennessee, 10.8. If \nI missed South Dakota, it is 5.1; Tennessee, 10.8 percent; Texas, 7.5 \npercent; Utah, 5.7 percent; Vermont, 7.1 percent; Virginia, 7.2 \npercent; Washington State, 9.3 percent; West Virginia, 9.2 percent; \nWisconsin, 9 percent; and Wyoming 5.9 percent.\n  Those are just percentages. But you know what they represent? They \nrepresent real hard-core pain for American families today. The fact \nthat we would have the gumption to come and take another $3 billion \nfrom them to increase the benefit structure of Federal employees at a \ntime when what we should be doing is seeing how we can become more \nefficient in the Federal Government and spend less money in the Federal \nGovernment flies in the face of the difficulties that these individuals \nfind themselves faced with.\n  If you look at what is actually happening to our country and take the \n75-year projections, this year we are going to spend under $200 billion \nin interest. Eight years from now we are going to spend $806 billion in \ninterest just on the interest rates we have today.\n  How many people believe we will have a Fed discount rate of a quarter \nof 1 percent 8 years from now and that we will be able to borrow money \non a 10-year T-bill at 3.6 percent? It isn't going to happen. We are \ngoing down the road to destruction, and we are clueless about how to \nsolve it.\n  So if we add up the 75-year projected unfunded liabilities for \nMedicare and if we add up the 75-year unfunded liabilities for Medicaid \nand if we add up the 75-year unfunded liabilities for Social Security \nand if we add up the 75-year unfunded liabilities for Federal employee \nretirement and if we add up the 75-year unfunded liabilities for \nmilitary retirement and if we add up the 75-year unfunded liabilities \nfor every other trust fund this Congress and Congresses before have \nrobbed the money from to spend now--which should have been endowed--\nwhat we come to is $100 trillion.\n  If we look at what our population is expected to be then, and the \npercentage that would not be working in the workforce--in other words, \nthe very young children and the very large 40 percent of that \npopulation that is going to be retired--what we end up having is an \nunfunded obligation for every one of those people who are going to be \nthe taxpayers of $500,000 apiece. That doesn't include the debt we have \nnow, which is $11.4 trillion--which is going to double to $22 trillion \nover the next 10 years--and the internal debt of that will triple. So \nnow we have $122 trillion worth of liabilities. Yet we are saying, now \nis the time to increase the benefits for Federal employees.\n  I don't deny that the Federal employees do great work. But when you \nlook at what the average pay plus benefit is for Federal employees \nversus everybody else in the country, now is not the time to do it. Not \nonly because, No. 1, we can't afford it; but, No. 2, it is patently \nunfair to everybody else in this country based on the average salaries.\n\n  So the fact that we would add an amendment onto the Defense bill--\nbecause it is a bill that is going to move; there is no question it \nwould not survive cloture--that doesn't bother me. I have done that a \nlot. What bothers me is that we lack the perspective of what is \nhappening. We passed a $787 billion stimulus bill, of which only $80 \nbillion has gone out the door. The unemployment rate is still rising--\nand I am not critical. This body passed it. But it is not going to be \nhighly stimulative because most of it was not meant to be stimulative. \nIt was meant to be transfer payments. But we have spent that, and that \nis all borrowed money. We passed an omnibus. We passed a supplemental. \nNone of that was paid for. Not a penny of it was paid for. That is all \nborrowed.\n  So what we have done is we are going to add $2.2 trillion to our debt \nthis year, and now we have something that, well, it just adds a measly \nlittle $3.2 billion. But think about what $3.2 billion would do to help \npeople who don't have a job in this country today. Instead, we are \ngoing to enhance the benefits of Federal employees. To me, it is an \ninsult to every other worker who is out there who is either struggling \nto keep their job--and, by the way, we are going to add 100,000 Federal \nemployees this year. So these numbers are underestimating what the real \ncost is.\n  Here is the amendment. It is 49 pages long. It has six major titles \nin it--adjusting. We allow people who left the government to come back \nand put their money back in, and we will say: Oh, you didn't leave, so \nyou didn't lose any of your retirement. You still get it compounded.\n  We have institutionalized sick pay and we have made it an \nentitlement. We have said everybody who has ever worked for the DC \ngovernment, they can work for the Federal Government and all of their \nretirement years will transfer to the Federal Government. But we don't \ndo that for anybody else who works for any other State government. We \ncertainly don't do that for people who have retirement plans from any \nother company. We don't add that retirement to the Federal \nGovernment's. So why are we doing things that are patently unfair to \nthe rest of the American workforce in this country?\n  I plan on speaking on this bill until cloture ripens, which means we \nare going to be here all night. Until this amendment is withdrawn, I \nwill stay here, or I will have a colleague stay here, and we will talk \nabout how this country is out of control in its spending. We will talk \nabout how we have failed the American people by not being good \nstewards; how we have not done oversight on the $350 billion worth of \nwaste every year. Not one amendment has passed that has gotten rid of \nany of the waste that this government wastes every year. Not one has \ngotten through this Congress. Not one.\n  We are getting ready to work on a health care bill. We have been \nworking on it. We have spent a ton of time on it. We have $120 billion \nworth of fraud in Medicare and Medicaid, but we haven't addressed that \nat all. It is not being addressed. We are twiddling our thumbs as \nMedicare goes bankrupt, while Medicare doesn't offer the services that \nare promised, and we are going to create another $1.6 trillion worth of \ncost for the American people. The only thing I can figure is that \nWashington thinks we can spend more money to save money in a \nsignificant way. We have been trying to do that since 1965 and it \nhasn't worked once, and it isn't going to work this time.\n  Let me mention, for a minute, just some of the things that we have \nbeen doing that do not fit with the priorities\n\n[[Page S7991]]\n\nof American citizens. It does not come anywhere close to matching what \nevery family in this country is doing today. Here is what they are \ndoing.\n  First of all, they are scared and they are fearful and they are \nworried. Do you know what they are doing? We see it in the economic \nstatistics. When consumer spending drives normally 70 percent of our \neconomy, we have the highest savings rate we have had in 40 years \nbecause they are afraid to spend. One of the reasons they are afraid to \nspend is because they don't trust what we are doing up here. They think \nthings might get worse. I think things are going to get better, but \nthey are certainly not going to get better by spending another $3.2 \nbillion in this way.\n  What they do is they sit down as a family and they say here is what \nis coming in and here is the auto payment and here is the house payment \nand here is what we have to have for groceries and here is the utility \nbills. What is left? In other words, they make a list of priorities. \nThey decide what has to be done, what must be done, but what they want \nto do comes last because we are in tough times. That applies to almost \nevery family in this country. It implies heartaches because it means a \nfather is not doing something he would like to do for his son or a \nmother is not buying a new dress for a daughter to help her own self-\nesteem in comparison with other children. It has real-world factors on \nfamilies.\n  They make those hard decisions every day, absolutely every day. The \nreason they make those hard decisions is they do not lack the courage \nto face reality, such as we do. They also do not have the other option \nwe have, and that is charging our lack of courage to the next two \ngenerations.\n  Most Americans are not cowards. They look at the real world, they \nlook at what is responsible of them, what decision is going to have to \nbe made. They dig in their heels, they work and work to solve the \nproblem, and they will go through tough times doing the very best they \ncan to make good of a bad situation.\n  That is opposite the behavior this place has been displaying. We have \nignored the fact that we have $11.4 trillion worth of debt. We passed a \nstimulus spending bill, of which less than $150 billion was true \nstimulus. We have created dependencies of, now, the States. Anytime \nthey are in tough times, they have now been infected with our illness: \nDon't worry about it, we will just charge it to the next generation. \nBecause every State we helped through the stimulus we did charge it to \nthe next generation. We have now instituted lack of discipline by every \nState legislature in the country because now they no longer have to \nworry about it. The Senate will just borrow from their grandkids and \nsend it to them and now they don't have to worry about it, they don't \nhave to have any courage to make the tough decisions.\n  What all have we done that would secure the honor of the American \npeople, that we are working for them? What symbol have we given them, \nin terms of limiting our excesses in Washington, that might give them \nhope?\n  The Akaka amendment is the opposite of that. It is saying: You don't \nget it, your priorities are not right. You think you can forget what \nhas happened to us. You think you can charge it to our grandchildren \nand our children. You think you can steal their opportunity and nobody \nis ever going to know it.\n  I have barked up this tree a lot in the last 5 years in this body, \nand I am not ever going to stop barking up this tree because it is \nmorally wrong to steal the future from your grandchildren. It is \nmorally wrong. It is not just ethically wrong, it is not just \nconveniently wrong, it is morally wrong to take the great attributes of \nthis country away from your children and grandchildren. It is time for \nsome grownups to start making hard decisions that may cost us \nreelection but are in the best long-term interests of this country.\n  So this issue is not going to go away. I may ultimately get defeated \non it, but those families out there who do not have a job, those \nfamilies out there making those hard choices every day--every night \nworrying where is the money to buy the food that is going on the table \nthe next day, who still have a job--they are going to know somebody is \ngoing to fight for some common sense in the Senate.\n  There is no question, I lost this amendment in committee. I was \nmortified at the lack of sensitivity to the rest of this country, \nplacing Federal employees' very good benefits--enhancing those above \nthe negatives that are occurring to every family in this country based \non our economic situation. Even if we were not having a tough economic \ntime, it would still be wrong to do this. It would still be incorrect \nto do this.\n  If you think for a minute about what it costs to fund the interest \ncosts on $500,000--if it is 6 percent, it is $30,000 a year. If I were \na schoolteacher here and we had a blackboard, I would be making \neverybody write home that I am sorry I am stealing $30,000 a year from \neach of your children. That is what I would be doing--I am sorry I am \nstealing $30,000 a year just to pay the interest, never mind paying the \nprincipal off, on what we have accumulated.\n  Take a young child 6 years of age today and extrapolate that out to \nright before their retirement. What you have done is you have stolen \ntheir opportunity to have the American dream because it is not just \ngoing to be the $30,000, because all the years they can't work it is \ngoing to build that they will have to pay and all the years in their \nretirement are going to be less because they will not have the \nbenefits.\n  By the way, if you are a Federal employee and unhappy with me trying \nto defeat this amendment, you should pay attention to something. There \nis no guarantee to your Federal pension based on the economics we face \ntoday in this country. If you think it is guaranteed, you have another \nthought coming because the world economic system is going to determine \nwhether we can honor that pension. That is what is coming. We are very \nclose.\n  It was not long ago that Alan Greenspan was asked a question: What is \nthe maximum limit which we can borrow? There is a lot of question about \nwhether people want to loan us money anymore. What he said is, I don't \nknow what it is, but I can tell you we are getting very close.\n  What happens to us when we tap out? You know, he is not an \nunrespected thinker in materials of economics and banking.\n  Here is what happens to us. Interest rates that are 3.6 percent for a \n10-year government note go to 7 percent, 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 \npercent. All of a sudden, the cost of funding our debt becomes $2 or $3 \ntrillion a year, 20 years from now. What is the option? The option is \nthere not be any government pensions, there will not be any Medicare. \nWe will barely have money to defend our country. All these wonderful \nFederal programs that we have, most of which have a duplicate somewhere \nin the Federal Government that they defend, that we cannot get rid of \nbecause they have a constituency that somebody might be afraid, if we \neliminate some of the $350 billion in waste, fraud, and duplication, \nthey are not going to be there.\n  So what it comes down to and what we are facing is, can our Republic \nsurvive our excesses? Can we survive this tremendous direction that we \nhave stepped away from reality, saying economic forces do not apply to \nus? The answer to that is no. There will not be a Federal pension when \ninterest is at 10 or 12 percent and we have $35 or $40 trillion worth \nof debt.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. Certainly.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator have an estimate how much this will cost \nthe taxpayers?\n  Mr. COBURN. Over the first 10 years, $3.3 billion.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I understand from the amendment there is a provision that \nall the money is paid back.\n  Mr. COBURN. It is another trick and game. There is an assumption it \nwill be paid back, but it will never be paid back. What it will do is \nincrease the obligations of the Federal taxpayer--that is myself and \nyou and all your families and everybody we represent--the liabilities \nof the people who are going to get the benefit from this amendment.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could the Senator tell me the connection between this \namendment and the Defense authorization bill?\n\n  Mr. COBURN. There is no connection between this amendment and the \nDefense authorization bill.\n\n[[Page S7992]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I say to the Senator from Oklahoma, I am in \nagreement. We do strange things around here, particularly late in \nconsideration of the bill. I thank him for at least bringing it to the \nattention of the American taxpayer.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to finish my line of thought \nbecause what I sense is the American people get it and we do not. The \nAmerican people are worried we do not get it. They are worried we think \nwe can continue spending money, not reform things, not make things more \nefficient, not eliminate duplication. What they know is this is not \nmonopoly money. They know this is not ``not real money.'' They know \nthis issue about us having common sense, about us being fiscally \nresponsible--they know the future of their children and their \ngrandchildren depends on whether we start acting the same way every \nother family in this country has to act. That is in the real world. It \nis not in the world of Washington that: Don't worry, we will put it off \nbecause the next election is much more important than I addressing this \nand taking the next tough vote. We are going to put it off.\n  I say to my colleagues, I have plenty of topics. I am going to spend \nthe next couple hours going through waste so the American people can \nactually see how well we have done with their money--waste and earmarks \nand things that benefit the well-heeled and the well-connected but hurt \nyour children and hurt your grandchildren.\n  Before I do that, I wish to spend a moment talking about what the \nheritage of our country is. How did American exceptionalism come into \nbeing? How is it that this became the greatest country in the world, \nthat had more technological advances than anybody else in the world? \nThat created the highest standard of living of any society ever known \nin the world? What was the glue, what was the key, what was the \ncharacteristic that allowed that to happen?\n  I will tell you what it was. It was called sacrifice. If you think \nback four or five generations in your family and you try to find out \nwhat was going on, no matter what your racial background is or what \nyour lineage is, what you saw was people willing, absolutely willing to \nsacrifice the short term to make sure the long term was better for \ntheir children, their family, and their grandchildren. That is what I \ncall a heritage of sacrifice. It is what made us great. It is what \ncreated this vast, great country.\n  I am sorry to say that, since I entered the area of public service--\nand one of the reasons I entered it was because I didn't see this \ntrait--is that, since 1994 I have not seen any change. Actually, it is \nworse.\n  When you take the oath to be a Senator, what it says is you will do \nwhat the Constitution says. You will uphold it, you will make sure it \nis protected, that you will follow it.\n  I have a bill, it is called the Enumerated Powers Act. It has a lot \nof cosponsors, but none of the big spenders here want to cosponsor it. \nDo you know why? Because it creates a challenge for wasteful spending. \nWhat it says is what our Founders thought was pretty important. They \nvery clearly, in article I, section 8 of our Constitution, listed out \nwhat the responsibilities of the Federal Government are. They listed \nthem out. What Madison and Jefferson wrote about when they wrote in \narticle I, section 8, they said people are going to try to say it is \nsomething different than this. They are trying to say the general \nwelfare clause is we can do anything we want. The commerce clause is--\ndon't believe them. That is not what we intended. Yet that happens \nevery day in this body. We abandon the intent.\n  We just had a hearing on a Supreme Court nominee and one of the \nquestions she was asked by a lot of us was: Are you going to uphold the \nConstitution?\n  Well, my thoughts and prayers would be that she will do a better job \nthan we do, because we get an F. And the American people know it. They \nknow we cannot tolerate this spending. They know we cannot tolerate \nthis debt. They know we cannot tolerate raising taxes on the American \npeople if we are going to hope to get out of this. Their wisdom needs \nto be brought here. And the way you bring your wisdom here is to let us \nknow. Hold us accountable. Call, e-mail, go to the offices, write to \nour homes, make sure that people who are representing you uphold that \noath of fulfilling the Constitution, honoring the tenth amendment.\n  You know, our Founders in the Bill of Rights put in the tenth \namendment, and it is a very important amendment, because it says: \nWhatever is not spelled out specifically under article I, section 8--\nhere is the limited things the Federal Government is supposed to do--is \nexplicitly reserved for the States and for the people.\n  So how is it that we are going to have a $2 trillion deficit this \nyear? I can tell you how it is. It is because we have ignored the \nConstitution. We have done things that are totally outside the realm \nour Founders thought we would ever do. We have taken over things that \nare truly the responsibilities of the States and the communities and \nindividuals. We have created dependency by the States, created \ndependency in all sorts of others.\n  I got a letter last week asking me to sponsor money for fire engines \nfor Oklahoma. When did buying firetrucks for Oklahoma become a part of \nthe U.S. Constitution? Am I supposed to steal money from people in \nPennsylvania and New Jersey and New York so Oklahoma can have fire \nengines, which is an Oklahoma responsibility? It is not even an \nOklahoma responsibility; it is a community responsibility.\n  As we create this dependency, we create something that is worse after \nit. If you cannot get it, you all of a sudden are a victim. That is why \nearmarks are so bad, because what they do is keep us from making the \ngreat and hard decisions we should make because we benefit from it \npolitically.\n  That is why several of us have fought since we have been here to \nchange the earmarking process so that the American people can see what \nit is about. And what you will see, you watch on this bill, on the \nappropriations bills that follow, is if somebody has an earmark in this \nbill, they will never vote against it. Because what they will be told \nby the chairman or ranking member of the committee the next time they \ngo to request something is: Oh, you requested something. I put it in \nthe bill, but you did not vote for the bill, so I am not going to give \nit to you.\n  What happens is, instead of looking at the content of a bill and the \nbest long-term interests of the country, we look at the content of the \nearmark and how we look back home to the well-heeled and the well-\nconnected few, the source of campaign, the source of political \nempowerment, instead of looking at our oath that says: You will follow \nthe Constitution.\n  There is no question we have the right to say where money goes. And \nthere is no question we should be able to have earmarks if they are \nauthorized, which means that a committee of your peers, through the \nAppropriations Committee, says: This is something we as a country ought \nto do. But you will not see that. What you see are not authorized \nearmarks. They do not go through a committee of your peers. So it \nbecomes the very foul stink that ends up corrupting the whole system of \nfollowing that Constitution and being loyal to that oath.\n  In 2016, every American is going to pay $13,000 on the national \ndebt--think about that--for interest. I said that wrong. Every American \nfamily is going to be responsible for $13,000 worth of interest on the \nnational debt. That is if it does not grow a penny from now. And we \nknow we are going to have trillion-dollar deficits from now for as long \nas we can see under the budget that has passed this body.\n  The average American family, do you have $13,000? Do you have $13,000 \nfor us to continue the excess of uncontrolled spending in Washington, \nthe excess of failing to do our job to eliminate waste and fraud and \nduplication? Do you have it? Maybe you ought to call us and borrow it \nfrom the Senators. Maybe you ought to ask us for it since we are the \nones labeling you with it.\n  So as you hear what we are saying today when we talk about what is \ngoing on, these are not just words; they are real facts that affect \nreal lives, that limit opportunity, that steal this wonderful country \nfrom us and our kids. Because what is happening is we are slowly \nputting handcuffs on ourselves. We are slowly diminishing our ability \nto be creative. We are slowly taking away the opportunity and the \nfreedom with which we have excelled.\n\n[[Page S7993]]\n\n  If, in fact, the government said more about how you live your life \nthan you say how you live your life, you have lost freedom. You have \nlost it. As we encounter this mountain, this truly high mountain of \ndebt, what is going to happen is those handcuffs are going to get \ntighter and tighter--they are not going to get tighter, they are going \nto get closer and closer together before we have little ability to get \nout of them, little opportunity to change.\n  We are close to being on an irreversible course. What we do and how \nwe do it over the next 2 years in this country is going to determine \nwhether your children live in freedom. And I do not mean controlled by \na dictator, I am talking about having the freedom to have the \nopportunity to work hard, to develop your skills, to take risks, and to \nhopefully reward yourself and your family so that, in fact, you can be \nbenevolent to someone else who may not be able to do that. That is what \nAmerica is all about.\n  We are losing. It is going away. And it goes away every week in this \nbody. Every week that we create another new government program that \nlimits your freedom and puts a bureaucrat between you and your choice, \nit goes away. Quite frankly, we have gotten pretty good at stealing \nyour freedom.\n  For me and the people I represent, we have had enough. We have had \nenough of the government deciding everything for us. We have had enough \nof judges not following the Constitution. We have had enough of Federal \nbureaucrats limiting our property rights, and what we can do on our own \nproperty. We have had enough of people telling us what our freedoms are \nand what they are not. We have had enough of the Federal bureaucracy in \neducation ruining our schools rather than giving us the freedom to \neducate the children the way we want; taking our taxes, absorbing 20 \npercent and sending 80 percent back and saying: You can have this money \nif you do this, this, this, and this. It is interesting, in the \nConstitution, there is no role for Federal education, no role for the \nFederal Government to be involved in education. None. Zero. Where did \nwe get the idea that 80 percent of the people who work in the \nDepartment of Education, who do not know how to teach a child, should \nbe telling the teachers in this country what to teach, and what to do, \nand what they can get paid for and what they cannot.\n  That is a loss of freedom, folks. You have a bureaucracy in \nWashington that determines the outcome of what your children's \neducation is going to be, rather than you determining what that outcome \nwill be.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will yield for a question.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know my colleague has given more time and effort to \nstudying the sickness that is affecting our Congress with regard to how \nwe spend money than anyone in this body, and he has taken a lot of heat \nfor standing up and raising these issues. I salute him for it.\n  But the amendment that is before us, it seems to me, is absolutely \ntypical of how out of step Congress is. This may be a swell amendment \nfor whoever benefits from it, but the people who are paying for it are \nnot aware that the money they have earned from the sweat of their brow \nis now going to somebody who got a better health care plan, a better \nretirement plan and higher pay than they get, and more job security \nthan they get.\n  In my home county, the unemployment rate is over 20 percent. Then we \nhave people with so much better jobs wanting more money. This is what, \na $2 billion amendment? I would ask you, is this not sort of a pretty \negregious example of the tendency we have to try to reward one group \nand ignore the cost that everybody else is going to have to pay?\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I would answer the Senator, yes, but it is even worse in \nanother way, and it is this: You know, we are not going to get killed \nby one big punch. It is going to be the little pinpricks. This is \nanother pinprick. The fact is, I would love for our Federal employees \nto get this benefit. But we cannot afford it, one.\n  No. 2, it is highly unfair to everybody else out there trying to \nstruggle right now to pay the taxes that pay those salaries. No. 3 is, \nwe do not even have the money to fund the pensions for the Federal \nemployees that we have promised right now. So it is about us getting it \nwrong. Our priorities are wrong. That is my whole point. There is no \ncommon sense to what we are doing.\n  Sure, it is nice, you can be lauded by all of the Federal employees: \nYou did this. You did this. You can get their vote. But what about the \nfuture of our Republic? What is going to happen to us?\n  I have a granddaughter who is going to be born in the next 2 weeks, \nand I am wondering if she will even recognize what I knew to be what we \nwere like in the 1950s, 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, because the freedom, the \ndiminution of our freedom in this country has been massive. It is in \ndirect correlation with the size of the growth of the Federal \nGovernment, directly correlated.\n  The bigger the Federal Government is, the less freedom we have. As it \ngets smaller, we can possibly get back some of our freedom. But we are \ntalking about growing the Federal Government, we are talking about \nmaking it bigger. We are talking about having it more involved in every \naspect of our life and taking away the ability of you and your family \nto make critical decisions about your family.\n  Are we totally dependent on the Federal Government? If that is where \nwe are, our freedom is lost. If we have decided we do not need the \nStates any more, get rid of all of the State legislatures; the Federal \nGovernment is doing it all anyway. And we do it so efficiently and so \nwell, you can interact with your bureaucrat so well. They always make \nsense, they are always 100 percent responsible. That is garbage.\n  The fact is, the farther away your government is from you, the less \ncontrol you have over it. There is no need, if we continue the \ndirection we are in, to have a city council. We are directing what you \nhave got to do on street lights now. We are going to tell you what car \nyou can drive.\n  I thank the Senator from Alabama for his question. I appreciate his \nhelp on a lot of these issues.\n  This is not anything other than a departure point for our country. So \nlet me spend a little time--first, let me tell you how good of a job we \ndo. We passed a $787 billion stimulus bill of which $70 billion is out \nthe door. So not even 10 percent, maybe 10 percent by this week; I have \nnot checked the Web site this week to see.\n  Let's talk about what has gone out the door. What has gone out the \ndoor in my home State in Perkins, OK, that to get the money for a new \nwater sewage system that the Federal Government said they had to have--\nState government did not say it, the Federal Government did--they had \nto spend an extra $2 million to build a water disposal and sewage plant \nthat originally was going to cost $4 million. Now it costs $6.2 \nmillion. Guess what they got from the Federal Government--$1.5 million.\n  Think about that for a minute. Here is the stimulus. There is no \nquestion some jobs are being created from that. There is no question \nthe citizens of that town will have to pay higher water rates and \nsewage rates to get a new plant. But what we did in the meantime of \nhaving the Federal Government involved in it is we raised the net cost \nof it by $500,000 so that the people who are going to benefit from it \nare going to end up paying water rates, sewage rates, at elevated \nlevels for a longer period of time because the Federal Government got \ninvolved in it.\n  It doesn't mean we didn't need the sewage plant. We did. It didn't \nmean the city fathers didn't do the best thing they could for the city. \nThey had to get a bond. So when somebody comes up and says, I am the \nFederal Government, here is $1.5 million, take it; and you say, maybe I \ncan help my city out and get this thing done--except the net result of \nthat is, it will actually end up costing $2 million more--ask yourself \na question: If you were to build a garage onto the back of your house \nand the Federal Government says: We will give you a grant to help you \ndo that, but when you finish up, the net cost to you is going to be \nabout 8 to 20 percent more than what it would have cost if you did it \nyourself, are you going to take that deal? No, you are not.\n  This is money that is already out the door on the stimulus. It is an \nexample of what happens when we lose common\n\n[[Page S7994]]\n\nsense and when we lose economic parameters with which to make \ndecisions.\n  No. 2, in the stimulus was, heretofore, before we got to the health \ncare bill that we just passed out, was the largest earmark in history, \n$2 billion. Here we have FutureGen. Let me tell you what we know about \nFutureGen. The idea behind it is pretty good. Let's figure out if we \ncan take coal and make it absolutely clean and take the carbon dioxide \nout of it and sequester the carbon dioxide and use this resource we \nhave and have a totally nonpolluting coal plant for generating \nelectricity. Good idea, right? It got canceled in late 2007 because the \nDepartment of Energy, relying on a study from the Massachusetts \nInstitute of Technology, said: We don't have the technology to do it. \nYou shouldn't spend the money. The technology isn't there.\n  Isn't it funny, in 4\\1/2\\ months that report gets ignored and we put \na $2 billion earmark in to build a coal plant that we don't have the \ntechnology for? Let me explain what will happen. We will spend that $2 \nbillion, but when the $2 billion is gone, they are going to come back \nand say: We almost got it. How about $2 billion more? We will get \nanother $2 billion earmark and another $2 billion earmark, and 5 to 10 \nyears from now, we will have $24 billion in it. Then they will either \ndo one or two things. They will say: We finally figured it out, which \nmeans had we waited to build on it a small prototype plant and \nperfected the technology, we could have done it for 5 percent of that, \nor they will say: It just didn't work. We can't do it. But we did it on \nthe basis of parochialism and the enhanced interest of some power \ncompanies that were well-heeled and well connected to this body. So now \nwe have $2 billion of your money going to a project that MIT says the \ntechnology isn't finished yet, and we should not be spending any money \nto build a final plant. Yet we did it. Yet the claim was that there \nweren't any earmarks in the stimulus bill.\n  Here is another fact that a lot of people don't know. Every fact I \nwill give you I can absolutely document, either from the Department of \nTransportation or somewhere else. We have over 230,000 major bridges in \ndisrepair. Remember Minneapolis. We have tons of those bridges. I am \nnot saying they will collapse, but structurally they have been deemed \nto need repair.\n  The stimulus bill spent $24 billion on roads, highways, and bridges. \nWe should have spent $100 billion because we really would have created \nfour times as many jobs. We would have bought things we know we will \nhave to buy anyhow, and we would have fixed problems we know we have \ntoday. If we are going to borrow money against our kids' future, it \nought to be on high-priority items that will truly benefit us and our \nkids rather than that which is not going to benefit us.\n  Here we have Wisconsin, which has 1,256 structurally deficient \nbridges--more than Florida, Colorado, Arizona, and Alaska combined. \nInstead of fixing those, they put $58 million into bridge repair to \nrepair 37 rural bridges that people hardly ever use. Why? How? How did \nit happen? We have interstate highway bridges that need to be repaired \nthat have tens of thousands of cars going over them every day, and \ninstead we repair a bridge to a bar. I guess that Rusty's Backwater \nSaloon is more important than the safety of kids on the highway.\n  Then we have a Florida project. When we build highways today, \nespecially interstates, we put these eco-passages underneath them so \nthat wild animals--sometimes cattle, if they are connected lands--can \nhave transportation underneath the highway without going around. Good \nidea. In Florida, we have a highway sitting there, and less than a \ncouple miles down the road we have an eco-passage, and a couple miles \nup the road we have one. We are going to spend $3.4 million to put \nanother one in because too many turtles are crossing the road and \ngetting hit. Maybe that is OK. But when we have a $11.4 trillion debt, \nwe are going to run a $2 trillion deficit this year, when everything we \nare spending this year--50 cents out of every dollar we spend, we are \nborrowing on the backs of our children--should we be spending this kind \nof money on turtles? There are plenty of turtles in Florida. It is \nprobably not going to have an ecological impact. But is that a \npriority? Is that something we should be doing? I think not.\n  We have a nonprofit that got fired for doing weatherization contracts \nin one of our States, for poor performance and noncompliance. We get \nthe stimulus, and guess who gets the contract--somebody who has already \ncheated the taxpayers. Nevada. Somebody has already been fired for \nnoncompliance and not doing appropriate work, and the first thing we do \nis we hire them back. Do you think there might not have been a \npolitical connection with the person who got that contract? Think it is \nstrange?\n  Here is my favorite. This is Oklahoma. In the wonderful wisdom of the \nCorps of Engineers, back in the late 1940s and 1950s in western \nOklahoma--fairly arid land, good for raising cattle, and where you can \nget irrigation, it is great for growing wheat--we built a dam and a \nspillway and generation and everything. Only one problem: There never \nwas any water that came to the lake.\n  So we have this little road that runs along the edge of it, and they \nreplaced the guardrails 2 years ago. Less than 10 cars a day in the \nregular summer season go across this, 3 average in the winter. The \nCorps of Engineers decides, since we have all this money, we need to \nreplace the guardrails. The reason they wanted to replace the \nguardrails is they are an inch and a half too short for the 10 cars \nthat go by there. But if you run off the road, you run into something \ndown there that is dry as a bone. You don't run into a lake. But \nbecause the Corps has the code that you have to have guardrails on \nanything around a lake, even if you don't have a lake there, we are \ngoing to spend millions of dollars putting guardrails around a \nnonexistent lake because the bureaucratic code is: Never do what is \nbest when you can do what is good for you. Here goes millions of \ndollars to build guardrails. I pretty well have gotten this one stopped \nby having my staff out there with the Corps, but had I not done it, we \nwould have spent the money.\n  What are we doing? Do you like the fact that the Federal Government \nis involved in all this? Do you think they are exhibiting wisdom and \nprudence?\n  We can take Elizabethtown, PA. They have had an old train station \nthat hasn't been used in 30 years. Granted, they could maybe use a \ntrain station, but they have been getting along pretty well without one \nfor 30 years in this particular location. We are going to spend \nmillions of dollars to renovate an old train station, not because we \nhave a need but because we have money to spend and it will create a \njob.\n  There is nothing wrong with having deficit spending, in terms of \nKeynesian economics, to try to stimulate the economy, but there ought \nto be a priority that what we spend the money on actually, in fact, is \na long-term benefit that we would have spent the money on anyway. When \nwe throw the money out there and we roll the dice, what happens is, \nyes, we get a benefit. We get the millions of dollars spent on our \nbehalf. It gets spent on our behalf. But was it the best way to spend \nthe money? Was there another priority that would have been better, that \nwould have created more jobs, that was something we truly have to have, \nthat would have created a permanent job, that would have helped truly \nstimulate the economy? Those questions are not getting asked.\n  Here is another one of my favorites. Part of the stimulus was that we \ngive seniors a check. I don't understand that, but we did. But the IRS \nsent checks to 10,000 dead people. It can happen. I could see how that \ncould happen, but 10,000? So if we are sending checks to 10,000 dead \npeople on a stimulus, what else are we not doing right at the IRS and \nevery other agency? I think it totaled $25 million.\n  Here is another one of my favorites: Union, NY. The town of Union was \nsurprised when it was notified that it would be receiving a $578,661 \nstimulus grant to prevent homelessness for several reasons. Here is \nanother interesting point: They never applied for the grant. Second, \nthey don't have a homeless problem. ``Union did not request the money \nand does not currently have any homeless programs in place in the town \nto administer such funds,'' said the town supervisor, John Bernardo. \n``We were surprised. We were never a recipient before.'' He is not \naware of\n\n[[Page S7995]]\n\nany homeless issue in the largely suburban town. Where did that one \ncome from? Where is the connection? The people at the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development just sent them a check. It is not their \nmoney. Get the money out the door. Send it to somebody who doesn't need \nit. When asked about it, HUD just sent the money to every town based on \nits population, whether it had a homeless problem or not.\n  When did it become, under the Constitution, a Federal responsibility \nrather than a community responsibility to take care of homeless people? \nAs we shift that responsibility to the Federal Government, what happens \nto the freedom of your hometown to care for homeless people? When you \nget the money from the Federal Government come the rules and \nregulations on what you will do and how you will do it. Rather than a \ncommunity-based or a church-based homeless shelter, now you will follow \nthese regs and do these things if you want our help.\n  What is our help? Our help is taking money from you, filtering it \nthrough Washington, wasting 20 percent of it, and then sending it back \nto you to tell you what you already know how to do, except now they \nwill tell you how to do it and give you 35 pieces of paper and forms to \nfill out as you tell them how you spent your money that they took 20 \npercent of to care of your homeless that you should have never sent the \nmoney to Washington for in the first place.\n  Let me spend time--I will pick and choose through a few of these. The \nFederal Government gives weatherization grants to help people \nweatherproof their homes. We have been doing this for over 25 years, \nand we continue to spend more and more money on it every year. Either \nwe are not doing a good job or we have weatherized every home in the \ncountry and we are starting to do it a second time.\n  But here is one from Illinois, where they took the weatherization \ngrant and bought eight pickup trucks for the county--under a \nweatherization grant.\n  In Wisconsin, a nursing home got $2.8 million in stimulus money it \ndid not need or request. Prior to the stimulus funding, the Knapp Haven \nNursing Home was on track for a loan from the USDA. In other words, \nthey had the finances set up to get a loan to where they could repay \nit. When the stimulus money came available, the funding source was \nshifted to a new source of Federal assistance. Carmen Newman, the city \nclerk-treasurer said:\n\n       It's kind of a joke as far as I'm concerned. I don't \n     understand how they can say this is stimulus.\n\n  They were going to do it anyway. The mayor of that city said:\n\n       I don't see how the project benefited.\n\n  Well, somebody benefited. But somebody also lost, and that was our \nkids and our grandkids.\n  Here is a good one: Iowa State legislators are using money freed up \nby the Federal stimulus cash to buy $11 million in new cars the State \ndoes not need. About four dozen brandnew cars owned by the State are \nalready sitting unused in a parking lot near the capitol. According to \nState Representative Christopher Rants:\n\n       Some of them [still] have the [sales] stickers on them. \n     None of them have license plates. Some of them still have \n     their seats wrapped in plastic.\n\n  But we are going to buy the cars because we got the money. So see \nwhat is happening here? There is no priority. Because the money comes \nin, spend it. Even though you have excess cars sitting in the parking \nlot, you buy it. Spend it or lose it.\n  Michigan is going to spend $500,000 to renovate an old freight house \nfor a yoga class. There is no question if you renovate an old warehouse \nand you employ people to do that, you will stimulate the economy. The \ncriticism here is, are there not other things more important in \nMichigan that we could spend $500,000 on that would create more \npermanent jobs, long-lasting jobs, and be of stronger benefit to the \ncommunity?\n  The only reason I question this is because it came through the \nFederal Government down there. If that money came through the \nstatehouse or the city, I would have no business questioning it at all. \nBut in light of where we find ourselves as a country, it is difficult \nfor me to see the priorities that are expressed.\n  In Macomb, IL, $643,945 was spent on a Prairieview public housing \nparking lot that nobody wants. Many of the residents whom the parking \nlot was supposed to benefit have protested it. Explaining his concern, \na local resident said: The kids love the grass. We have enough pavement \nalready for all the cars here. We need a playground.\n  But we are going to pour concrete over it because we have the money \nto do it--another wasted priority.\n  In Chicago, rather than help welfare recipients obtain jobs and \nescape poverty, $1 million will be used to study whether 300 people in \nChicago are healthier when living in a ``green'' public housing \nfacility. The study will evaluate whether green housing is healthier \nfor people and will focus on 300 residents at a Chicago public housing \nfacility. Researchers expect to find that residents living in these \nmore energy-efficient facilities will have much lower health care \ncosts. The study will create jobs because it will get two or three \npeople to interview the residents.\n  Oh, here is another priority that came out of the stimulus. The \nNational Institutes of Health has given an Indiana University professor \na grant of $356,000. Maybe this is OK but not now. It is not OK where \nwe find ourselves. But here is what they are going to do with it. They \nare going to ``test how children perceive foreign-accented speech \ncompared to native-accented speech.'' It will also determine how such \naccents might influence speech development in children.\n  I do not doubt that might, in fact, be something we want to study. \nBut we still have a lot of women in this country with a lot of disease \nand we have a lot of men in this country with a lot of disease. I am \nnot sure accents are as important as studying ways to lower health care \ncosts or funding a professor to do research on one of the cancers that \nare plaguing our country. How about buying H1N1 flu vaccine? Might that \nnot be a better expenditure of that money? In other words, priorities \nget lost.\n  Detroit Public Schools will reap massive benefits from the stimulus \ndespite a $150 million deficit. According to the Intelligencer--that \nis, evidently, a newspaper in the area--financial management problems \nbecame ``so tangled the state recently appointed a manager to take the \nfinancial reins.'' The Detroit Public School System stands to get $530 \nmillion, which $355 million would have ``no strings attached.''\n  So we have a school system that has been totally irresponsible with \ntheir financing and the management of their money, and what do we do \nwith the stimulus? We reward the incompetence and then give them twice \nthat amount to pull them out of a hole rather than fix the real \nproblem.\n  Consequences to our behavior are a great learning episode for all of \nus, no matter how old we are. If we are very young and we touch the hot \nstove, we learn it is hot. When we are adolescents and we do some of \nthe stupid things we do as adolescents, we learn from them. Do you know \nwhat. Governments do not learn, and that is because governments do not \nhave compassion. Only people have compassion. And when you bail out a \nschool system that has been irresponsible, without them suffering the \nconsequences--and I know the answer is: Well, the kids suffer the \nconsequences. That is right. We all suffer the consequence. You do not \nthink kids are suffering the consequences right now in our economy?\n  So this one is just cute. You will love it. Yale University and the \nUniversity of Connecticut are going to get $850,000--they have already \ngotten it, by the way--in stimulus money for research ``to study how \npaying attention improves performance of difficult tasks.''\n  Did you ever hit your thumb with a hammer? Studying that paying \nattention helps you with difficult tasks? I do not know who thinks \nthese things up. But, more importantly, it does not matter who thinks \nthem up. Who would give a grant for that? I am not opposed to giving \ngrants for sound scientific study. But do you know what. We already \nknow the answer this thing is going to give us--a statistically \nsignificant answer: You do better if you pay attention; and you do not \ndo as well if you do not. It is pretty straightforward.\n  Hanscom Field, MA, where we are going to put excess money for \nadditional runways, has received criticism\n\n[[Page S7996]]\n\nfrom local representatives, including a State representative from \nLexington. The State legislative leaders did not want us to do it. But \ndo you know what. We did it anyway. The people who represent the area, \nthe political leaders, did not want it to happen because they thought \nit promoted irresponsible corporate behavior. Do you know what we did? \nWe did it anyway. It goes back to that point we were talking about: \nfreedom. When you give it to us, you lose it. We are supposed to be the \nbastion that protects your freedom, and what we have become, through \nthis myriad number of Federal programs and spending, is we have been \nthe ones who are taking away your freedom.\n  In Oklahoma, I trap armadillos in my yard. They come in and they will \nruin a good yard because they like grub worms. So all you have to do is \nto lay a few marshmallows out and then put a marshmallow or two in the \ntrap cage and you will catch those suckers.\n  Well, that is what Washington is doing to the American liberty. We \nbite the first little bite off the marshmallow and say: Oh, that tastes \ngood. I got a little benefit here. There is no connection between what \nI have done and me receiving this benefit. And then we take another \nlittle bite off the marshmallow or the next one in. And all of \na sudden, before you know it, this armadillo--that runs at night mainly \nthat my dogs chase into the woods every time they see one of them--\npretty soon that armadillo fellow is in my cage. I got him. The reason \nI got him is he kept thinking he could get something for nothing. He \nkept thinking: Man, that is a sweet marshmallow.\n\n  So what happens is, here he comes down the road, like us--us \npromising more, promising more--but, remember, whatever we are \npromising to give you, we have already taken from you. And when we take \nit from you, we lessen your liberty, to a great extent. We steal your \nliberty. We steal your choice. We steal your freedom. We steal your \nability to be whom you want to be. We steal your ability to be the \nparent you want to be because we are interjecting us in the education \nsystem between you and your child. We are interjecting and planting the \nseeds of a lack of responsibility and accountability, as we bite the \nmarshmallow, as we walk into the trap, and the cage closes.\n  There are two things I do with those armadillos--one of two things. I \neither put them in the back of my pickup and take them 10 or 15 miles \naway from my property or I shoot them. That is exactly what is going to \nhappen to us. We are either going to be carried far away from what we \nknow, we trust, and believe in to be right or we are going to be \nextinct as a nation. We are going to lose the wonderful flavor of the \ngreatest Nation that has ever been on this Earth. We are going to \nlose--and we are doing that--we are losing it, a little bit at a time \nbecause we are similar to the frog that climbed into this wonderful pot \nof water that slowly and slowly heated up, and he never thought to jump \nout because, before he knew it, he could not.\n  So I have just listed about 30 of the first 1,000 projects that went \nout on the stimulus so you can get a flavor as to what kind of judgment \nis being made with the money we stole from our grandchildren. I would \nsay we are not doing great. I voted for a stimulus bill that would have \nspent almost $500 billion--I didn't vote for this one, but it was real \nstimulus. It was real roads, it was real bridges, it was real sewage \nplants. It included things we were going to have to do. It was really \nresetting the military because we are going to buy a whole bunch more \nmilitary. We are going to be forced to do it. To buy it now will create \njob after job after job, and it will save us money because we are going \nto buy it now at a cheaper price than what we will pay 5 years from \nnow.\n\n  So I am not critical of having stimulus. I am critical of how we \nmanage it, what we are doing about it, and the severe lack of oversight \nthat Members of this body daily fail to do. They do not do the job \ndemanded of them. It is not enough for us to say where the money is \nspent. What is required of us is to say where the money is spent and \nthen make sure it is spent wisely, prudently, and in the best interests \nof everybody in this country, not in the best interests of our next \nelection cycle.\n  I quoted earlier $350 billion worth of pure waste, fraud, and abuse \nevery year in this country. It is not fair for me to quote that without \ngoing through it for you so you can actually see where it is. I did \nthis last year, so I am sure it is worse this year since we have not \nhad the courage to do anything about fixing the problems that cause \nthis. But let me go through it. These are either department agency \nnumbers, CBO numbers, inspector general numbers, or General Accounting \nOffice numbers. They are not Tom Coburn's numbers. Every one of them \ncan be backed up.\n  Medicare fraud: At a minimum, $80 billion a year. We are \ncontemplating a health care bill. We have Medicare that is upside down, \nboth Part A and Part B, running in the red, and is projected to run \ninto the trillions of dollars. Name something that has been done on \nthat in the last 2 years, 3 years, by us. Medicare improper payments, \nnet loss--in other words, we paid out more than we should or we paid \nout less than we should--the net difference is $10 billion, so now we \nare at $10 billion a year.\n  Medicaid fraud at a minimum--and the reason we say it is at a minimum \nis because Medicaid can't even tell us what their fraud is. They can't \neven report it--$30 billion. Improper payments, net loss, $15 billion.\n  So now we are at $135 billion and we have just gone through two \nprograms.\n  Social Security disability fraud: I hear every day in my office from \npeople in my State about people who are getting disability who are \nabsolutely not disabled, but they get the check. They are living off \nus, but they can actually go to work and do something. At a minimum, it \nis estimated to be--I think this is a very low number, and it doesn't \nmean I don't want to help people with disability if they are truly \ndisabled. But everybody out in the country will know somebody who is \ncollecting a check who can still ride their horse, still run their \nrotor tiller, still lay brick, or still do anything else they want, but \nthey can't work: $2.5 billion.\n  Government-wide improper payments in all of the other agencies, but \nseven of them we still don't have any reporting on, even though the law \nsays they have to report. It is a Federal law you have to report your \nimproper payments every year, but they don't do it. Of the ones that do \nreport, another $15 billion net loss of paying out more than they \nshould. That is just on the agencies that report.\n  Maintenance of buildings by the Defense Department that they will not \nuse in the future nor do they use now, but we can't sell them because \nwe have all of these laws in Congress that create an impossibility for \nus to get them to the market. We have created a bureaucratic nightmare \nthat takes about 10 years to put a building up for sale. We are \nspending in the Defense Department $3 billion that could go for soldier \npay, health care for our veterans, health care for our soldiers; $3 \nbillion to maintain buildings that are sitting empty and to maintain \nsecurity for them.\n  We have contracting problems. The bill before us, the Defense \nauthorization--everybody recognizes we have a significant problem with \ncontracting in this country. This data comes not from last year but \nfrom the year before last. The Department of Defense paid out $8 \nbillion for performance awards to contractors who did not earn the \nawards. In other words, they had a contract. Here are the requirements \nto meet the contract. They didn't meet the requirements of the \ncontract. The Department of Defense paid them anyway. It hasn't \nstopped, folks. Where is the connection?\n  It is estimated by GAO that at a minimum, if we eliminated no-bid \ncontracts everywhere in the Federal Government--most earmarks, by the \nway, are no-bid contracts; it is a sweetheart deal--we would save, at a \nminimum, $5 billion a year--at a minimum--probably closer to $7 billion \nor $8 billion. Just to eliminate no-bid contracts pays for the entire \nbudget of the State of Oklahoma for 1 year. Every expense we have, just \n1 year of eliminating no-bid contracts would have that kind of savings.\n  Then we have the wonderful trick: we send bills through here that are \nsupposedly emergency supplementals, and we add all of these things of \nextra spending onto them that aren't emergencies. It is kind of like an \nearmark process, except the difference is they\n\n[[Page S7997]]\n\ndon't have to be within the budget numbers, so they just go straight to \nthe bottom line against our kids. So it doesn't pull back any spending \nanywhere else, but we spend this money anyhow, and that is another $15 \nbillion a year that the Members of Congress do outside of the budget.\n  So let's see here. We are at $184 billion. We have a crop insurance \nprogram that benefits the crop insurance industry but not the farmers, \nbut we refuse to modernize it. We can save $4 billion if we modernize \nit, but we don't modernize it because the effect and power of the well-\nheeled and well-connected keeps us from doing what is right.\n  Then we send $5.9 billion to the U.N. every year. We know--and this \nis a report we finally got forced to get out of there; it got leaked \nout and we finally got ahold of it--that our entire contribution to \npeacekeeping, which amounts to about 40 percent of our contributions--\n$2 billion a year--is totally wasted in fraud. In other words, it \ndoesn't help us do peacekeeping anywhere in the world because there is \nonly one agency and one government that is more inefficient than us, \nand it is the United Nations. Yet we can't have transparency.\n  Every year I put on the foreign appropriations bill a requirement \nthat for the U.N. dues to be paid, they have to give us transparency \nabout where they are spending our money. It passes 99 to 0, and as soon \nas it goes to the conference, guess what happens. It gets pulled out \nbecause we don't have the courage to confront the U.N. and say: We are \ngiving you $5.9 billion. Tell us how it is being spent. So there is \nanother one.\n  One of the greatest areas of worry the inspectors general have across \nall the agencies of government is investment in IT. Last year, we \ncontracted $64 billion of IT contracts through the Federal Government--\n$64 billion. What we know is at least 20 percent of that ends up \ntotally getting mismanaged and wasted. It gets wasted because they \ndon't know what they want when they sign the contract. They continue to \nchange what they want as the contract goes through, and when we get to \nwhat was going to be a $200 million contract, it ends up being an $800 \nmillion contract because we have changed what the contract did.\n  By the way, the contract isn't no-bid; the contract is cost plus, so \nwhoever is doing the contract has every inclination to give them new \nideas to make it better and change it. So what happens is we fall way \nbehind, we don't get it, we pay four times as much. What is estimated \nis that we lose almost $11 billion a year on that kind of poor \nmanagement. What is being done about it? Nothing in this body. Nothing \nin this body.\n  The National Flood Insurance Program is another $17.5 billion of \nwaste and duplication. If we reformed the Tax Code--by the way, we are \nnow right at $218 billion. If we reformed the Tax Code--if we just made \nit either straight line or simple, straight, fill it in on a postcard, \nor went to the fair tax, what we know is the Federal Government, just \neverything else being equal this year, would have $100 billion more \ncollected because there would be $100 billion less in fraud. Just $100 \nbillion. Just $100 billion. But we have a Tax Code that is this thick \nthat no IRS department will give you the same answer to the same \nquestion anywhere else in the country, and neither will any of the big \nauditing firms because the code is so complex that nobody knows what \nthe truth is. So we spend over $200 billion a year in this country \npaying our taxes.\n  I am not talking about the taxes we pay, paying our taxes. Either \npaying somebody else to figure it out or paying the interest because we \ncouldn't figure it out or paying the penalty because we couldn't get it \ndone on time, but most of it comes from paying people to pay our taxes \nfor us.\n  Then there is a miscellaneous, another $18 billion. I said $350 \nbillion. The total I have given is $385 billion. The reason I said $385 \nbillion, I don't want to exaggerate, so I cut 10 percent off of it. So \nnobody can say we have exaggerated the waste, fraud, and abuse in the \nFederal Government that occurs every year.\n  What would it be like right now if we weren't wasting that? What \nwould happen to Medicare if we didn't have this high number, billions \nand billions of dollars of fraud in Medicare every year? What would \nhappen? What would happen is Medicare would last a lot longer. No. 2, \nwe would actually get more resources directed to the people who \nactually need it.\n  The one story Dr. John Barrasso, the other physician in the Senate \ntells, is that Medicare is so well designed to be defrauded that people \nwho deal in drugs stop that and start doing Medicare fraud because it \nis easier to hit a home run, No. 1; No. 2, if you get caught, the \npenalties are less. No. 3 is you can make a whole lot more money with a \nwhole lot lower jail sentence. So we have this system that is designed \nto get defrauded that has $80 billion in it.\n  So let me make that point and say, if in fact you take--even if you \nonly take half of what I say--$175 billion--but even if you only take \nhalf of what I say, here are the things we know: This country is \nabsolutely on an unsustainable course. We cannot sustain what we are \ndoing. We cannot have another year such as this year. We cannot have \nanother year that comes anywhere close to this year.\n  We can't have another year that moves forward in the direction we are \nmoving in terms of the government taking more of your freedom away and \nbuilding itself up and building the bureaucracies in this town.\n  I understand my colleague from Hawaii is here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 1522 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my friend Senator Coburn for \nallowing me to speak at this time. I have been working with him in our \nCommittee on Homeland Security. We have taken up these amendments in \ncommittee. I think I am correct when I say that Senator Coburn at the \ntime did support these amendments.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. AKAKA. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think the record will show that I did not support the \namendment.\n  Mr. AKAKA. I thank the Senator for the clarification.\n  First, I understand the current economic climate. I want the Federal \nGovernment to save as much money as it can and to reduce all the \ninefficiencies there are. My amendment would do that.\n  My amendment also has been supported by a bipartisan group of \nSenators. I am proud that the cosponsors include Senators Collins, \nLieberman, Voinovich, Murkowski, Begich, Kohl, Mikulski, Cardin, \nInouye, Webb, and Warner. It is a bipartisan effort to correct certain \ninequities in the Federal retirement system. That has been our effort \nin these amendments.\n  Also, this effort was supported by a huge number of groups. Some of \nthe organizations are: The American Federation of Government Employees, \nNational Treasury Employees Union; International Federation of \nProfessional and Technical Engineers; Federal Law Enforcement Officers \nAssociation; the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal \nEmployees; American Postal Workers Union; National Association of \nLetter Carriers; National Rural Letter Carriers Association; National \nFederation of Federal Employees; National Active and Retired Federal \nEmployees Association; Senior Executives Association; Federal Managers \nAssociation; Government Managers Coalition; National Association of \nPostal Supervisors; National Association of Postmasters of the U.S.; \nand the National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys.\n  That is the kind of support we have. This amendment will ensure that \nall Federal employees are treated the same when it comes to retirement. \nThis will save money, due to the reduced lost days of work and avoid \nunnecessary employee transfers, which reduces the need for additional \ntraining; reduces litigation costs borne by the government due to \ndifferent treatment of different classes of employees; improve employee \nmorale, which increases efficiency; and ensure that we are able to \ntransfer institutional knowledge to the next generation of Federal \nworkers.\n  OPM estimates that $68 million is wasted per year because of the \ndifferent leave policies in effect. In fact, the amendment would \ncertainly help in that respect. My amendment will reduce the Federal \ndeficit by $36 million over 10 years.\n\n[[Page S7998]]\n\n  This amendment has the bipartisan support of the committee of \njurisdiction and by both managers and employees. I have read a list of \nthe others who support it.\n  This is a good government bill that protects the taxpayers' dollars.\n  I look forward to continuing this effort. I want to at this time say \nthat this is a good amendment. I will fight for these provisions in \nconference. But I don't want to hold up the Defense authorization bill.\n  Under the circumstances, I will withdraw this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator. I think he will find another vehicle \nat some other time. I know this bill is important to him. We just \nhappen to disagree about the priorities. That is what I have been \nspeaking on for 1 hour 20 minutes. I appreciate him doing that as a \ncourtesy to the rest of the Members of this body. I love him dearly as \na friend and as a brother. I appreciate it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me add my thanks to the Senator from \nHawaii. He is doing this for the good of the order to permit us to get \non with the bill. He knows how important this is. I appreciate his \nwillingness to withdraw the amendment at this time. It is very much \nappreciated by all of us. I hope something good could come out of \nconference.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Hagan \nbe recognized to speak on a previous amendment for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member \nMcCain for reporting out a bill that enacts reforming the Defense \nDepartment's budget and reorients weapons systems geared toward the \nwars we are fighting today. Our soldiers, sailors, marines, and airmen \nneed capabilities that are conducive to implementing the Department's \nshift to counterinsurgency tactics, techniques, and procedures. There \nis nothing more important than enhancing the force protection of our \ntroops. That is why I am pleased that this bill provides proven, \neffective ground capabilities, such as the MRAP vehicles to protect \nagainst IEDs.\n  I want to highlight a couple of provisions in the bill. First, I \nsupport funding the administration's request for $7.5 billion for the \nAfghanistan security forces fund to train and equip the Afghan national \narmy and police. The commander of the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, \nBrigadier General Nicholson, recently indicated that the success of the \nMarine offensive in the Helmand Province is dependent upon placing an \nAfghan face on the operation, in order to instill confidence among \nlocal Afghans in the Afghan Government's abilities to provide safe \ncommunities and to govern efficiently.\n  Equally important is providing coalition support funds for Pakistan. \nThe stability of Afghanistan is dependent on the stability of Pakistan, \nand vice versa. We need to enable the Pakistan Army and Frontier Corps \nwith the capability to conduct sustained direct action missions against \nthe dangerous elements of the Pakistani Taliban along the federally \nministered tribal areas, as well as against the Afghan Taliban High \nCommand in Pakistan's Balochistan province.\n  Key to successful operations in theater are effective aviation \nassets. I am a big proponent of the Joint Strike Fighter as it can \nserve multiple roles, including close air support, tactical bombing, \nand air defense missions. I am disappointed that we were unable to \nsecure enough votes for Senator Bayh's amendment. I want to reiterate \nthat I think it is important we safeguard language to authorize funding \nto develop and procure an alternate Joint Strike Fighter engine.\n  I know the issue of the location of the Navy's OLF has already been \ndebated and voted on, so I will not spend a lot of time on it. I \ncosponsored an amendment with Senator Burr to prevent the Navy from \nbuilding an OLF in the Sandbanks and the Hale's Lake locations within \nCamden, Currituck, and Gates Counties in North Carolina. I am against \nan OLF at these proposed sites because it would destroy small family \nfarms that have been around for generations, as well as thousands of \nacres of farmland, essential to the livelihood and economic base of \nthose communities. An OLF in these locations would only bring 52 jobs, \nand it would destroy valuable farmland that currently employs over \n2,000 workers. Moreover, the OLF would only be a few miles away from \nongoing projects that will attract new businesses and tourists.\n\n  Last week, I met with local government leaders of the respective \ncounties to discuss their concerns regarding construction of the OLF. \nThe State of North Carolina recently passed a law banning the \nconstruction of an OLF at these sites. I do not think it would be in \nthe Navy's interests to continue to pursue construction of an OLF at \nthese sites, knowing that it will more likely than not be tied up in \nlitigation for years.\n  I want to make sure North Carolina is treated fairly. The residents \nof these counties simply do not want the OLF there. The State of North \nCarolina is the friendliest military State in the Nation, and we would \nwelcome the opportunity to work with the Navy in identifying sites that \ncould potentially meet the Navy's OLF requirement, and also have the \nsupport of the North Carolinians in those counties. One of those sites \ncan be at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point or a site close to it \nwithin Craven County. All of the elected local officials in that \ncommunity are in support of having an OLF located there.\n  The Navy excluded Cherry Point as a potential OLF site because Navy \nstandards specify that an OLF should be no more than 120 nautical miles \nfrom home base. Cherry Point sits approximately 135 nautical miles from \nOceana, VA. That is just 15 nautical miles beyond the Navy's current \nrequirement. I want to work with the Navy to examine the impact of \nhaving an OLF that is located just outside its current requirements, \nand especially on the readiness of the Navy's personnel and aircraft \nfleet.\n  Senator Webb and I worked together to insert additional language \nwithin the committee report to do two things: one, to mandate the \nSecretary of the Navy issue a report detailing the Navy's consultations \nwith local governments, communities, and stakeholders in North Carolina \nand Virginia regarding OLF site options; two, to mandate the Navy \nidentify all suitable options for the location of an OLF beyond the \nfive sites identified in both States.\n  However, I don't think that is good enough. The State of North \nCarolina has had previous negative experiences with the manner in which \nthe Navy has implemented its OLF site selection process. I strongly \nfeel that the Navy should delete the two current sites in North \nCarolina.\n  I also thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting my \namendment in committee that provides the Department of Defense with the \noption to increase the acquisition of additional C-27s in the outyears \nas mission requirements dictate. That amendment requires the Department \nto provide its strategic plan to deploy and station C-27 joint cargo \naircraft in theater and in the continental United States, as well as \nplans to procure additional aircraft beyond the 38.\n  Forty-eight adjutants of the National Guard signed a letter to the \ncommittee last month supporting the funding of 78 joint cargo aircraft. \nTheir letter emphasized the C-27 provides an essential airlift \ncapability in war, as well as to State emergency management teams in 48 \nStates.\n  I also thank the chairman and Ranking Member McCain for accepting my \namendment to direct the Secretary of the Army to submit a report to \nassess the feasibility and advisability of creating a trainees, \ntransients, holdees, and students account within the Army National \nGuard to ensure all soldiers in\n\n[[Page S7999]]\n\nunits have completed their initial entry training prior to being \ndeployed.\n  Approximately 27,000 of the National Guard's end strength are not \ndeployable because they are awaiting training. This account would allow \nnew Guardsmen to be fully trained prior to reporting to their \nassignment. A TTHS account with the National Guard would improve the \nunit readiness, increase individual dwell time between deployments, and \nprovide more predictability to soldiers, families, and employers.\n  Finally, I thank the chairman and ranking member for accepting my \namendment involving depot maintenance work. This amendment directs the \nSecretary of the Navy to submit a cost-benefit analysis report \nidentifying each alternative the Secretary is considering for the \nperformance of the AV-8B Harrier aircraft planned maintenance and \naircraft modifications.\n  We are working with the Navy and the Marine Corps to ensure that \ndepots allow partnerships with the commercial sector, while recognizing \nthe legitimate national security need for the Department of Defense \ncivilian and military personnel to retain the key skills to be \nresponsive to our soldiers fighting in these two wars.\n  This is an important bill, and despite my and Senator Burr's ongoing \nconcerns about this outlying landing field, I think that Senators Levin \nand McCain deserve our gratitude for their work on this bill, and this \nbill deserves the support of all of my colleagues.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Kyl \namendment be temporarily set aside and that the following four \namendments then be in order: the Sessions amendment, No. 1657, which is \ngoing to be modified and which I understand will not require a rollcall \nvote; the Isakson amendment, No. 1525, which would then be called up \nand I understand would require some debate; the Lieberman amendment, \nNo. 1650, which I also understand may be modified; and then the next \namendment after that, which I thought I could enumerate, but I cannot \nnow, would be a Democratic amendment and would then be in place; that \nno amendments would be in order to any of the above amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me modify my previous unanimous consent \nagreement: that prior to those three amendments being called up, we \ntake up the Lincoln amendment, No. 1487, which I understand has been \ncleared. Again, as to the other three amendments we identified for \ndebate, no amendments will be in order to any of those amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is now my understanding that under that \nUC, we would take up Lincoln amendment No. 1487.\n  I am wondering whether the Senator from Arkansas would like to have \none quick minute to explain her amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1487\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment \nNo. 1487 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arkansas [Mrs. Lincoln], for herself, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Risch, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. \n     Wyden, proposes an amendment numbered 1487.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To amend title 32, United States Code, to modify the \nDepartment of Defense share of expenses under the National Guard Youth \n                           Challenge Program)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 573. MODIFICATION OF DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE SHARE OF \n                   EXPENSES UNDER NATIONAL GUARD YOUTH CHALLENGE \n                   PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Modification.--Section 509(d)(1) of title 32, United \n     States Code, is amended by striking ``may not exceed'' and \n     all that follows and inserting ``may not exceed the amount as \n     follows:\n       ``(A) In the case of a State program of the Program in \n     either of its first two years of operation, an amount equal \n     to 100 percent of the costs of operating the State program in \n     that fiscal year.\n       ``(B) In the case of any other State program of the \n     Program, an amount equal to 75 percent of the costs of \n     operating the State program in that fiscal year.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on October 1, 2009, and shall apply with \n     respect to fiscal years beginning on or after that date.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman, Senator Levin, and \nSenator McCain, Senator Graham, and the others for allowing me to bring \nup this amendment.\n  This is a critical amendment at a critical time. Many of us visit our \nhome States, and we see the disadvantaged youth all across our States \nwho are having difficult times. We know unstable economic times bring \nabout instability in our schools, in our families, and in a host of \ndifferent places.\n  One of the ways we have of combating this is with the National Guard \nYouth ChalleNGe Program. It is an excellent program put on by our \nNational Guard in many of our States where these at-risk youth come in \nand they are surrounded by both structure and support and guidance to \nbe able to meet their needs of getting a GED and their high school \neducation and then going on to make something of their lives, really \nturning themselves around and making sure they are becoming great parts \nof our communities, whether it is finding a job or entering the \nmilitary on their own but certainly turning their lives around and \nbeing productive.\n  What we do in this amendment is we open up our National Guard Youth \nChalleNGe Program to new States. Right now, we have it in several of \nour States. Many of us have been able to see the rewards of this \nprogram, but this will open it up to other States to be able to \nparticipate.\n  One of the biggest problems we have had with this program is not the \nsuccess, because the success has been tremendous, but it is the ability \nof our States to be able to financially support these programs. Right \nnow, they have to come up with 40 percent of the resources that are \nnecessary. Quite frankly, our States are not entering into these \nprograms because they do not have the resources. These are excellent \nprograms. They have tremendous results. And one of the things we want \nto make certain of is that we don't lose the opportunity to catch these \nyoung people early on and turn their lives around. So our amendment \nprovides a 75-25 percent cost sharing with the States instead of the \n60-40. We don't change the amount of money spent, we just change the \nway it is allocated. We also allow the opportunity for some new States \nthat want to start these programs to come in, and for the first 2 years \nthe Federal Government will support 100 percent of those programs as \nthey get their feet on the ground and they get these programs started, \nand then they must again resume that 25-percent State responsibility in \nthese programs.\n  We have a great bill we have introduced. We have tremendous \nbipartisan support. We have 32 cosponsors of our bill. I am joined in \nthis amendment by Senators Byrd, Casey, Cornyn, Hagan, Landrieu, \nMurkowski, Risch, Rockefeller, Snowe, and Udall of Colorado, along with \nSenator Wyden. So we have great support for this amendment. It is \nsomething that is important for our kids, and it is certainly a great \nopportunity for us to see how our military can empower our youth by \ngiving them the kind of support that is necessary to turn their lives \naround through both education and opportunity, helping them to develop \nskills, working in the community, and really making something of \nthemselves.\n\n[[Page S8000]]\n\n  I thank the chairman for the ability to be able to offer this \namendment on behalf of our States and on behalf of our National Guard, \nwhich is doing a tremendous job in these programs, but most importantly \non behalf of our children and the great things it does for our children \nall across this Nation.\n  Mr. President, a special thanks to the chairman and the ranking \nmember for their indulgence in letting me offer this amendment. I am \nlooking forward to hopefully seeing how we can move it forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first let me thank Senator Lincoln for this \namendment. The linkage of the National Guard and States and our kids is \na very powerful link indeed. I have seen this up close and personal \nbecause I am sort of the godfather of the STARBASE Program, which \nstarted in Michigan at Selfridge Air National Guard Base, and it has \nspread. While this program which Senator Lincoln is so deeply involved \nwith, and her cosponsors, is not an outgrowth of that program, it is \nvery similar in terms of its purpose to link our National Guard and the \ninspiration they can provide and the technical skills they can provide \nour children with. So I thank her for her amendment and hope it will be \npromptly adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1487) was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I believe the next amendment is the \nSessions amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1657, as Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1657, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for Mr. \n     Sessions, proposes an amendment numbered 1657, as modified.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To express the sense of Congress that military commissions \n      are the preferred forum for the trial of alien unprivileged \n   belligerents for violations of the law of war and other offenses \n                    triable by military commission)\n\n       On page 394, between lines 8 and 9, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1032. TRIAL BY MILITARY COMMISSION OF ALIEN UNPRIVILEGED \n                   BELLIGERENTS FOR VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW OF WAR.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subchapter I of chapter 47A of title 10, \n     United States Code, as amended by section 1031(a), is further \n     amended by adding at the end the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 948e. Trial by military commission of alien \n       unprivileged belligerents for violations of the law of war\n\n       ``(a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the preferred forum for the trial of alien unprivileged enemy \n     belligerents subject to this chapter for violations of the \n     law of war and other offenses made punishable by this chapter \n     is trial by military commission under this chapter.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections of the \n     beginning of such subchapter, as amended by section 1031(a), \n     is further amended by adding after the item relating to \n     section 948d the following new item:\n\n``948e. Trial by military commission of alien unprivileged belligerents \n              for violations of the law of war.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, we have been working with Senator \nSessions--myself, Senator Levin and his staff, and Senator Sessions' \nstaff. This amendment basically clarifies the fact that when a detainee \nis in military custody or an intelligence agent's custody, being \ndetained as a result of wartime activity, to be interrogated for \nintelligence gathering, there is no requirement that person have \narticle 31, or Miranda, rights read to them. We don't want to \ncriminalize the war. Military intelligence gathering is not a law \nenforcement function.\n  There has been some confusion at Bagram Air Force Base about the \nDepartment of Justice FBI agents reading Miranda rights. Clearly, there \ncould be a time when that would be appropriate, but this amendment \nstates unequivocally that Miranda warnings, or article 31 rights, are \nnot to be read or required to be read by DOD personnel or intelligence \nagencies as a result of battlefield activities or military intelligence \ngathering.\n  I think it is a good amendment that will clarify a potentially \nconfusing situation. I appreciate Senator Levin's staff helping us with \nit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, after a very brief comment, I am going to \nsuggest a quorum be called. This amendment has been significantly \nmodified from its original form. It has been modified in a way which I \nbelieve is now satisfactory. It addresses interrogations by the \nmilitary, by defense agencies. It does not involve interrogations by \nthe Department of Justice, as I understand it.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is correct.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Department of Justice is not involved in the warnings \nthat are involved here. It especially provides it must be applied in a \nmanner consistent with the constitutional requirements. With these \nchanges, I am satisfied, but I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the \npending Sessions amendment, as modified, be temporarily laid aside and \nwe now proceed to the next item under the unanimous consent agreement, \nwhich would be the amendment of Senator Isakson.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Georgia is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1525\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I call up amendment No. 1525.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Georgia [Mr. Isakson], for himself and Mr. \n     Chambliss, proposes an amendment numbered 1525.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To repeal the sunset of authority to procure fire resistant \n    rayon fiber for the production of uniforms from foreign sources)\n\n       On page 245, between lines 3 and 4, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 803. REPEAL OF SUNSET OF AUTHORITY TO PROCURE FIRE \n                   RESISTANT RAYON FIBER FOR THE PRODUCTION OF \n                   UNIFORMS FROM FOREIGN SOURCES.\n\n       Subsection (f) of section 829 of the National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; \n     122 Stat. 229; 10 U.S.C. 2533a note) is repealed.\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, a few years ago this body granted a Berry \nwaiver on the purchase of rayon fiber made in Austria for the purpose \nof making fire-resistant uniforms of the U.S. Marines, Army, and \naviators. The Berry requirement is the buy American requirement, \nmeaning that you first have to buy American before you go offshore to \nbuy a product.\n  At the beginning of the Iraq war, the U.S. Army and Marines noticed \nimmediately we had a tremendous increase, because of the nature of that \nwar, in burn injuries. They conducted a survey and looked at the 24 \nbest alternatives they could find anywhere to make fire-resistant \nuniforms. They finally settled on a para-aramid fire-resistant fiber \nblend of rayon with nylon.\n  Environmental Protection Agency requirements to make rayon make it \nprohibitive in the United States, and there is no rayon produced in the \nUnited States. It is produced in Austria.\n  So the Berry waiver we received a few years ago was to allow them to \nimport, through now and 2013, rayon, fire-resistant rayon, which in the \nUnited States is blended for fabric, cut, sewn, produced, and shipped \nto the U.S. military--10,000 American jobs. The rayon cannot be \nproduced in the United States because of the EPA requirements.\n  The reason to request an exception and postpone the sunset in 2013 is \nbecause the military procurement in the outyears is now reaching beyond \nthat. With the absence of a Berry waiver for those years, they would \nhave to zero\n\n[[Page S8001]]\n\nout the purchase for those uniforms which, in turn, would mean the \npeople who make those uniforms would not have the certainty of the \nBerry waiver because it would be subject to a Berry waiver again. \nTherefore, the investment they would make would be limited to the years \nthey knew they could make the guaranteed deliveries.\n  I have offered this amendment as an extension for that very reason. \nThe U.S. Army, the Marine Corps, and the aviators who use the material \nlove it because it breathes, it gives them some circulation, it has \ntremendous protection against burns and it has performed very \nsatisfactorily and they want to continue to use it and there is no \nAmerican competitor that can meet or exceed it.\n  Obviously, if there were, that waiver would go away and we could \ncompete, but at this time they do not. I ask the Members for their \nconsideration on behalf of our military men and women in harm's way in \nAfghanistan and Iraq and wherever they might be for the uniform that \nwas chosen for the very battle we are now in because it was the best \nthe military could find anywhere in the country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, regrettably, I must rise in opposition to \nthis amendment. I believe this amendment is not timely. It is premature \nto eliminate a congressionally imposed sunset clause for an existing \ntemporary exception to the Berry amendment, an exception that was \nsupposed to be temporary.\n  In May of this year, Senator Graham and I jointly requested the \nSecretary of Defense to review the Department of Defense continuing \nreliance on this exception. The Under Secretary of Defense, Mr. Carter, \nhas confirmed that this review is now underway and the results are \nexpected soon. I do not believe we should modify the current statutory \nrequirement, which would prejudice the outcome of the Department of \nDefense review, until we have heard the Department's assessment. \nRemoving the sunset clause would result in an indefinite extension of \nan exception that favors foreign suppliers of rayon over our own \nAmerican companies.\n  A vote against this amendment will not have an adverse effect on \ncurrent arrangements to obtain rayon from foreign sources. Today's Army \nuniform procurement contract will continue until 2013, so long as the \nArmy stipulates that a requirement for rayon fiber in fire-resistant \nuniforms and the Department of Defense maintains the exception to the \nBerry amendment is needed.\n  The 2013 sunset clause was designed to ensure that American industry \nwill be fairly treated during future competitions for contracts if \nindustry can demonstrate an ability to manufacture materials that \nsatisfy Army requirements for fire resistance and other features. Under \nthe current arrangement, companies are losing jobs because they cannot \ncompete to provide alternate materials. Our domestic manufacturers are \nnow able to provide alternate materials that could satisfy Army \nprocurement requirements. It is not in the best interests of the U.S. \ndefense industrial base, our economy or the U.S. military to remove a \ncongressionally imposed sunset provision at this time.\n  We have had discussions with General Fuller, the Army's Program \nExecutive Officer Soldier, who is responsible for acquiring the best \nequipment for the Army and fielding it as quickly as possible. He has \nconfirmed to my staff that he will consult industry to determine what \nthe domestic market has to offer to satisfy performance-based \nrequirements for military uniforms. This will allow American industry \nto come in with a whole spectrum of ideas and alternate materials. The \nArmy would then be able to explore new technologies that may have \nevolved since we last visited this issue.\n  Removing the sunset clause also poses a risk to the Army's future \nresearch and development requirements. The Army relies on American \nprivate industries to an extensive degree to conduct R for next-\ngeneration materials and fabrics for uniforms, body armor, and other \nmission-essential materials. Some companies, such as Dupont, for \nexample, have already lost hundreds of jobs owing to that inability to \ncompete for Army contracts. A continued reliance on this Berry \namendment exception would jeopardize their ability to remain \ncompetitive in this segment of the defense industrial base. I do not \nbelieve the Army can afford to lose this critical R capacity. For \nthose reasons, I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to also \noppose it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I would like to echo the sentiments of \nSenator Webb. We have been working together on this. I very much \nappreciate Senator Isakson. I understand this is a bit complicated--\nthere are parochial interests involved--until we understand the dilemma \nwe are in here.\n  In the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill, we included \nlanguage that grants a 5-year waiver to the Berry amendment for the \nprocurement of flame-resistant rayon, the material used to make \nmilitary uniforms. There are 3 years left on the waiver. The Isakson \namendment permanently extends this waiver and will end all efforts to \nproduce a domestic material to make military uniforms.\n  I respectfully oppose the amendment. We are currently procuring the \nmaterial from Europe. There is no source of domestic rayon.\n  Neither Congress nor DOD has ever issued a determination or finding \nthat the domestic market lacks sufficient products that could perform \nthe functions desired by DOD. This amendment unfairly excludes, in my \nopinion, U.S. manufacturers from competing for DOD procurements and \nimproperly limits competition since the domestic market contains \nproducts such as flame-resistant cotton, Nomex, and nylon which can \nfulfill DOD's needs.\n  DOD's decision to procure flame-resistant fabric from foreign \nsuppliers without even examining whether domestic manufacturers could \nmeet the agency's need with other products violates DOD's statutory \nmandate to use performance rather than material specifications and to \nseek free and fair open competition whenever practical.\n  Instead of affirmatively extending a waiver that has 3 years \nremaining, we should continue to let the technologies and fabrics \ndevelop and reassess where we are in 1 or 2 years. I think that is the \nwise thing to do, and I respectfully urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Through the Chair, will the Senator from South Carolina \nyield for a moment for a question?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I will.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. With respect, isn't it true that there is nothing in \nthis waiver that in any way inhibits or prohibits American \nmanufacturers from doing the research and development necessary to \nattempt to come up with a material that meets or exceeds the rayon made \nin Austria? The problem is they cannot produce rayon in the United \nStates of America because of EPA prohibitions and the costs to meet \nthat.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Senator for that question. It is my \nunderstanding that the efforts made in Virginia and South Carolina to \nproduce this product domestically, and the concerns the Senator has \naddressed, the private sector is dealing with; and that the ability to \nproduce this material domestically is a viable option. I don't want to \ntake a precedent, in terms of the Berry amendment, that I think would \nchange the spirit of the amendment at a time when we have a potential \nto make this domestically. I think, as much as we can do domestically \nto protect our military and to provide resources to our military, the \nbetter.\n  A year or two from now, we will know better. To lift the waiver, to \nmake it a permanent waiver, I think would be an unwise erosion of the \nBerry amendment at this time. That would be my answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, let me comment, if I can. The Berry ``Buy \nAmerican'' program is absolutely 100 percent on target. The reason for \nwaivers is when we find that there is no domestic product equal to or \nbetter than a product that has a component overseas, in the interest of \nour men and women in the military, we give the\n\n[[Page S8002]]\n\nwaiver so it doesn't keep us--so we do not prohibit ourselves from \nhaving the best material possible. If an American domestic manufacturer \nproduces an alternative fiber or fabric which meets or exceeds the \nfire-resistant para-aramid rayon that is now being used, the Berry \nwaiver will no longer apply because there will be a domestically \nproduced U.S. product that is superior or equal to that particular \nproduct of rayon.\n  So I would respectfully submit to the Senators from Virginia and \nSouth Carolina that the argument that there is a prohibition--that this \nwould keep people from making an investment in R to produce something \nbetter is the reverse. It actually will accelerate the need for them to \nmake the R investment to try and produce something better in the \nUnited States, if they can.\n  One last point. The U.S. military did 24 different evaluations after \nthe initial move into Iraq when we had so many burn injuries. It \ndetermined this fabric has to be the best for our men and women \naviators, men and women in the Marine Corps, men and women in the Army \nin combat, and it has performed well in Afghanistan and Iraq ever \nsince.\n  So I would submit the R argument is actually accelerated with the \nextension of the waiver, and the proof of the product is in the pudding \nwhich we have seen with the safety of our troops and our men and women \nin harm's way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I rise very quickly in support of the Isakson \namendment. There is currently a waiver to the Berry amendment in place \nwhich allows companies to import the fire-resistant rayon from foreign \ncountries.\n  Let me be very clear. The jobs that go with the manufacture of these \nuniforms for the Army and Marines are U.S. jobs. All of these uniforms \nare made in the United States. But this fabric is used by TenCate, \nIncorporated, to make its Defender M fabric to produce fire-resistant \nuniforms for both the Army and the Marines.\n  The material is not made in the United States due to EPA standards. \nThis is a classic example of where EPA standards can be too stringent \nto allow U.S. manufacturers to operate. And, the reason is, it is cost \nprohibitive to do so.\n  The current waiver, which includes a 5-year sunset clause, was \nincluded in the 2008 Defense authorization bill after a tremendous \neffort by my colleague, Senator Isakson, and obviously is set to \nexpire.\n  The Army's PEO Soldier expressed very strongly that FR rayon is the \nsuperior fabric based upon key selection criteria. The criteria were \ncost, comfort, durability, and length of time before receiving third-\ndegree burns. We have had some very serious situations, obviously, that \nhave occurred with burns in both Iraq and Afghanistan. That is why the \nArmy and the Marines like this uniform.\n  We buy 115,000 new FR uniforms every month. This uniform is superior \nbecause of the fact that we have been able to import this fabric with \nthe Berry amendment waiver. It is, in my opinion, imperative that we \ncontinue for the competition. The uniforms are still competitively bid. \nSo it is not like we are taking anybody out of the marketplace.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Isakson amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1657, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send a further \nmodification of the Session's amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is further \nmodified.\n  The amendment as further modified is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __.

Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that Senators \nLieberman and Graham call up amendment No. 1650, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate the assistance of Chairman \nLevin and all those involved. This is to me a very important statement \nby the Senate at a crucial time in our Nation's history. Simply put, \nour amendment is a sense-of-the-Senate statement that there is a \npreference for military commission trials regarding detained \nterrorists.\n  The reason we are making this statement and trying to urge our \ncolleagues to agree with us is that the interim detainee report that \nhas been issued in the last day or two by the White House has a \nstatement within that report that there should be a presumption that \ndetained terrorists would be tried in article III Federal civilian \ncourts.\n  I could not disagree more. We will keep working with the \nadministration on this issue. There may be an odd case where a Federal \ncourt may be an appropriate venue. But I think I speak for Senator \nLieberman and I hope most Americans that the people we are talking \nabout are not common criminals. They are not detained because of some \nviolation of domestic criminal law. They are detained because they have \nbeen found to be part of al-Qaida and other terrorist organizations \nthat the Congress has previously determined to be enemy combatant \nbelligerents, people who have taken up arms against the United States \nof America, who are intent on our destruction. They are not accused of \nrobbing a liquor store. They fall within a narrow statutory definition \nthat was created after 9/11. This is an opportunity for the Senate to \nexpress itself and say there is a preference for military courts.\n  I conclude with this thought. I believe we are at war. It is an \nunusual war but nonetheless a deadly war. The people we are talking \nabout, again, need to be viewed as military threats, and under military \nlaw it is appropriate to try someone who has operated outside the law \nof armed conflict in a military commission.\n  Our Nation has been doing this for 200 years. The Nazi saboteurs who \nwere caught landing on the coast of Florida were tried by military \ncommission. I can give a long history of how military commissions were \nused by our Nation at times of war. That is the preferred vehicle when \na nation is at war.\n  I conclude with this thought. Those who can be tried should be tried \nby military commissions. There will be some enemy combatants determined \nto be part of al-Qaida who will not be subject to criminal process \neither in Federal courts or military commission trials. It is my belief \nthat this country cannot afford to release them if they are still a \nmilitary threat.\n  Under military law, there is no requirement to release an enemy \nprisoner as long as they present a threat to your country. There is no \nsuch concept in domestic criminal law. We cannot\n\n[[Page S8004]]\n\ncriminalize this war. It will come back to haunt us.\n  Due process is available under military law. The men and women \nrunning these trials are officers, judge advocates. I have been one for \n25 years. They are wonderful people. They will adhere to the law. They \nunderstand the law. They will provide transparent justice. But this is \nthe setting that we need to be in regarding these detainees. This \nstatement by the Senate is appropriate.\n  Mr. President, to my good friend, Senator Lieberman, he has, above \nall others, tried to remind himself that the Nation's defense is more \nimportant than politics. I cannot tell Senator Lieberman how much I \nadmire him. We have worked together to get a sense of the Senate, not \nbinding, but a strong statement that it is a preference that these \nterrorists detained as part of an al-Qaida network be tried in military \ncommissions, as we have done in our history.\n  I yield to Senator Lieberman and hope my colleagues will accept this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I call up our amendment No. 1650, as \nmodified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Lieberman], for himself \n     and Mr. Graham, proposes an amendment numbered 1650, as \n     modified.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Trial by military commission of alien unprivileged belligerents \n              for violations of the law of war.''.\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Graham for his overly \ngenerous words in my direction. It is always a pleasure to work with \nhim on matters of this kind. Really more than anyone else in the \nSenate, he knows military law because he practices it in his capacity \nas a member of the JAG. I thank him for cosponsoring this amendment \nwith me.\n  Also, I thank Chairman Levin, Senator McCain, and Senator Graham for \nthe extraordinary work they have done in improving the military \ncommission system that has been set up. It is the basis for the \namendment that Senator Graham and I put in this evening.\n  The fact is that military commissions, by one name or another, have \nplayed a time-honored role in our country in bringing war criminals to \njustice. The use of military tribunals dates all the way back to the \nbeginning of our country. Our first President, GEN George Washington, \nrelied on them during the Revolutionary War for the trial of violations \nof the laws of war.\n  The United States has continued to utilize military commissions or \ntribunals for the trial of people accused of violations of the laws of \nwar and related crimes throughout our history.\n  The fact is we are once more at war today against those who planned, \nauthorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n2001. There is an existing authorization for the use of military force. \nMilitary commissions, in my opinion, and Senator Graham's, are, \ntherefore, the appropriate forum for the trial of war criminals \ncaptured during this conflict, as they have been throughout our \nhistory. And all the more comfortable should we be in saying that after \nthe amendments to the Military Commissions Act have been adopted as \npart of this National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I remind our colleagues, because it was done without a lot of debate, \nthat the package of amendments to the Military Commissions Act that has \nbeen adopted as part of this legislation, offered by Senators McCain, \nLevin, and Graham, would ensure lawful, fair, and effective trials by \nproviding a series of protections to the accused for the military \ncommissions, including a prohibition on the use of statements obtained \nthrough cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment, access to exculpatory \nevidence, and meaningful appellate review of legal and factual \nfindings.\n  As distinguished witnesses and authorities have testified at a \nhearing Chairman Levin led before the Armed Services Committee on this \nissue 2 weeks ago, according to these witnesses, including people who \nwork as general counsel in the Defense Department, for instance, the \nmilitary commission provisions in the bill before us not only meet but \nsurpass by far the fundamental standards of fairness and due process \nrequired by our Supreme Court, the Geneva Conventions, and the rules of \nthe International Criminal Court.\n  Given those robust procedural and substantive rights provided by the \nsystem of military commissions established in this bill, I must say \nthat I have been surprised, troubled, and I would even go so far as to \nsay astounded that officials of our administration have now made clear \nthat they prefer prosecuting war criminals in Federal district courts \nhere in the United States as opposed to before the military commissions \nwe have established. That was testimony given before the Armed Services \nCommittee in response to questions of the General Counsel of the \nDefense Department.\n  Just this week, an interim report was issued by a Department of \nDefense and Department of Justice task force on the legal questions \nassociated with the detainees. In that report there is this sentence:\n\n       There is a presumption that, where feasible, referred cases \n     will be prosecuted in an Article III court, in keeping with \n     traditional principles of federal prosecution.\n\n  Article III courts, of course, are federal courts.\n  So it is the testimony of the General Counsel of the Defense \nDepartment, and now this interim report from the Department of Defense \nand the Department of Justice, that has led Senator Graham and me to \noffer this amendment, because we simply disagree, as we think most \nAmericans and most Members of the Senate do, with the idea that there \nis a presumption in favor of trying prisoners of war before our Federal \ncourts instead of before military commissions, as has been done \nthroughout our history.\n  This realizes the worst fears of people that we would begin to \ncriminalize the war on terrorism instead of treating it and its \nperpetrators as war and criminals of war. This change in direction \ndeparts from our history and, in some sense, diminishes the \nextraordinary work that has been done by Chairman Levin, Senator \nMcCain, Senator Graham, and others to create and improve these military \ncommissions. It may, in fact, cast unfounded doubt on the legitimacy of \nthe convictions obtained by military commissions on the strength of the \nevidence used to secure convictions in those proceedings and the \nprocedural protections accorded to defendants by the military \ncommissions process.\n  Our amendment is very simple. It is a long sentence, and I read it, \nas follows:\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the preferred forum for \n     the trial of alien unprivileged enemy belligerents subject to \n     this chapter for violations of the law of war and other \n     offenses made punishable by this chapter is trial by military \n     commission under this chapter.\n\n  So we adopt wording in the military commissions section of this \nlegislation regarding violations of the law of war and other offenses \nmade punishable by this chapter, and we say that it is our preference \nthat people accused of such crimes of war be tried before the military \ncommissions.\n\n[[Page S8005]]\n\n  We have created a system of military commissions that I believe \noffers remarkable protections--perhaps the best ever offered to people \nin the status of alleged war criminals against our country or any \ncountry, against our citizens or the citizens of any country. And, I \nrepeat, obviously we are at war, and therefore we should use these \nmilitary commissions we have created and preference should be in their \ndirection.\n  The fact is, where to bring charges against people accused of \nviolating laws of war or, as we have said in the legislation, other \noffenses made punishable by this chapter is a decision made by the \nexecutive branch. It is not one we can control. But we can express an \nopinion. We can express an opinion to the executive branch, \nrespectfully, that we think they have made a mistake in stating a \npresumption to try prisoners of war in Federal district courts. Such an \napproach would cast doubt, as I have said, on the use of military \ncommissions but I think would also set an unfortunate, even dangerous, \nprecedent for the trial of war criminals today or in future conflicts \nin Federal courts rather than our Nation's time-honored use of military \ncommissions for the violation of the law of war.\n  I hope we can unite across party lines to adopt this expression of \nopinion on a most important question.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment, in response \nto my good friends, Senator Graham and Senator Lieberman, and say a \nword on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice and its prosecutors, \nwho have been actively engaged in the war on terror for many years now \nand who have shown considerable success.\n  The information they have is that the number of individuals who have \nbeen successfully prosecuted, convicted, and incarcerated as a result \nof military commissions numbers in the handful--perhaps even fewer than \nfive. By contrast, just since January 1 of this year, more than 30 \nindividuals have been charged with terrorism, successfully prosecuted, \nand sentenced to Federal prison--more than 30 convicted or sentenced \njust this year. There are 355 inmates in Federal prison now who have \nbeen successfully charged, prosecuted, convicted, and are now serving \nlengthy sentences as a result of their history or connection with \ninternational or domestic terrorism.\n  I don't want to get into a discussion right now on whether military \ncommissions are a good or bad idea, but what has proven tried-and-true \nin terms of actually putting terrorists behind bars, where they belong, \nhas been the expertise and the experience and the capability of the \nU.S. Department of Justice. They have been successful. There are \nhundreds of terrorists behind bars. There are far more than have ever \ncome through the military commissions during the course of this \nstruggle. And I think we should bear that in mind as we speak about \nthis issue and as we vote about this issue. There is a lot of high-\nquality prosecutorial work and a lot of patriotism in the Department of \nJustice, and there is a reason we should allow the professionals to \nsort out case by case which is the better venue for the trial, whether \na military commission, however new and untested in this modern era, or \nthe tried-and-true model of the U.S. Federal prosecutor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I hope we can quickly get to a voice vote. \nI would briefly say that the executive branch created a presumption \nthat the cases would be tried before criminal courts--article III \ncourts. I thought it was a mistake. We should not have a presumption \none way or the other. The amendment before us redresses the balance to \nthe extent we can do it tonight.\n  Also, we were able to get the agreement on the part of the sponsors \nto strike a part of the original amendment which would have created \nsome very difficult bureaucratic problems in terms of reporting case by \ncase as to why decisions were made one way or another.\n  So I do hope we can promptly agree to the amendment. I thank Senators \nLieberman and Graham.\n  Again, my own preference is there not be either a presumption or a \npreference one way or the other, but I think this does even the \nbalance. Again, it is a sense of the Senate, so it will be left to the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Levin for his \nstatement. It is always a very thoughtful and mutually respectful \nprocess when you work with Senator Levin, even on matters of \ndisagreement, and I appreciate the resolution.\n  I would just like to say in response to the comments of my friend \nfrom Rhode Island--and there is nothing here intended to in any way \ndisparage the work of the Federal prosecutors, and I appreciate the \nrecord he cited of the prosecutions, but the point Senator Graham and I \nare trying to make, and I hope the whole Senate will, is that \nviolations of the laws of war are inherently different. Regardless of \nthe outcome--how many people are convicted or put in jail or not--those \nallegations of such crimes belong before military commissions, or \ntribunals as they have been called throughout our history, not in \nFederal criminal courts where other violations of our domestic criminal \nlaw are handled. Part of that is just an appropriate allocation of \nresponsibility. Part of it is that I think it is important we not fall \ninto a misunderstanding that we are not involved in war. It is a very \ndifferent kind of war, but it is a war, and we know that from the \ncasualties we suffered on 9/11 and people around the world have \nsuffered before and since in a lot of other cities and countries. So we \nare making a point of an appropriate forum for the trial of cases, not \nbased on outcome but based on where these allegations are best tried.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1650), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND \n                   COSTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR \n                   FAMILIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the Armed Forces and their families \n     endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current combat operations, but also during the wars of the \n     last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     retirement benefits, including lifetime health benefits, that \n     a grateful Nation provides for those who choose to \n     subordinate their personal life to the national interest for \n     so many years.\n       (4) Currently serving and retired members of the uniformed \n     services and their families and survivors deserve benefits \n     equal to their commitment and service to our Nation.\n       (5) Many employers are curtailing health benefits and \n     shifting costs to their employees, which may result in \n     retired members of the Armed Forces returning to the \n     Department of Defense, and its TRICARE program, for health \n     care benefits during retirement, and contribute to health \n     care cost growth.\n       (6) Defense health costs also expand as a result of \n     service-unique military readiness requirements, wartime \n     requirements, and other necessary requirements that represent \n     the ``cost of business'' for the Department of Defense.\n       (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, too \n     many of those efforts have been devoted to shifting a larger \n     share of the costs of benefits under that program to retired \n     members of the Armed Forces who have earned health care \n     benefits in return for a career of military service.\n       (8) In some cases health care providers refuse to accept \n     TRICARE patients because that program pays less than other \n     public and private payors and imposes unique administrative \n     requirements.\n       (9) The Department of Defense records deposits to the \n     Department of Defense Military Retiree Health Care Fund as \n     discretionary costs to the Department in spite of legislation \n     enacted in 2006 that requires such deposits to be made \n     directly from the Treasury of the United States.\n       (10) As a result, annual payments for the future costs of \n     servicemember health care continue to compete with other \n     readiness needs of the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have an \n     obligation to provide health care benefits to retired members \n     of the Armed Forces that equals the quality of their selfless \n     service to our country;\n       (2) past proposals by the Department of Defense to impose \n     substantial fee increases on military beneficiaries have \n     failed to acknowledge properly the findings addressed in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (3) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n     to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that \n     do not disadvantage retired members of the Armed Forces who \n     participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE program, \n     and should pursue any and all such options rather than \n     seeking large increases for enrollment fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments for such retirees, and their families or \n     survivors, who do participate in that program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1662\n\n(Purpose: To expand the provision authorizing special compensation for \n members of the uniformed services with certain injuries or illnesses \n                     incurred in the line of duty)\n\n       Strike section 617 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 617.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1759\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to speak today about an \namendment I have offered to the National Defense Authorization Act, No. \n1759, to provide $16.8 million in funding for the research and \ndevelopment of a program called ``1760 in the Bay,'' which will allow \nfor our B-52 fleet to carry GPS-guided ``smart weapons'' internally in \nthe bomb bay.\n  Currently, the B-52 can only carry these important weapons \nexternally, on its wing pylons. Giving the B-52 this expanded \ncapability would allow for an increase in the aircraft's overall bomb-\nload capacity, or for an increase in its fuel efficiency and range by \nusing an internal-only weapons load.\n  As early as 1993, the Air Force documented the requirement for \ninternal carriage of precision-guided munitions in its B-52H \nConventional Upgrade Operational Requirements Document. The Air Force \nreaffirmed its belief in the need for this requirement in 2005, and \nCongress continued to fund the program in 2006 and 2007. The program is \non the Air Force's fiscal year 2010 unfunded priorities list.\n  My amendment would provide $16.8 million in R funding to complete \nrequired hardware and software development and testing for an \nelectrical upgrade to ``military standard 1760,'' which provides a \ncommon electrical and digital interface between weapons and aircraft. \nThe MIL-STD-1760 connecter is used to transfer guidance information to \nweapons including the GBU-32 JDAM, the AGM-154, and the CBU-103, CBU-\n104, and CBU-105. This technology upgrade will also make it easier to \nadd WCMD, JSOW, and JASSM weapons to the B-52 in the future.\n  This is exactly the kind of investment we need to be making in the B-\n52, an aircraft that is indispensable to maintaining an effective \nbomber force. It is unmatched in its range and payload ability. It is \nthe most cost-effective and reliable component of our Nation's bomber \nforce. It is a plane that we are going to be using more than 30 years \nfrom now. It is truly the ``best bomb truck for the buck.'' \nParticularly in light of the decision by the President and Secretary \nGates to delay procurement of the next-generation bomber, it is \ncritical that we continue to outfit each B-52 with new technology like \nthe ``1760 in the Bay'' program.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1656\n\n  Mr. President, I want to take a moment to talk about an amendment I \nhave offered to the National Defense Authorization Act, No. 1656, that \nwould require a study and report on the recruitment and retention of \nmembers of the Air Force in nuclear career fields.\n  One of the key lessons learned from the nuclear incidents that \noccurred a couple of years ago is that we need to be able to keep our \nbest and brightest in the nuclear force. Working with America's nuclear \narsenal is one of the most demanding jobs in the Air Force. It takes \nspecial people with unique skills to maintain and safeguard our \nnation's most powerful weapons. That is why the Air Force has stated \nthat one of its biggest priorities is reinvigorating the nuclear \nmission.\n  In recent months, I have heard from a number of senior Air Force \nleaders working in the nuclear mission that interest among airmen in \nthe nuclear career field is very high, in part due to sustained \nleadership attention to the nuclear force. Right now, the best and the \nbrightest are flocking to this career field. However, I remain \nconcerned about the long-term outlook of this important area of work. I \nwant to be sure that interest in the field will not wane if the Air \nForce's top priority shifts to other issues.\n  There is absolutely no doubt that leadership at every level of the \nAir Force understands that our nuclear weapons are one of our Nation's \nmost critical assets. By deterring America's enemies, assuring our \nallies, and dissuading potential future adversaries, our nuclear \npersonnel are at war every single day. This is the message of Air Force \nand Department of Defense leadership, and it is the message of the \nSenate and the Congress. But it is not enough for our airmen to simply \nhear that message. They must be given evidence to demonstrate that it \nis more than words.\n  Few needs are more critical than the ongoing effort to determine the \nbest ways to make the systemic change necessary to ensure that every \nairman working on the nuclear mission believes each and every day that \nhis job is critical to the strength and security of the United States. \nThe standup of the Strategic Deterrence and Nuclear Integration Office \non the Air Staff and the new Global Strike Command major command are \nimportant steps. But steps must also be taken to make sure that the \nmessage is understood at every level, even to the youngest cadet.\n  I believe it is necessary to examine what incentives could or should \nbe built into the system in order to ensure that we continue to be able \nto recruit, retain, and develop highly trained and motivated nuclear \npersonnel. That is why I have introduced this amendment to ask the Air \nForce to provide a report on the steps it has taken to improve \nrecruiting and retention and to gauge the potential impact that new \nretention bonuses or assignment incentive pay could have on the \nattractiveness of serving in the nuclear mission, and, in turn, on the \neffectiveness of the force.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1780\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to speak about an amendment that \nI have filed to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2010. The \namendment is an attempt to improve our Nation's support system for our \nNational Guard and Reserve members and their families. The amendment \nrequires evaluating the Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program, and \nidentifying programs that will make the program truly comprehensive.\n  Today, our military and our country have come to rely heavily on the \nmen and women of our National Guard and Reserves to protect our \nnational security. More and more, these citizen-soldiers and their \nfamilies have gone above and beyond the call of duty to serve our \ncountry's interests, engaging in multiple deployments in dangerous \nregions all over the world. Since 9/11, we have seen this increasing \nreliance on our Guard and Reserves in States throughout the country. \nNew Hampshire is no exception. Thousands of Guardsmen and women have \nalready deployed overseas into combat areas. And more than 1,100 \nmembers of the 197th Fires Brigade were recently notified that they \nwill be deployed to the Middle East sometime in the next year. This \nwill represent the single largest deployment in New Hampshire's \nhistory. Although our Guardsmen and Reservists show unwavering passion \nand courage no matter their assignment, these men and women and their \nfamilies did not sign up for this high number of dangerous deployments. \nIt is our responsibility to make sure servicemembers and their families \nreceive the proper services before, during and after deployment so that \nthey can return to their normal lives.\n  The Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program provides important support \nservices to Guard and Reserve members through informational events and \nactivities throughout the predeployment and deployment phases, as well \nas after 30, 60, and 90 days upon their return. However, these \nprograms--often held in an impersonal group setting--are not enough.\n  The National Guard in New Hampshire came to realize that, despite \ntheir best efforts, many of those who deployed continued to fall \nthrough the cracks upon their return. They realized that they needed a \nmore intensive, more personal, professional, and persistent program \nwhich catered to individual family needs. The New Hampshire National \nGuard developed a pilot program to provide each National Guard and \nReservist a professional ``care coordinator'' who is responsible for \nthe kind of personal attention and support that is required to identify \nand support those who are struggling.\n  Though the names have been changed, the real-life stories of the New \nHampshire Guard who have participated in the program are moving and \ndemonstrate a clear need for creating a seamless, nationwide program.\n  In his twenties and a self-employed mechanic by trade, Sergeant Joe \nserved in Iraq from 2006 to 2007. Prior to his deployment, he set up \nhis girlfriend and her children in a rental apartment and gave his \nsavings to support her while he has in Iraq. When he\n\n[[Page S8018]]\n\nreturned to New Hampshire, he suffered from ongoing back pain and PTSD \nthat went undiagnosed; he found that his girlfriend had squandered his \nsavings and defaulted on the rent; and that his business partner had \nclosed up shop. Distraught but not defeated, he rented a room and tried \nto reestablish his business. Despite his best efforts, he has faced a \nseries of jobs losses, bills he could not pay, increasingly severe \nPTSD, and, ultimately, eviction. The New Hampshire National Guard \nChaplain eventually found out about Joe's circumstances and connected \nhim immediately with a care coordinator. His personal care coordinator \nhelped Joe turn his life around: she used emergency funds to provide a \nmodest income and secure temporary housing; she connected him with \nmedical and mental health services through the VA; and paired him with \nthe Easter Seals job placement services that helped Joe get a less \nphysically demanding, full-time job with benefits. Because of this \nsafety net, Joe recently bought a home and is continuing treatment for \nhis PTSD.\n  Because of the New Hampshire National Guard's unique partnership with \nthe New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services, Easter Seals \nin New Hampshire and 22 other civilian and veteran service \norganizations, Guard members and Reservists like Sergeant Joe are able \nto reenter civilian life.\n  However, there is a clear need to provide counseling and support \nservices predeployment as well. As shown in the story of Staff Sergeant \nMary, a single mother of two who is slated for deployment later this \nyear, predeployment services create a foundation for parents and \nfamilies to adjust to deployment while minimizing disruptions to their \nlives.\n  Mary, upon learning of her deployment, feared that she could not \nleave her children with her ex-husband and that she would be unable to \nfulfill her duty with the New Hampshire National Guard despite her \ndesire to serve alongside her colleagues. Hesitant to take help from a \nstranger, she initially resisted meeting with her care coordinator. The \ncoordinator persisted, slowly built a close bond with Mary, and \ndesigned a plan to address Mary's concerns. The care coordinator \nconnected Mary to legal representation to negotiate how the children \nwill be cared for while she is in Iraq--a necessary step to create a \npositive environment for Mary to leave her children. The coordinator \nalso went to the children's school, met with the teachers and \nadministration personally, and provided them with a direct link for \ncommunication and concerns while Mary is deployed. She also arranged \ncounseling for the children so that they will have extra support while \ngrappling with their mother's absence. Mary says that her care \ncoordinator is a ``beacon of light'' who helps guide her through the \nchallenges of being a single parent and deploying soldier. She finds \ncomfort in knowing she has one person by her side throughout her \ndeployment.\n  Unfortunately, the problems Adam and Mary faced are not unique. \nNational Guard and Reservists nationwide face similar problems, and \nwithout programs like the New Hampshire National Guard pilot program \nthey may fall between the cracks.\n  My amendment requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate the \nnationwide Yellow Ribbon Reintegration Program and to closely examine \nhow states have filled gaps in the program to better serve our National \nGuard and Reserve members and their families. Furthermore, the \namendment seeks to identify the best programs so that they can be \nreplicated nationwide.\n  As we call on the National Guard and Reserve to protect the Nation at \nhome and abroad, I call on my colleagues in the Senate to protect these \nbrave men and women and their families to the best of our ability. We \nneed to make sure our policies and programs are worthy of the great \nsacrifice of our citizen-soldiers.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1799, as Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to modify a \npreviously agreed to amendment, No. 1799.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \namendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1799), as modified, is as follows:\n\n                    Amendment No. 1799, as modified\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title V add the following:\n\n     SEC. 557. IMPROVED ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE FOR FAMILY \n                   MEMBERS OF MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD AND \n                   RESERVE WHO ARE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS.\n\n       (a) Initiative to Increase Access to Mental Health Care.--\n       (1) In general.--The Secretary of Defense shall develop and \n     implement a plan to expand existing initiatives of the \n     Department of Defense to increase access to mental health \n     care for family members of members of the National Guard and \n     Reserve deployed overseas during the periods of mobilization, \n     deployment, and demobilization of such members of the \n     National Guard and Reserve.\n       (2) Elements.--The plan required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) Programs and activities to educate family members of \n     members of the National Guard and Reserve who are deployed \n     overseas on potential mental health challenges connected with \n     such deployment.\n       (B) Programs and activities to provide such family members \n     with complete information on all mental health resources \n     available to such family members through the Department of \n     Defense and otherwise.\n       (C) Efforts to expand counseling activities for such family \n     members in local communities.\n       (b) Reports.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, and at such times thereafter as \n     the Secretary of Defense considers appropriate, the Secretary \n     of Defense shall submit to the Committees on Armed Services \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives a report on \n     this section.\n       (2) Elements.--Each report shall include the following:\n       (A) A current assessment of the extent to which family \n     members of members of the National Guard and Reserve who are \n     deployed overseas have access to, and are utilizing, mental \n     health care available under this section.\n       (B) A current assessment of the quality of mental health \n     care being provided to family members of members of the \n     National Guard and Reserve who are deployed overseas, and an \n     assessment of expanding coverage for mental health care \n     services under the TRICARE program to mental health care \n     services provided at facilities currently outside the network \n     of the TRICARE program.\n       (C) Such recommendations for legislative or administration \n     action as the Secretary considers appropriate in order to \n     further assure full access to mental health care by family \n     members of members of the National Guard and Reserve who are \n     deployed overseas during the mobilization, deployment, and \n     demobilization of such members of the National Guard and \n     Reserve.\n\n\n                  Intercontinental Ballistic Missile.\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \nesteemed colleague Senator Enzi, the cochairman of the Senate ICBM \nCoalition, about an amendment the coalition has offered to express the \nsense of Congress on the strategic importance of the intercontinental \nballistic missile.\n  I am happy to offer this amendment on behalf of the members of the \nSenate ICBM Coalition, including my cochairman Senator Enzi, as well as \nSenators Hatch, Tester, Bennett, Baucus, Barrasso, and Dorgan.\n  This amendment, No. 1682, expresses the sense of the Congress that we \nmust maintain the long-term vitality of the triad, that the land-based \nnuclear force is the most stabilizing portion of our nuclear arsenal, \nand that our robust ICBM force must be retained to advance our Nation's \nstrategy of deterrence, assurance, and dissuasion.\n  I strongly believe that all three legs of the triad must be \nmaintained in order to retain a highly reliable and credible nuclear \nforce, and we particularly believe that our ICBM force takes on even \ngreater importance as we draw down our nuclear force.\n\n[[Page S8019]]\n\n  As GEN Larry Welch and others have argued, our land-based nuclear \nforce is the most stabilizing portion of our nuclear arsenal, and it \nbecomes even more so as total warhead numbers shrink. The readiness, \nbroad dispersion, numbers, and low warhead loading of the ICBM force \nmake a successful disarming attack nearly impossible. That deters \nattack from near-peer competitors and dissuades future adversaries from \nbuilding their nuclear forces. It also eliminates the pressure to \nmaintain a launch-on-warning posture.\n  While almost everyone agrees with us that the ICBM is an essential \npart of the triad, some believe that the size of the force can or \nshould be reduced. I strongly oppose cutting the ICBM force below its \ncurrent force structure of 3 wings of 150 missiles each. A reduction in \nthe size of the force below 3 wings would make it increasingly \ndifficult to recruit, retain, and develop highly trained and motivated \npeople. That would have a tremendous impact on the effectiveness of the \nforce.\n  Finally, in light of the serious fiscal challenges facing our Nation, \nit is worth noting that ICBMs are by far the most cost-effective leg of \nthe nuclear triad, coming in at about one-fifth the annual operating \ncost of the submarine-launched leg. What is more, ICBM costs will be \nstable for many years to come, while an extremely expensive replacement \nprogram for the Ohio-class submarine is just about to begin.\n  I support President Obama's efforts to negotiate a new arms control \ntreaty with Russia to replace the expiring Strategic Arms Reduction \nTreaty. However, we must be very careful that reductions to our nuclear \nforces are conducted in a way that avoids creating unnecessary risks. \nOur ICBM force dramatically decreases the risk of nuclear war by \nproviding a stabilizing constant in our nuclear posture, and it ought \nto be maintained at its current levels as an essential part of our \nnation's nuclear force.\n  I thank my colleague Senator Enzi for his work as cochair of the ICBM \nCoalition.\n  Mr. ENZI. I would echo my colleague's remarks, and I share his \nconcern about a reduction in the current ICBM force. The current force \nof 3 missile wings of 150 missiles is appropriate for our national \nneeds.\n  America's dispersed and alert Minuteman III ICBM force is a critical \nelement of the nuclear triad and represents our most responsive, \nstabilizing, and cost-effective strategic force.\n  The strategic nuclear forces that deterred Soviet aggression and kept \nthe limited conflicts of the Cold War era from escalating continue to \nplay a critical role in deterring aggression and dissuading new near-\npeer competitors. At its present size, our ICBM force represents a \nnearly insurmountable hedge against strategic surprise. That force, \nbecause of its broad dispersion and high survivability, is nearly \nimpossible to preempt or disarm. Additionally, the current ICBM force \noffers a high level of crisis stability. This capability also helps to \nreduce the risk of regional arms races that could encourage friends and \nallies to develop their own nuclear capabilities.\n  As our Nation proceeds to analyze and make decisions on future \nstrategic posture and U.S. nuclear policy, I believe that ICBMs will \ncontinue to be the most responsive and stabilizing element of the \nnuclear triad. Minuteman III is a robust, cost-effective, and highly \ncapable system.\n  I also thank my colleague, Senator Conrad, for his work on behalf of \nthe coalition on this issue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank my friend Senator Enzi and each \nmember of the ICBM Coalition for their support for this amendment.\n\n\n               national guard--state partnership program\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I would like to thank the chairman and \nranking member for their leadership and courtesy regarding my amendment \nto provide budget authority for the National Guard--State Partnership \nProgram. I understand that this amendment as accepted would provide the \nprogram with budget authority for fiscal year 2010. I urge the \ncommittee to consult with the Department of Defense, our combatant \ncommanders in the field, and our State adjutant generals regarding the \nefficacy of permanent authority for the program as the committee \nprepares next year's defense bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I appreciate the efforts of my friend from \nOhio on this issue. I know that the committee will continue to consider \nthe views of all stakeholders about this program. I encourage the \nDepartment of Defense to include a request for formal authority in its \nannual legislative proposal to the committee should they find permanent \nauthority necessary.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Levin and \nRanking Member McCain for their leadership and my colleagues on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee for working in a bipartisan fashion to \ncraft the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. This \nbill provides our troops with the resources, training and equipment \nthey need to fulfill their mission. It takes care of our troops and \ntheir families, including a 3.4-percent across-the-board pay raise. \nAdditionally, it authorizes fiscal year 2010 end strengths to allow for \nthe expansion of our Armed Forces and provide a greater time period \nbetween deployments, which will ease some of the burden placed on our \ntroops and their families.\n  This bill includes important language to ensure that the Iraqi and \nAfghan governments take more responsibility for ensuring their own \nsecurity and stability. It provides nearly $7.5 billion to train and \nequip the Afghan National Army and National Police Force; extends for \none year the authority for the Department of Defense--DOD--to support \nState Department programs for security and stabilization assistance; \nemphasizes the need to establish comprehensive measures of progress for \nthe administration's strategy in Afghanistan and Pakistan and report \nregularly to Congress on progress in the region; and provides funding \nfor the Commanders' Emergency Response program in Iraq and Afghanistan \nto enable Commanders to quickly fund humanitarian relief and \nreconstruction projects and authorizes funds to promote Afghan-led \nlocal development.\n  I am pleased that this bill provides our brave men and women in \nuniform the equipment, training and support they require. The bill \nfully funds readiness and depot maintenance programs to ensure that \nforces are trained and their equipment deployment ready. This bill \nprovides $6.7 billion for the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected Vehicle \nFund to protect our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill also \nprovides full funding for the Joint Improvised Explosive Device Defeat \nOrganization. This is very timely as there have been reports of stepped \nup use of Improvised Explosive Devices--IED--in Afghanistan. In light \nof the recent missile tests conducted by North Korea, the authorization \nto convert six additional Aegis ships for missile defense capabilities \nand field additional Terminal High Altitude Air Defense--THAAD--and \nStandard Missile 3--SM-3--missile defense capabilities is very timely. \nAs a long time proponent of corrosion control for DOD systems, I am \nhappy to note that this bill provides for corrosion protection to keep \nequipment working effectively for a longer period of time. This is \nespecially important in light of our current budget situation. If we \ncan protect our systems from the detrimental effects of corrosion and \nmake them last longer, it will save valuable resources.\n  As stewards of taxpayer dollars, we must ensure that there is \nthorough oversight of the Department of Defense's programs and \nactivities. This bill takes important steps to accomplish this \nincluding, enhancing the ability of the DOD IG to conduct audits by \nauthorizing the IG to subpoena witnesses; requiring DOD to justify all \nsole-source contract awards in excess of $20 million; and improving DOD \nfinancial management by requiring the Department to engage in business \nprocess reengineering before it approves a new business system \nmodernization program.\n  One of my priorities as a member of the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee and chairman of the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee is to \nensure our servicemembers and veterans receive the health care services \nthey need, including treatment for invisible wounds of war such as \npost-traumatic stress disorder. I am pleased that this bill\n\n[[Page S8020]]\n\ntakes some important steps in caring for our troops. For example, it: \nRequires the Secretary of Defense to develop and implement a plan to \nincrease the number of military and civilian behavioral health \npersonnel and to consider the feasibility of additional officers and \nenlisted specialties as behavioral health counselors; authorizes the \nservice secretaries to detail up to 25 officers each year as students \nto study for doctorate degrees in clinical psychology; requires person-\nto-person mental health assessments at designated intervals for \nservicemembers deployed in connection with contingency operations; \nrequires an assessment of case management services for behavioral \nhealth care under TRICARE; authorizes travel and transportation \nallowances for up to three individuals to travel with seriously injured \nor wounded individuals during their inpatient stay; authorizes \ncompensation to caregivers for the assistance they provide to \nservicemembers with combat-related catastrophic injuries or illnesses \nrequiring assistance in daily living; and, requires the Department of \nDefense to initiate a process of reform and improvement of the TRICARE \nsystem. It extends eligibility for TRICARE Standard to gray area \nretirees.\n  I have also worked to improve the collaboration and cooperation \nbetween the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to help smooth the transition from military to civilian life. I \napplaud the inclusion of language in this bill that requires the \nSecretary of Defense to report on the exchange of medical data between \nthe Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs, an \nissue I have worked on with Chairman Levin. In addition, the bill \nauthorizes the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans \nAffairs to jointly operate a Federal Health Care Center to showcase its \nability to work in unison to serve current and former servicemembers.\n  This bill exemplifies what can be achieved when we put aside our \nparty differences and work together to support our military. Moreover, \nit demonstrates our commitment to provide our troops and their families \nwith the support that they require and deserve.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Senator Kit Bond and I have worked for many \nyears together as cochairs of the Senate National Guard Caucus. With \nthe assistance of Chairman Levin, we were able to enact landmark \nlegislation in the fiscal year 2008 Defense authorization bill that \namong other actions elevated the chief of the National Guard from \nthree-star general to full general. That so-called National Guard \nEmpowerment Act was designed to ensure that the Guard has a seat at the \ntable in major budget and policy decisions.\n  There were some important lessons learned as the Department of \nDefense moved forward with executing the important changes for the \nGuard implemented in the fiscal year 2008 Defense bill. One glaring \nomission in the reorganization of the Guard Bureau was the absence of a \nvice chief.\n  This evening, Senator Bond and I have again worked closely with \nChairman Levin and the Armed Services Committee to address this \nsituation. We have proposed and the Senate has adopted an amendment to \ncreate the position of vice chief at the National Guard Bureau. This \nposition is critical to the National Guard Bureau and will further \nimprove the day-to-day operations of the National Guard organizing, \ntraining and equipping over 460,000 soldiers, airman and civilian \nforces serving in the United States and overseas.\n  Since the elevation of the chief of the National Guard Bureau to a \nfull general, the roles and responsibilities of the chief have greatly \nexpanded. Much as there is a vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, it became apparent that the National Guard chief needs a senior \ngeneral officer serving as a vice chief to adequately assist the chief \nwith the demands of that new elevated role.\n  In its new capacity as a joint activity, the National Guard bureau \nhas a greater number of joint and interagency responsibilities assigned \nto it. The vice chief will provide essential support to the chief to \nexecute these responsibilities.\n  I join with Senator Bond in thanking Chairman Levin, the Armed \nServices Committee and all of our Senate colleagues for adopting this \namendment to create a vice chief at the National Guard Bureau. Over the \npast 10 years, our nation has called on our Guard forces at home and \nabroad like never before. The Senate is again recognizing the role the \nGuard serves in our national defense by passing this important \namendment.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in 2005, the Base Realignment and Closure--\nthe so-called BRAC--Commission released a final report recommending the \nclosure of 33 military installations and the realignment of 29 other \nbases. While many of us in Congress and communities across the country \nfought against these closures, the report was approved in September \n2005--an approval that resulted in dozens of cities and towns \nnationwide facing a new overwhelming, onerous burden in redeveloping \nthese shuttered bases. According to the data contained in the 2005 \nbase-closing round, nearly 33,000 civilian jobs will be lost in base \nclosures and realignments, 6,500 of which are projected to occur at the \nBrunswick Naval Air Station, BNAS, in my home State of Maine.\n  These communities must be equipped with tools--not hamstrung by \nobstacles--to recover from such a dramatic event as a base closing. And \nso, I rise today to advocate that when this bill goes to conference, \nthe conferees should retain language included in the House Armed \nServices Committee's, HASC, version of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 which would encourage the use of \nno-cost economic development conveyances, EDCs, when disposing of \nexcess military property, in order to assist these communities with the \ndifficult process of base closures. This language was based on a \nprovision I originally authored in the Defense Communities Assistance \nAct of 2009, which was cosponsored by Senators Pryor, Collins, Cochran, \nand Cornyn.\n  Undeniably, base closures have a devastating impact on local \neconomies. In the wake of a closure, communities that have invested so \nmuch over the years to integrate servicemembers and their families \ninvariably confront a sudden and sharp reduction in the number of \ntownspeople. The children who have gone to their schools leave, \nthreatening to lower the amount of funding their districts are eligible \nfor and, in some cases, leading to layoffs of teachers who would no \nlonger be required. Friends who have attended the same church, banked \nat the same financial institutions, and shopped at the same grocery \nstore are gone. Tax revenues decrease and community programs suffer. \nThe consequences of these changes are dramatic enough in even the best \nof economic times.\n  No-cost EDCs mitigate this harm by providing land in the hands of \ncommunities faster--and by transferring property at no cost to the \ncommunity. By accelerating the transfer process, the Department of \nDefense--DOD--will be turning property over to communities faster, \nallowing them to redevelop and create jobs more quickly. This approach \nbenefits everyone involved. The DOD saves both time and money that \nwould otherwise be spent maintaining these facilities during protracted \nnegotiations; communities receive the property at no cost to them and \ncan begin the critical work of economic development and job creation in \nless time; the taxpayers spend less because the land does not remain in \nFederal ownership for a period of years--even a decade; and economic \nredevelopment helps diminish the number of unemployed.\n  Indeed, in 1999, with the help of the Clinton administration, we \nadded no-cost EDCs to the DOD's property disposal toolbox. A January \n2005 Government Accountability Office, GAO, report indicated that the \nchange in policy to no-cost EDCs had yielded successful gains. The \nreport stated that, according to Department of Defense and community \nofficials, the use of economic development conveyances ``. . . had \ngained in popularity with the adoption of the no-cost provision, which, \nin addition to saving money for the new user, virtually eliminated the \ndelays resulting from prolonged negotiations over the fair market value \nof the property and accelerated economic development and job \ncreation.'' In other words, the change in policy garnered the desired \neffect. In fact, the rate of property transfer increased nearly 200 \npercent during the years following the no-cost provision.\n\n[[Page S8021]]\n\n  Yet regrettably, in 2001, some in this body added a requirement to \nthe Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act that stipulated that the \nDepartment of Defense, when using an EDC, should seek ``fair market \nvalue'' in return for the land being transferred. In the past four \nbase-closure rounds, we have had 97 major base closures, along with 235 \nsmaller closures and 55 major realignments, and we never asked for fair \nmarket value. Why we took steps backward to this requirement of ``fair \nmarket value'' when we succeeded in clearing the logjam makes no sense \nto me.\n  It is unfair to now begin placing such a high premium on fair market \nvalue for EDCs after four rounds that have spurred significant savings \nto the Department of Defense. Recognizing this problem, I introduced an \namendment in 2005 to the Defense authorization bill that was far more \nstringent than the current House language. It would have essentially \nrequired all excess real and personal property to be transferred to \ncommunities at no-cost, with exceptions for national security reasons. \nThat amendment received 36 votes then--even in its rather rigid form. \nIn fact, then-Senator Obama voted for my amendment--an amendment that \nwould have gone much farther in its scope than the language in the HASC \nbill.\n  Earlier this year, to once again stand up for these base communities, \nI introduced the Defense Communities Assistance Act of 2009. As I \nmentioned before, this vital legislation includes a provision to strike \nexisting language stating that the DOD shall seek fair market value \nwhen disposing excess military property, and encourage the transfer of \nclosed military installations to communities quickly by placing the no-\ncost economic development conveyance on a level playing field with \nother methods of disposal. I am pleased a modified version of my \nprovision was included in the House Armed Services Committee's bill. \nThe Senate Armed Services Committee, SASC, meanwhile, has included \nlanguage in its version of the DOD authorization bill reiterating the \nDepartment's ability to use a range of property transfer options, \nincluding the no-cost EDC. Regrettably, the Sense of the Senate \nlanguage, even as improved by the amendment Senator Pryor and I have \nintroduced, does not go far enough. That is why, moving forward, I urge \nmy colleagues to support the House provision in conference.\n  Redeveloping base properties today and in the near future, our \ndefense communities must address an economic landscape that is unlike \nany other we have witnessed in decades. The unemployment rate stands at \n9.5 percent--the highest level in nearly 26 years. The economy shed \n467,000 jobs in June alone. More than 14.7 million Americans are \npresently without jobs, and 6.5 million payroll jobs have been lost \nsince the beginning of this recession in December 2007. We are in the \nworst economy since the Great Depression, one that contracted 5.5 \npercent in the first quarter of 2009.\n  As such, there is much concern--particularly among those communities \nenduring impending base closures--that without increased use of no-cost \nEDCs, communities will not be able to quickly bring back the jobs that \nwill be lost and acres upon acres of property will sit fallow, more a \nhazard to the community than a benefit. They fear that time-consuming, \ncostly delays will hamper their effective and meaningful redevelopment \nefforts as the DOD attempts to play realtor. As former DOD Deputy Under \nSecretary for Installations, Randall Yim, summarized in 1999, ``The No-\nCost EDC authority provides an opportunity for a collaborative \nrelationship by assisting communities with creating new jobs on the \nformer installation and relieving the Department of needless caretaker \nexpenses.'' And that is what the crux of the matter is--working with \ncommunities affected by the closure of a military installation to \nmitigate devastating economic consequences, and doing so in a timely \nmanner that curbs the waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  I also would like to add that the House Armed Services Committee's \nprovision would not eliminate the Department's ability to use other \nmethods of disposal presently available in the toolbox--such as public \nauctions, public benefit conveyances, disposal for use by the homeless, \nnegotiated sales, transfers to other Federal agencies, and leases of \nland. Instead, it would put the no-cost EDC on a level playing field \nwith these other essential disposal mechanisms, so that communities may \nbegin the urgent process of creating good, high-paying jobs while \nsimultaneously saving the Defense Department from needless costs and \nwaste of taxpayer dollars.\n  The No. 1 complaint I have heard over and over again from communities \nwith BRAC-closed bases is the time-consuming, lengthy, and inefficient \nprocess with regard to property transfer. The House provision would \ntake a giant step toward reversing these trends and help get \ncommunities back on their feet faster, particularly during the economic \nconditions our Nation presently faces. I hope we would respect the \ninterests of the community that is directly affected. After all, they \nare the ones who are disproportionately bearing the costs of the base \nclosure.\n  In closing, I want to again cite Secretary Yim, who, in reference to \nthe job losses facing communities with base closures, eloquently wrote \nthat, ``. . . these jobs were an economic engine . . . of enormous \npower for these communities, and these communities contributed in many \nways to our mission, from building roads, schools, utility systems, to \nmaking educational and business and consumer and recreational \nopportunities readily available for our military. Some communities even \nwent so far as to give us the property for free. We have an obligation \nto help mitigate the impacts caused by our base closure decisions.'' He \ncontinued by saying that, ``We view it as an investment, not a give-\naway, and a continuation of the tradition of taking care of our people \nbefore, during, and after our time of need.'' And, frankly, isn't that \nhow we should view our defense communities that have time and again \nsacrificed so much for the good of the Nation? I certainly believe it \nis.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak in support of \nthe Levin-McCain amendment, Senate amendment No. 1469, to the 2010 \nNational Defense Authorization Act. Ending production of the F-22 and \nsupport for the Levin-McCain amendment reflects the best judgment of \nthe President, Secretary of Defense Gates, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff Mullen, the unanimous Joint Staff including the Chief of Staff \nof the Air Force Schwartz and Secretary of Air Force Donley. These \nindividuals have carefully considered and weighed the current and \nlikely threats to the nation. They have considered the Nation's \nnational security priorities, policies, and budget, including the \ndefense budget, and have reached the unanimous conclusion to end \nproduction at 187 aircraft.\n  On July 16, Secretary Gates said in Chicago that ``the grim reality \nis that with regard to the defense budget, we have entered a zero-sum \ngame. Every defense dollar devoted to--diverted to fund excess or \nunneeded capacity, whether for more F-22s or anything else, is a dollar \nthat will be unavailable to take care of our people, to win the wars we \nare in, to deter potential adversaries, and to improve capabilities in \nareas where America is underinvested and potentially vulnerable. That \nis a risk I cannot accept and one that I will not take.''\n  I agree with Secretary Gates; therefore, I voted to strike the $1.75 \nbillion to fund just seven more F-22 aircraft--not even a full \nsquadron.\n  Not only do I support the administration's budget request in this \nregard, but I also support the excellent work of the Armed Services \nCommittee. Under the leadership of Chairman Levin and Senator McCain, \nthe committee funded the urgent research and development priorities of \nthe Air Force's Joint Strike Fighter Program; the high but unfunded \npriorities of the Navy; and the all-important operations and \nmaintenance needs of the Army. As Secretary Gates said, ``we have \nentered a zero-sum game'' and every defense dollar counts.\n  If the $1.75 billion F-22 funding stayed in the bill it would cut \n$850 million from operations and maintenance--O is \nmoney that would be used to perform depot maintenance on our Navy \naircraft and ships at Navy and industry locations\n\n[[Page S8022]]\n\naround the country including facilities located in Jacksonville, FL. \nThe Chief of Naval Operations identified these funding priorities in \nthe fiscal year 2010 unfunded programs list, UPL. Mr. President, I will \nask to have printed in the Record the Chief of Naval Operations and the \nNavy's UPL. If we authorize and fund continued procurement of F-22, \nthen these critical shortages will not be addressed.\n  Other accounts reduced to pay for the $1.75 billion unwanted F-22 \nprocurement include funding for aircraft maintenance for the Air Force \nand mission support and training activities for Special Operations \nCommand. Furthermore, $400 million would be cut from military personnel \naccounts. Reductions in military personnel funding will affect unit \nreadiness by hindering the Services' ability to meet manning goals for \nend strength and operational units prior to deployment.\n  It has indeed become a zero-sum game; thus, I support the effort of \nChairman Levin and Senator McCain to restore funding for these vital \naccounts for readiness, support, and personnel. I support the military \nand professional judgments of the President, the Secretary of Defense, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the Joint Staff to end \nthe F-22 program at 187 aircraft.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Chief of Naval Operations and the Navy's UPL to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Department of the Navy,\n\n\n                                    Chief of Naval Operations,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2009.\n     Hon.

Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nFiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act. Let me begin by \nthanking the committee's distinguished chairman, Senator Levin, and \nranking member, Senator McCain, for their leadership in crafting this \nbill and for their strong commitment to our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  This legislation will provide essential training, equipment, and \nsupport to our troops as they engage in combat overseas and in \nexercises at home. The legislation will provide critical force \nprotection to our men and women in uniform; help restore our military's \nreadiness; and continue the development of technologies to counter \nexisting and emerging threats. This is a critical time in our nation's \nhistory and the committee has, once again, demonstrated its strong \nsupport of our soldiers, airmen, sailors, and marines and their \nfamilies.\n  It also offers an important opportunity for continued debate as to \nour Nation's strategy in Afghanistan. The legislation we are now \ndebating contains an amendment that Senator Ben Nelson and I offered \nduring committee markup to express the sense of Congress that the \nadministration should review any previously established measures of \nprogress and establish further measures of progress for both \nAfghanistan and Pakistan.\n  Our proposal was approved unanimously by the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee. It represents a significant bipartisan call for the \nadministration to establish clearly defined policy objectives for \nAfghanistan as our nation sends more troops and billions of additional \ndollars to the region.\n  Time and again, I have expressed serious reservations about sending \nmore troops to Afghanistan without clear, specific benchmarks. The \nPresident needs to provide clear, measurable goals for Afghanistan and \nthe region. I have raised my concerns with top Pentagon officials, \nincluding Commander of U.S. Central Command General David Petreaus and \nCommander of U.S. Forces in Afghanistan General Stanley McChrystal \nabout the risks in sending additional troops to Afghanistan. I have no \ndoubts at all about the courage and skill of our men and women in \nuniform. They are simply the best in the world. I have considerable \ndoubts about whether the President's strategy can succeed.\n  The legislation before us also includes a strong commitment to \nstrengthening Navy shipbuilding. A robust Navy budget is of critical \nimportance. Our nation needs a strong and modern naval fleet in order \nto counter existing and emerging threats.\n  For several years, military leaders have documented a minimum \nnational requirement for 313 ships to support our Navy and Marine \nCorps. Unfortunately, however, the Navy's fleet has declined to 283 \nships. I am deeply concerned by the decreasing size of the Navy fleet \nand have worked to increase the funding allocated to shipbuilding. This \nlegislation is an important step toward reversing that troubling \ndecline.\n  As the threats from around the world continue to grow, it is vitally \nimportant that the Navy have the best fleet available to counter those \nthreats, keep the sealanes open, and to defend our Nation. Bath Iron \nWorks and the shipyards of this country are ready to build whatever \nships the Navy needs. It is vitally important that there not be a gap \nin shipbuilding that jeopardizes our industrial base. That is what this \nlegislation works to accomplish.\n  The instability and inadequacy of previous naval shipbuilding budgets \nhave had a troubling impact on our shipbuilding industrial base and has \ncontributed to significant cost growth in the Navy's shipbuilding \nprograms. The 313-ship plan, combined with more robust funding by \nCongress, will begin to reverse the decline in Navy shipbuilding.\n  This bill authorizes $1 billion in funding for construction of the \nthird DDG-1000 and honors the agreement the Navy negotiated to build \nall three ships at Bath Iron Works, BIW. The Pentagon's preference to \nhave BIW build all three of the DDG-1000s demonstrates confidence in \nBIW, should ensure stable work for the shipyard, and should also help \nto stabilize production costs for the Navy.\n  That same confidence was also demonstrated this May when Defense \nSecretary Robert Gates toured BIW, the first official tour of our \nshipyard by a Defense Secretary since the 1950s. Secretary Gates said \nthat what impressed him most during his tour was BIW's ability to \ninnovate and the pride and professionalism of its workforce. Maine has \na long and proud history of innovation and creativity, and BIW \nrepresents Maine ingenuity at its best. Secretary Gates's statement \nthat the men and women of BIW will have consistent work for years into \nthe future was a very welcome acknowledgement of the yard's \naccomplishments.\n  In addition, this legislation authorizes $2.2 billion for continued \nDDG-51 procurement and nearly $150 million for the DDG-51 modernization \nprogram.\n  Our bill also includes a provision that repeals a requirement enacted \nin the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008 that \nwould require all future surface combatants to have nuclear propulsion \nsystems. The provision allows the Navy to conduct analyses of \nrequirements capabilities for new ship classes without biasing the \nanalyses in favor of one propulsion option or another. Continuing this \nrequirement would dramatically increase the costs of large surface \ncombatants, reduce the overall number of ships that could be built at a \ntime when the Navy is seeking to revitalize and modernize its fleet, \nand would undermine the Chief of Naval Operations 313-ship plan.\n  Our Senate bill also includes funding for additional littoral combat \nships.\n\n[[Page S8023]]\n\nWhile this program has suffered a number of setbacks, the Navy, with \nthe help of Congress, has taken significant steps in order to better \noversee this program. These ships are important for the Navy in order \nto counter new, asymmetric threats, and the Navy needs to get these \nships to the fleet soon.\n  The Senate's fiscal 2010 Defense authorization bill also includes \nfunding for other defense-related projects that benefit Maine and our \nnational security.\n  The bill authorizes $28 million for a new aircraft hangar at the \nBangor Air National Guard base in Bangor, ME. This new hangar is \nessential for the Maine Air National Guard and will replace the 55-\nyear-old building the guard now uses. With the construction of a new \nhangar, the Maine Air Guard will be able to better maintain its \naircraft.\n  The bill also authorizes $7.1 million for Portsmouth Naval Shipyard \nto be used for security improvements at Gate No. 2. The money will be \nused to install new antiterrorism and protection measures at the guard \nhouse that will improve security.\n  Funding also is provided for machine guns and grenade launchers, both \nof which are manufactured by the highly skilled workers at Saco Defense \nin Saco, ME.\n  In addition, the legislation authorizes $10.5 million for the \nUniversity of Maine. This funding would support continued research and \ndevelopment of light weight modular ballistic tent insert panels \ndesigned by the University of Maine's Army Center of Excellence in \nOrono. These panels provide crucial protection to servicemembers in \ntemporary dining and housing facilities in mobile forward operating \nbases in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The funding would also support continued research and development of \nhigh temperature sensors for health monitoring of aerospace components. \nThese sensors are capable of sensing physical properties such as \ntemperature, pressure, corrosion and vibration in critical aerospace \ncomponents.\n  And, the bill would also support continued research and development \nof cellulose nanocomposites panels for enhanced blast and ballistic \nprotection as well as provide for woody biomass conversion to JP-8 \nFuel.\n  Finally, I am pleased that this bipartisan Defense bill also \nauthorizes a 3.4- percent across-the-board pay increase for \nservicemembers, half a percent above the President's budget request.\n  This bill provides the vital resources to our troops and our nation \nand recognizes the enormous contributions made by the State of Maine to \nour national security. The bill provides the necessary funding for our \ntroops, and I offer it my full support.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order other than the pending amendments; that upon \ndisposition of the pending amendments and managers' amendments as noted \nbelow, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate then proceed to \nvote on passage of S. 1390, as amended; further, that upon passage of \nS. 1390, it be in order, en bloc, for the Senate to consider the \nfollowing Calendar items: 90, 91, and 92; that all after the enacting \nclause of each bill be stricken and the following divisions of S. 1390, \nas passed by the Senate, be inserted as follows: Division A, S. 1391; \nDivision B, S. 1392; Division C, S. 1393; that these bill be read a \nthird time, passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, en bloc; further, that the consideration of these items appear \nseparately in the Record; further, that the Senate then proceed to the \nconsideration of Calendar No. 96, H.R. 2647, the House companion; that \nall after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 1390, as \namended, and passed by the Senate be inserted in lieu thereof, the bill \nbe read a third time, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table; that upon passage of H.R. 2647, as amended, the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House on the \ndisagreeing votes of the two Houses, and the Chair be authorized to \nappoint conferees on the part of the Senate, with the Armed Services \nCommittee appointed as conferees; that notwithstanding passage of S. \n1390, it still be in order for managers' amendments to be considered \nand agreed to if they have been agreed upon by the managers and the \nleaders; and that no points of order be considered waived by virtue of \nthis agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we will be in session tomorrow. We have some \nwork to do. There will be no votes tomorrow. We received permission \nfrom everyone to move to the Energy and Water appropriations bill. We \nwill do that sometime late Monday afternoon. We have to make sure the \nmanagers are available.\n  We have accomplished a great deal with this massive bill that is now \nbefore this body. We had a few rocky roads to begin with--hate crimes \nand gun legislation--but we were able to arrive at this point with the \nskill of the two managers, frankly. I appreciate very much Senator \nLevin and Senator McCain for their brilliant work on this bill. We have \n2 weeks after we come back. We have two appropriations bill to do. We \nhave the Supreme Court nomination. We have to make sure we take action \nso the highway fund doesn't go dry. We have some FHA stuff that is \nimportant. We have some unemployment stuff. It appears at this time the \nHouse is going to send us a single package for that. We have travel \npromotion. All of these things I have spoken about in some detail with \nthe Republican leader. Now that we have a pathway forward, I think we \ncan have a very productive work period.\n  The Finance Committee is still working on a markup as it relates to \nhealth care, but that is a different issue, and I don't think we need \nto involve that tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1657, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n1657, Senator Sessions amendment, be further modified and that we agree \nto it by voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is further \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 1657), as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. NO MIRANDA WARNINGS FOR AL QAEDA TERRORISTS.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--In this section--\n       (1) the term ``foreign national'' means an individual who \n     is not a citizen or national of the United States; and\n       (2) the term ``enemy combatant'' includes a privileged \n     belligerent and an unprivileged enemy belligerent, as those \n     terms are defined in section 948a of title 10, United States \n     Code, as amended by section 1031 of this Act.\n       (b) No Miranda Warnings.--Absent an unappealable court \n     order requiring the reading of such statements, no military \n     or intelligence agency or department of the United States \n     shall read to a foreign national who is captured or detained \n     as an enemy combatant by the United States the statement \n     required by Miranda v.

Under the previous order, the Senate insists \non its amendments and requests a conference with the House.\n  The Chair appointed Mr. Levin, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Byrd, Mr. Lieberman, \nMr. Reed of Rhode Island, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Nelson of Florida, Mr. Nelson \nof Nebraska, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Webb, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Udall of Colorado, \nMrs. Hagan, Mr. Begich, Mr. Burris, Mr. McCain, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. \nSessions, Mr. Chambliss, Mr. Graham, Mr. Thune, Mr. Martinez, Mr. \nWicker, Mr. Burr, Mr. Vitter, and Ms. Collins conferees on the part of \nthe Senate.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder now if the Senator from New York might be \nrecognized for a brief colloquy with me which will last no more than 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an \namendment which I had offered which was not included in the managers' \npackage. It has passed in the House. It is about the issue of autism.\n  We have a significant issue with regard to autism in the military. \nThe autism spectrum disorder affects 1 in every 150 American children, \n1 in every 90 boys, more than pediatric cancer, diabetes, and AIDS \ncombined. A new case of autism is diagnosed every 20 minutes, making it \nthe fastest growing serious developmental condition in the United \nStates. And if this continues, autism could reach 4 million Americans \nin the next 10 years.\n  In the military, autism is even more prevalent. There are currently \nover 13,000 children of Active-Duty servicemembers with autism. \nRepresenting about 1 percent of the Nation's total population, military \nfamilies understand all too well the financial impact and the emotional \nburden of this disorder. Despite this, the Department of Defense has \nbeen unable to adequately provide autism therapy services to their \nfamilies.\n  Currently, autism treatment is subject to a monthly cap under the \nhealth insurance system, TRICARE. It also has a very burdensome \napplication process, which can delay critical care for our military \nfamilies. My amendment is designed to change this, to make sure this \ncap no longer applies so that these military families have access to \nthe care their children need.\n  One example. One family's son, Taylor, has autism, and he is 7 years \nold. They are dependent on the TRICARE autism treatment because his IQ \nis at 73, and the cutoff for the New York State program is 70. So they \nbudget about $500 extra out of pocket per month to pay for Taylor's \ntherapy. But it is far less than Taylor actually needs to achieve his \npotential.\n  So what we are hoping to do is ultimately make sure that children who \nhave autism, whose mothers or fathers are serving in the military will \nhave access to the number of hours of treatment doctors recommend. We \nhope that through these efforts, down the line we can begin to provide \nthese resources for the men and women who put their lives on the line \nevery day for our country.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me commend the Senator from New York \nfor identifying a very significant problem. She has always shown great \nsensitivity to the men and women in the Armed Forces.\n  There is a provision in the House bill--we are not sure exactly what \nit is--that relates to this issue and the need to provide for autistic \nkids. We will take a look at that in conference and see if there is \nanything we can do to move in the direction which the Senator from New \nYork has so properly identified.\n\n\n                             Thanking Staff\n\n  The proud tradition that our committee has maintained every year \nsince 1961 continues with the Senate's passage of this 48th consecutive \nnational defense authorization bill. We are motivated to pass this \nbill, as we are every year. In fact, we are inspired to pass this bill \nfor the men and women of our Armed Forces and their families. They give \nit everything they have 24/7. They never give up and they never give \nin. We always have to work long and hard to pass this bill, but it is \nworth every bit of effort we put into it. I\n\n[[Page S8025]]\n\nthank our leadership on both sides of the aisle and all Senators for \ntheir role in keeping the tradition going.\n  Our committee's bipartisanship also makes this moment possible. I am \nproud to serve with Senator McCain. I am grateful for his partnership \nand his friendship. To all of the committee members--we have one of our \ncommittee members presiding at the moment--your work on a bipartisan \nbasis the entire year is most appreciated.\n  I want to thank not only our subcommittee chairs and ranking members \nbut give special thanks to the six new members who joined our committee \nthis year. We work together in committee. We did not allow our \ndifferences on this bill to divide us; we reported the bill \nunanimously. And to Charlie Armstrong in the Office of Senate \nLegislative Counsel, after drafting hundreds of amendments to this bill \nagain this year, many, many special thanks to you.\n  Our committee staff members, if they are still here--many of them \nare--many of them are still in Russell working tonight--you deserve \nmuch more than heartfelt thanks, but that is all we can offer to you \nright now. They were led by Rick DeBobes, our committee staff director, \nand Joe Bowab, our Republican staff director. Our staff unselfishly \nsacrifices and works incredibly hard on this bill.\n  So please go home now, staff, enjoy a couple of hours--no more than \n3, please--of sleep and enjoy a nonmicrowave meal for a change. We know \nyou will be back at 6 o'clock in the morning fully rested and ready to \ntackle the conference with your talents, ability, and teamwork. We \ncould not be where we are now without you.\n  They deserve our recognition as a tribute to their professionalism. \nAnd as a further expression of our gratitude, I ask that all of their \nnames appear in the Record at this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n                 senate armed services committee staff\n\n       Adam J.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRODUCTION OF MOLYBDENUM-\n                   99.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are fewer than five reactors around the world \n     currently capable of producing molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) and \n     there are no such reactors in the United States that can \n     provide a reliable supply of Mo-99 to meet medical needs.\n       (2) Since November 2007, there have been major disruptions \n     in the global availability of Mo-99, including at facilities \n     in Canada and the Netherlands, which have led to shortages of \n     Mo-99-based medical products in the United States and around \n     the world.\n       (3) Ensuring a reliable, supply of medical radioisotopes, \n     including Mo-99, is of great importance to the public health.\n       (4) It is also a national security priority of the United \n     States, and specifically of the Department of Energy, to \n     encourage the production of low-enriched uranium-based \n     radioisotopes in order to promote a more peaceful \n     international nuclear order.\n       (5) The National Academy of Sciences has identified a need \n     to establish a reliable capability in the United States for \n     the production of Mo-99 and its derivatives for medical \n     purposes using low-enriched uranium.\n       (6) There also exists a capable industrial base in the \n     United States that can support the development of Mo-99 \n     production facilities and can conduct the processing and \n     distribution of radiopharmaceutical products for use in \n     medical tests worldwide.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, including Mo-99 \n     and its derivatives, are essential components of medical \n     tests that help diagnose and treat life-threatening diseases \n     affecting millions of people each year; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy should continue and expand a \n     program to meet the need identified by the National Academy \n     of Sciences to ensure a source of Mo-99 and its derivatives \n     for use in medical tests to help ensure the health security \n     of the United States and around the world and promote \n     peaceful nuclear industries through the use of low-enriched \n     uranium.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1808\n\n(Purpose: To provide to members of the Armed Forces and their families \n comprehensive information on benefits for members of the Armed Forces \n                          and their families)\n\n       At the end of subtitle G of title V, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 573.

REPORT ON TAIWAN'S AIR FORCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Defense's (DoD) 2009 \n     Annual Report on Military Power of the People's Republic of \n     China, the military balance in the Taiwan Strait has been \n     shifting in China's favor since 2000, marked by the sustained \n     deployment of advanced military equipment to the Chinese \n     military regions opposite Taiwan.\n       (2) Although the DoD's 2002 Report concluded that Taiwan \n     ``has enjoyed dominance of the airspace over the Taiwan \n     Strait for many years,'' the DoD's 2009 Report states this \n     conclusion no longer holds true.\n       (3) China has based 490 combat aircraft (330 fighters and \n     160 bombers) within unrefueled operational range of Taiwan, \n     and has the airfield capacity to expand that number by \n     hundreds. In contrast, Taiwan has 390 combat aircraft (all of \n     which are fighters).\n       (4) Also according to the DoD's 2009 Report, China has \n     continued its build-up of conventional ballistic missiles \n     since 2000, ``building a nascent capacity for conventional \n     short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) strikes against Taiwan \n     into what has become one of China's primary instruments of \n     coercion.'' At this time, China has expanded its SRBM force \n     opposite Taiwan to seven brigades with a total of 1,050 \n     through 1,150 missiles, and is augmenting these forces with \n     conventional medium-range ballistic missiles systems and at \n     least 2 land attack cruise missile variants capable of ground \n     or air launch. Advanced fighters and bombers, combined with \n     enhanced training for nighttime and overwater flights, \n     provide China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) with \n     additional capabilities for regional strike or maritime \n     interdiction operations.\n       (5) Furthermore, the Report maintains, ``the security \n     situation in the Taiwan Strait is largely a function of \n     dynamic interactions among Mainland China, Taiwan, and the \n     United States. The PLA has developed and deployed military \n     capability to coerce Taiwan or attempt an invasion if \n     necessary. PLA improvements pose new challenges to Taiwan's \n     security, which has historically been based upon the PLA's \n     inability to project power across the 100 nautical-mile \n     Taiwan Strait, natural geographic advantages of island \n     defense, Taiwan's armed forces' technological superiority, \n     and the possibility of U.S. intervention''.\n       (6) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 requires that, in \n     furtherance of the principle of maintaining peace and \n     stability in the Western Pacific region, the United States \n     shall make available to Taiwan such defense articles and \n     defense services in such quantity ``as may be necessary to \n     enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability,'' allowing that ``the President and the Congress \n     shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense \n     articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the \n     needs of Taiwan . . .''.\n       (b) Report to Congress on Taiwan's Current Air Force and \n     Future Self-Defense Requirements.--Not later than 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President \n     shall submit to Congress a report, in both classified and \n     unclassified form, containing the following:\n       (1) A thorough and complete assessment of the current state \n     of Taiwan's Air Force, including--\n       (A) the number and type of aircraft;\n       (B) the age of aircraft; and\n       (C) the capability of those aircraft.\n       (2) An assessment of the effectiveness of the aircraft in \n     the face of a full-scale concerted missile and air campaign \n     by China, in which China uses its most modern surface-to-air \n     missiles currently deployed along its seacoast.\n       (3) An analysis of the specific weapons systems and \n     platforms that Taiwan would need to provide for it's self-\n     defense and maintain control of its own air space.\n       (4) Options for the United States to assist Taiwan in \n     achieving those capabilities.\n       (5) A 5-year plan for fulfilling the obligations of the \n     United States under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide for \n     Taiwan's self-defense and aid Taiwan in maintaining control \n     of its own air space.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1811\n\n   (Purpose: To extend and enhance reporting requirements related to \n           United States contributions to the United Nations)\n\n       On page 479, between lines 18 and 19, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1222.

Mr. President, as some of my colleagues may be aware, \nthis week the State Department acceded to a Treaty of Amity and \nCooperation in Southeast Asia, TAC. This action reflects an effort by \nthe administration to engage vigorously in the region, which I applaud.\n  The State Department consulted with the Senate prior to taking this \nstep. During the course of these consultations, Senator Kerry, Senator \nLugar, and I sought clarification on issues related to the substance of \nthe TAC and to the unique process suggested for U.S. accession. To \nconfirm our understandings on these points, Senators Kerry, Lugar, and \nI sent a letter to the Secretary of State on July 10, 2009. On the \nbasis of the understandings set forth in this letter, we did not object \nto the Department's plan for acceding to the TAC. I believe the letter \nmay be of some interest to Senators since it involves both the \nconstitutional role of the Senate in the treaty making process and \nAmerican foreign policy in Southeast Asia.\n\n[[Page S8030]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter to \nSecretary Clinton dated July 10, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton: We write to you regarding the \n     proposed U.S. accession to the Treaty of Amity and \n     Cooperation in Southeast Asia (TAC). We believe that U.S. \n     accession to the TAC reflects the strong American commitment \n     to the region and to vigorous engagement with the Association \n     of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), both of which we fully \n     support. The U.S. has important foreign policy and economic \n     interests in Southeast Asia which we believe this agreement \n     can further.\n       There are two important points of clarification, however, \n     that we wish to make as part of the Senate's input in the \n     context of the State Department's congressional \n     consultations. First, we understand that the Department is \n     considering having the United States accede to the TAC in \n     late July as a sole executive agreement, which would not \n     require the advice and consent of the Senate. We note that \n     the title of the agreement refers to the agreement as a \n     ``treaty,'' and we are unaware of any precedent for the \n     United States acceding to an agreement styled as a ``treaty'' \n     without the advice and consent of the Senate as provided for \n     in Article 11, Section 2 of the Constitution. At the same \n     time, we are mindful that other factors apart from the formal \n     name of the agreement could suggest that it is consistent \n     with U.S. practice for the United States to accede to the TAC \n     as an executive agreement. Of particular importance, the \n     agreement is largely limited to general pledges of diplomatic \n     cooperation and would not appear to obligate the United \n     States to take (or refrain from taking) any specific action \n     (with the exception of provisions of Article X which we \n     understand will be the subject of a reservation as discussed \n     below). We also note that the United States did not take part \n     in the negotiations among ASEAN countries leading up to the \n     conclusion of the TAC in 1976, or in the decision to \n     characterize it as a treaty.\n       In light of these unique considerations, we will not object \n     to the Department's plan to accede to the TAC as an executive \n     agreement. We continue to believe, however, that the use of \n     the term ``treaty'' in the title of an agreement will \n     generally dictate that Senate advice and consent will be \n     required before the United States may accede to the \n     agreement. In this regard, treatment of the TAC as an \n     executive agreement should not be considered a precedent for \n     treating future agreements entitled ``treaties'' as sole \n     executive agreements. To ensure our understanding that the \n     process surrounding this agreement is not misinterpreted in \n     the future as a precedent, we will submit this letter into \n     the Congressional Record. We would also request that the \n     State Department include it in the next edition of the Digest \n     of United States Practice in International Law.\n       Second, Article X of the TAC provides that ``[e]ach High \n     Contracting party shall not in any manner or form participate \n     in any activity which shall constitute a threat to the \n     political and economic stability, sovereignty, or territorial \n     integrity of another High Contracting Party.'' We also note \n     that the U.S. has proposed a reservation to the TAC that \n     states that the TAC, noting in particular Article X, ``does \n     not limit actions taken by the United States that it \n     considers necessary to address a threat to its national \n     interests.''\n       We interpret this reservation as ensuring that the TAC does \n     not limit the authority of the U.S. government--either the \n     executive branch or the Congress--to take actions that it \n     considers necessary in pursuit of U.S. national interests in \n     the region or with respect to any individual nation.\n       We thank you for your close consideration of this matter \n     and for the Department's consultation prior to acceding to \n     the TAC.\n           Sincerely,\n     John F. Kerry,\n       Chairman, Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.\n     Mitch McConnell,\n       Republican Leader United States Senate.\n     Richard G.

Mr. President, I take this opportunity to discuss \nthe recent decisions by General Motors and Chrysler to eliminate \nthousands of automobile franchises across America. This is an extremely \nimportant issue: GM's and Chrysler's actions have had a negative impact \non small businesses, employees, consumers, and communities in every \ncorner of my State, West Virginia.\n  Although I do not question the automakers' need to restructure their \ncompanies and become financially viable, I do have serious concerns \nabout the way they have handled these dealership terminations. Neither \ncompany has been fully transparent in explaining why they needed to \nterminate dealerships or how they decided which ones to eliminate. \nNeither company has provided dealers with an adequate opportunity to \nfully appeal their terminations--in fact, Chrysler has not established \nan appeals process at all. And though both companies claim that dealers \nwill be fairly compensated for vehicles, parts, and specialty tools, \nthe reports I continue to receive from terminated Chrysler dealers is \nthat they still have hundreds of thousands of dollars in parts and \nspecialty tools and many have received ``no response at all'' from \nChrysler to their ``numerous requests for assistance.''\n  I also continue to hear the argument that ``this is how things happen \nin the normal bankruptcy process.'' But GM's and Chrysler's \nbankruptcies are anything but normal. How many bankruptcies are funded \nwith billions of taxpayer dollars? How many bankruptcies result in the \ngovernment obtaining a majority interest in the restructured companies? \nUnder these circumstances, the thousands of small business owners whose \nfranchise agreements have been summarily revoked deserve more from the \ncompanies that would not exist but for taxpayer support.\n  That is why I have been fighting from the beginning to find a better \nresolution for the thousands of terminated auto dealers throughout this \ncountry. And although we have seen improvements on behalf of dealers so \nfar, I must admit that I am thoroughly disappointed that GM and \nChrysler have refused to do more. For that reason, I am cosponsoring S. \n1304, the Automobile Dealer Economic Rights Restoration Act of 2009.\n  I fully understand the serious concerns that have been raised about \nthis bill. But the reality is that GM and Chrysler need to understand \nthat they cannot ignore repeated requests by Congress and the American \npeople to treat terminated dealers fairly. It is my hope that by \ncosponsoring this bill, I can help the automakers better appreciate \nthat very important point and ultimately come to the table. They should \nwork with Congress and the dealers on a reasonable resolution--one that \nprovides dealers with fair compensation and a meaningful opportunity to \nchallenge their terminations. That is what the people of West Virginia \nand America expect, and that is what the terminated dealers deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8030-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8030-S8031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           35TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, Saturday, July 25, marks the 35th \nanniversary of the Legal Services Corporation, LSC. In 1974, Congress--\nwith bipartisan support, including that of President Nixon--established \nLSC to be a major source of funding for civil legal aid in this \ncountry. LSC is a private, nonprofit corporation, funded by Congress, \nwith the mission to ensure equal access to justice under law for all \nAmericans by providing civil legal assistance to those who otherwise \nwould be unable to afford it. LSC distributes 95 percent of its annual \nFederal appropriations to\n\n[[Page S8031]]\n\n137 local legal aid programs, with more than 900 offices serving all 50 \nstates and every congressional district.\n  LSC and LSC funded programs make a crucial difference to millions of \nAmericans. In fact, LSC-funded programs close nearly 1 million cases \nper year and provide other assistance to more than 5 million people.\n  Recipients of LSC funding help clients secure basic human needs, such \nas access to wrongly denied benefits including Social Security, \npensions and needed health care. Families of 9-11 victims, flood \nvictims, and hurricane evacuees have received crucial legal assistance \nin obtaining permanent housing, unemployment compensation and \ngovernment benefits. Further, members of our Armed Forces and their \nfamilies receive help with estate planning, consumer and landlord/\ntenant problems and family law.\n  It is LSC-funded attorneys who help parents obtain and keep custody \nof their children, help family members obtain guardianship for children \nwithout parents, assist parents in enforcing child support payments and \nhelp women who are victims of domestic violence. In fact, three out of \nfour legal aid clients are women, and legal aid programs identify \ndomestic violence as one of their top priorities.\n  I know firsthand the important work of the Legal Services \nCorporation. Before I was elected to Congress, I worked as a legal aid \nattorney in Polk County, IA. I experienced the challenges--and also the \nrewards--of representing people who otherwise would not have the legal \nassistance they deserve. And I developed a deep appreciation for the \nrole that legal aid attorneys play within our system of justice.\n  The fact is, our promise of ``equal justice under law'' rings hollow \nif those who are most vulnerable are denied access to quality legal \nrepresentation. As former Justice Lewis Powell said: ``Equal justice \nunder law is not merely a caption on the facade of the Supreme Court \nbuilding. It is perhaps the most inspiring ideal of our society . . . \nit is fundamental that justice should be the same, in substance and \navailability, without regard to economic status.''\n  Given the vital role played by LSC-funded attorneys, it is disturbing \nto note that, this year, more than 50 percent of eligible clients who \nseek assistance will be turned away because of lack of LSC program \nresources. With unemployment nearly 10 percent, and with poor Americans \nstruggling to keep their jobs, cars and basic necessities, the need for \nlegal aid attorneys has never been greater, yet funding for LSC remains \ninadequate. This is something Congress needs to address and I look \nforward in the coming months and years to doing so.\n  On this anniversary, I salute the Legal Services Corporation and LSC-\nfunded attorneys for the vital work they do every day on behalf of \nAmericans who need qualified counsel. Every day that a legal aid \nattorney protects the safety, security and health of our most \nvulnerable citizens, they bring this nation closer to living up to its \ncommitment to equal justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8031-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8031-S8032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING JACOB TRIOLO\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the outstanding \nservice Jacob Triolo has provided to the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship in his capacity as a professional staff \nmember. When Jacob--known to most as Jake--joined the committee staff \nin the spring of 2007, I knew that I had selected a top-notch staffer \nwho cared deeply about making a difference in peoples' lives. We will \nmiss his dedication and insight when he leaves Capitol Hill next month \nto pursue a law degree at Washington & Lee University in historic \nLexington, VA.\n  A native of Oregon and a 2004 dean's list graduate of the University \nof Oregon, Jake came across the country to Capitol Hill in the summer \nof 2004 to begin working for my good friend and former colleague, \nSenator Gordon H. Smith. Starting out in the front office as a staff \nassistant, Jake immediately sought out additional responsibilities and \nwas promoted to the position of legislative correspondent in less than \na year's time. In 2007, when I was looking to hire a new staff member \nto handle a wide-ranging portfolio of issues for the Small Business \nCommittee, I was immediately impressed by Jake's ability to multitask \nand his willingness to tackle a variety of issues simultaneously. His \nastute research, concise analysis, and willingness to accept new \nchallenges made him an ideal candidate to represent the committee on a \nvariety of small business initiatives, including entrepreneurial \ndevelopment programs, disaster oversight, science and innovation, and \nfunding for the Small Business Administration. Additionally, those who \nknow Jake, including Senator Smith, spoke glowingly of his \nprofessionalism and creativity.\n  Jake immediately hit the ground running, compiling intelligent and \nthoughtful background memoranda and hearing materials that contained \ntremendous insight and detailed analysis. One of his first endeavors as \npart of my staff was playing a leading role in developing legislation \nthat would overhaul the SBA's disaster response program. In the wake of \nthe devastation wrought by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita back in 2005, \nJake helped me to identify the causes of the Federal Government's \nsubstandard response by working on the Small Business Disaster Response \nand Loan Improvement Act of 2007. Early in his tenure, Jake came into \nthe office over several weekends, on his own volition, and successfully \nadvocated to include these key provisions into the farm bill \nconference. As a result of his diligence and persistence, I \nsuccessfully worked with a number of my Senate colleagues in advocating \nfor private lending institutions to have the option of making private \ndisaster loans following large-scale disasters. This change, which was \npassed into law, will greatly improve our country's ability to respond \nto natural disasters. As a responsible and trusted member of the \ncommittee team, Jake has also traveled to the gulf region to monitor \nprogress and attend critical field hearings focused on rebuilding \ncommunities devastated by hurricanes.\n  Additionally, as ranking member of the Senate Small Business \nCommittee, I am charged with fully considering the concerns of \nentrepreneurs and small firms nationwide. As such, Jake labored \nextensively on the Patent Reform Act of 2007, helping me to ensure that \nsmall businesses retained their voice in the process by preparing me \nfor negotiations with the Judiciary Committee on provisions that would \nprotect their unique interests. While this legislation did not pass, \nhis efforts helped guarantee that entrepreneurs will be taken into \naccount during discussions of policy changes, such as modifications to \nthe post-grant review process--work that will provide a solid \nfoundation as the Senate continues its attempt at patent reform this \nCongress.\n  Jake's command of individual subject matters and appreciation for \ncollaboration has been a direct result of his tenacious study and \nexposure to the legislative process. In large measure, his success as a \nHill staffer is due to his ability to cultivate lasting professional \nrelationships with staffers from other offices in the Senate, House, \nand at Federal agencies. His sense of humor and easygoing personality \nmake him easily likeable, and many of his colleagues have become close \nfriends throughout the years. Jake is also a tremendously caring \nindividual, and his family plays a central focus in his life. That is \nwhy when his sister, Renata, came to Washington for an internship, Jake \nwas certain to look after her as she followed in her big brother's \nfootsteps.\n  Jake is fond of saying that the classic movie ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington'' has influenced his career, and provided him the impetus \nfor attending law school. Well, Mr. President, Jake Triolo has gone to \nWashington, and he is now headed into a vast frontier where, with his \nknowledge, resilience, and passion, he has a bright future with no \nbounds. I fully expect that in 3 years' time, Jake will be back in \nWashington, serving our Nation's people in one capacity or another. A \ndedicated public servant who has demonstrated a capacious appetite for \nlearning and a true talent for public policy, Jacob Triolo has been an \nasset to me and to the committee staff during his nearly 2\\1/2\\ years \nhere. I wish him luck at Washington & Lee and in every endeavor he \npursues.\n\n[[Page S8032]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8032-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         COMMENDING JIM FISHER\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of Jim Fisher \nand his contribution to my home State of Idaho. For much of the past \nthree decades, Jim has worked at the Lewiston Morning Tribune--first as \na political reporter and then as an editorial page editor.\n  Over the years, Jim and I have crossed paths several times, \nparticularly on the opinion page. In most cases, our views on a given \nissue were not congruent. On the few occasions when Jim and I shared \nthe same opinion, I especially had to take a second look at my \nposition. But you could always count on Jim to be grounded--he always \nthought the issue through before reaching an opinion. He challenged his \nreaders to think and question their assumption or knowledge about an \nissue. He relished being a lightening rod and getting people to talk \nabout the subject of the day.\n  During my time as an Idaho State senator, Governor, and now as U.S. \nSenator, Jim has continued to challenge me to reach for solid, grounded \nthinking. In doing so, I respect and value his viewpoint even when we \ndisagree. His desire was to make his community and state a better \nplace. He wanted to give a voice to those that could not be heard. Jim \nFischer did his job well.\n  I extend to Jim my thanks for his many years of outstanding work on \nthe editorial page in promoting critical thinking on the issues \nimportant to Idaho. Vicki and I wish him the best in his retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8032-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BAYKEEPER\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to \nrecognize the 20th anniversary of the San Francisco Baykeeper.\n  Created in 1989 as the first ``waterkeeper'' organization on the west \ncoast, Baykeeper has experienced many successes over the past 20 years \nin its efforts to reverse the environmental degradation of the past, \nand promote new strategies and policies to protect the water quality of \nthe San Francisco Bay. The ``waterkeeper'' concept dates back to a 19th \ncentury English tradition, and today, the International Waterkeeper \nAlliance is 157 programs strong, with each organization working to \nenforce provisions of the 1972 Clean Water Act and other Federal and \nState laws.\n  Baykeeper fills a unique niche in the bay area by acting as the \nwatchdog for the San Francisco Bay. Baykeeper has become the bay area's \nmost effective advocate, working tirelessly to address the most \npressing problems facing the bay.\n  In its 20 year history, Baykeeper has fought tirelessly to hold \npolluters accountable for illegal toxics, protect native fish and \nwildlife, keep pesticides out of the bay, and fight for an end to \nsewage spills in the bay. Today, as it gets ready to enter its third \ndecade of defending the bay from pollution, Baykeeper is seeing \nprogress toward its vision of a healthy, thriving bay.\n  For 20 years, Baykeeper has worked passionately and effectively to \nensure a thriving San Francisco Bay for generations to come. I commend \nBaykeeper staff and volunteers for their continuing efforts to restore \nthe bay to a teeming estuary that attracts millions of birds, fish, and \nmarine mammals--as well as enchanted visitors, devoted residents, and \npassionate recreationists. I look forward to future generations having \nthe opportunity to enjoy this special part of California for many years \nto come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8032-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8032-S8033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING KEN GORELICK\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, on June 8, 2009, a brilliant \nphysician, humanitarian, intellectual and caring person passed away. I \nknew Ken Gorelick and his extended family for almost 50 years and fully \nbelieve that more physicians like him would make health care more \neffective for many. With all of his intelligence he had a unique belief \nthat his principal responsibility was to devote as much energy as he \ncould muster to help those who needed professional care recover from \ntheir illnesses. He was daring in his choices of treatment for his \npatients always searching to reach beyond conventional methodology for \nthe best outcome.\n  To commemorate his life I ask that a eulogy which was prepared for \nhis funeral be printed in the Record. It so fully describes the unusual \ncharacter of this great human being who will be missed by all who had \nthe privilege of knowing him.\n  The eulogy follows:\n\n                      Kenneth Paul Gorelick, M.D.\n\n       Psychiatrist, essayist, poet, and leading poetry therapist \n     Dr. Kenneth Paul ``Joshua'' Gorelick has left us and this \n     world, after two years of valiant efforts to overcome brain \n     cancer. He was 67.\n       When recently asked why he had chosen psychiatry as a \n     career and life pursuit, Ken responded that he had been \n     fascinated by psychology's promise of a ``way to understand \n     the invisible parts of life'' and ``to understand life \n     stories.'' This great fascination was driven by Ken's \n     intrinsic love of life and people and the human narrative, \n     which, in turn, propelled him on the lifelong journey of an \n     insatiable learner, an inspired teacher, and a caring doctor. \n     He read widely and avidly; he relished the arts and supported \n     them; he wrote extensively, both prose and poetry; he \n     instructed and lectured; he ministered to those in need and \n     healed those he could. Ken possessed that rare Renaissance \n     mind that brought a rich and textured approach to his daily \n     life, his practice as a psychiatrist, and his teaching of \n     psychiatry at St. Elizabeth's Hospital and George Washington \n     University (GWU), where he was awarded Professor Emeritus \n     status, and numerous national and international conferences. \n     Yet, throughout his life of great academic and professional \n     pursuits and accomplishments, he never stopped his joyful \n     appreciation and examination of human behavior and the human \n     condition, and he never stopped attempting to improve that \n     condition through is work and his daily interactions with \n     others.\n       Born and raised in Paterson, New Jersey, the son of Russian \n     Jewish immigrant parents, Ken was inspired to become a doctor \n     early on. When he was four, his father had a heart attack and \n     the daily doctor visits left an indelible impression. A \n     favorite story of his recalls the compliment he received \n     early in his training from a medical school professor for \n     conducting a skillful psychiatric interview. He explained \n     that he had asked just what he had learned to ask customers \n     during his childhood in Gorelick's Bakery, ``How may I help \n     you?''\n       Ken's academic life testified to his fervent desire for \n     learning and understanding. He was first in his class at \n     Montclair Academy (New Jersey) and at Rutgers College. He was \n     awarded the Phi Beta Kappa Prize, as well as General \n     Electric, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, and Henry Rutgers \n     scholarships, and he graduated summa cum laude. Accepted at \n     Columbia, Yale and Harvard Medical Schools, Ken chose instead \n     to accept a Fulbright scholarship to Bordeaux in order to \n     research French literature and study French language, \n     continuing what had by then become a lifelong passion for the \n     beauty and power of the written and sounded word.\n       Again applying to Harvard, Ken was accepted, and he then \n     graduated in 1967. After his medical internship at Mount Zion \n     Hospital and Medical Center in San Francisco, he returned to \n     Harvard in 1968, completing his residence in 1971 at the \n     Massachusetts Mental Health Center. During this period, he \n     also served on the Harvard University faculty as Clinical \n     Instructor in psychiatry.\n       At St. Elizabeth's, the first Federal mental health \n     facility, Ken was an expert in the Hospital's history. He \n     gave numerous lectures and keynoted the St. Elizabeth's 150th \n     Anniversary celebration in 2005. He was a founder of the \n     Historical Museum. Ken was deeply moved and inspired by \n     founder Dorothea Dix's commitment to ``the most humane care \n     and enlightened curative treatment.'' Ken brought this \n     commitment to his private practice and hospital work, \n     encouraged a patient enterprise program, and led DC \n     Council members and others on a visit to Bethel, Germany \n     to see model humane treatment of patients.\n       Ken was a noted pioneer and widely respected leader in the \n     use of literature in the field of psychotherapy, particularly \n     poetry therapy, serving on the executive boards of the \n     National Federation for Biblio/Poetry Therapy, as president \n     of the National Association for Poetry Therapy, and on the \n     National Council of Creative Therapies. In recognition of his \n     many contributions to the field, he received the Outstanding \n     Achievement Award and the Morris Morrison Education Award in \n     2004. With colleague Arleen Hynes, he established the first \n     standardized training curriculum for poetry therapy, founded \n     the Bibliotherapy Training Program at St. Elizabeths, and \n     served as its co-director and clinical supervisor, training \n     hospital staff and community mental health professionals in \n     the use of poetry and other literature in the treatment of \n     hospitalized patients with severe and persistent mental \n     illness. From 1993 to 2007, he co-directed the Wordsworth \n     Center for Poetry Therapy Training.\n       A much sought-after speaker and workshop leader, Ken \n     presented workshops, seminars, and Grand Rounds lectures \n     nationally and internationally at hospitals, universities, \n     and organizational meetings. His articles on mental health, \n     psychopathology, and literature were published in the \n     American\n\n[[Page S8033]]\n\n     Journal of Social Psychiatry, Arts in Psychotherapy, Journal \n     of Poetry Therapy, and Expressive Therapies, to name just a \n     few of the many publications he contributed to over his \n     lifetime. In fact, Ken's contributions as a speaker, writer, \n     organizer, editor, advisor, and leader were extremely \n     numerous and a testament to a man who had amazing erudition \n     and energy.\n       Ken was also an exceptionally generous mentor and colleague \n     and friend, who readily shared his resources, ideas, time, \n     and energy to educate and empower. He had a superb sense of \n     humor and a laugh that was unrestrained and utterly gleeful, \n     and he had the endearing ability to bring smiles and laughter \n     to other people, no matter how difficult their circumstances. \n     His voice's melodic, pleasant lilt communicated a special \n     combination of maturity and caring and welcome that \n     immediately put people at ease, disarming them, and opening \n     them up to the possibilities of life. He possessed deep \n     wisdom and insight into human nature, and he showed \n     exceptional levels of kindness, compassion, and gentleness \n     toward those who are most vulnerable and in need of care. \n     And, despite his intellectual brilliance and considerable \n     professional accomplishments, he had that rare gift to make \n     all those he encountered feel respected and worthy.\n       Never once did Ken Gorelick lose his appreciation of what \n     is essential: each single day, each single person. In an \n     article after a childhood of fear-defying, successful scuba-\n     diving experience, he wrote: ``This day, like every day, has \n     had something to celebrate. And to be grateful for,'' and he \n     went on to quote William Stafford's lines, ``Will you ever \n     bring a better gift for the world/than the breathing respect \n     that you carry/wherever you go right now?''\n       He valued each moment and each person around him. In his \n     touching eulogy for his beloved friend and mentor, Arleen \n     Hynes, Ken praised what he deemed as her superb talent \n     of ``finding the dazzling part of each person, and letting \n     that person know she saw it.'' Ken, too, had that talent \n     and used it to its fullest.\n       There can be no greater example of Ken's sacred, lifelong \n     commitment to serve humanity and his immeasurable generosity \n     of spirit than how he used his own life-threatening brain \n     cancer diagnosis as a powerful means to teach his students, \n     future doctors, the power of human empathy. He openly shared \n     with them how this diagnosis feels to a patient, allowing \n     them to question, sharing his story of how he was treated by \n     doctors, and, through this intimate personal revelation, he \n     taught them how necessary it is to have genuine empathy and \n     what this means to the patient. He taught them the great \n     power of the simple words, ``I'm sorry.'' In Leslie Milk's \n     interview with Ken which is transcribed in her article ``The \n     Doctor as Patient,'' Washingtonian, May 2009, Ken disclosed \n     his story of coping with his brain cancer diagnosis, his \n     awareness of its typical course, his experience with the \n     medical community and the limited status of research, and, so \n     typical of Ken, his determination to enjoy life's riches. He \n     again underscored the value of a doctor's simple ``I'm \n     sorry.''\n       Ken continued, to the very last, to teach medical students \n     and residents to use the power of literature, the words that \n     tell the story of humanity, in their endeavors to help \n     others. He believed in the connection of all people through \n     all time and how that connection can be accessed in the \n     stories, great and small, of each and every person. And, in \n     the end, he even offered the story of his own experience with \n     terminal illness to encourage them to always make the human \n     connection.\n       A poem--written after the first surgery to remove the brain \n     tumor--shares some of his deepest reflections: ``I feel my \n     life has been right . . . I put into each act more thought \n     and mindfulness . . . The trees have been challenged by \n     dryness and lack of cold/ Out of this dearth has come such \n     beauty/ Still clinging with all its tenacity.''\n       Ken's immense joy of being alive and his savoring of each \n     moment of life are reflected in his verses and are echoed by \n     two of his favorite poets, Stanley Kunitz and Mary Oliver. \n     Kunitz wrote in his poem ``The Round'': ``I can scarcely wait \n     till tomorrow/ when a new life begins for me,/ as it does \n     each day,/ as it does each day.'' And Oliver wrote in her \n     poem ``Peonies'': ``Do you love this world?/ Do you cherish \n     your humble and silky life?/ Do you adore the green grass, \n     with its terror beneath?'' Ken's answer, our answer with him, \n     is ``Yes! Forever!''\n       Ken's passing is a great sad event which is for us a time \n     to feel not only the deep loss of a man who gave so much to \n     all, but also the joyful celebration that he lived, a man \n     whose spirit and actions will continue to influence the many \n     people he touched during his time on earth.\n       Dr. Gorelick is survived by his beloved wife, Cheryl \n     Opacinch Gorelick, a retired international policy analyst; a \n     sister and brother-in-law, Arlene and Joseph Taub of New \n     Jersey; a niece and nephew, Michelle Taub Tesser and Scott \n     Tesser; and Marc Taub and Karen Taub, great-nieces and great-\n     nephews, other relatives, friends and colleagues.\n\n     Looking back I feel my life has been right\n     No second-guessing that this or that might have been better,\n     No ache that I might have climbed higher mountains.\n\n     I am in a generous leisurely mood with myself\n     Filled with gratitude and awe for what has been,\n     The gifts, the luck, the love.\n\n     My hunger now is different.\n     I put into each act more thought and mindfulness.\n     Eventually the true cliches come to pass: like ``living in \n           the moment.''\n\n     Time has slowed to a crawl.\n     That is a good thing.\n     Every grain counts as it drops\n     My being, my spirit are pulled by gravity.\n     And they soar.\n\n     Moment to moment I try to solve, ignore, or transcend the \n           frustrations\n     My big eye on the big picture.\n     And that picture is beautiful.\n\n     This fall foliage has not been spectacular.\n     But here, at my back door, there is a city forest\n     No flaming colors\n     Yet the palette is subtle and exquisite\n     A harmony of golds, greens, rusts.\n\n     The trees have been challenged by dryness\n     And lack of cold\n     Out of this dearth has come such beauty\n     Still clinging with all its tenacity\n\n     --Ken Gorelick 11/14/07\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8033-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING WILLIAM L.

A highly successful attorney, \nWilliam Utsey was a personal friend and along, with his friends and \nfamily, I mourn his passing.\n  William was born on October 28, 1939, in Gilbertown, AL. He graduated \nfrom the University of Southern Mississippi in 1962 and received his \nJ.D. from the University of Alabama School of Law. In 1965, William was \nadmitted to the Alabama State Bar. He began his legal career serving as \na clerk and later as an attorney with the firm of Clement, Rosen, \nHubbard, and Waldrop in Tuscaloosa.\n  After practicing law for 5 years in Huntsville, William returned to \nhis home in Choctaw County to embark as a solo practitioner. At the \ntime of his death, William was the senior partner of Utsey and Utsey \nwhere he practiced with his son. William's fondness of the legal \nprofession extended well past his private practice. He served as \npresident of the Choctaw County Bar Association and the Alabama \nAssociation for Justice. In addition, William held memberships to the \nAlabama State Bar Association, the First Judicial Circuit Bar \nAssociation, and the Alabama Trial Lawyers Association.\n  Most people in west Alabama know William for his many contributions \nto the Democratic Party in west Alabama. For 20 years, William served \nas chairman of the Choctaw County Democratic Executive Committee.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to my good \nfriend Colonel Lewis Minor Stewart, U.S. Army, Retired. Lewis passed \naway on July 18, 2009. He was a personal friend and, along with his \nfamily, I mourn his passing.\n  Lewis was born on June 13, 1918, and raised in Marion, AL. He \ngraduated from the Marion Military Institute and attended the \nUniversity of Alabama School of Law. In 1941, Lewis joined the Army. He \nwas a proud solider whose tours during World War II included fighting \nwith the 261st Infantry, 65th Division, landing in LeHarve, France, and \nending the war in Austria. Lewis went on to serve as regimental staff \nofficer and then the commander of 24th Squadron, 4th Constabulary \nRegiment in Lenz, Austria, during the tensions of the Berlin airlift. \nHe also served 16 months in Korea during the early occupation.\n  He was awarded several prestigious honors including the Legion of \nMerit, Bronze Star with Oak Leaf Cluster, Combat Infantry Badge, Expert \nInfantry Badge, Army Commendation Medal, Army of Occupation Medal, \nWorld War II Medal, American Campaign Ribbon, National Defense Medal \nwith Oak Leaf Cluster, Korean Service Medal, Korean Conflict Ribbon, \nand the\n\n[[Page S8034]]\n\nMiddle Eastern Campaign Ribbon. Lewis was also selected for the \nInfantry OCS Hall of Fame for obtaining field grade rank starting from \nthe rank of private.\n  After a distinguished military career, in 1972 Lewis retired at the \nrank of colonel from the Army. Following his retirement, Lewis returned \nto Marion and remained very active in the community. He served as \nadministrator for the local Public Housing Authority, formed Stewart \nReal Estate, rehabilitated two historic homes and a Marion commercial \nbuilding, served as director of special services for the district \nattorney, 4th Judicial Circuit, AL. He was also deeply involved in the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the Perry County \nHistorical Society, and the Lions Club. As an active member of St. \nWilfred's Episcopal Church, Lewis served as senior warden of the Vestry \nand led the revival of the church's historic cemetery.\n  Lewis is loved and will be missed by his two sons Lewis Minor \nStewart, Jr. and SG Matthew Rebel Stewart, U.S. Army, Retired, as well \nas his four grandchildren, three great-grandchildren, and two sisters. \nLewis was an inspiration to many and will be remembered as an \noutstanding husband, father, soldier, churchman, community contributor, \nfriend, and leader.\n  I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the \nlife of my great friend, Lewis Minor Stewart.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8034-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING KATIE'S CAFE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, tourism represents Maine's largest \neconomic sector, and as a result, many of my State's nearly 150,000 \nsmall businesses are seasonal. But this year, between the deepest \neconomic recession our country has faced since the Great Depression and \na streak of unfortunate weather throughout Maine, these boutiques, \nshops, and restaurants are in many cases not experiencing the level of \nbusiness they would traditionally. Despite these disparaging factors, \none small restaurant in the town of Ogunquit, Katie's Cafe on Shore \nRoad, recently undertook a significant and bold expansion to attract \nnew customers.\n  While Katie's Cafe on Shore Road is a new restaurant on the scene, \nhaving opened just last year, it has already taken noteworthy steps \ntowards establishing itself as a preeminent member and integral part of \nthe local community. Katie's is owned by Rich Yurko; Donna Andersen; \nRob Leary; and Katie Yurko, Rich and Donna's mother for whom the \nrestaurant is named. An Alberta, Canada, native, Katie and her husband \nMike, along with their six children, are known for their abundant \nenergy and hospitality. The Yurko family's first foray into the \nhospitality business occurred in 1999, when they purchased Breakfast on \nthe Connecticut, a luxurious bed and breakfast in Lyme, NH.\n  Although a new establishment, Katie's boasts a knowledgeable staff \nwith years of experience in the restaurant industry. The cafe is run by \nDavid Carme, who brings with him a plethora of experience from some of \nBoston's finest restaurants, including Teatro, an upscale Italian \nrestaurant in Boston's theatre district, and Mistral, a trendy French \nMediterranean establishment in the city's south end. Katie's also added \nexecutive chef Jason Grant to the team in May. An experienced cook, \nGrant brings 20 years of culinary experience to this new position.\n  Following a successful first year of operation last year, Katie's \nCafe used the winter to expand its facilities, adding 40 new seats \nincluding a new porch seating area. Additionally, Katie's increased its \nkitchen space as well as the size of its lounge. With this recent \nexpansion, Katie's Cafe serves as the perfect meeting place where \ncustomers are assured that they will receive a five star dining \nexperience in a welcoming, relaxed social environment. With its \nexpanded capacity, Katie's provides a unique locale for special events \nsuch as birthdays, weddings, receptions, and family holiday gatherings. \nAdditionally, the cafe hosts ``Lounge Socials'' every Saturday and \nSunday, complete with complementary appetizers and drink specials.\n  In its short time on Shore Road, Katie's has already taken the \ninitiative to join with other area businesses in making several \ncommunity events successful. In particular, the restaurant helped \nsponsor last December's Christmas by the Sea festivities, and took part \nin the town's Cinco de Mayo weekend this past May. These annual \ncelebrations are a true example of community spirit, and they draw new \nfaces from across the region to explore Ogunquit and the surrounding \ntowns of York County.\n  A noteworthy seasonal small business that has quickly made a name for \nitself, Katie's Cafe has taken several concrete steps to ensure that it \nhas a bright future beyond these tumultuous times. I congratulate \neveryone at Katie's Cafe for their vision and creativity, and wish them \nmany more successful seasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8034-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8034-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8034-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:29 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1511.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress, the Governor of \n     Louisiana, the Department of Economic Development, the \n     Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Public \n     Service Commission, to assist in putting wood to electricity \n     projects on a commensurate funding and taxation level with \n     wind and solar generated electricity; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 49\n\n       Whereas, the major focus of the Wood Products Development \n     Foundation is the expansion or development of new uses of \n     wood and wood waste products that result in a positive impact \n     on the economic conditions of the state; and\n       Whereas, the timber industry has experienced a serious \n     decline in recent years, and this downturn will continue \n     unless new use sources are developed in the immediate future; \n     and\n       Whereas, after studying numerous potential industries, the \n     foundation determined a project that used wood and wood waste \n     products to create electricity would be the most economically \n     viable expansion of raw wood products for the long term; and\n       Whereas, the use and need for electricity will continue to \n     increase, and these projects will provide a renewable, green \n     source of electric power that does not affect the nation's \n     food supply or demand for food-based agricultural products \n     and materials for an indefinite period; and\n       Whereas, these wood to electricity projects provide an \n     additional market for raw wood products even in a distressed \n     market, provide an additional source of electricity at a \n     market rate that is carbon neutral, and provide a dedicated \n     electrical source available locally to supply viable defense \n     structures and critical facilities in times of natural \n     disasters; and\n       Whereas, the foundation has completed plans for two \n     centrally located plants within the state that will use wood \n     waste products from wood producers in the vicinity; and\n       Whereas, the electrical production will be made equally \n     available to wood-related industries and a grid for the \n     benefit of low-income households within reasonable vicinity \n     of the plant sites; and\n       Whereas, the two proposed projects will inject sixty \n     million dollars into the economy in terms of construction and \n     start-up costs and will create a minimum of thirty permanent \n     full-time jobs at the plant sites and approximately one \n     hundred jobs for suppliers of the wood fuel feedstock; and\n       Whereas, in the last several months, significant regional \n     job losses in the wood industry make this effort even more \n     vital to securing new alternatives for value-added market \n     activity related to the wood resources of the state; and\n       Whereas, there is a current need for additional funding to \n     complete the necessary regulatory, environmental, \n     engineering, and administrative functions to fulfill the \n     requirements for construction loan approvals: Therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     urge and request the Louisiana congressional delegation, the \n     governor, the Department of Economic Development, the \n     Department of Agriculture and Forestry, and the Public \n     Service Commission to assist in providing funding for any \n     necessary additional requirements, documentation, or studies \n     that may be needed to secure long-term funding, and to assist \n     in developing state and federal policies for wood to \n     electricity projects that put them on a commensurate funding \n     and taxation level with wind and solar generated electricity: \n     Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the Louisiana congressional delegation, the governor, the \n     Department of Economic Development, the Department of \n     Agriculture and Forestry, and the Public Service Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-60. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana expressing continued support for the \n     Coastal Restoration and Enhancement Through Science and \n     Technology Program for its role in providing new research and \n     scientific information for coastal restoration; to the \n     Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 20\n\n       Whereas, the Legislature of Louisiana expressed its support \n     for the CREST Program in Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 21 \n     of the 2008 First Extraordinary Session of the Legislature; \n     and\n       Whereas, the CREST Program and its member educational \n     institutions in Louisiana and Mississippi are continuing to \n     work to provide applied research in innovative and practical \n     technologies to meet the urgent need for coastal restoration \n     and protection and to support a new generation of restoration \n     scientists drawn from students working in science and \n     engineering; and\n       Whereas, one of CREST's aims is to help policymakers, \n     planners and coastal resource managers use the latest science \n     and best technologies to ensure sustainable and productive \n     coastal habitats and communities; and\n       Whereas, the CREST Program has been funded on an annual \n     ``add-on'' basis in the federal budget and is therefore \n     highly vulnerable to loss of its funding, a situation which \n     would be improved by having the program become a regular part \n     of the budget for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration; and\n       Whereas, research funded by CREST has helped to improve \n     barrier island restoration, marsh terracing, and re-\n     vegetation techniques, to develop water and sediment budget \n     needed for sustaining the Chenier Plain, and to understand \n     the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the marsh areas below the \n     Caernarvon Freshwater Diversion structure: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana does hereby \n     express continued support for the Coastal Restoration and \n     Enhancement Through Science and Technology Program for its \n     role in providing new research and scientific information for \n     coastal restoration and protection: Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the president of the United States, the administrator of the \n     National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the director \n     of Coastal Restoration and Enhancement Through Science and \n     Technology Program, and to each member of the Louisiana \n     delegation to the United States Congress.\n       POM-61. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Senate of \n     the State of Louisiana urging Congress to enact legislation \n     to adjust the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rules to \n     ameliorate the unintended negative impact caused by the \n     infusion of disaster relief funding, both in public and \n     private, into Louisiana's and other state's economies \n     following major disasters; to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                  Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 137\n\n       Whereas, in 2005 and 2008, Louisiana was struck by \n     hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Gustav, and Ike, collectively \n     requiring billions of dollars of federal and private \n     assistance to the state; and\n       Whereas, the people of Louisiana are grateful for the \n     support of the American people and of the United States \n     Congress as the state is recovering from these catastrophic \n     events; and\n       Whereas, coastal states, such as Florida, Mississippi and \n     Texas, and other states, such as Iowa, have recently \n     experienced significant disasters related to either \n     hurricanes or flooding, and coastal states can reasonably \n     expect to experience similar calamities in the future; and\n       Whereas, after a disaster resulting in massive and wide \n     spread damage to public and private property, economic \n     activity may temporarily significantly increase as the state \n     and local communities endeavor to rebuild; and\n       Whereas, due to the increased economic activity resulting \n     from hurricanes Katrina and Rita, Louisiana's per capita \n     personal income saw an unusual and extraordinary increase of \n     forty-two percent from 2005 through 2007; and\n       Whereas, the per capita personal income for Louisiana grew \n     by six point eight percent from 2000 through 2005; and\n       Whereas, the bureau of economic analysis of the U.S. \n     Department of Commerce stated in its 2007 report entitled \n     State Personal Income, that ``Louisiana grew ten point five \n     percent in 2007, down from twenty point six percent in \n     2006,'' and that ``these growth rates are substantially \n     higher than any other state''; and\n       Whereas, the bureau further reported that, ``the rental \n     income component of Louisiana personal income was boosted by \n     five point four billion dollars of Road Home subsidies from \n     the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development,'' and \n     that much of the per capita personal income gain in Louisiana \n     ``is accounted for by the Road Home subsidies which average \n     nearly twelve hundred fifty dollars per Louisiana resident''; \n     and\n       Whereas, evidence shows that even though the per capita \n     personal income had grown by forty-two percent from 2005 \n     through 2007, median income has remained stable which \n     indicates that real personal income has not grown in a \n     sustained way; and\n       Whereas, the bureau of economic analysis captures not only \n     the economic activity generated by the receipt of government \n     disaster relief payments but receipt of insurance payments \n     that would not have occurred but for the hurricanes--activity \n     which, when included in the overall calculations of per \n     capita personal income are extremely difficult to \n     disaggregate for attribution to specific causes as the \n     spending percolates throughout the economy; and\n       Whereas, the increased economic activity in Louisiana in \n     2006 and 2007 is clearly a direct result of the rebuilding \n     that occurred in the aftermath of hurricanes Katrina and Rita \n     and this economic activity led to a corresponding increase in \n     per capita personal income in Louisiana in 2006 and 2007; and\n       Whereas, accurate considerations of per capita personal \n     income are important because federal law establishes the \n     formula by which the FMAP for each state is determined based \n     on a comparison of each states per capita personal income to \n     the per capita income personal income of the United States as \n     calculated by the bureau of economic analysis; and\n       Whereas, when a state's per capita personal income \n     increases relative to the average of the United States, the \n     state's FMAP decreases; and\n       Whereas, according to the federal formula, the increase in \n     per capita personal income in Louisiana in 2006 and 2007 will \n     have the unintended consequence of reducing Louisiana's FMAP \n     for federal fiscal years 2010 and 2011; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's FMAP will decrease to 67.61% in \n     federal fiscal year 2010 and to\n\n[[Page S8037]]\n\n     63.16% in federal fiscal year 2011, a total decrease of 6.53% \n     over two years, the largest decline of any state; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's FMAP is temporarily enhanced to eighty \n     percent as a result of the enactment of the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA), but that enhanced FMAP \n     will terminate on December 31, 2010; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's FMAP will drop precipitously from \n     eighty percent to sixty-three point sixteen percent on \n     January 1, 2011, and this loss in federal match will \n     annualize to approximately one billion dollars; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana has demonstrated a significant \n     commitment to its programs for providing health care access \n     to the poor by investing in substantial sums of state general \n     fund dollars through Medicaid, SCHIP and a statewide system \n     of public hospitals, all of which to combine to provide a \n     safety net for a state with low income and significant \n     provider access problems, and such a drastic reduction in \n     Louisiana's FMAP will have devastating impact on the state's \n     infrastructure for caring for the poor; and\n       Whereas, the presumed purpose for using the per capita \n     personal income as a basis for the calculation of FMAP is to \n     ensure resources are directed to states which are more likely \n     to have low-income populations, and thus, a more significant \n     burden on the Medicaid program; and\n       Whereas, Louisiana's Medicaid program has not seen a \n     decrease in enrollment after hurricanes Katrina and Rita, but \n     rather an increase, and thus, from an economic perspective, \n     it is clear the purpose for utilizing per capita personal \n     income as the primary driver of the state's FMAP cannot be \n     accurately and fairly applied to Louisiana during the period \n     following the temporary increase in economic activity; and\n       Whereas, the Louisiana Legislature does not accept that it \n     is the intention of the United States Department of Health \n     and Human Services or the United States Congress, through an \n     artifact of the FMAP formula, to financially penalize \n     Louisiana and other states working to rebuild their \n     communities after major disasters: Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the Congress of the United States to enact legislation to \n     adjust the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage rules to \n     ameliorate the unintended negative impact caused by the \n     infusion of disaster relief funding, both public and private, \n     into Louisiana's and other state's economies following major \n     disasters; Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution shall be \n     transmitted to the secretary of the United States Senate and \n     the clerk of the United States House of Representatives and \n     to each member of the Louisiana delegation to the United \n     States Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-62.

STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. REID (for Ms. Mikulski (for herself, Mr. Cardin, and Mrs. \n        Murray)):\n  S. 1506. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Transportation to \nestablish national safety standards for transit agencies operating \nheavy rail on fixed guideway; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I introduce common sense \nlegislation requiring the Secretary of the U.S. Department of \nTransportation to implement and enforce national safety standards for \nmetro systems. Commuter rail systems like Maryland's MARC and the \nVirginia Railroad Express have Federal safety standards. Our metro \nsystems must have them too. It is time for Congress to give the U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation this authority to keep commuters and train \noperators safe.\n  Last month the nation's hearts and prayers went out to the families \nof the nine passengers killed including one Marylander and 52 injured \nin the tragic\n\n[[Page S8042]]\n\ncrash involving two Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, \nWMATA, Metrorail trains. Shortly after this horrible accident, the \nMembers of the Maryland and Virginia Congressional delegations and \nCongresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton met with the National \nTransportation Safety Board, NTSB, to be briefed on their ongoing \ninvestigation into this crash. This is when I learned the NTSB had \nrecommended that the Federal Transit Administration, FTA, establish \nFederal standards for metro systems but the FTA had not taken action. \nApparently, the FTA doesn't think it has this authority. Well, my bill \nfixes that. It gives the FTA the green light to move forward with \nFederal safety standards.\n  My bill directs the Secretary of Transportation to work with the NTSB \nto establish these new Federal standards. The bill also requires the \nSecretary to implement the NTSB's prior recommendations. These include \nsafety standards relating to crashworthiness, emergency evacuation and \nevent recorders of rail transit cars and hours of service for transit \noperators.\n  The NTSB is still investigating the cause of last month's crash here \nin our nation's capital. It will take about one year to complete. \nExisting evidence points to malfunctions with WMATA's train control \nsystem. Federal safety standards may not have prevented these \nmalfunctions, but they may have been able to save lives had FTA \nimplemented and enforced crashworthiness and emergency evacuation \nstandards for transit rail cars. We also would know a lot more about \nthe cause of the crash had FTA required event recorders on transit rail \ncars, as required on airplanes. These are all recommendations the NTSB \nhas made that have not been addressed by the FTA.\n  More than 7 million people board rail transit cars every weekday in \nthe U.S. Our metro systems must be safe.

A bill to fund comprehensive programs to ensure an adequate \nsupply of nurses; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. This is a critical time in America. For the first time in \nmany decades, we have a real opportunity to reform our healthcare \nsystem and improve how care is delivered in our country and the ability \nfor Americans to access such quality care.\n  The delivery of quality care in our country is as great as it is \nbecause of the more than 2.9 million nurses in our country. Americans \ndepend on nurses to deliver quality patient care, yet our nation faces \na critical shortage of nurses. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics \nprojects that more than 1.2 million new and replacement nurses will be \nneeded by 2014 to keep up with the aging Baby Boomer population and the \nincreased demand for health care.\n  As we work toward reform of health insurance, we need to prioritize \nincreasing the number of nurses entering the workforce. We can do that \nby building on the current healthcare workforce. That allows us to work \nwith people who are familiar with the work environment in the health \nfield, require less time in orientation than new workers, and represent \na diverse population more representative of the patients being served.\n  Today, I am pleased to introduce the Nurse Training and Retention Act \nto assist states and localities in creating career ladders for current \nhealthcare workers who are ready to upgrade their skills. Many people \nin the healthcare workforce are in entry level jobs that don't always \noffer opportunities for advancement. For much of this population, \nadvanced education is unaffordable and unattainable. The legislation I \nam proposing offers incumbent healthcare workers realistic options to \nenhance their skills, advance their careers, and meet the growing \ndemand for nurses.\n  The legislation authorizes the Department of Labor to award grants to \nsupport training programs for healthcare workers. Health aides can use \nthese programs to earn a certificate or degree in nursing. Nurses can \nupgrade their skills and qualifications so that they can serve as nurse \nfaculty, which would help relieve the backlog of qualified applicants \nwho aren't in nursing school because of the lack of faculty.\n  Programs administered by joint labor/management training partnerships \nhave made great progress educating and retaining nurses. The proposed \ngrant program builds on the good work these partnerships have done and \nencourages further collaboration with colleges and universities. The \ncombination of support in the workplace and collaboration with nursing \nschools to meet the needs of the non-traditional student means these \nstudents are performing very well in nursing school. These new nurses \nhave higher retention rates than other, more traditional students who \ndo not have work experience in the field. Another benefit of the career \nladder is that these collaborations are building a more diverse nursing \nworkforce.\n  Another important player in this process is the employer. That's why \nmy bill asks employers of incumbent healthcare workers to invest in the \ntraining programs. This completes the partnership, so that labor, \nemployer, and the participating school are all working together to \nretain and grow the healthcare workforce we have today.\n  Nurses play an invaluable role in patient care in this country. By \nsupporting our current healthcare workforce and offering these \nindividuals a chance to move up in the field, the Nurse Training and \nRetention Act can help us tap an overlooked resource. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n[[Page S8043]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1512\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse Training and Retention \n     Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) America's healthcare system depends on an adequate \n     supply of trained nurses to deliver quality patient care.\n       (2) Over the next 15 years, this shortage is expected to \n     grow significantly. The Health Resources and Services \n     Administration has projected that by 2020, there will be a \n     shortage of nurses in every State and that overall only 64 \n     percent of the demand for nurses will be satisfied, with a \n     shortage of 1,016,900 nurses nationally.\n       (3) To avert such a shortage, today's network of healthcare \n     workers should have access to education and support from \n     their employers to participate in educational and training \n     opportunities.\n       (4) With the appropriate education and support, incumbent \n     healthcare workers and incumbent bedside nurses are untapped \n     sources which can meet these needs and address the nursing \n     shortage and provide quality care as the American population \n     ages.\n\n     SEC. 3. ESTABLISHMENT OF GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Purposes.--It is the purpose of this section to \n     authorize grants to--\n       (1) address the projected shortage of nurses by funding \n     comprehensive programs to create a career ladder to nursing \n     (including Certified Nurse Assistants, Licensed Practical \n     Nurses, Licensed Vocational Nurses, and Registered Nurses) \n     for incumbent ancillary healthcare workers;\n       (2) increase the capacity for educating nurses by \n     increasing both nurse faculty and clinical opportunities \n     through collaborative programs between staff nurse \n     organizations, healthcare providers, and accredited schools \n     of nursing; and\n       (3) provide training programs through education and \n     training organizations jointly administered by healthcare \n     providers and healthcare labor organizations or other \n     organizations representing staff nurses and frontline \n     healthcare workers, working in collaboration with accredited \n     schools of nursing and academic institutions.\n       (b) Grants.--Not later than 6 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor (referred to in \n     this section as the ``Secretary'') shall establish a \n     partnership grant program to award grants to eligible \n     entities to carry out comprehensive programs to provide \n     education to nurses and create a pipeline to nursing for \n     incumbent ancillary healthcare workers who wish to advance \n     their careers, and to otherwise carry out the purposes of \n     this section.\n       (c) Eligible Entities.--To be eligible to receive a grant \n     under this section an entity shall--\n       (1) be--\n       (A) a healthcare entity that is jointly administered by a \n     healthcare employer and a labor union representing the \n     healthcare employees of the employer and that carries out \n     activities using labor management training funds as provided \n     for under section 302 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, \n     1947 (18 U.S.C. 186(c)(6));\n       (B) an entity that operates a training program that is \n     jointly administered by--\n       (i) one or more healthcare providers or facilities, or a \n     trade association of healthcare providers; and\n       (ii) one or more organizations which represent the \n     interests of direct care healthcare workers or staff nurses \n     and in which the direct care healthcare workers or staff \n     nurses have direct input as to the leadership of the \n     organization; or\n       (C) a State training partnership program that consists of \n     non-profit organizations that include equal participation \n     from industry, including public or private employers, and \n     labor organizations including joint labor-management training \n     programs, and which may include representatives from local \n     governments, worker investment agency one-stop career \n     centers, community based organizations, community colleges, \n     and accredited schools of nursing; and\n       (2) submit to the Secretary an application at such time, in \n     such manner, and containing such information as the Secretary \n     may require.\n       (d) Additional Requirements for Healthcare Employer \n     Described in Subsection (c).--To be eligible for a grant \n     under this section, a healthcare employer described in \n     subsection (c) shall demonstrate--\n       (1) an established program within their facility to \n     encourage the retention of existing nurses;\n       (2) it provides wages and benefits to its nurses that are \n     competitive for its market or that have been collectively \n     bargained with a labor organization;

Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nrecognizing Lieutenant Commander Chris Cassidy, space shuttle mission \nspecialist of the STS-127 space shuttle mission and the Expedition 19 \nInternational Space Station mission, for becoming the 500th person to \nfly into space.\n  While Lieutenant Commander Chris Cassidy is a native of Salem, \nMassachusetts, he considers York, ME, his hometown, where he attended \nYork High School. Chris has a very impressive academic background \nearning a bachelor of science in Mathematics from the U.S. Naval \nAcademy, and a Master of Science in Ocean Engineering from the \nMassachusetts Institute of Technology.\n  Even more impressive is his ongoing service to his country. Chris \nspent 10 years as a U.S. Navy SEAL, which includes two tours in \nAfghanistan. During that time, he received numerous awards including \nthe Bronze Star with the combat `V' and the Presidential Unit Citation \nfor leading a 9-day operation at the Zharwar Kili cave complex. This \noperation was a national priority objective directly on the Afghan/\nPakistan border. Lieutenant Commander Cassidy received a second Bronze \nStar for combat leadership service in Afghanistan in 2004. Chris was \nalso a Quest speaker at the U.S. Naval Academy's 2003 and 2004 Combat \nLeadership Seminars.\n  Upon returning from his service, Chris was selected by the National \nAeronautics and Space Administration to begin astronaut training in \n2004 at NASA's Johnson Space Center in Houston.\n  The space shuttle STS-127 mission is Lieutenant Commander Cassidy's \nfirst time in space. As this Nation celebrates the 40th anniversary of \nthe Apollo 11 mission and the first man on the moon, Chris Cassidy \nbecomes the 500th person to travel to space on the Space Shuttle \nEndeavor. The STS-127 mission's primary goal is to deliver the final \ncomponents of the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency's Kibo laboratory \nto the International Space Station, which will be essential to allowing \nastronauts to perform valuable science experiments that are exposed to \nthe vacuum of space. In order to install those components, five space \nwalks are scheduled for the 16-day mission and Chris is expected to \nperform three of them.\n  This resolution recognizes Space Shuttle Mission Specialist Navy \nLieutenant Commander Chris Cassidy of STS-127 space shuttle mission and \nthe Expedition 19 International Space Station mission and for becoming \nthe 500th person in history to fly into space; and also commends him \nand the rest of the STS-127 Mission crew for risking their lives in the \nadvance of science and human understanding. I hope my colleagues will \njoin Senator Collins and me in supporting this resolution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8044-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8044-S8045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 1767.

REPORT ON FEASIBILITY AND DESIRABILITY OF \n                   ESTABLISHING GENERAL UNIFORM PROCEDURES AND \n                   GUIDELINES FOR THE PROVISION OF MONETARY \n                   ASSISTANCE BY THE UNITED STATES TO CIVILIAN \n                   FOREIGN NATIONALS FOR LOSSES INCIDENT TO COMBAT \n                   ACTIVITIES OF THE ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Report.--The Secretary of Defense shall submit to \n     Congress a report on the feasibility and the desirability of \n     establishing general uniform procedures and guidelines for \n     the provision by the United States of monetary assistance to \n     civilian foreign nationals for losses, injuries, or death \n     (hereafter ``harm'') incident to combat activities of the \n     United States Armed Forces during contingency operations.\n       (b) Matters To Be Included in Report.--The Secretary shall \n     include in the report the following:\n       (1) A description of the authorities under laws in effect \n     as of the date of the enactment\n\n[[Page S8060]]\n\n     of this Act for the United States to provide compensation, \n     monetary payments, or other assistance to civilians who incur \n     harm due directly or indirectly to the combat activities of \n     the United States Armed Forces.\n       (2) A description of the practices in effect as of the date \n     of enactment of this Act for the United States to provide ex \n     gratia, solatia, or other types of condolence payments to \n     civilians who incur harm due directly or indirectly to the \n     combat activities of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (3) A discussion of the historic practice of the United \n     States to provide compensation, other monetary payments, or \n     other assistance to civilian foreign nationals who incur harm \n     due directly or indirectly to combat activities of the United \n     States Armed Forces.\n       (4) A discussion of the practice of the United States in \n     Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom to \n     provide compensation, other monetary payments, or other \n     assistance to civilian foreign nationals who incur harm due \n     directly or indirectly to the combat activities of the United \n     States Armed Forces, including the procedures and guidelines \n     used and an assessment of its effectiveness. This discussion \n     will also include estimates of the total amount of funds \n     disbursed to civilian foreign nationals who have incurred \n     harm since the inception of Operation Iraqi Freedom and \n     Operation Enduring Freedom. This discussion will also include \n     how such procedures and guidelines compare to the processing \n     of claims filed under the Foreign Claims Act.\n       (5) A discussion of the positive and negative effects of \n     using different authorities, procedure, and guidelines to \n     provide monetary assistance to civilian foreign nationals, \n     based upon the culture and economic circumstances of the \n     local populace and the operational impact on the military \n     mission. This discussion will also include whether the use of \n     different authorities, procedures, and guidelines has \n     resulted in disparate monetary assistance to civilian foreign \n     nationals who have incurred substantially similar harm, and \n     if so, the frequency and effect of such results.\n       (6) A discussion of the positive and negative effects of \n     establishing general uniform procedures and guidelines for \n     the provision of such assistance, based upon the goals of \n     timely commencement of a program of monetary assistance, \n     efficient and effective implementation of such program, and \n     consistency in the amount of assistance in relation to the \n     harm incurred. This discussion will also include whether the \n     implementation of general procedures and guidelines would \n     create a legally enforceable entitlement to ``compensation'' \n     and, if so, any potential significant operational impact \n     arising from such an entitlement.\n       (7) Assuming general uniform procedures and guidelines were \n     to be established, a discussion of the following:\n       (A) Whether such assistance should be limited to specified \n     types of combat activities or operations, e.g., such as \n     during counterinsurgency operations.\n       (B) Whether such assistance should be contingent upon a \n     formal determination that a particular combat activity/\n     operation is a qualifying activity, and the criteria, if any, \n     for such a determination.\n       (C) Whether a time limit from the date of loss for \n     providing such assistance should be prescribed.\n       (D) Whether only monetary or other types of assistance \n     should be authorized, and what types of nonmonetary \n     assistance, if any, should be authorized.\n       (E) Whether monetary value limits should be placed on the \n     assistance that may be provided, or whether the determination \n     to provide assistance and, if so, the monetary value of such \n     assistance, should be based, in whole or in part, on a legal \n     advisor's assessment of the facts.\n       (G) Whether a written record of the determination to \n     provide or to not provide such assistance should be \n     maintained and a copy made available to the civilian foreign \n     national.\n       (H) Whether in the event of a determination to not provide \n     such assistance the civilian foreign national should be \n     afforded the option of a review of the determination by a \n     higher ranking authority.\n       (c) Recommendations.--The Secretary shall include in the \n     report such recommendations as the Secretary considers \n     appropriate for legislative or administrative action with \n     respect to the matters discussed in the report.\n       (d) Submission of Report.--The report shall be submitted \n     not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act. The report shall be submitted in unclassified form, \n     but may include a classified annex.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/23/senate-section/article/S8060-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AUTHORITY FOR COMMITTEES TO MEET\n\n\n            committee on banking, housing, and urban affairs\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge passage of \nH.J. Res. 56, the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act, which is now on \nits way to the President's desk for his signature.\n  As in years past, this resolution will extend import sanctions for \nanother year against Burmese goods in order to maintain economic \npressure on the ruling State Peace and Development\n\n[[Page S8061]]\n\nCouncil--SPDC. It also continues the Tom Lantos Block Burmese JADE Act, \nwhich was enacted last year and further increased sanctions against the \njunta.\n  In some circles the value of sanctions has been questioned and, at \nsome point, greater engagement with the regime may be in order. \nHowever, by passing this measure, Congress has clearly concluded that \nsuch a change in policy would be premature, and for good reason. The \nvery fact that Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has been put \non trial by the regime for trumped-up charges reflects how essential it \nis to continue these measures against the SPDC. To do otherwise would \nimplicitly condone the junta's actions in trying her. It also would \nturn a blind eye to the regime having imprisoned Suu Kyi for 13 of the \npast 20 years, to say nothing of the scores of less well-known \npolitical prisoners who currently languish in Burmese prisons.\n  UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon's recent trip to Burma, I think, \ndemonstrates yet again the true nature of this regime. During his \nvisit, he was denied access to Suu Kyi and apparently received no \nconcessions from the junta. This reflects that it is the SPDC that does \nnot want to engage meaningfully with the international community, not \nthe other way around. Therefore, my colleagues and I believe that \nsanctions against the junta should remain in place until such time as \nthe regime truly commits itself to a course of democratization and \nreconciliation.\n  Nor should anyone be fooled by the junta's transparent efforts to \nlegitimize its rule through the scheduled 2010 elections. By excluding \nSuu Kyi from participating in the elections and by including provisions \nthat would permanently entrench military rule, the new Burmese charter \nis no more legitimate than the regime that sponsored it. More than \nhalfway through 2009, it is hard to see how next year's elections in \nBurma are redeemable.\n  Congress's posture toward the Burmese regime is not just borne out of \nhumanitarian concerns; it also involves important national security \nconsiderations. Just this week, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton \npublicly raised questions about alleged military links between the \njunta and North Korea. The details of the Burmese-North Korean \nrelationship are murky but, according to the Washington Post, concern \nhas been raised among U.S. officials about a possible budding nuclear \nrelationship between the two autocracies.\n  Finally, I note that this resolution has brought together 66 Members \nof this Chamber as cosponsors, more cosponsors than any previous year. \nThis showing reflects yet again the genuine bipartisan support for the \npeople of Burma and opposition to the junta's rule. In this effort, I \nwas pleased to work closely again with my friend Senator Dianne \nFeinstein, who has long been a vigorous advocate for the Burmese \npeople. Senators McCain and Durbin have also been stalwarts in their \nsupport for freedom in Burma, and they once again were at the vanguard \nof this legislative undertaking. I would close by thanking Brandi White \nand Ally Bird of my staff for their hard work on this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the joint resolution be read \na third time and passed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, and that any statements relating thereto be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J. Res. 56) was ordered to a third reading, \nwas read the third time, and passed.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In fact, there were 19 amendments on this list as it now \nappears, including that modified Sessions amendment. So I wanted to \nclarify the Record on that point. There are 19 amendments on that list, \nNo. 19 being one that we, frankly, thought we previously approved but \napparently had not. So it is intended that it is on that list, and we \nare assured by the staff that this is the way we can correct that \nproblem.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so note.\n  Mr. LEVIN.
