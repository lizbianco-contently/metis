Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the health care reform legislation. The first 3 \nhours will be for debate only. That time will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees and controlled in \n45-minute alternating blocks of time. The majority will control the \nfirst block. We anticipate reaching an agreement to have a series of \nvotes beginning at 2:30 this afternoon. Senators will be notified as \nsoon as possible with regard to when the votes will actually occur.\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, yesterday, Friday, 14,000 people lost their \nhealth insurance in America. Today, Saturday, another 14,000 people \nwill lose their health insurance, and Sunday and Monday and Tuesday and \non and on. Every day, 14,000 people lose their health insurance in \nAmerica. The American people don't get weekends off from this \ninjustice. Bankruptcy doesn't keep bankers' hours. They do not go away \njust because it is Sunday or Saturday. The pain is still there. So our \nwork continues this weekend. It will continue until we give this \nNation's citizens a health insurance system that works for them.\n  Tens of millions of Americans, those with coverage and those without \ncoverage, know all too well right now that the system is broken. They \ndo not need academic studies or congressional investigations or \npoliticians' speeches to tell them health care is in critical \ncondition. Every day they live with it, and every day some even die \nwith it or because of it.\n  Next year is just around the corner. It is just weeks away. In the \nnew year, a whole lot more Americans are about to learn just how broken \nour system is. You see, last year one of America's largest private \ninsurance companies made about $1 billion. In fact, it was more than $1 \nbillion. Its chairman and chief executive officer took home $100 \nmillion himself. But this health care company isn't going to make \nenough this year, by their estimation. The healthy profit of this \nhealth insurance company, by their standards, is not healthy enough \nbecause its executives\n\n[[Page S12462]]\n\nhave decided that the profit they are making--and remember, more than \n$1 billion, with the boss taking home more than $100 million--isn't \nenough. So this multibillion-dollar company found a clever way to make \nmore money next year. How? Raising rates.\n  As one might expect with the insurance industry, being as callous as \nit is, those higher premiums are going to be too expensive for many. \nSome analysts say that as many as 650,000 people insured by this \ncompany will no longer be insured by the company. They will have to \nfind other insurance or go without. Now, 650,000 is more than the \nentire population of North Dakota, more than the population of Vermont, \nand more than the population of Wyoming. It is more than the entire \npopulations of Baltimore and Boston and Denver and Seattle. How many \npeople is this one company going to drop? You could count every man, \nwoman, and child in Las Vegas and still have 100,000 people left over. \nLas Vegas is as big as Boston, Baltimore, Denver, and Seattle. But here \nis the worst part: That shocking estimate comes directly from the \npresident of the company himself--the man who made more than $100 \nmillion last year. That means the company devised this strategy, \ncrunched the numbers, and saw how many American families it was going \nto hurt. Then the bosses shrugged their shoulders and decided to go \nahead anyway.\n  We would hardly stand idly by as a country if every citizen of one of \nour States was left out in the cold. And that is, in fact, what we have \nhere. We would never consider doing nothing if every resident of one of \nour biggest cities was, in fact, hung out to dry, but that is the \nequivalent of what just one company is doing--just one of the countless \nhealth insurance companies that care about nothing except profits.\n  Others may suggest the system is just fine the way it is. We on this \nside of the Senate do not believe that.\n  Why are they able to do this? Well, one reason they are able to do it \nis they are not subject to the antitrust laws. They can conspire to fix \nprices, as we have indicated, and there are no civil or criminal \npenalties.\n  Some may suggest the system is fine just the way it is. We don't \nbelieve that.\n  Just this summer, the junior Senator from South Carolina said what we \nneed to do is ``get out of the way and allow the market to work.'' \nWell, the market sure worked fine for this insurance company. It is \nworking fine right now. The problem is, it doesn't work for the \nAmerican people, only for the big shots of these insurance companies.\n  Just last week, my distinguished counterpart, the Republican leader, \nsaid the health care crisis is ``manufactured.'' Those were his words: \nThe health care crisis is ``manufactured.'' In one sense, he is right. \nIt has been manufactured by the greedy insurance companies, just like \nthe one I mentioned earlier, companies that claim to be in the business \nof helping people stay healthy when they are actually in the business \nof making as much money as they can. They raise families' rates on a \nwhim, deny coverage because someone has a preexisting condition or they \nare a woman or they are too old, with concern for nothing but their own \nexecutives' personal bank accounts.\n  The question before the Senate is, How many more of our own citizens \nwill we sentence to such a fate? How much longer will we look the other \nway while our neighbors suffer right in front of us? How much more are \nwe going to charge those fortunate enough to have insurance in order to \ncover the many who don't? Right now, every individual who has insurance \npays at least $1,000 a year more because of the uninsured going to \nemergency rooms all over the country. I ask my colleagues, How much \nlonger will we enable the insurance companies to deny health care to \nthe sick? How much longer will we let those companies force thousands \nupon thousands of Americans into bankruptcy while they rake millions of \ndollars of cash into their pockets? That is the reality.\n\n  Opponents of progress have tried to drown out this truth with \ndistortions, distractions, and dishonesty. But, as John Adams observed \na long time ago, facts are stubborn things.\n  Here is one of the most startling facts: Last year, 750,000 people \nfiled for bankruptcy. Seventy percent of those who filed for bankruptcy \ndid so because of medical expenses, and 62 percent of those who filed \nbecause of medical expenses had insurance. What a sad commentary. In \nthe year World War II ended, President Harry Truman warned that many of \nus were vulnerable to what he called ``the economic effects of \nsickness.'' In the 64 years since, it has only gotten worse.\n  Here are some facts--facts about what our legislation will do: The \nlegislation before this body will make sure every American--nearly \nevery American, at least 97\\1/2\\ percent--will be covered with \ninsurance. It will not only protect those seniors on Medicare, it will \nmake it stronger. It will make sure more than 30 million Americans who \ndon't have health insurance now will soon have it. It will not add a \ndime to our deficit. In fact, in the next 10 years it will reduce it by \n$130 billion and over the next 20 years by almost $\\3/4\\ trillion.\n  We are even making this bill stronger than when it was introduced, \nthis bill here. For example, because we have added Senator Mikulski's \namendment to the legislation, women can now get the mammograms, \ncheckups, and other preventive tests they need in order to stay \nhealthy, at no cost. We made it better by reaffirming our commitment to \nseniors who rely on Medicare and Medicare Advantage, guaranteeing they \nwill always get the care they need and the quality of life they \ndeserve. We made it better by ensuring that the money dedicated to the \nhealth care of America's seniors and people with disabilities should be \nused only for those precise payments. And today, we will continue to \nmake it better with an amendment by Senator Lincoln of Arkansas that \nstops irresponsible tax breaks for millionaire health insurance \nexecutives and starts to use companies' revenues to strengthen \nMedicare.\n  The fact is, our bill will, in short, save lives, save money, and \nsave Medicare. It will make it possible for each and every American to \nafford to live a healthy life. We can't afford not to do this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/05/senate-section/article/S12462-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12462]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I am glad we are \nhere\n\n[[Page S12463]]\n\nthis weekend. Oh, I know we like to be with our families, we have \nChristmas shopping to do and things such as that. It is always nice to \nbe with our families on the weekends. But think about it this way: \nMillions of Americans today are giving up their weekends, they are \ngiving up their nights, their holidays, because they are either out of \nwork, they are working part time, they are trying to do odd jobs to get \nenough money together to keep their families intact. So they are \nworking at nights, they are working on weekends. They are not taking \ntime off. They are out there looking for work now or out there doing \nodd jobs, whatever they can possibly do. They are making sacrifices. \nThey are making sacrifices for their families, but they are also making \nthese sacrifices to pay their medical bills or to afford their needed \nprescriptions. It seems to me we owe them nothing less than the same \nlevel of commitment to the task of bringing quality, affordable health \ncare within their reach.\n  Our leader, Senator Reid, was right to call the Senate into session \nthis weekend. We ought to keep at this bill, this health care reform \nbill, working hard, until the Senate finishes the job before us. \nNothing less will do.\n  I do not plan to spend a lot of time on the debate over Medicare \nAdvantage that we had yesterday. However, after listening to the \ncomments yesterday, I did want to mention briefly editorials that \nappeared in the Des Moines Register. The first was published 6 years \nago when the Senate considered the Republican Medicare drug \nlegislation. The major element of that bill was to give outrageous \nbonuses to private health plans in Medicare Advantage. In criticizing \nthat proposal, the Register called on Members of Congress ``to remind \nthemselves their job is to serve the interests of the people, not \nindustry lobbyists.''\n  Sadly, we didn't heed that call that time, 6 years ago. Instead, \nCongress, under Republican leadership at that time, enacted a bill that \nprovided a massive and unjustified windfall to the insurance industry.\n  The Register revisited the same subject in an editorial this year, \nMay 31 of this year. Here is what they said:\n\n       Congress encouraged private insurance plans, known as \n     Medicare Advantage plans, which have cost taxpayers more than \n     covering seniors in traditional government-administered \n     Medicare.\n       Congress should not repeat the mistakes it made in 2003 \n     when reforming Medicare--catering to special interests and \n     pushing people into private-sector insurance coverage.\n\n  Our health bill, the one we have before us, heeds these words. We \nstand up to the special interests that even today are demanding \nbillions of dollars in taxpayer funds to prop up their inflated \nprofits. So yesterday was a good day. Yesterday we said no to giving \nthe insurance industry a $120 billion bonus for doing the same job that \nMedicare can do for far less.\n\n  Today we will consider a proposal from Senator Lincoln to say no to \nthe outrageous salaries that top executives in these companies receive. \nChief executive officers at the seven leading insurance companies made \na combined $118.6 million in 2007 alone, an average of $11.9 million \neach. Let's compare that to the wages of millions of Americans or the \nminimum wage. For someone making the minimum wage, it would take nearly \n800 years to make what these insurance company executives make in 1 \nyear.\n  Again, here is the CEO compensation. For United Health Group, they \nmade $2.9 billion in profit in 2008 and they paid their CEO $9.4 \nmillion; WellPoint, $9.8 million; Aetna, $24.3 million; Humana, $47.3 \nmillion; Coventry Health Care, $11 million; Cigna, $4.4 million. That \nis the CEO compensation. That probably is not the whole package when \nyou consider all the other benefits they get, deferred compensation and \non and on--golden parachutes, all that kind of stuff. That is basically \ntheir CEO compensation for the year.\n  As you can see, they get paid pretty well and $11.9 million is the \naverage. Here is Aetna, $24 million a year. They had a profit of $1.3 \nbillion that year. So they did well, their shareholders did well, their \nCEO did well. But how about the consumers, the working families?\n  In 2003, by the way, Aetna, this company right here, making all this \nmoney, paying their CEO $24 million a year--in 2003 Aetna settled a \nlawsuit. You know, usually when you settle lawsuits it is because you \nthink you are going to get hit worse down the line. They settled a \nlawsuit brought by who? Brought by physicians, a whole group of \nphysicians brought a class action against Aetna because they had a \nhistory of shortchanging patient care. Aetna settled for $470 million, \njust to get away from it, in 2003.\n  There was not any money to help them afford the coverage patients \nneed, but they had billions for profits and they had millions for \nsalaries--nothing for working families.\n  The reality for working families across America is simply this: \nInsurance premiums have skyrocketed, outpacing the growth in wages over \nthe same period. Quality affordable health care is slipping further and \nfurther from the grasp of middle-class Americans. Between 1999 and \n2007, the average American worker saw wages increase 29 percent. \nInsurance premiums during that same time rose more than 120 percent. \nThey see the premiums skyrocketing, but their health care is slipping \naway.\n  There is something else. The profit margins of the insurance industry \nsoared. Over the last 7 years the profits of the seven largest publicly \ntraded health insurance companies increased by 428 percent. Profits \nincreased by 428 percent, from $2.4 billion to $12.9 billion. Yet look \nat what our workers' wages went up--29 percent.\n  Now you begin to understand why people in this country are upset and \ndiscouraged and outright mad about their lack of health insurance \ncoverage, about the affordability of that coverage and the quality of \nthat coverage. Yet with all of this money that is going to their CEOs \nand huge increases in the profits they make, our Republican friends on \nthe other side of the aisle say they still need a Federal handout. The \nindustry cannot find a dime to bring down prices for consumers but they \ncan find millions to lobby for more special favors.\n  The Wall Street Journal reported that the health care industry \nboosted their efforts in lobbying this year. In a quote from the Wall \nStreet Journal:\n\n       Overall, the health-care sector reported a five percent \n     increase in lobbying expenditures to $133 million, making it \n     the single largest spender on lobbying of the 10 major \n     industry sectors tracked by the Center for Responsive \n     Politics. Health-insurance companies increased lobbying \n     activity by 11 percent to $7.8 million, according to the \n     data.\n\n  An increase of 11 percent. You wonder why all this health sector this \nyear had $133 million in lobbying expenditures. I think, if I am not \nmistaken, the supposed, stated purpose of health insurance is to \nprotect Americans from the cost of illness. Supposedly their purpose is \nto keep the American people healthy and productive for the benefit of \nsociety. Yet over some 60 years, this industry, the health insurance \nindustry, has transformed itself from an industry that is there to help \nyou to an industry that is there to take money from you when you are \nhealthy and avoid paying your bills when you get sick. This is an \nindustry with armies of actuaries and functionaries whose job is to \nprevent you from enrolling if you have a preexisting condition. It is \nan industry that looks at the fine details of your medical records when \nyou get sick so they can figure out how to cancel your policy and leave \nyou high and dry when you need their help the most, as has been said \nmany times around here.\n  The majority, actually 62 percent of bankruptcies in America, is \nbecause of medical costs, and 80 percent of that group had health \ninsurance. They actually had health insurance, but they had to file for \nbankruptcy because--they didn't know it, but in their contract, in \ntheir policy, there was some fine print called a rescission clause, or \nthere is fine print in there on terms of their annual or lifetime caps, \nwhich most people do not even know are in their policies. But when they \ngot very sick, all of a sudden their policy got rescinded, which means \nwhen it came up for renewal the insurance company didn't renew it, and \nhere you are with an expensive chronic disease or illness such as \ncancer or heart disease or disability, and they cancel your policy. You \nare left with only one recourse--file for bankruptcy.\n\n  This is an industry which defines being a victim of domestic violence \nas a preexisting condition. I spoke about this previously. Only in \nAmerica, with this health insurance industry running\n\n[[Page S12464]]\n\neverything in terms of our health care coverage, only here would we \nhave a situation where a woman can be the victim of domestic violence, \nbe battered, get medical help, go to the hospital perhaps, a victim of \ndomestic abuse, and then later on find that she can't get her policy \nrenewed because she has a preexisting condition, the preexisting \ncondition of being the victim of domestic violence.\n  You may think that is outlandish, but it is true, and it happens. All \nwe are seeking is competition, openness, transparency, and fairness.\n  The insurance industry, what are they seeking? They are seeking to \npreserve and protect a sweet deal they have been enjoying on the backs \nof middle-class Americans and seniors. The proposal Senator Lincoln is \noffering says basically: Enough is enough. In defense of their \noutlandish salaries, the insurance company CEOs cite the difficulty of \ntheir jobs and the complexity of their tasks. The President of the \nUnited States probably has a pretty difficult job. He has a few complex \ntasks to confront. There is no reason insurance company CEOs should get \na tax break on salaries higher than the President's. That is exactly \nwhat the Lincoln amendment does.\n  I thank Senator Lincoln for her commonsense proposal. I think \nconsumers across America should know that when they pay their hard-\nearned dollars to cover the soaring cost of premiums, they are not just \nchipping in to pay for the CEOs' next new yacht or the newest Mercedes \nin the driveway. In homes across Iowa people are clipping coupons and \nmaking do with secondhand, patching up instead of buying new. They have \nhad to make sacrifice after sacrifice to afford premiums that provide \ncoverage for their health care. It is outrageous that their hard-earned \ncash goes for gold-plated salaries and bonuses. Senator Lincoln is \nright to take a stand against these excesses. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport her amendment.\n  The Lincoln amendment is consistent with a major theme of our \nlegislation. It is basically standing up to the health insurance \nindustry on behalf of consumers. Her proposal will add one more \nimportant item to the list of benefits our legislation will bring to \nAmerican patients.\n  As I said before, this bill ends the practice of denying coverage \nbecause a person has a preexisting medical condition. I would wager \nprobably every Member of this Senate has some kind of a preexisting \ncondition of some sort, and every one of us could be turned down if we \ndidn't have the kind of secured program under the Federal employees \nprogram. Why shouldn't the rest of the American people have the same \nkind of security?\n  This legislation ends the lifetime limits and bans unreasonable \nannual limits. Our bill gives young people better options to stay on \ntheir family's and parents' plan until they are age 26. It also ends \nthe outrageous practice of charging women higher prices for the same \npolicy, the exact same policy a man gets. I can remember, during my \ntown meetings back in August, talking about this issue. People were \nstartled to learn that an insurance company can charge a woman up to \ntwice as much for the same policy--same age, all the same parameters, \nsame occupation, same kind of history. They can charge a woman up to \ntwice as much as a man for the exact same coverage, the exact same \npolicy. We get rid of that in this bill. We do not allow that kind of \ndiscrimination in any other kind of industry. Why should we allow it in \nthis industry?\n  Our bill provides better options for individuals, small businesses, \nfarms, for the self-employed. I have said many times the biggest \nwinners in our health care reform bill are small businesses and the \nself-employed. Right now they are sort of at the end of their rope. \nThey have no bargaining power whatsoever. Our bill will create \nexchanges so they will be able to go on the exchange and pool with \nother people for more options, more competition, more transparency \navailable.\n  Some places in Iowa we have only one insurance company offering \npolicies. There is absolutely no competition. Setting up the exchanges \nwill allow our self-employed and small businesses to get more \nbargaining power.\n  These are the kinds of measures the American people want and need to \nmake sure they get a fair deal on the coverage they buy. We need a \nhealth insurance industry that is a partner for employers and ordinary \nAmericans, charges fair premiums, treats us right, and pays our bills \nwhen we get sick. That is what our bill is all about. It is to end a \nlot of these outrageous practices that have gone on for far too long in \nthe health insurance industry.\n  A lot of times people say: You are always beating up on the health \ninsurance industry. Not really. We are just taking them to task for \nwhere they have gone. Years ago when they first started out, they were \ndoing a good job. Then the greed, the normal human nature and greed for \nmore profits, higher CEO salaries, $24 million salaries for CEOs, gold-\nplated benefits packages for all their CEOs and corporate executives; \nit just got out of hand. It became a situation where almost one health \ninsurance company was trying to outdo the others in terms of how much \nmoney they could squeeze out of the consumers. It is just a system that \nsort of ran amok.\n  Now it is up to us in the Congress to rein it in, to make the health \ninsurance industry what it ought to be--a fair and reasonable, \ncompetitive system for the consumers. That is what this bill does. To \nme, that is the American way. That is why we have to stay here on the \nweekends, if we have to. If we have to be here today, fine; and \ntomorrow, fine; and all next week, fine; and next weekend; and, if we \nhave to, right through the holidays.\n  The American people are looking to us to get this job done. We are \ngoing to get the job done. No matter how much our friends on the \nRepublican side want to delay, delay, delay, and try to kill this bill, \nit is not going to happen. This bill is unstoppable because the \nAmerican people are demanding that we do something about it. We are \nresponding to that, and we are going to get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, we gather today on a Saturday which, as \nmany Americans know, is rare, but it is entirely appropriate and \nessential that we make sure we spend the time on a weekend to debate \nthis bill and to get the bill passed. I commend the words of Senator \nHarkin and his great work over many months on this legislation. We are \ngrateful for his leadership. I commend Senator Lincoln on the amendment \nwe will vote on today regarding executive compensation.\n  I rise to speak about children, as this bill affects their lives--in \nparticular, the lives of children who are particularly vulnerable. I \nhave said a number of times in this debate that at the end of this \ndebate, when the bill is enacted into law, we should be able to say \nthat no child is worse off, especially a child who happens to be poor \nor has special needs. That is what I rise to speak of this morning.\n  I had a joint resolution a number of months ago that was filed \nrelating to this bill. It was joined in by Sen-\nators Dodd, Rockefeller, Brown, Whitehouse, and Sanders. It was simple. \nIt basically said what this chart says: No child worse off at the end \nof the debate. It is a fundamental principle, but I also believe it is \na commitment we must keep. When we talk about the legislation before \nus, we are not talking about some new system. We are talking about \nfiguring out a way--and I think we have in the Senate--to fix what is \nbroken and build upon what works. I believe that is what we are trying \nto do.\n  When it comes to children, we have special considerations, and we \nhave to have unique strategies to make sure they get the best health \ncare possible. As so many child advocates tell us--and it seems like \nsuch a simple maxim--children are not small adults. That is a profound \nstatement. You can't just take a health care program for adults and \noverlay that on the health care that is provided to children. Children \nare not small adults. They are different. The care they get has to be \ndifferent. It has to be tailored and focused on their needs. The care \nthey get, especially a child who is vulnerable, is determinative of \ntheir life. If we don't provide them the kind of care in the dawn of \ntheir life, as Hubert Humphrey talked about, there is very little after \nthat we can do to save them or to allow them to reach their full \npotential.\n\n[[Page S12465]]\n\n  That bright light inside a child, if we miss the opportunity to care \nfor that child, will never be the same. We have an opportunity in this \ndebate, and at the end of the debate with the legislation, to \npositively affect the lives of countless American children.\n  I have some changes I will propose to the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, but I wanted to speak this morning about parts of the bill \nthat speak directly to the needs of at least two vulnerable children, \ntwo young girls by the name of Hannah and Madeline from Pennsylvania.\n  I will get to their story in a moment, but their mother, Stacie, \ncommunicated with us and a lot of other people about their lives and \ntheir challenges. I did want to first review some of the basic parts of \nthe bill. We often say this bill contains consumer protections. That is \na nice-sounding phrase, but when you talk about consumer protections in \nthe lives of young children such as Hannah and Madeline, it takes on a \nwhole new meaning. I will talk more about them in a moment.\n  I want to walk through some of the basic provisions in the bill as \nthey relate to children and what we have in the bill already.\n  No. 1, the bill ensures pediatric input into benefit packages so that \nthe skill and the knowledge of a pediatrician and the kind of care they \ncan provide to a child is part of the benefits package. Again, children \nare not small adults. The bill also ensures benefit packages that \ninclude pediatric benefits including critical oral and vision health \ncare.\n  We all remember the tragedy last year of Diamante Driver of the State \nof Maryland, a young boy who lost his life because his family did not \nhave coverage for an infected tooth and couldn't afford the care. We \nare talking about a child in America who died from an infected tooth \nthat would have cost $80 to treat. This horrible tragedy that everyone \nin Washington was talking about at the time was entirely preventable. \nWe remembered his story and his tragedy in the bill by making sure that \noral and vision health care are part of what we do.\n  In addition, the bill mandates prevention and screenings for \nchildren. It creates pediatric medical homes. People say: What is a \nmedical home? That is not a place. It is a way to treat someone, so if \nan American, especially a child, has a primary care doctor, which many \nof them unfortunately don't--and that is another part of what we are \ntrying to do--that primary care doctor should be surrounded by the \nexpertise we can bring to bear to help the child. We have so much \nknowledge and wisdom and ability when it comes to our doctors. We have \nremarkable pediatricians whose sole focus is to help a child in one \npart of their needs, the health care needs of that child. Why should \nnot every child be surrounded by that kind of expertise? That is what \nwe are trying to do.\n  We strengthen the pediatric workforce. We can't just say we need a \nlot of pediatricians and hope it happens. We have to make sure we have \na workforce and a recruiter workforce to do that.\n\n  Senator Dodd and I and Senator Brown--I know Senator Dodd is on the \nfloor--added a loan repayment provision in the bill for pediatric \nspecialists and providers for mental health services for children.\n  I have two more items and then I will get to the story of Hannah and \nMadeline.\n  We expand drug discounts for children's hospitals and finally \nincrease access to immunizations. The CDC will provide grants to \nimprove immunizations for children and adolescent adults.\n  But let me talk for a couple moments--I know we have others who are \nwaiting to talk this morning--about these two children: Hannah and \nMadeline. The good news is--this picture is a dramatic depiction of \nwhat they were suffering from when they were diagnosed with leukemia at \nthe age of 4. They are 11 years old now, and they are doing better, but \nthey still have enormous challenges in their lives. Their mother Stacie \nRitter wrote as follows:\n\n       When my identical twins were both diagnosed with [a kind of \n     leukemia]--\n\n  And she talks about it--\n\n     at age four, we were told they would need a bone marrow \n     transplant in order to survive.\n\n  Imagine that. I have four daughters, and I remember when they were \nabout the age of 4. I never had to worry about any of this. I never had \nto even think about it. But if my wife and I--my wife Teresa and I--\nwere given this news, we would have been given coverage for a condition \nsuch as that by an insurance policy because I happened to be a State \ngovernment employee, and now I am a Federal Government employee. So I \nnever had to worry about that diagnosis for my daughters. Other than \nthe challenge of the diagnosis itself, I did not have to worry about \ncoverage. But Stacie Ritter and her husband Ben did. She says:\n\n       I learned that the insurance company thought my daughters \n     were only worth $1,000,000 each. It sounds like a lot of \n     money. It's not!\n\n  She says that with an exclamation point.\n\n       When you add up the costs involved in caring for a patient \n     with a life threatening disease like cancer $1,000,000 barely \n     covers it.\n\n  I think that is an understatement.\n\n       Fortunately the hospital social worker recommended we apply \n     for a secondary insurance through the state considering the \n     highly probable chance we would hit that [million dollar] \n     cap. And we did hit that cap before the end of treatment. \n     Thankfully the state program kicked in and helped pay for the \n     remainder of treatment.\n\n  The State program--it sounds a lot like a public option, doesn't it, \nan awful lot like a public option. So at least for this part of the \nstory, they were able to get some help through a State program, a kind \nof public option. We will talk more about that later.\n  But then Stacie goes on, and the lead headline of this section is one \nword, ``Bankruptcy.''\n\n       During this time my husband had to take family medical \n     leave so we could take turns caring for our one year old son \n     and our twins--\n\n  These twins, as shown in these pictures--\n\n     at the hospital. . . . For the 7 months my husband was out on \n     family medical leave, he was able to maintain his employer \n     based insurance for us via $117.18 a month COBRA payments.\n\n  My recollection is, COBRA was an initiative by the Federal Government \nto make sure, if you lose your job, you do not lose your health \ninsurance. We have to extend it right now--another government \ninitiative that was helpful here.\n\n       After spending all our savings to pay the mortgage and \n     other basic living expenses we had to rely on credit cards.\n\n  So a mother and a father who get this diagnosis for their children at \nage 4 have to rely on credit cards to get the help their daughters \nneed.\n  Stacie writes:\n\n       In the end we had no choice but to file bankruptcy. And \n     when you file bankruptcy everything must be disclosed, we \n     even had to hand over the kids' savings accounts that their \n     great grandparents--\n\n  Their great grandparents--\n\n     had given them. . . .\n\n  Is this the kind of system we want, when a mother and a father are \nhit with that diagnosis for their two daughters, when they are age 4, \nthat we have a system that says: Do you know what. We have to cap your \ncoverage. We can help you a little bit, but we are going to limit it. \nYou will figure it out. Don't worry. That is basically what the system \nsaid to them.\n  So what are we doing? Well, we have a bill that happens to speak to \nthese kinds of situations. It is ironic--I guess is the word--that on \npage 16 of the bill, which is actually the second page of the text, we \nhave a provision that says this:\n\n       A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering \n     group or individual health insurance coverage may not \n     establish . . . lifetime limits on the dollar value of \n     benefits for any participant or beneficiary. . . .\n\n  It is not complicated. It is not legalese. It is very specific to the \nlives of these two children. The first provision in the bill says there \nare no lifetime limits. So you cannot say to Hannah and Madeline: \nSorry, we know you have leukemia and we know you need expert care and \ntreatment, but we are going to limit your care.\n  So for those who think this is complicated and difficult in a lot of \ndebate here in Washington, it is not complicated. If we had this \nprovision as a matter of law in effect when Stacie got that diagnosis \nfor her daughters, she would not have had to worry about coverage. She \nwould not have had to use credit cards and go into bankruptcy and take \nthe savings these children were given by their great grandparents.\n\n[[Page S12466]]\n\n  Why do we tolerate this system? Why do we go, year after year, and \ntalk about changing it, saying: Oh, isn't that terrible we have these \nsituations and we let it go and we say that is too bad we couldn't get \nthe bill passed; it got a little difficult in Washington.\n  Well, the time for talk and debate and discussing the finer points of \nthis is over. We have to act to make sure a family such as this never \nhas to go through what these parents went through but especially what \nthese two young girls went through.\n  I will conclude with this: This picture, as dramatic as it is, I \nthink connotes a lot of hope. Look at those two young girls, facing the \nmost horrific of circumstances, and they are smiling and hopeful. But \nthey still need help. We are going to be spending time in the next \ncouple days getting this bill done so we can make sure we help them in \nthe future.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before he leaves the floor, I wish to thank \nour new colleague from Pennsylvania. From the moment he arrived here, \nhe has raised the profile of this issue involving children and \nfamilies. As someone who has been involved, myself, for a long time \nchairing the Subcommittee on Children and Families, and with the help \nof the Presiding Officer and others, we did the Family and Medical \nLeave Act back some 17 years ago; the childcare legislation almost 25 \nyears ago, dealing with infant screening, premature births, autism--a \nwhole host of other issues.\n  I wish to thank him for bringing what has been a tireless effort \nsince he has arrived in this Chamber, adding yet another voice, another \nstrong voice, on behalf of children in our country. Jay Rockefeller, \nour colleague from West Virginia, has been a stalwart for years on \nthese issues as well. I know Sherrod Brown of Ohio is also working very \nhard on these issues, and I wish to commend him.\n  So I wish to say thank you to my colleague from Pennsylvania. The \npoints that he raises are good ones.\n  I know our time has expired, and I apologize for interfering with our \nother colleagues' time, but I wish to thank him for his efforts. I \ncannot think of a more noble cause to be involved in. There will be a \nlot of debate about this bill, but we must keep in mind that the most \ninnocent in our society, our children, are born into circumstances \ntotally beyond their own control. And there are too many instances \nwhere they are suffering from one problem after another. A great \ncountry such as this, with great resources and potential, ought to be \nable to ensure that every child in this country--regardless of the \neconomic circumstances or the physical circumstances they are born \ninto--gets the kind of care that America can be proud of. I say to the \nSenator, you are a champion of that, and I thank you for it.\n  I yield the floor. I66F\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I am going to proceed on my leader \ntime, which I assume will not be charged on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. His leadership time \nhas been reserved.\n  The Chair will note, there is 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining on the \nDemocratic side allocated on the debate; and then, of course, there is \nanother 45 minutes, under the unanimous consent agreement, that will be \nallotted to the Republican side of the aisle.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I would like to yield my 3\\1/2\\ minutes to \nmy distinguished friend from Kentucky and my friend from Arizona and my \nfriend from Utah and my friend from Florida and my friend from Wyoming \nas well--3\\1/2\\ minutes for all of them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we all know the U.S. health care system \nis in serious need of reform. Costs are too high, they are rising, and \nif we do nothing, they will continue to consume a larger and larger \nshare of Federal dollars and of the budgets of millions of middle-class \nAmerican families, of young workers trying to get their start in life, \nand, of course, of seniors.\n\n  For months, the administration and its allies in Congress promised a \nsolution to these problems, a solution they said would lower costs and \nhelp the economy. They assured us that under their proposal anyone who \nlikes the health care plans they have would be able to keep them, and \nthey said their proposal would save Medicare.\n  But, in the end, what matters is not what we say. It is what we do. \nThis week, the proponents of this plan did more with a single vote than \nthey did all year in talking about all the things their health care \nplan would do.\n  How? Because in voting to cut a $\\1/2\\ trillion from the Medicare \nProgram for seniors, our Democratic friends undercut not only the \nroughly 40 million seniors who depend on Medicare, they also undercut \ntheir own promises about reform.\n  As I said, the President and congressional Democrats have noted, \nagain and again, that under their measure those who like their plans \nwill be able to keep them. After Thursday's vote, even Democrats are \nadmitting that is no longer true.\n  Here is how one of our Democratic colleagues put it:\n\n       We're not going to be able to say that ``If you like what \n     you have, you can keep it.''\n\n  Then he added:\n\n       . . . and that basic commitment that a lot of us around \n     here have made will be called into question.\n\n  As for the oft-repeated pledge to save Medicare, well, nobody buys \nthat one after the vote on Thursday to cut it by $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  These Medicare cuts will impact the quality of care for millions of \nAmerican seniors. Nearly 11 million seniors on Medicare Advantage will \nsee a reduction in benefits. Hospice care will see massive cuts. \nHospitals that treat Medicare patients will see massive cuts. Nursing \nhomes are cut. More than $40 billion is cut from home health care \nagencies--agencies that provide an appealing alternative to seniors who \nwould rather receive the care and attention they need in the comfort \nand privacy of their own homes.\n  I hear from seniors all over Kentucky worried about the impact these \ncuts will have.\n  Anita, from Hebron, KY, says she is worried about the impact these \ncuts will have on her husband, a Vietnam vet with multiple sclerosis. \nEvery 2 weeks, she writes, a home health care nurse visits her husband \nto perform procedures prescribed by his doctors. Now Anita is worried \nthose visits might be limited or curtailed under this bill. It is not \nclear they will not be because cutting $40 billion from a benefits \nprogram is bound to affect the benefits that people such as her husband \nreceive.\n  Joy, from Somerset, KY, works for a home health care agency. She \nwrote my office because she is also concerned about cuts to home health \ncare. She asked me to protect the rights of the chronically ill, \nelderly Medicare population that she and her colleagues care for every \nday in Kentucky through cost-effective home health care.\n  Robin, from Independence, KY, writes that her father is almost 80 and \nreceives home health care twice a week. She says he depends on a walker \nand a wheelchair to get around and that it is hard for him to get out \nof the house. Robin's father is the kind of person home health care is \nmeant to help. Frankly, I do not know what to tell her--I literally do \nnot know what to tell her--except that $40 billion in cuts to this \nprogram is not a very encouraging sign for people such as her dad.\n  I noticed that some years ago one of the top Senators on this issue \non the Democratic side used the very same image I have used to decry \nthese cuts. Back then, he warned, as I have in recent months, not to \nuse Medicare as a piggy bank. Yet that is precisely what our friends \nare doing with Medicare. They are not fixing it. They are raiding it--\nraiding it--to create an entirely new government entitlement program, \nraiding Medicare not to help save Medicare but to create an entirely \nnew entitlement program. In fact, one of the largest single sources of \nmoney for this 2,074-page bill is the money they get from Medicare.\n  I am not sure what has changed since our friends decried cuts to \nMedicare as immoral and irresponsible. But today I would, once again, \nurge them to reconsider their vote from earlier this week. They have \nvoted now to cut Medicare, and they have now voted twice to cut the \nimportant Medicare Advantage Program for nearly 11 million seniors.\n\n[[Page S12467]]\n\n  Today we will have a chance to restore the cuts they authorized to \nhome health care. A vote in favor of the Johanns amendment is a vote in \nfavor of the men and women who have been writing our offices, sharing \ntheir stories about the benefits of home health care. Americans never \nexpected that health care reform would mean that they would have to \ngive up the health care they have and like. They didn't expect it \nbecause they were told it wouldn't happen. Unfortunately, that pledge \nwas broken this week. That pledge was broken this week. Today our \nfriends have an opportunity to help repair some of that damage.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority now has 45 minutes for debate.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Utah, the Senator from Kentucky, the Senator from New Hampshire, \nthe Senator from Georgia, the Senator from Florida, and the Senator \nfrom Wyoming be allowed to participate in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, very quickly, I wish to remind my \ncolleagues that the AARP continues to be referred to as endorsing this \nlegislation and supporting it and opposing amendments that would have \ndone things that they in the past have supported. So I urge my \ncolleagues to look at this Washington article--one of my favorite \nsources of information and opinion, the Washington Post:\n\n       But not advertised in this lobbying campaign have been \n     AARP's substantial earnings from insurance royalties and the \n     potential benefits that would come its way from many other \n     reforms.\n\n  So we have been looking into that, and guess what. The AARP \nendorsement of more than $400 billion in Medicare savings--according to \nits own financial statements from 2008, AARP generated 38 percent of \nits $1.1 billion in revenue or more than $414 million in royalty fees. \nThey also obviously will--if we take away Medicare Advantage, then \nMedigap sales will have to go up because that provides for the services \nthat are being taken away. So under the AARP, they would generate in \ntheir endorsements--they have generated $414 million, putting them in \nfifth place of all of the health insurance companies in America behind \nUnited Health, Wellpoint, Aetna, and Humana. So we have before the body \nan amendment that would modify any health insurer's remuneration to the \nsame level as the salary of the President of the United States.\n  So I ask unanimous consent at this time that the AARP executives be \nadded in under the effect of this pending amendment from the Senator \nfrom Arkansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I also understand that Walmart sells \nhealth insurance policies. They are based in Arkansas. I ask unanimous \nconsent that Walmart be included in this curb on excessive remuneration \nthat will now place them under the same level.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, to be totally candid, \nthese are stunt amendments which we have not seen. I have never heard \nof the amendments.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is not complicated. It is pretty simple. It is people \nwho sell health insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, because I have not even \nseen these amendments, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sorry the Senator from Montana cannot understand \nthat they are people who sell health insurance as well. AARP does, \nWalmart does. If we are going to have this kind of demagogic amendment, \nthen we should include them, especially Walmart, that does a lot of \nbusiness.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from Arizona if \nI may ask a question. I would ask the Senator from Arizona, is this the \nsame AARP that I recall opposed a $10 billion reduction in the rate of \nincrease in Medicare spending back in 2005?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my colleague they not only opposed it, \nthey got all of their members fired up in opposition to it. We all \nheard from them back in 2005. These were reductions in spending. This \nwas not $438 billion taken out of Medicare and put in to create a new \nentitlement program of $2.5 trillion.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Could I ask my friend one more question? Is this the \nsame bill that back in 2005 my counterpart, the majority leader, \ndecried as immoral?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As I recall, that is exactly it. I think the Senator from \nNew Hampshire recalls that debate.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, absolutely. I \nwas chairman of the Budget Committee at the time. As the Republican \nleader is alluding to, we attempted to reduce the rate of growth of \nMedicaid by $10 billion of a $1 trillion base over 5 years, less than \none-tenth of 1 percent, I believe that was. It was opposed aggressively \nby the AARP, and it was opposed by the other side of the aisle. Not one \nMember of the other side of the aisle voted for that. Do you know what \nthat change was going to be? It was going to require that wealthy \npeople who benefited from the Part D drug benefit would have to pay \npart of their premiums rather than getting them all for free. So Warren \nBuffett, for example, would actually have to contribute to his drug \nbenefit, assuming he is on Part D. Maybe he isn't. Maybe he hasn't \nopted for it. But as a practical matter it was a very reasonable \namendment.\n  Now we are seeing, as the Senator from Arizona has pointed out, a \n$460 billion cut over the first 10 years of this bill; a $1 trillion \ncut in Medicare, $3 trillion over the first 20 years of this bill--$3 \ntrillion--when we already know Medicare, according to this chart, is \ninsolvent to the extent of $38 trillion--insolvent. Yet we are going to \ntake this money out of Medicare, as the Senator from Arizona has \npointed out, and we are going to fund a brandnew entitlement.\n  We are going to expand Medicaid to 133 percent of poverty with this \nmoney, and we are going to create this brandnew entitlement which has \nnothing to do with Medicare. None of the people who are going to get \nthis benefit probably have ever paid into the hospital trust fund, \nwhich is what funds Medicare. That seems totally inconsistent with the \npurposes of Medicare.\n  Shouldn't Medicare funds benefit Medicare recipients, I would ask the \nSenator from Arizona or the Republican leader? If there are going to be \nreductions in Medicare, should it not go to make Medicare more solvent \nand not to create a new entitlement?\n  Mr. McCAIN. One would think so. There are two doctors in the Senate; \nthere are lots of lawyers, two doctors. Both of them have hands-on \nexperience. I don't know if Dr. Barrasso has seen this morning's New \nYork Times, another of my favorite sources of news information and \nopinion. On the front page this morning: ``Home Care Patients Worry \nOver Possible Cuts.''\n\n  I understand the purpose of health care reform as proposed by the \nother side is to reduce health care costs. Is there a way to reduce \nhealth care costs better than treating people at home than instead of \nin a hospital? I am curious about the Senator's experience.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, as the Senator from Arizona knows, I have treated \npatients in Wyoming, families in Wyoming, for 25 years. The story in \nthe New York Times has a wonderful picture of Bertha Milliard, a 94-\nyear-old lady, who is very similar to many of the patients I have taken \ncare of in families in Wyoming who depend on this care. There is a \npicture of Bertha dealing with her nurse. Bertha greets the nurse who \nhas come to check her condition and review the medications she takes \nfor chronic pain, for heart failure, and for stroke. Ms. Milliard says \nthose visits have been highly effective, she says, in keeping her out \nof the hospital.\n  That is the whole idea: Keep them out of the hospital so they can \nlower the cost of care. But the home care that she receives could be \naltered, according to the front page of the New York Times, under the \nlegislation passed by the House and pending on the Senate floor today. \nThe legislation\n\n[[Page S12468]]\n\nwould reduce Medicare spending on home health services, which is a \nlifeline for homebound Medicare beneficiaries which keeps them out of \nhospitals as well as out of nursing homes.\n  So there you have it. What could be better for our seniors than to \nhave the dignity of being in their own homes, to have someone coming \ninto their homes to help them, to make their lives better, and that is \ngoing to include skilled nursing care, physical therapy, occupational \ntherapy, sometimes speech and language therapy, and different medical \nand social services? That is where the care ought to be given, in the \nhome. That is what we want for our seniors: the dignity at home, \nopportunities at home, to stay in their surroundings. That is what we \nwant for not just all seniors such as Bertha, we want that for our \nNation because that will help keep down the cost of care.\n  This bill does the exact opposite. That is why we have to have this \namendment that says don't cut Medicare for our seniors and certainly \nnot to start a whole new program.\n  In the Wall Street Journal today is an editorial by the dean of Johns \nHopkins Medical Center, a wonderful, world class center: ``Health \nReform Could Harm Medicaid Patients.''\n  So we are taking the money from Medicare, hurting Medicare patients, \nand they are using it in a way that is actually going to make it worse \nfor patients on Medicaid, as they have dumped 15 million people into \nthis program that is absolutely broken.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for a question? Will the Senator \nyield for a question?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I will yield to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. If it is taken out of your time, just exactly as you \nresponded when someone asked if you would yield for a question from \nthem yesterday. Is it taken out of your time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the time for the Senator's \nquestion not be taken out of the time that is allotted to us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will not be.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Do the Senators realize and do they know that yesterday \nthe Home Care and Hospice Association, the National Association for \nHome Care and Hospices, the umbrella organization for home health and \nhospice, wrote a letter to me, which basically says:\n\n       [F]or all of these reasons, we support the provisions of \n     your health care reform legislation as it relates to home \n     health care.\n\n  Is the Senator aware of that letter, the Home Care and Hospice \nAssociation's support for this legislation? Is the Senator aware of \nthat letter?\n  Mr. McCAIN. My response is, I don't know what deal has been cut in \nSenator Reid's office, as the deal was cut with the pharmaceutical \ncompanies and the deal was cut with the AMA and the deal was cut with \nthe hospital association. But I know what the effect is. I know what \nthe effect is. The bill would slice $55 billion----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. This is not on my time because he is going to filibuster \nover there.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The House bill would slice $55 billion over 10 years for \nprojected Medicare spending on home health services while the Senate \nbill would take $43 billion. I know that. But I don't know the details \nof the deal that was cut over where the white smoke comes out. I don't \nknow what the deal was. I know what the deal was with PhRMA. I know \nwhat the deal was with PhRMA. They told them they would oppose drug \nreimportation from Canada, and they told PhRMA they would not allow \ncompetition for Medicare patients.\n  So I don't know the deal that was cut that bought them, but I know \ndeals have been going on, and I know they are unsavory. I know people, \nsuch as the lady who was just referred to, Bertha Milliard, are not too \ninterested in seeing their home health care cut.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, with time being equally \ndivided on both sides for this colloquy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't know what the deal was----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I can tell the Senator the deal. I am going to tell the \nSenator the deal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I don't know what the deal was, but we will find out, \njust like the deals that were cut with all of these other \norganizations.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will tell the Senator what the deal was.\n  Mr. McCAIN. This place is full of lobbyists. I can't walk through the \nhallway without bumping into one of their lobbyists. If the Senator \nkeeps interrupting, he is violating the rules of the Senate. He needs \nto learn the rules of the Senate.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield to know what the deal was?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to finish my answer to you, if I may; that \nis, I don't know the deal that was cut with them, but we will find out. \nI know Bertha Milliard was not there when the deal was cut that \ngenerated that letter. That is my answer.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield for another question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will yield for one more, but we have other Senators who \nwish to speak.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Does the Senator know that the so-called deal was that \nwhereas MedPAC and the administration and the House wanted to make \ndomestic cuts to home health care, but rather we went to the home \nhealth care industry, worked with them, and took two of their major \nsuggestions about fraud and abuse as well as outliers, so we modified \nso that the home health industry thought this was fair and reasonable?\n  Does the Senator know that was the agreement that was reached?\n  Mr. McCAIN. My quick answer is, I don't know what the deal was, but I \nknow the people who are in the home health care business, who will see \n$43 billion in cuts to their business, the funding for their business, \nwere not there when the lobbyists showed up.\n  We have already heard the stories of the meetings you and the \nmajority leader have had with these people saying: Get on board or when \nwe shape the final parameters of this bill, we are going to hurt you.\n  We know they have been threatened.\n  Mr. GREGG. I was wondering if that was the deal. We know there are a \nlot of deals around here. I know the Senator from Arizona pays a fair \namount of attention to earmarks and other things done around here. I \nhope we will get an amendment from the Senator from Arizona that lists \nthe special deals like the ones that exempted a few States from the \nMedicare Advantage cuts, like the deals that got allegedly a few votes \non their side of the aisle so we could get cloture and proceed to this \nbill.\n  Do you think it is part of the deal that they would not--if there \nreally was a deal, should we not put in here that this money would go \nto benefit Medicare recipients and not to create a new entitlement? If \nyou were going to take $42 billion out of Medicare money going to home \nhealth, shouldn't it have gone to making the system more solvent rather \nthan creating a new entitlement with that and taking that money from \nseniors and giving it to somebody else? Shouldn't that have been part \nof the deal?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As is often said, it is what it is.\n  The Senator from Georgia has a comment.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. If there was a deal, it wasn't made with everybody. I \nhave a letter that was sent December 4 of this year to me from Judy \nAdams, executive director of the Georgia Association for Home Health \nCare Agencies, endorsing the Johanns amendment. So they must not have \nbeen part of the deal. They represent Georgia. Further, in here----\n  Mr. McCAIN. They will probably be called up to Senator Reid's office \nvery soon.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. They estimate that 68 of the 100 Medicare-approved home \nhealth care agencies in Georgia will go out of business. So if there \nwas a deal, it wasn't made with every State because the State of \nGeorgia is on record.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Georgia Association for\n\n\n                                   Home Health Agencies, Inc.,\n\n                                   Marietta, GA, December 4, 2009.\n     Hon. Johnny Isakson,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Isakson: The members of the Georgia \n     Association for Home Health\n\n[[Page S12469]]\n\n     Agencies, Inc. fully support Senator Johann's motion to \n     commit Senator Reid's Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act back to the Senate Finance Committee with instructions to \n     eliminate the home health cuts.\n       According to a study conducted by the National Association \n     for Home Care and Hospice, under Senator Reid's bill 72.15 \n     percent of home health agencies in Georgia will have negative \n     margins by 2016 in the Senate bill, and approximately 68 \n     percent of the 100 Medicare Certified home health agencies in \n     Georgia will go out of business and the patients they serve \n     will be rehospitalized or forced to seek alternative more \n     costly care.\n       We appreciate the opportunity to offer our support for \n     Senator Johann's motion and thank you for being an advocate \n     for the sick and elderly citizens of Georgia.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Judy Adams,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. If I may, I will follow up on my colleagues' comments \nabout what happened in Georgia.\n  I walked to one of the largest home health care providers in Florida. \nWe have a letter to the editor in the Sarasota Herald Tribune of \nNovember 16 where this person, who works for one of these home health \ncare companies--one of the bigger ones, which aren't going to be in as \nmuch trouble--they say:\n\n       Contrary to the other assertions that senior care will be \n     unaffected by health care reform in Florida, this scenario \n     could be devastating for older Floridians. More than 56 \n     percent of Florida's home health agencies could be in the red \n     as early as 2011.\n\n  So we are going to take the smaller home health agencies--the mom-\nand-pops--in Florida, we have 1.9 million small businesses. They are \nnot going to be able to function because we are going to take this \nmoney out.\n  I want to make a point, also, that today in the New York Times, a \ngood point was made that there is going to be no new insurance money \ncoming in for home health care agencies--or very little. It is not as \nif there are going to be folks having this new public option or new \ninsurance-backed program because home health care is for seniors. There \nis not going to be any extra money. So what is going to happen? We are \ngoing to have our moms, dads, and grandparents who are benefiting from \nthis home health care in Florida and across this country instead of \nhaving to go to a nursing home, instead of having to go to an assisted \nliving facility away from their home and family--they are not going to \nbe able to go anymore.\n  By the way, I don't believe that will save any money. I think that \nwill increase costs because we know nursing home care is far more \nexpensive than home health care. It is estimated that 1 day of hospital \ncosts, for example, is 43 times as much as home health care. When you \nget rid of home health care, you are actually going to increase costs.\n  I want to follow up on a comment, if I can, of my friend from New \nHampshire. I am new here, and I am still understanding the ways of \nWashington, DC. Everybody in America needs to know this bill will not \nhelp seniors at all. This bill takes money from senior health care. If \nthere was a legitimate and straightforward effort to actually help \nseniors, we would take Medicare savings and keep the money in Medicare. \nBut, as our leader said today, we are robbing the piggy bank, taking \nmoney out of health care for seniors and putting it into this new \nprogram.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Let me remind the Senator from Montana, sometimes there \nis good news and sometimes it is bad. There was an article earlier this \nyear where the staff of the Senator from Montana called in the high-\npaid lobbyists and told them not to meet with Republicans, saying that \nif they did, it would be treated as a hostile act. I can provide that \narticle for the Record. I hope it is not true, but I think it is.\n  Mr. BENNETT. I say to the Senator from Arizona and others who have \ncommented, home health care is not the only way seniors will be hurt by \nthis. I am quoting from an article by Tom Scully, one of the designers \nof the Medicare Part D benefit, on the impact of this bill on Medicare \nPart D for seniors. Let me quote the key points of the article. I ask \nunanimous consent to have the entire article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              Medicare Part D `Reforms' Will Harm Seniors\n\n                            (By Tom Scully)\n\n       There is a little-noticed provision buried deep in both the \n     House and Senate health-care reform bills that is intended to \n     save billions of dollars--but instead will hurt millions of \n     seniors, impose new costs on taxpayers, and charge employers \n     millions in new taxes.\n       As part of the Medicare Modernization Act in 2003, Congress \n     created a new drug benefit--called Medicare Part D--for \n     retirees at a cost of about $1,900 per recipient per year. \n     Many private employers already provided drug coverage for \n     their retirees, and the administration and Congress did not \n     want to tempt employers into dropping their coverage. \n     Actuaries calculated that if the government provided a \n     subsidy of at least $800, employers would not stop covering \n     retirees.\n       The legislation created a $600 tax-free benefit (the \n     equivalent of $800 cash for employers), and it worked. \n     Employers continued to cover about seven million retirees who \n     might have otherwise been dumped into Medicare Part D.\n       It was a good arrangement for all involved. An $800 subsidy \n     is cheaper than the $1,900 cost of providing drug coverage. \n     And millions of seniors got to keep a drug benefit they were \n     comfortable with and that in many cases was better than the \n     benefit offered by the government.\n       But now that subsidy is coming in to be clipped. This fall \n     congressional staff, looking for a new revenue source to pay \n     for health reform, proposed eliminating the tax deductibility \n     of the subsidy to employers. The supposed savings were \n     estimated by congressional staff to be as much as $5 billion \n     over the next decade.\n       It sounds smart--except that nobody asked how many \n     employers will drop retiree drug coverage. Clearly, many \n     will. The result is that, instead of saving money, the \n     proposed revenue raiser will force Medicare Part D costs to \n     skyrocket as employers drop retirees into the program.\n       The careful calculation that was made in 2003 to minimize \n     federal spending and maximize private coverage will go out \n     the window if this provision becomes law. Any short-term cost \n     savings that Congress gets by changing the tax provision will \n     be overwhelmed by higher costs in the long run.\n       Some members in the House want to mitigate the cost of this \n     provision by mandating that employers maintain existing \n     levels of retiree coverage despite the reduced subsidy. But \n     it's not that simple. A mandate would increase costs on \n     businesses, which in turn would make it harder for those \n     businesses to hire new employees. The mandate would \n     effectively be a tax on employers that provide retiree \n     benefits; this in turn will simply induce some unknown number \n     of employers to terminate their retiree drug programs before \n     the mandate kicks in.\n       In short, if the changes that are proposed for employer \n     subsidies in the current Medicare Part D program are enacted, \n     everyone will lose. Unions will lose as employers seek ways \n     to drop retiree drug coverage. Seniors will lose as employers \n     drop them into Medicare Part D. Medicare and taxpayers will \n     lose as they face higher costs. And employers will lose as \n     they find it harder to provide benefits.\n       To make matters worse, accounting rules for post-retirement \n     benefits will require companies that keep their retiree \n     benefits to record the entire accrued present value of the \n     new tax the day the provision is signed into law. This would \n     cause many employers to immediately post billions in losses, \n     which could significantly impact our financial markets.\n       There are many reasons to pass health-care reform. There is \n     no reason to hurt seniors, employers and taxpayers in the \n     process. Businesses are struggling, and the Medicare trust \n     funds have plenty of problems as it is. It makes no sense to \n     make these problems worse.\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. He says:\n\n       There is a little-noticed provision buried deep in both the \n     House and Senate health care reform bills that is intended to \n     save billions of dollars--but instead will hurt millions of \n     seniors, impose new costs on taxpayers, and charge employers \n     millions in new taxes.\n\n  Here is the core of it:\n\n       This fall, congressional staff, looking for a new revenue \n     source to pay for health reform, proposed eliminating the tax \n     deductibility of the subsidy to employers. The supposed \n     savings were estimated by congressional staff to be as much \n     as $5 billion over the next decade.\n       It sounds smart--except that nobody asked how many \n     employers will drop retiree drug coverage. Clearly, many \n     will. The result is that, instead of saving money, the \n     proposed revenue raiser will force Medicare Part D costs to \n     skyrocket as employers drop retirees into the program.\n\n  He concludes with this comment:\n\n       There are many reasons to pass health care reform. There is \n     no reason to hurt seniors, employers and taxpayers in the \n     process. Businesses are struggling and the Medicare trust \n     funds have plenty of problems as it is. It makes no sense to \n     make these problems worse.\n\n  So not only are the programs going to be cut, but the drug costs are \ngoing to be dumped into the program, with an increased number of people \ninvolved. You are going to see tremendous financial distortions as a \nresult of the passage of this bill.\n\n[[Page S12470]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from North Carolina for a question \nand then the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. BURR. I will make this point and ask this question: The President \nset out in this debate and targeted two things--quality and savings. He \nassured the American people that we were going to save health care and \nwe were going to maintain quality.\n  Would it not be accurate to say that, as you take money away from \nhome health, one, you remove from that population that tool that \nmaintains disease, that keeps that from getting worse, and you chase \nseniors back to the hospitals for the services. So, one, the acuity of \nthe senior patient is much worse and, two, the cost of the delivery of \nthe service because by the time they hit the hospital, it has \ndeteriorated. So we flunk on both points. We don't decrease cost by \ncutting home health, we increase it. From the standpoint of the \nquality, the outcome of the patient is worse because we put them into a \nhospital setting. Is that not what we are trying to eliminate?\n  Mr. McCAIN. It seems to me, yes.\n  I yield to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I was watching this in my office.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is a lot of fun, isn't it?\n  Mr. CORKER. It is. I would rather not be any other place than on the \nfloor talking about the most important piece of legislation we probably \nwill deal with in our tenure here.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Based on the principle that a fight not joined is a fight \nnot enjoyed.\n  Mr. CORKER. I can tell. I have never seen the Senator from Arizona as \nhappy as he is today in the fight against something that is so \ndevastating.\n  I don't understand what it is that would cause my friends on the \nleft, on the other side of the aisle, to throw seniors under the bus. \nThere is no doubt that there ought to be some changes in Medicare to \nmake it more solvent. We all want to ensure that seniors, down the \nroad, have the ability to benefit from Medicare. no question. I think \nwe have all said from day one that we want to join with Senator Gregg \nand others to make sure Medicare is here for seniors.\n  I do not understand--I listened to the last segment of my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle talking about the many needs in this \ncountry. Many people don't have health insurance, and many of us have \noffered bills to solve that.\n  I don't understand, and I hope you can explain it to me, why the left \nwould be willing to throw seniors under the bus. Regardless of what you \nsay about the bill, they are being thrown under the bus, and doctors \nare going to get a 23-percent cut in a year, and they are not even \ndealing with that, and they are taking $464 billion out of Medicare. \nWhat is it that would drive our friends on the left who in the past--\nnot today--have supported seniors but today are willing to throw them \nunder the bus for a political victory? What drives them?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I do not understand it. Perhaps my other colleagues can \nexplain it better.\n  I also want to return for a second to the question of the Senator \nfrom Montana. The AMA is a classic example. When I go back to Arizona \nand talk to doctors and providers, they say: What is going on? You made \na deal with the lobbyists. That is my answer to you. You made a deal \nwith the lobbyists--not the home health care providers, not the nurses, \nnot the doctors, the people who are the users of pharmaceuticals who, \nthis year, have seen an 8- to 9-percent increase in the cost of \nprescription drugs--because your deal is going to protect them. My \nanswer to you is, I don't know what you bought that letter for, but it \nwas probably a pretty high price.\n  The Senator from----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Will the Senator yield? I can answer the Senator's \nquestion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know the answer to it. I just gave you the answer.\n  I yield to the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree with the Senator. It is astonishing that the \nSenator from Montana would read a national organization's letter \ninstead of one from his home State.\n  In Wyoming, we have 43 different home health care agencies, and some \nof them are in communities that don't even have hospitals. Therapists \ndrive long distances. We have colleagues from rural States here, and \nMontana is certainly one of them. Those home health care agencies know \nthey are not even going to get paid enough from Medicare to put gas in \nthe car to drive out to the ranches and the farms where people are who \nare staying at home, trying to stay out of the hospitals and nursing \nhomes. We have home health agencies throughout the States, and they \ndrive tens of thousands of miles every year, with therapists and nurses \nand home care aides going out to help people stay at home and therefore \ngive them dignity and allow them to keep down the cost of care for \neverybody.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty minutes 22 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The salary of William B. Novelli, who has since stepped \ndown--an old friend--last year was $1,797,751. Mr. Tauzin, a \npharmaceutical research and manufacturers lobbyist, only made $1.5 \nmillion last year. Scott Serota, of BlueCross BlueShield, made $1.6 \nmillion. Chicken feed.\n  I yield to the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona.\n  My mind goes back to a personal experience I had that I would like to \nshare with my friends on the left. It was an entirely different bill--\nNo Child Left Behind. We were all for it on this side of the aisle \nbecause our President had proposed it. My staffer said to me, listening \nto the debate: You know, Senator, if President Clinton had proposed \nthis, you would vote against it because you would think it was too \nheavyhanded with government interference. I said: You know, you are \nright. I have to do the right thing. I was one of the few Senators who \nvoted against it.\n  If we had proposed what the Democrats had proposed, every argument we \nare currently hearing from the right side of the aisle would be coming \nwith great roars and insistent statements on the other side of the \naisle. But because it is their President who proposed it, they are \nsomehow keeping their consciences under control. I hope they will \nrecognize the irony of that and that at least one Senator--that is all \nwe need in order to stop this bill--would recognize that conscience \nought to prevail and this bill ought to be stopped.\n  Let's be clear. If this bill is stopped, health care reform will not \ndie as a cause. Indeed, health care reform will be reborn in a \nbipartisan sense of, let's solve the problem, rather than in a partisan \nsense of, let's jam something down somebody's throat.\n  I hope that is what will happen, that conscience will prevail \nsomewhere and one member of the Democratic Party who feels in his or \nher heart that this is a dumb idea will let his or her conscience \nprevail.\n  I see the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Will the Senator yield for an observation? Senator \nMcCain has pointed out where the lobbyists are on this bill. Senator \nIsakson has pointed out where the people of Georgia are on this bill. \nSenator Barrasso has pointed out where the people of Wyoming are on \nthis bill. We also know where the American people are.\n  I have not seen a survey in months--in months--by anybody that \nindicates the American people are for this bill. It is not in doubt. We \nhave heard that President Clinton came up to their lunch. The President \nmay be coming back himself. The argument they are making on the other \nside? Ignore the American people, make history. Make history? What I \nhear the American people saying to us is: Vote for this bill and you \nwill be history.\n  This is not in the gray area. The American people are asking us to \nstop this bill and start over. They do not want a 2,074-page \nmonstrosity of complexity and Medicare cuts and tax increases and \nhigher premiums for everybody else. They want us to stop and start over \nand get it right.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask the Senator from New Hampshire very quickly, is it \nyour understanding that AARP does sell health insurance and Wal-Mart \nsells health insurance?\n  Mr. GREGG. Both of those are correct.\n\n[[Page S12471]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then would it make sense they would be included in the \namendment to modify the limit on excessive remuneration paid by certain \nhealth insurance providers to set the limit at the same level as the \nsalary of the President of the United States? Wouldn't the CEO of Wal-\nMart and the head of AARP, who only made $1.8 million last year, fall \nunder that umbrella?\n  Mr. GREGG. The underlying proposal is a blatant act to try to \nEuropeanize our economy and move us to a process where the government \ndecides what the market should do. But consistency would require that \nboth of those organizations be included in that if the author is going \nto be consistent with the theme of the amendment, which is absolutely \nwrong in my opinion because there is no reason that we as a Congress \nshould decide the compensation levels for people who are in the private \nsector.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I want to put a face on what home health care means to \nthe quality of health care and the lowering of the cost of health care \nin America.\n  My youngest son was in a horrible accident in 1989. He was \nhospitalized for 8 weeks, had four surgeries, developed an infection, \nand had some bone marrow threats. He was put in home health care after \nthose 8 weeks. At a cost of pennies on the dollar, a visiting nurse \ncame and helped my wife and me administer antibiotic drips periodically \nso he could continue to have the protection he needed to fight off the \ninfection.\n  The 8 weeks he was in the hospital cost over $100,000. The 8 weeks \nfollowing that, when he was at home, home health care cost only a few \nthousand dollars.\n  We are taking an agency and a service that has provided to the \nAmerican people that greatly reduces the cost of health care, improves \nthe quality of life of the individual and forcing the only option for \nsomebody hurt like that to be in a hospital. Granted, my son was not in \nMedicare, but people in Medicare are in accidents and have the same \ntype of thing happen.\n  The patent effect of this is, on the one hand you save money to pay \nfor somebody else's government option health insurance, but you take \naway an affordable, effective way to deliver health care.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. I was thinking about last year's campaign. The Senator \nfrom Arizona was highly involved in that campaign. I know he offered \nsome health care solutions that were greatly maligned. But I think back \non that, and I wonder, had our sitting President run on a health care \nreform bill that took money out of Medicare, which was insolvent, \ncreated a new entitlement, hurt seniors through home health, eliminated \nchoices, making sure doctors got a 23-percent cut in a year, if he ran \non a platform of health care reform that did that--had unfunded \nmandates to States, raised taxes--and told the American people while he \nwas campaigning that their premiums were going to go up, I do wonder if \nthe outcome would have been the same.\n  As a matter of fact, I cannot imagine a health care policy being \npresented that is more off base than the one we are debating. But one \nthat makes Medicare insolvent, has unfunded mandates to States when \nthey are troubled, raises taxes and raises premiums. That is what we \nare discussing. Why my friends on the left want to give our President a \nvictory on that basis is astounding to me.\n  I don't know, but since you were up close and personal to that, I \nwonder if you might respond.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator from Tennessee. I am very reluctant \nto take a trip down memory lane again. Could I say, one of the phrases \nthroughout the campaign was: If you like the insurance policy you have, \nyou can keep it. You tell me how people who now have Medicare Advantage \ncan keep it under this proposal? It is impossible.\n  Maybe the other side is right. Maybe these reductions have to be made \nin Medicare Advantage. Maybe those changes have to be made. I don't \nhappen to agree, although cost savings should be there. But no one can \nbelieve that you can keep the same Medicare Advantage policy that 11 \nmillion seniors in America have today under this proposal. It is \nimpossible.\n  The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. If the Senator from Arizona will allow, I want to ask \none question of my friend, the medical doctor, about infections in \nhospitals. My understanding is that home health care is actually better \nfor the patient, it is better for the efficacy of the treatment because \na big problem we have in hospitals is that patients get staph \ninfections and other infections. In fact, it is one of the leading \ncauses of death in a hospital. You don't go in with this infection, you \nget it there.\n  Isn't this proposal that is going to take people out of home health \ncare and send them to hospitals going to actually hurt patients?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. This proposal is going to hurt patients in a lot of \nways. It is going to hurt patients psychologically. They are in a \nhospital when they want to be at home. It is going to hurt patients in \nterms of their health. The better place to be is at home, as long as \nsomebody is coming around to check on them. That is why for so many \nreasons, doctors have for decades said: Try to help patients get home \nas quickly as they can. That is the best place for them to heal.\n  We have heard from the Senator from Georgia a remarkable story about \npennies on the dollar, the effectiveness of this program. It is good \nfor folks, and it is good for the whole health care of our Nation if we \nhave people healing at home, not in the hospital.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Thanks to our crack staff who are a good example of the \nsuccess of work release programs, I remind my friend from Montana, a \nRollcall article as of June 11:\n\n       Top aides to Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus called a \n     last-minute, pre-emptive strike on Wednesday with a group \n     of prominent Democratic lobbyists, warning them to advise \n     their clients not to attend a meeting with Senate \n     Republicans set for Thursday.\n       Russell Sullivan--\n\n  Whom I don't happen to know--\n\n     the top staffer on Finance, and Jon Selib, Baucus' chief of \n     staff, met with a bloc of more than 20 contract lobbyists, \n     including several former Baucus aides.\n\n  Who have made a nice transition.\n\n       ``They said, `Republicans are having this meeting and you \n     need to let all of your clients know if they have someone \n     there, that will be viewed as a hostile act,' '' said a \n     Democratic lobbyist who attended the meeting.\n       ``Going to the Republican meeting will say, `I'm interested \n     in working with Republicans to stop health care reform,' '' \n     the lobbyist added.\n\n  Again, PhRMA, the New York Times, again my favorite. Tauzin, the \n$1.5-million-per-year representative of PhRMA said:\n\n       ``We were assured: `We need somebody to come in first. If \n     you come in first, you will have a rock-solid deal,' '' Billy \n     Tauzin, the former Republican House member from Louisiana . . \n     . said. ``Who is ever going to get into a deal with the White \n     House again if they don't keep their word? You are just going \n     to duke it out instead.''\n\n  They cut a deal. That is, again, in answer to the Senator from \nMontana, that is probably how they got the letter, the same way Tauzin \nwrote his letter.\n  The majority leader--the minority leader, hopefully majority leader \nsoon.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I say to my friend from Arizona, at the risk of being \nrepetitious, what we all know is going on here is there is a total \ndisconnect between inside-the-beltway lobbyists who cut their special \ndeals and the American people who are speaking loudly to all of us in \nall of the surveys saying: Please stop this thing.\n  I have never been involved in an issue in all the years I have been \nhere, I say to my friend from Arizona and other colleagues, on which \npeople spontaneously stop me in the airport and say: Please stop this \nbill.\n  I am sure there are people in Kentucky who are for it. I have not met \none. There must be a doctor in Kentucky who is for this. I have not \nheard from one.\n  This is an incredibly unpopular bill. Thus, their only rallying cry: \nMake history, ignore the American people. What an act of arrogance. \nWhat an act of total arrogance. We know better than you. Why don't all \nyou American people, all 300 million of you, shut up, sit down, and we \nwill do it for you. We will restructure one-sixth of the economy. We \nknow what is best for you. This is an act of total arrogance.\n\n[[Page S12472]]\n\n  As the Senator from Utah pointed out, we just need one Democratic \nSenator to say no: No, I am not going to do this. I know the President \nwould like me to make history, but this is wrong for the country, and I \nwill not participate in it. Just one can make a difference.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. The Washington Post in October of this year, talking about \nthe story on AARP, said:\n\n       The group and its subsidiaries collected more than $650 \n     million in royalties and other fees last year from the sale \n     of insurance policies, credit cards and other products that \n     carry the AARP name . . .\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Wouldn't that mean that AARP executive would naturally \nfall under the Lincoln amendment?\n  Mr. BURR. Absolutely, because it says ``the majority of its $1.14 \nbillion in revenue'' that AARP collected, according to the tax records, \nwere made up of sale of these insurance products.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from North Carolina has made an \nexcellent point. Consistency would require for the AARP to be included \nin this amendment, if the amendment is going to go forward. I hope the \namendment is not adopted. But clearly it should be consistent with all \nthe different interest groups. It appears it is not included because \nsome deal was cut. Is that the implication here?\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Utah?\n  Mr. COBURN. If I might, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the consolidated audited financial statements of AARP. They \nare the fifth largest insurance sales company in America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     KPMG LLP,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 30, 2009.\n\n                      Independent Auditors' Report\n\n     The Board of Directors,\n     AARP, Inc.\n       We have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of \n     financial position of AARP, Inc. and affiliates \n     (collectively, AARP) as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and \n     the related consolidated statements of activities and cash \n     flows for the years then ended. These consolidated financial \n     statements are the responsibility of AARP management. Our \n     responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated \n     financial statements based on our audits.\n       We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing \n     standards generally accepted in the United States of America. \n     Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to \n     obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial \n     statements are free of material misstatement. An audit \n     includes consideration of internal control over financial \n     reporting as a basis for designing audit procedures that are \n     appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of \n     expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of AARP's internal \n     control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no \n     such opinion. An audit also includes examining, on a test \n     basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the \n     financial statements, assessing the accounting principles \n     used and significant estimates made by management, as well as \n     evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We \n     believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our \n     opinion.\n       In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements \n     referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, \n     the financial position of AARP as of December 31, 2008 and \n     2007, and the changes in its net assets and its cash flows \n     for the years then ended in conformity with U.S. generally \n     accepted accounting principles.\n       As discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial \n     statements, AARP adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board \n     Statement No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, in 2008.\n                                                         KPMG LLP.\n\n  CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND\n

Mr. President, I have enjoyed this colloquy. I have \nenjoyed the enthusiasm that is here. I noticed that the sense of \npassion to get something done properly for the American people is on \nthis side of the aisle. A great of sense of defensiveness is on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  We all have an been caught one time or another in the struggle \nbetween support for a leadership position or a Presidential position \nand our own sense of what is the right thing to do. I join with my \nleader from Kentucky in saying that the people of Utah have never been \nmore worked up about any issue than this one. I have never seen any \ncircumstance where they have been more firm and unanimous in their \ndemand that this bill be stopped.\n  The Senator from Kentucky said if there is somebody in Kentucky who \nis for this bill, he has not met him. I have met some people in Utah \nwho are for this bill. They have spoken to me about it, as I pass \nthrough airports or I walk down the street in the hearing of other \npeople from Utah. As soon as anybody hears someone tell me, Vote for \nthis bill, there is a chorus of voices that spontaneously come up \naround that and say: Don't listen to him; listen to us. This is a \nterrible bill. This is a terrible circumstance.\n  I have been proud in the debate to point out that in Utah, the \nDartmouth study says we have the best health care available in the \nUnited States, and if everybody got their health care there, it would \nnot only be the best, it would be one-third cheaper than the national \naverage.\n  I have spent a lot of time talking with the people who provided that \nresult. Unanimously they tell me this bill would damage that result. It \nwould damage the quality, and it would raise the price. Why in the \nworld would we want to do those two things?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Dr. Barrasso from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It has been a privilege to take care of patients in \nWyoming for the last 25 years. This bill is going to hurt them. It is \ngoing to hurt the future of care. It is going to hurt the future of \nMedicare in America. You cannot take $464 billion away from Medicare, a \nprogram on which the seniors of this country depend, and say it will \nnot affect their care. It will affect them in the hospitals, it will \naffect them in the doctors' offices, it will affect them in the home, \nit will affect them in the final days of their lives in the hospices. \nThat is what I hear about across Wyoming.\n\n  I have not met doctors who support this--not at all. I have not met \nvery many patients who support it, and they are also told by others: We \ndon't want this. The townhall meetings have been overwhelming in \nopposition.\n  This is a bill that will be bad for our small businesses and bad for \npeople who want to get insurance. It will be bad for people who have \ninsurance because they know their premiums are going to go up. It will \nbe bad for people who pay taxes because those are going to go up. But \nspecifically for home health care, this will be awful. It will affect \nsmall communities--in all of the small communities of America, not just \nin Wyoming. I can't imagine anyone in a small community being for this.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And put more people in the hospital.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I have been listening to the debate, and \nit is seldom that debate on the Senate floor has much impact on me, I \nmust add. But the fact is, I do think this amendment--the Lincoln \namendment--is a terrible amendment. We should not be voting on \ncompensation.\n  But I am wondering, I ask Senator McCain, if we should offer a \nunanimous consent agreement to change the amendment to take into \naccount AARP, PhRMA, and others. I wonder if the other side would be \nwilling to take that unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not to mention the chief executives of the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. Why wouldn't we want to bring them in on it? After all, they \nare paying for lobbyists at $1.7 million every year to cut these deals \nat the White House that they describe on the front page of the New York \nTimes.\n  I would hope the Senator would be glad to modify her amendment to \ninclude all these other people who have gotten extremely wealthy--\nPhRMA, an 8-percent increase in drug prices in the last year. Again, I \nrefer to the New York Times.\n  Anyone else? Senator Burr.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. One minute.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Senator Burr will wrap it up.\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator from Arizona has stated this case very well \nover a number of days, and it will continue to be stated--they are \ncutting Medicare to fund a new government program. They are taxing the \nAmerican people through drugs and devices and more money for their own \ninsurance policies so that government can have a larger hand in health \ncare.\n  You know what. At the end of the day, the American people realize now \nthat they are going to pay more and the quality of their health care is \ngoing to go down. It is no more obvious than the current amendment on \nslashing the reimbursements to nursing homes or to hospice or to any \nother area under Medicare.\n  This is wrong, it should be stopped, and the American people's voices \nshould be heard in this debate.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It has been a great time. We are going to do it again, a \nlot, between now and the time the vote is forced, and the American \npeople are on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is very frustrating because we have \nthese blocks of time, with Senators lining up to take control of the \ntime and to make their points, and then they flee the Senate floor and \nwe cannot get into a debate or a colloquy. We cannot make points that \nrebut the points they have made because they have all left the floor.\n  Mr. CORKER. I am glad to stay here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. They all come in and make their points and then they \nflee.\n  Mr. McCAIN. We are here.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Good, I am glad they are staying because I want them to \nhear this. Maybe we will all learn something.\n  First of all, clearly, we all care about home health care. I mean, \nlet's obviously agree that we all do. I see the Senator from Arizona \nnodding his head in agreement; he does care about home health care. \nThis Senator cares about home health care. The Senator from Wyoming, \nDr. Barrasso--here he is, over here--he cares about home health care. \nHe has talked about home health care.\n  We all know seniors would rather be home than in the hospital or a \nnursing home, if that is medically appropriate. We all know that. I \nknow that personally. My mother was in the hospital 2 weeks ago, and \nshe is now, thankfully--praise the Lord--out of the hospital, and she \nis home. We have a home health care person coming in every day to see \nmy mom.\n  When I am there with the home health care person, I am very \nimpressed. They do a super job. It is really something to behold. My \nmother loves it and I love it. We clearly are not going to do anything \nto cut home health care.\n  But another point I would assume all my colleagues agree with is that \nwe want to cut waste, if there is waste. We want to cut waste out of \nthe health\n\n[[Page S12475]]\n\ncare system. Why should we allow waste, as representatives of our \npeople--the taxpayers? We want to cut out waste. Again, I see the \nSenator from Arizona is nodding his head, yes, that clearly we want to \ncut out waste that may or may not occur in the system.\n  Now, the next question--and it is a question--is, there are lots of \nforms of waste, and one is fraud--people just ripping taxpayers off and \nripping seniors off. That is clear. There is a lot of waste. Let me \ntake one small example in the home health provisions in the Senate \nbill, and that is this: The General Accountability Office found that in \nthe home health industry there are a lot of outlier expenditures which \nare fraudulent; that is, some home health agencies classify their \nexpenditures for home health as outliers--as extra payments--for very \nsick people.\n  In fact, there is one county in Florida which accounts for 60 percent \nof all outlier reimbursements, whereas they provide health care for \nonly 1 percent of the Nation's people. The GAO has found lots of \nexamples where the outlier portion of home health is abused. It is \nfraud. It is abused. Well, guess what. The home health care industry \ncame to us and said: Gee, we have some ideas how to stop that because \nwe don't like rotten apples spoiling our barrel. We want to stop this \nfraud that exists with excessive outlier payments.\n  So they came to us with some ideas. I know it is easy to think that \nsuggestions might be classified as deals or whatnot, but that has not \nhappened. They came with an idea of how to cut excessive costs in \noutliers, and we have done that. That is in this bill. There are a lot \nof other provisions with respect to home health care.\n  I know the Senators have letters from their home States. I don't know \nif they are referring to a House-passed bill, which is very aggressive \nin cutting home health care benefits, or whether they have read the \nmost recent language in the Senate bill, which essentially is much less \naggressive because in talking to the agencies, they were saying: Yes, \nwe can live with these changes--such as rebasing and market basket \nupdates, phasing them in instead of immediately--with the idea, again, \nof getting rid of excessive payments and fraudulent payments.\n  I say excessive because the home health care industry is enjoying an \n11-percent growth rate annually, as it is right now in dollars. Well, \nsome think it is 17 percent. The chart I have is 11 percent, but maybe \n17 percent. Then the national health care spending rate, spending for \nall care, goes up about 6 percent a year, about 6 percent a year \nnationwide. Home health without reform is between 11 and 17 percent. It \nis almost double.\n  Under this legislation spending will be about 8 percent. Remember, \nnational health spending is 6 percent, and the home health industry did \nwrite a letter saying: Yes, we can live with that.\n  My approach, frankly, in regard to legislation, is to work with \ngroups, to work with industries and talk to them and not just be \ndraconian and not be arbitrary in cuts or changes. You talk to them to \nsee what accommodations can be made consistent with your principles.\n\n  One of my principles is stopping a lot of the fraud and to see if \nthere is a way to cut excessive spending because sometimes there is \nexcessive spending around here, and that is what we have done in the \nhome health industry.\n  I could go into more detail, but I want my colleagues to know there \nis real, solid, sound reason for these changes in the home health \nprovisions, and it is my judgment this will not hurt home health care \nfor patients. That is a very important point to make.\n  The same is basically true with the other industries--say with regard \nto the hospital industry. We worked with them and said: OK, we know you \nshould be cut. I talked to a lot of hospital administrators privately \nand said: What do you think?\n  They said: Yeah, Max, we should take a haircut. Our hospital should \ntake a haircut.\n  As you well know, you sometimes go to a hospital and you say: Good \ngosh, why do they have that big fountain out front? Why do they have \nall that marble? Why does this look like the Taj Mahal? You don't need \nthat for health care.\n  So then they crank that back for the need of their health care. Some \nof the executives say to me privately: Yeah, there should be some \nreductions in hospital payments. So we go to the hospitals and say: \nWhat is reasonable? Remember, this is over a 10-year period.\n  They say: We could take a $155 billion cut. But they say that, in \npart, because they know what they lose on the margin they can make up \nin volume because of everybody's health insurance. That means, too, \nthat we can get health care reform.\n  You know, it is hard to get the health insurance industry to work \nwith us if there is no health insurance for most Americans. If there is \nno health insurance for most Americans, then the health insurance \nindustry is inclined to revert back to their old ways--or try to \nanyway--underwriting insurance, denying policies based on preexisting \nconditions, et cetera.\n  So this whole effort is to work with groups--work with consumer \ngroups, with labor, with hospitals, doctors, the insurance industry, \npharmaceuticals--to see what is reasonable. That is democracy--to try \nto get some kind of broad-based kind of rough justice agreement to put \nthis together. That is the effort we have undertaken in this \nlegislation.\n  I hear criticism, well, gee, we are cutting this and cutting that. \nBut let's remember--and I know my colleagues agree with this--the waste \nin the American health care system is somewhere between $300 billion a \nyear to upper estimates of $800 billion a year. It is waste, and we \nhave to figure out a way to get rid of the waste without sacrificing \ncare and actually, at the same time, improving the quality of care. \nThat is the major goal.\n  So when you see reductions in some of the payments to providers, a \nlot of that is an honest attempt to get rid of the waste or excessive \npayments. Let's take Medicare Advantage. Somebody quoted Tom Scully \ntoday. I have a quote from Tom Scully that says there is way too much \nspending in Medicare Advantage. I don't have the exact quote, but it is \nbasically a public quote that we should cut Medicare Advantage spending \nbecause there is way too much expense in Medicare Advantage.\n  It is a question of judgment as to how much to cut, I grant you. But \nstill there are areas where there is excessive spending, there is \nwaste, and home health care is a good area where we worked hard to \nrefine the changes to get rid of some of the fraud--the outliers I \nmentioned--but in a way that helps seniors get good home health care.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I noticed the senior Senator from Montana \nreferred to us being here, and I wonder if he would yield for a very \nshort question.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I agree, so long as it comes off their future time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Well, I think we have a lot of time today, so I think \nthat will work.\n  Mr. President, I was wondering if the Senator from Montana might \neducate us--and all seniors in this country who receive Medicare--if \nhis intent is to make Medicare work better--and, by the way, I think he \nis, in some cases, working sincerely to do that--why is he taking those \nsavings away from Medicare? And being the distinguished chairman of the \nFinance Committee, he knows as well as anybody in this country that \nMedicare is insolvent. Why is he not using whatever he believes to be \ngood savings--and we may disagree with those savings--to make Medicare \nsolvent, or at least to pay the physicians who treat Medicare \nrecipients? They are going to get a 23-percent cut next year, and it \nwill take $250 billion just to make them equal in 10 years. Why is he \nnot using those savings to actually make Medicare work for the people \nwho are already receiving it versus leveraging all the entitlement from \none insolvent entitlement to another insolvent entitlement? Why would \nthe chairman of the Finance Committee consider doing something like \nthat?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would very much like to respond to that \nquestion. First of all, I appreciate the implied premise in the \nstatement that the Senator agrees there should be savings.\n\n[[Page S12476]]\n\nThe question is, Where should the savings go? I mean, basically, the \nSenator is implying there should be savings, and that is very good to \nhear. I think that is a very constructive addition to a part of this \ndialogue, this conversation, that we should take savings because there \nis waste.\n  The Senator's question is, OK, you take the savings, what should we \ndo with the savings? That is the basic question.\n  The fact is, because of the reforms in Medicare, a couple things are \nhappening. No. 1, we are extending the solvency of the trust fund; it \nis another 5 years. The Medicare trust fund will now be extended 5 \nyears, so that helps seniors.\n  I know the Senator didn't mean this at all, but, rhetorically, \nearlier he said: Why does this side want to throw seniors under the \nbus? I know he didn't mean that. I know he knows nobody is trying to \nthrow seniors under the bus, nobody wants to do that in the Senate. But \nthe fact is, these changes do extend the solvency of the trust fund.\n  Then he asked a different question, and it is a very good question. \nIt is a judgment call, what should be done with the additional savings? \nThis legislation takes those savings to help more people get health \ninsurance. One could argue those savings should not be used to help \nthose without health insurance get health insurance for them. They \ncould go back to the Medicare trust fund, they could reduce the budget \ndeficits--there are a lot of different options here. But this is a \nhealth care reform bill. In this legislation, we are trying to come up \nwith a system, if you will, that gets some coherence nationwide in \nhealth care. We don't have a system today. It is a hodgepodge. It is a \ncollection. It is kind of a free-for-all. Docs do their things, \nhospitals do their things, nursing homes do their things; each attempt \nto get health care based on profit motive, but it is kind of \nincoherent. There is no real--anything there.\n  We say let's try to look for coherence. We are the only \nindustrialized country in the world that does not have some system, \nsome way where everybody has health insurance. It seems to me we should \ntry to see if we can have some kind of system, some way, where \neverybody has health insurance. I know it is extremely complicated. \nThere is no doubt it is complicated. But if people have health \ninsurance, that opens up lot of doors for other reform; one is to \nprevent companies, health insurance companies, from denying coverage \nbased on preexisting conditions, health care status, and so on and so \nforth, because then what they lose on the margin, they can make up in \nvolume because everybody has health insurance. It is the same with the \nhospitals, same with the pharmaceutical industry, same with virtually \nall providers, the whole system. If everybody has health insurance, not \nmost everybody--more have health insurance the better the system is.\n  That is a judgment call. But I do believe, when people have health \ninsurance--those who do not now have it--are going to be more healthy. \nI think that is a good thing. Hospitals will not have to worry near as \nmuch about uncompensated care, which is a big challenge to hospitals \nthese days. The average, I think, is about $1,100, $1,200 a year per \nfamily, when it comes to uncompensated care that private patients' pay. \nThen, after that, we open up doors to delivery system reform. You get \nthe system working a lot better, compensating more on quality outcomes \nrather than quantity, et cetera. I know the Senator knows much about \nall these things.\n  But it is a judgment call for those savings. I am glad the Senator \nseems to imply there should be or are savings, but it is a judgment \ncall as to where the savings go.\n  The 21 percent in docs, we are going to have to take that up after \nthis bill. It is going to be difficult because some want to pay for it; \nsome want to not pay for it. I grant you, that is going to be a huge \nbattle.\n  You might ask: Why is that not in this bill?\n  Mr. CORKER. I did ask.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. My answer to that is, A, it is not part of health reform. \nBut, B, on the other hand, it is; they are docs, we care about our docs \nand we are going to have to find a way to pay for them and we will, I \nthink, by the end of this year because we have to. Docs--there cannot \nbe any reduction.\n  Frankly, there is a partial fix in this bill anyway. It is 1 year \nwith an update. At least this bill does take care of docs for at least \n1 year and with an increase. That is 1 year. The House wants a \npermanent fix.\n  Frankly, I would love to have a permanent fix, but we are having a \nhard time finding the dollars to pay for it all, but this legislation \ndoes have a 1-year fix for docs.\n  I yield to the Senator from Massachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, just one moment?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the Senator will yield, I thank my colleagues for \nstaying on the floor. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I just was notified--I wish to respond to a \nfew of the things here. The Senator from Arkansas has the pending \namendment. My amendment is apparently not quite ready to be called up. \nWhat I want to do, if I can make a couple comments so the conversation \ndoesn't stay where it is, prior to the Senator from Arkansas and then I \nwill yield and then I would like to be able to come back after that \nwith my amendment.\n  I wish to say to our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, I \nhave listened carefully, obviously, for a number of days now. I notice \nmost of them have, indeed, disappeared--as the Senator from Montana \nsuggested. It is pretty hard to have a legitimate debate in the Senate \nwhen people speak and then leave the floor and we can't actually test \nthe things that have been said.\n  One of the things that was said a moment ago by the Senator from Utah \nwas, you cannot find any doctors who support this plan. Can you find \ndoctors who oppose it? Absolutely. I will give him that. But don't come \nto the floor of the Senate and suggest there are not huge numbers of \ndoctors across the country who are desperately waiting for the Senate \nto pass health care reform and, in fact, this plan. In fact, the AMA--\nthis is what the AMA says. They represent tens of thousands of doctors \nacross the country, and they said:\n\n       [We are] working to put the scare tactics to bed once and \n     for all and inform patients about the benefits of health \n     reform.\n\n  We have heard an incredible amount of scare tactics, Senator after \nSenator standing there, jumping up, pounding out one sort of \nmisstatement or one distortion or another. The bottom line is, they \nhave stood there for the last hour or so, claiming they are standing \nthere to protect seniors. It is ironic, when one Senator, the Senator \nfrom Arizona, who said yesterday and sort of repeated it today--this is \nwhat he said yesterday:\n\n       I will eagerly look forward to hearing from the authors of \n     this legislation as to how they can possibly add $\\1/2\\ \n     trillion in cuts without impacting existing Medicare programs \n     negatively and eventually lead to rationing of health care. . \n     . .\n\n  That is the Senator from Arizona today.\n  Only a year ago, when he was running for President of the United \nStates, this is what the Senator proposed:\n\n       \"John McCain would pay for his health plan with major \n     reductions to Medicare and Medicaid,'' a top aid said, ``in a \n     move that independent analysts estimate could result in cuts \n     of $1.13 trillion in 10 years to the government programs.''\n\n  Consistency, obviously, has never constrained anybody in politics. We \nknow that. But to stand there, over the last half hour or 45 minutes, \nand say: Seniors are going to get hurt and seniors don't support this \nand we are here to protect seniors--just a few days ago the \norganization that represents 40 million seniors in America, it is the \nlargest single representative group of seniors in our country--we all \nknow it, it is called AARP. It is the American Association of Retired \nPersons. It represents people from 50 years old on up. There are a \ntotal of about 90 million of those in the United States of America, so \nthey represent about half the seniors in America.\n\n  Their interest, day to day, is making sure those seniors' interests \nare not hurt by what we do here in Washington. Here is what they said, \non November 20:\n\n       Opponents of health reform won't rest. [They are] using \n     myths and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly \n     suggest that Medicare will be harmed. After a lifetime of \n     hard work, don't seniors deserve better?\n\n\n[[Page S12477]]\n\n\n  This is what AARP said a few days before that, on November 18:\n\n       The new Senate bill makes improvements to the Medicare \n     program by creating a new annual wellness benefit, providing \n     free preventive benefits and--most notably for AARP members--\n     reducing drug costs for seniors who fall into the dreaded \n     Medicare doughnut hole, a costly gap in prescription \n     coverage.\n\n  The Federation of American Hospitals said the following:\n\n       Hospitals always will stand by senior citizens.\n\n  They have no intention of pulling out the support that exists today.\n  The American Medical Association:\n\n       [We are] working to put the scare tactics to bed once and \n     for all and inform patients about the benefits of health \n     reform.\n\n  The Catholic Health Association of the United States:\n\n       The possibility that hospitals might pull out of Medicare \n     [is] very, very unfounded. Catholic hospitals would never \n     give up on Medicare patients.\n\n  So everything we have just heard continues the scare tactics, trying \nto gin anger in America that is unfounded, based on the basics of this \nbill. Let me call attention--this is the report this year in March that \ncame out from Medicare--it is about Medicare payment policy. It is a \nreport to us, the Congress, by MedPAC. As we all know, MedPAC is the \nentity that oversees the administration of Medicare, and its concern is \nmaintaining the viability of Medicare, making sure Medicare patients \nare not hurt by a particular program.\n  What is in this bill--that Senator Baucus and those of us on the \nFinance committee put in the bill--is precisely what MedPAC told us we \nshould do and could do without harming seniors. Let me share, \nspecifically, what they said we should do:\n\n       The recommendation is that Congress should eliminate the \n     market basket increase for 2010 and advance the planned \n     reductions for coding adjustments in 2011 to 2010 so that \n     payments in 2010 are reduced by 5.5 percent to 1990 levels.\n\n  They suggested that. They did it because they know it will make the \nprogram sounder and it will allow them to make payments in other areas \nof Medicare that wind up taking care of Medicare beneficiaries more \neffectively. They said:\n\n       The Congress should direct the Secretary [of health and \n     human services] to rebase rates for home health care services \n     to reflect the average cost of providing care.\n\n  That is precisely what we do here. But the other side jumps up, and \nthey will take any change, anything that reflects a shift from one \nplace to another--they will exploit shamelessly in an effort to scare \nseniors and pretend it is somehow going to affect them.\n  What is interesting--and America ought to take note of this--they \nkeep coming to the floor and they keep opposing what is here. They keep \nwanting to strip something out. They keep wanting to send the bill back \nso that ends this process altogether. But they do not come to the floor \nof the Senate and show us how we could fix it more effectively and, in \nfact, serve seniors better, rather than just embracing the status quo. \nEveryone in America knows the status quo is unacceptable. We cannot \nafford it. Medicare will go bankrupt within the next 10 years, and then \nwhere are we going to be?\n  This is the time for responsible action, and every step we have \noffered offers that kind of responsible action without reducing care.\n  I will make one last comment and I will yield to the Senator from \nArkansas and then come back and talk about further ways in which this, \nin fact, serves seniors and others more effectively. But as they have \ntalked, for the last moments they have been talking about home care \ncuts.\n  I have an amendment that shortly we will talk about that will \nprohibit any reduction in home care, that will guarantee we are clear \nthat we are prohibiting any reduction in home care. But I have long \nbeen an advocate for better home care, more home care capacity. In the \nFinance Committee, I offered amendments to sustain that home care \nquality.\n  Nobody worked harder than our late colleague Senator Ted Kennedy, \nwith whom I worked for years on this, to try to extend home health \ncare, protect home health care patients and augment home health care. \nHere is what the people who represent home health care in America have \nto say. This is from the National Association for Home Care & Hospice, \na letter they sent to Senator Baucus. It was a letter they sent \nyesterday.\n\n       The National Association for Home Care & Hospice supports \n     making health care available to all Americans. We believe \n     that every-one must be willing to sacrifice to make this \n     happen. [The National Association for Home Care & Hospice] \n     has agreed to do its part by reducing costs and payments in a \n     manner that makes the Medicare home care program more \n     efficient and less susceptible to abuse. We are grateful for \n     the opportunity to make these improvements and at the same \n     time protect the thousands of ethical providers who are \n     participating in this important program. We are pleased to \n     have the opportunity to work with your staff to make this \n     happen. For all these reasons, [the National Association for \n     Home Care & Hospice] supports the provisions of your health \n     care reform legislation as they relate to home health care. \n     We look forward to working with you and your staff . . .\n       Thank you for [the] important work [you are doing].\n\n  Who better to speak to the concerns of home health care? The folks \nwho have continually been distorting this debate and who continue to \ntry to scare people, or an association whose sole existence, whose \npayroll every day is put to the use of protecting the folks they \nrepresent in home care? I think the answer is self-evident to anybody \nwho wants to listen to common sense.\n  Mr. BURR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. It will have to be on your time.\n  Mr. BURR. I would ask the Senator from Massachusetts, relating to the \nquote from Senator McCain that he showed, is the Senator aware that the \nday after that, factcheck.com said that was false?\n  Mr. KERRY. What I am aware of is that the individual who was running \nfor President of the United States never stood up and said it was \nfalse. I don't have any quote of Senator McCain ever refuting it. All I \ncan say is that throughout the campaign, that was the operative \nlanguage. It was debated. It was never refuted.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am proud to join in this debate on an \nissue that is absolutely critical to all Arkansans and all Americans. I \ncompliment Chairman Baucus because, as we talk about this issue in \nterms of health care reform, clearly, our delivery system in health \ncare is broken. We have the best hospitals and doctors, research and \ntechnologies in the world. Yet our delivery system is broken. For the \nlast 24 months, the Senate Finance Committee has held hearings and \nroundtables, summits, all kinds of different deliberative efforts \nworking in partnership with associations that represent providers, \nadvocacy groups on behalf of patients, anybody who would come to the \ntable to talk about how we reform this system and make it better for \nthe constituents we serve, the patients who are the ultimate recipients \nof the health care system. I applaud him and the work we have done.\n  To anyone who says we are jumping in here and moving too fast, I have \ntremendous respect for the minority leader from Kentucky. My husband \ntrained at Kentucky, did his subspecialty there. His admiration for one \nof those he trained with is a good friend of Senator McConnell's. But \nthe minority leader's comment that we are saying to our constituents, \nsit down and shut up, again, like the comment from the Senator from \nTennessee that we are throwing seniors under the bus, we are in a body \nthat is here to be respectful of one another, respectful of our \ndifferences, our different approaches, how we come to the ideas we have \nof how we solve these questions.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts brings up a great point. Where are the \nsuggestions from the other side of how we solve this? Come to the \ntable. Are they going to come to the table with ideas of how we do \nsomething other than just going with the status quo? Clearly, Americans \nunderstand that we are not throwing them under the bus. We are trying \nto figure out how we preserve a Medicare Program that is going to be \nbankrupt in 2017. How do we make the difference in the delivery system \nso we bring down those long-term costs in health care, so that we can \nactually preserve the programs\n\n[[Page S12478]]\n\nthat work and that are so meaningful to people in their lives. As we \ncome to this debate, I hope we will continue the age-old attitude in \nthe Senate of being respectful for one another's views and one \nanother's efforts in trying to bring about something that will make \nsense and that will be helpful, not throwing people under the bus, not \ntelling constituents to sit down and shut up, but actually working hard \nto come up with some solutions.\n  Senator McCain was trying to call an awful lot of people in Arkansas. \nMy mother was one of those whom he tried to get in touch with to tell \nthem that something is wrong up here and that we are not doing what we \nneed to do. I certainly visit with my mom an awful lot. I hear about \nher experiences and the concerns she has about Medicare, which is a \nsystem that is great for her, and I am proud I live in a country that \nprovides her with that kind of care. She does believe very strongly in \nsome of the things she has seen in her Medicare bill, inefficiencies \nthat could be changed, ways that we could make it a better program. I \nhope we will all come to the table here with good ideas and ways that \nwe can make a difference.\n  I notice that there was an effort or certainly a concern about \nwanting to add people to my amendment. I would welcome Republicans, if \nthey wish to offer their own amendment to include other entities, if \nthey wish to do that. I have worked on my amendment, and I like my \namendment the way it is. I think it focuses on an industry with the \nsole purpose to provide health insurance. Their sole purpose is to \nprovide health insurance. If they want to add other people----\n  Mr. THUNE. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I will continue visiting for a moment, and then I will \nlet the Senator take time on his part. I am directing it solely to \nthose businesses whose only purpose is to provide health insurance for \nthe people of this country.\n  I refer as an example to an article that came out yesterday. It \nreferences basically one of our large national insurance companies \nworking hard, at least I hope they are, to do what is right. I see that \nthey are going to be dumping 600,000-plus customers because they don't \nthink their profits are big enough. Yet I look at the record, and I \nbelieve their CEO actually, in 2008, made over $24 million. If they can \npay their top executive $24 million last year but they are going to \ncomplain that their profits are not big enough, that they have to dump \npatients, I would ask my colleagues, where do we go to correct this \nimbalance, if it is not to a very plausible amendment? My amendment \ndoes not restrict what industries, corporations can provide or give \ntheir executives in pay. It says we are not going to subsidize that \nwith tax dollars. The very American taxpayers they are dumping are the \nones who are subsidizing those incredible executive pay amounts.\n  I have to say to my friends over there, those over there who are \ndefending the status quo on behalf of the health insurance companies \nand their executives who are receiving these multimillion dollar \ncompensation packages, it took nine of them at one time, so it is a \ntough lift to be able to defend these executive compensations for \ninsurance company executives; otherwise, nine of them wouldn't have \nbeen down here trying to shift the conversation to something else.\n\n  The American people do understand that is out of balance. Here we are \nwith an opportunity to provide these insurance companies even more \ncustomers. We just simply want to be reassured that we are not, through \ntaxpayers' dollars, subsidizing these enormous executive compensation \namounts and, more importantly, that the savings that come from that are \ngoing to go into the Medicare trust fund to shore it up.\n  I appreciate everyone's debate and their efforts to come to the floor \ntoday and talk about a critical issue. I remind my colleagues, current \nlaw allows all businesses to deduct up to $1 million annually per \nexecutive as a business expense. That is a million dollar tax break per \nexecutive per company that is subsidized by the taxpayers. There are \nmultiple more ways they can obviously provide greater compensation, and \nthere are lots of loopholes in there that allow them to get tax \nsubsidies for more compensation for their executives. My amendment \nwould limit this amount to $400,000, the very amount the highest public \nofficial in this land gets paid, the President, a $400,000 salary for \nthose health insurance companies that will profit as a result of the \nhealth insurance reform.\n  Our objective is to get more people insured. Working diligently \nthrough all of these technicalities, trying to get more people insured, \nwe are creating a new marketplace for them with more consumers, a \ntremendous amount. This is only in regard to health insurance \ncompanies. It doesn't dictate what a business can pay an employee. It \ndoes limit the taxpayer subsidies for compensation. This is a fair \npolicy. It is aimed at encouraging health insurance companies to put \npremium dollars toward lower rates and more affordable coverage, not \ninto their pocketbooks. They are complaining about profits. Yet they \nare still paying these executives a tremendous amount of money. To be \nsure, there is evidence these companies need the encouragement to do \nthe right thing for consumers. Where health insurers spent more than 90 \ncents per every dollar on patient care in the early 1990s, that number \nhas decreased to just over 80 cents per dollar. For every dollar they \nspend, only 80 cents of it goes back into their efforts to provide \ncoverage for consumers. That is in 2007. Those are the numbers we have.\n  According to testimony delivered to the Senate Commerce Committee \nearlier this year, this trend has translated into a difference of \nseveral billion dollars in favor of insurance company shareholders and \nexecutives at the expense of health care providers and their patients. \nIt is imperative that we do what we can to reverse that trend, \nparticularly now when millions more Americans will be purchasing their \nhealth insurance coverage as a result of this health reform package. \nTaxpayers are footing the bill for this subsidy, and we must take steps \nto deter the health insurance companies from further enhancing their \nprofit margins at the expense of the American people.\n  We had a lot of Senators who came to the floor this morning on the \nRepublican side to defend the status quo on behalf of the health \ninsurance companies and their executives who are receiving these \nmultimillion dollar compensation packages. Maybe they don't understand \nthat under current law, the American people are already footing the \nbill for this tax windfall for health insurance executive pay. As we \nmove forward, it is going to be a greater benefit to those executives \nand the ability for these insurance companies to be able to do that. We \nwant to keep those insurance companies in business. We want to make \nsure they are there as providers. It is just a disconnect when they say \nthey have to cut 600,000 of their insured under the current system \nbecause their profits aren't high enough. Yet they are paying their top \nexecutive a $24 billion compensation package that is subsidized by the \ntaxpayers.\n  I hope we will work together to figure out what is the right place to \nbe here, if what we want to do is to make sure we are reforming health \ncare, that we are asking everybody to come to the table and make an \neffort in putting ourselves back on track. Ultimately, we want that \nquality of life that a new, reformed health insurance and health care \ndelivery system can provide. We also want to make sure we strengthen \nour economy. Making sure we make good use of every medical dollar, that \nwe are getting the biggest bang for that buck is a critical part of \nputting our economy back on track.\n  The assumption on the other side has basically been based on the \ncurrent and broken marketplace where insurance companies really do \nbully their customers and monopolize choices. I don't know about their \nphones, but I hear a lot on my phones and from my constituents that \nthey can't get insurance.\n  They have a neighbor--a hard-working woman who is a single mom--who \ncannot get insurance because of a preexisting condition. I have others \nwho have had insurance, and then when they did become ill, they got \ndropped.\n  So our hope is we look at this in the context not of the broken \nmarketplace that exists today but of what we are trying to create, and \nthat is, a more robust marketplace, and one that makes sense both for \ninsurance companies and for consumers as well.\n\n[[Page S12479]]\n\n  With insurance market reforms we plan to implement, along with more \nconsumer choices through the exchange, these insurance companies are \ngoing to have to work to keep up with the business they have and to be \nable to be there for future customers. That is a healthy marketplace. I \ndo not think I will get any disagreement from my colleagues on the \nother side that competition and choice is the way to go in the \nmarketplace. That is who we are as Americans. It is to let those who \nhave that entrepreneurial spirit--who want to get in the marketplace \nand provide a product at a reasonable cost--to be an active part of the \nmarketplace. That is what we are trying to encourage in this \nlegislation.\n  So the amendment I am offering today would set the deduction cap at \nthe same level as the highest paid government official, and that is the \nPresident. It is estimated to save approximately $650 million over 10 \nyears, and will place these savings in the Medicare trust fund to \nfurther strengthen the solvency of that fund and protect our seniors.\n  We want desperately to make sure we protect our seniors. We know that \nin many instances there are Medicare Programs out there, unfortunately, \nthat are oversubsidized, which means those who are in regular Medicare \nPrograms are having to pay for the outrageous subsidies in these other \nMedicare Programs. We want to make sure we bring them to balance and \ncreate a better system for everybody out there. That means bringing \ndown long-term costs. It means making sure we are protecting Medicare \nfor all seniors. It means we do it in a deficit-neutral way, which we \nhave done in this bill and the other bills we worked on in the Finance \nCommittee. It means we work to put our best foot forward and bringing \nabout partnerships between States and the Federal Government, as well \nas with providers who understand this delivery system is broken as \nwell.\n  So in closing, the choice on this vote is very simple: either you \nsupport these revenues being placed in the Medicare trust fund or you \nsupport having the IRS write a check and sending it to health insurance \ncompanies to subsidize the multimillion-dollar salaries they are paying \nin their taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this effort on behalf of the American \ntaxpayer and on behalf of our seniors, and to vote in favor of this \namendment that I feel has been structured in a very fair way.\n  Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we have less than 4 minutes \nremaining on this side. I see someone else who wishes to speak. I \npromised him time, and Senator Durbin as well. I know they are both \neloquent orators. It is a bit difficult here. So I will split it in \nhalf, the time remaining, between each of the two.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the chairman, I would yield whatever time I \nwould have and come around in the next round.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Fine.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to Senator Nelson. And I think Senator Kerry \nwanted to lay down an amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Thank you.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the Senator from Florida has 4 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. He has 2\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Well, let me say, the people of Florida gave \nme one of the toughest jobs I ever had in my life when they elected me \nthe insurance commissioner 16 years ago of the State of Florida. I have \nsome familiarity with the conduct of the insurance companies, and it \ndoes not surprise me that the insurance industry is out to kill this \nlegislation and is spending millions of dollars running TV ads.\n  It does not surprise me that the insurance industry was very \ninterested in this legislation to begin with, when we were going to \nexpand all of those 46 million people who do not have insurance, to \nbring them into private insurance.\n  It does not surprise me that since they have calculated they have to \ndo their part, and that this bill will not allow them to cancel \npolicies in the middle of somebody getting their health care--and we \nhave heard those horror stories: in the middle of chemotherapy, \nsuddenly, the woman gets the notice that her insurance is canceled. We \nhave heard those horror stories of that little boy who was a year old \nand was heavy in pounds, and the insurance company said: We are not \ngoing to cover him. We hear the stories that: Oh, no, we can't insure \nyou because you have a preexisting condition. And when you look what \nthat preexisting condition is, it was a skin rash.\n  Did you ever hear of the word cherry-picking? That is the typical \nmodus operandi of insurance companies that want to keep their profit. \nThey cherry-pick the good risk, the healthy ones, and they deny \ninsurance to the ones who need the health insurance.\n  So as we come to consider the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas, \nwhich I support, as we, many times, come to hear all of this extraneous \nargument, come right back to the main function. When you try to--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. When you try to reform the health care system, \nlook who is trying to kill the reform.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to Senator Coburn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank you. I appreciate it. I sat here \nand listened to my colleagues to hear their input. I find it extremely \npeculiar that the only industry for which you would limit their taxes \nis one that has not struck a deal with the committee. The only one. \nPharmacists are going to spend $70 million advertising for this bill. \nThe other industries are putting up additional moneys to advertise for \nthis bill. The only industry that we are going to restrict is the \nindustry that is in opposition to what we are doing. It is interesting.\n  Senator Cornyn made the point with me a moment ago that we are going \nto take $450 billion, and we are going to give it to the very industry \nyou are talking about. We are going to take $463 billion from Medicare \nand give it to the same industry you are now criticizing.\n  Senator Baucus said--and let me quote--he said: As we tried to work \nthis, it was ``rough justice'' to put this agreement together. This is \ndemocracy.\n  It was done behind closed doors. That is not democracy. It was done \nbehind closed doors. The Senator from Arkansas asked why we have not \nbrought forward something. The Senator from Massachusetts asked. The \nfirst bill introduced was the Patients' Choice Act.\n  I commend to my colleagues a white paper by Thomson Reuters, a very \nwell respected firm, talking about the $600 to $850 billion worth of \nwaste in the health care system today, entitled ``Where Can $700 \nBillion in Waste Be Cut Annually From the U.S. Healthcare System.''\n  The reason we are concerned about $465 billion coming out of \nMedicare, to be paid to the very insurance companies you are going \nafter right now, is because we are not going where the real waste is. \nThe promise of the President was to cut the cost of health care. Right \nhere is where it is. This bill does not touch it.\n  There is $175 billion a year in fraud in the health insurance \nindustry. You all go after $2 billion of it--$2 billion. There is $175 \nbillion a year in fraud. What is in it? Nothing. We are going to manage \nto pay a private industry, but only the private industry that will not \nplay along behind the closed door, rough justice of democracy in this \ncountry.\n  When Senator Corker asked the chairman of the Finance Committee, Why \nare you taking the money from Medicare and using it somewhere else, \nrather than extending the life of Medicare, he did not answer the \nquestion. The fact is, there is a $44 trillion--according to the latest \ncalculation, if you go to the Medicare trustees: $44 trillion--counting \nwhat has been borrowed--unfunded liability over the next 75 years for \nMedicare. We are going to take $\\1/2\\ trillion out of that program that \nwe all know is going wrong. And I do not doubt the motives of anybody \nhere. I just think we are misdirected. And we are going to take that \nand spend it on another program. That is where people ought to be \nconcerned.\n  It is interesting--I will submit another document for the Record. \nThis is\n\n[[Page S12480]]\n\na report from the Congressional Research Service, released December 1, \n2009, at my request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that document be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n                                                 December 1, 2009.\n     To: Senator Tom Coburn, Attention: Evan Feinberg.\n     From: Thomas L. Hungerford, Specialist in Public Finance, \n         Congressional Research Service.\n     Subject: Public and Private Expenditures for Health Care, \n         2007.\n\n       This memorandum responds to your request for information on \n     total national health expenditures for health care and the \n     proportion funded by the federal, state and local \n     governments. In particular you are interested in \n     incorporating tax expenditures into the estimate of the \n     proportion of national health expenditures coming from public \n     sources. It can be argued that some private health \n     expenditures should be attributed to the public sector \n     because of tax subsidies available for health care spending.\n       Table 1 reports the breakdown of national health \n     expenditures by source of funds. In 2007, national \n     expenditures amounted to $2.24 trillion, of which 53.8% came \n     from private sources such as private health insurance and \n     46.8% came from public (federal, state, and local government) \n     sources. This breakdown, however, does not take into \n     consideration the tax subsidies for private funding for \n     health care. For example, the exclusion of employer provided \n     health care provides a subsidy for private health insurance, \n     which could be counted as public funds rather than private \n     funds.\n       Incorporating tax expenditures into the breakdown of health \n     expenditures into public and private sources will change the \n     results that are reported in Table 1. The intuition behind \n     the analysis is fairly simple. For example, take a dollar an \n     employer pays for a premium for an employee's health \n     insurance. This dollar is part of the employee's \n     compensation, but it is not taxed like other income (at an \n     average federal, state, and local tax rate of 15%); it is \n     excluded from income for income tax purposes. In essence, the \n     employee receives a 15 cent government subsidy for this \n     dollar spent on health insurance--the government pays 15 \n     cents and the employee pays 85 cents. This suggests that some \n     funds that are classified as private in Table 1 could \n     arguably be classified as public funds.\n\n      TABLE 1--NATIONAL HEALTH EXPENDITURES BY FUNDING SOURCE, 2007\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                Amount\n                      Source of funds                         (billions)\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal National Expenditures................................     $2,241.2\nPrivate Funds..............................................      1,205.5\n    Out-of-pocket payments.................................        268.6\n    Private Health Insurance...............................        775.0\n    Other Private Funds....................................        162.0\nPublic Funds...............................................      1,035.7\n    Medicare...............................................        431.2\n    Medicaid (federal, state and local)....................        329.4\n    Other Federal..........................................        137.0\n    Other state and local..................................       138.1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nSource: Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Office of the\n  Actuary, National Health Statistics Group, National Health Expenditure\n  Data, table 3, available at http://www.cms.hhs.gov/\nNationalHealthExpendData/downloads/tables.pdf.\n\n       Table 2 reports the results of applying this reasoning to \n     total national health expenditures.

However, taxpayers are allowed to deduct \n     out-of-pocket medical expenditures exceeding 7.5% of adjusted \n     gross income on their federal and state tax forms. The Joint \n     Committee on Taxation estimates that the federal government \n     lost $8.7 billion in tax revenue in 2007 from this deduction. \n     Other tax expenditures for out-of-pocket expenses amount to \n     $0.3 billion. State and local income tax revenues are about \n     28% of federal income tax revenues; it is assumed that state \n     and local revenue losses from tax expenditures will also be \n     28% of federal revenue loss estimates. Consequently, it is \n     estimated that state and local governments lost $2.5 billion \n     from these tax expenditures. The total tax subsidy for out-\n     of-pocket health expenditures is $11.5 billion.\n       The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that federal \n     government forgoes $251.0 billion in income and payroll tax \n     revenue due to the exclusion of employer provided health \n     insurance and other health insurance deductions. State and \n     local government lose $41.9 billion in income tax revenue \n     because of these exclusions and deductions. Consequently, \n     $292.9 billion of the $775.0 billion for health insurance is \n     classified as coming from public funds. Other private funds \n     for health expenditures include charitable contributions to \n     hospitals and other providers. These charitable contributions \n     are deductible and reduce federal, state, and local tax \n     revenues by $6.3 billion. This analysis estimates that $310.7 \n     billion of health expenditures that CMS attributes to private \n     funds could be considered public funds.\n       The last row of Table 2 reports the revised breakdown of \n     national health care expenditures between private and public \n     sources. It is estimated that public funding sources account \n     for $1,346.4 billion--60% of national health expenditures can \n     be attributed to public sources.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Here is what it says. I asked them what percentage of \nhealth care today is run through the government. You might be \ninterested to know it is 60 percent. As the Finance chairman responded \non why we were fixing it, we are going to create 70 new government \nprograms in this bill--70 new government programs in this bill--and we \nare fixing the government programs we have now. And we wonder why \nhealth care costs are out of control? They are out of control because \nthe government is running 60 percent of it now, and there is no \ncompetition for that 60 percent.\n  Nobody is going to defend outlandish salaries, but it is interesting, \nwe are not going after the outlandish salaries of the companies that \nare going to spend $80 million to support this bill, the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. We are not going to go after the salaries of the people who \nrun the hospitals who, on average, make more than $1 million a year. We \nare not going to do any of those. Only the ones who say: Wait a minute. \nMaybe this is not such a good deal.\n  Mr. President, I commend to my colleagues a document entitled \n``Impact Of The Patient Protection And Affordable Care Act On Costs In \nThe Individual And Small-Employer Health Insurance Markets'' from \nOliver Wyman and Associates, because what you claim you want to do is \ngoing to create 11 million young people who are not going to have \ninsurance, and for those who remain, their insurance is going to cost \ntwice as much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for allowing me to \nrespond.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nGeorgia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the ranking member on the \nFinance Committee for allowing me to speak for a few minutes to simply \nrespond to some of the statements, just as Dr. Coburn has done, that \nwere made earlier.\n  My friend from Massachusetts, whose heart, I know, is in the right \nplace, talked about the AMA, as if it were the last word in the medical \narena, being in support of this bill.\n  Well, Dr. Coburn is a practicing physician, and he can speak to this \nmaybe even better than I can, but what we know is that the AMA \nrepresents 10 percent of the practicing physicians in America--10 \npercent. That means 90 percent of the docs in America do not belong to \nthis group that sent this letter in support of the Senate bill.\n  I speak to this with authority because my phones have been ringing \noff the hook since this debate started months ago--the calls coming in \nfrom docs around the State of Georgia, who are violently opposed to the \nSenate bill--as it was being discussed and as it came out of the \nclosed-door session that took place across the hall after the \nleadership in the Finance Committee, after the leadership in the HELP \nCommittee could not agree on the direction on which we want to go.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts said we are here scaring seniors. \nWell, I hope we are. Seniors ought to be scared. They ought to be \nscared to death of what is going to happen here because we are taking \nalmost $500 billion out of Medicare, a program that a bipartisan \nMedicare Commission has said is going broke. And the Senator recognized \nthis: It is going broke. We are taking $500 billion out of it. Whether \nyou agree or disagree that the cuts\n\n[[Page S12481]]\n\nin Medicare proposed by the Democrats are legitimate, we ought to be \ntaking that money and putting it back into Medicare to save that \nprogram for the long term.\n  The Senator from Tennessee asked the right question to the Senator \nfrom Montana, and he took 10 minutes responding to the question. And \nDr. Coburn is right, he did not answer the question. There is a good \nreason why he did not answer the question. Because there is no \nlegitimate answer to taking this $500 billion out of Medicare and \ncreating an entirely new entitlement program that in and of itself is \ndestined to go broke.\n  If seniors are not scared by what we are saying, simply go to your \ndoctor. Go to your doctor and ask your doctor about this. I know what \nhappens to patients, Medicare patients who go to physicians who are \ngenerally in the range of 45 years or younger. Those physicians are not \ntaking additional Medicare patients or any Medicaid patients because \nthey can't afford it. The reimbursement rates to the physicians are \nless than the cost of the services they render.\n\n  The Senator from Montana said: Well, we understand that, yes; there \nis $250 billion in reimbursements over the next 10 years that we need \nto take care of. And we are going to take care of. And I appreciate \nthat because we need to. But it is in the House bill, and the House \nbill is $1.2 trillion. It is not in this bill, other than the 1-year \nfix the Senator alluded to. That is the reason the House bill is $1.2 \ntrillion and this bill is about $800 billion. That is the sole \ndifference in the two, basically.\n  But we are coming back, and in addition to the $800-plus billion \nexpenditure in this bill, we still have a hole to be filled to try to \ntake care of these docs or there is going to be a wholesale refusal on \nthe part of the medical community to see Medicare patients. That should \nscare seniors. So I hope that message is getting out there.\n  I wish to close with one other response to my friend from \nMassachusetts who said the National Association for Home Care and \nHospice is the leading organization in America in dealing with this \nissue, and we ought to listen to them. Let me tell my colleagues what \nthey say about what is going on in my State.\n  I quote from a letter that has already been introduced dated December \n4 from the Georgia Association for Home Health Agencies. In this letter \nthe executive director says:\n\n       According to a study conducted by the National Association \n     for Home Care and Hospice, under Senator Reid's bill, 72 \n     percent of home health agencies in Georgia will have negative \n     margins by 2016 in the Senate bill and approximately 68 \n     percent of the 100 Medicare Certified home health agencies in \n     Georgia will go out of business and the patients they serve \n     will be rehospitalized or forced to seek alternative more \n     costly care.\n\n  Well, I don't know how it is in the other 49 States, but I want to \nsee our patients, our Medicare patients in Georgia, do what they want \nto do, which is stay at home for the most part and receive the good \nhome health care they are getting today which, frankly, allows them to \nlive a better quality of life and a longer life. It is pretty obvious--\n--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. From this letter that is not going to happen.\n  I yield back, and I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield to Senator Murkowski for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Thank you, Mr. President, and thank you to my \ncolleague from Iowa.\n  In this morning's Wall Street Journal there is an article--actually, \nan editorial--and it starts out: ``Another Day, Another Study,'' \nconfirming that Obamacare will increase the price of health insurance. \nIt goes on to talk about a Blue Cross study. It talks about CBO \nnumbers. But the reality is, we have numbers all over. I think we all \nrecall the quote from Mark Twain: You've got liars, damn liars, and \nstatisticians.\n  Well, I think we are caught up in that world now of dueling numbers. \nOur numbers say this is going to increase your premiums. The other \nside's numbers say it is going to decrease your premiums. So the real \nquestion is, Who is right and whose numbers do you look to?\n  Well, I think it is important, as so many of my colleagues have \nmentioned this morning, when we are talking about whether it is the \nhome health care statistics in a State they impact, to look to those \nStates and what they are saying the impact will be. So I have gone to \nour State's think tank, if you will. The Institute for Social and \nEconomic Research at the University of Alaska is the entity that does a \nlot of analysis, not only on health care policy and issues but other \neconomic issues. I have asked them, let's sort through some of these \nnumbers. Let's sort through some of the statements that have been made \nout there. I think it is important to share this morning some of the \nstatements coming out of ISER.\n  When we talk about the premiums Alaskans are going to face, instead \nof a statement, a very simple statement, that, well, your premiums are \ngoing to go down, what ISER is saying is, when we look to the CBO \nestimate of the increase in the average premium for the nongroup \nmarket, what we expect to see is about a 12-percent increase by 2016. \nFor single coverage, this is about $1,160 a year, and for family \ncoverage it is about $2,900 in 2016.\n  ISER is still conducting the analysis to determine the extent of the \nsubsidies that may be available for Alaskans that could, in fact, \nreduce those premiums. But I think it is important to make clear that \nwe are understanding what we are talking about when we make statements \nsuch as, well, this is going to increase or this is going to decrease. \nWe need to make sure we are looking at all of the numbers.\n  CBO has very clearly stated that the average premium per person for \nnew nongroup policies is going to be between 10 and 13 percent higher \nin 2016 than the average premium. So we have to say, well, what is the \ndifference between that statement and the statement the Democrats have \nmade saying that the premiums are going to decrease by 14 to 20 \npercent? We have to look behind the screen, behind the curtain.\n  Two of the factors, administrative efficiencies and new enrollment, \nwill make premiums go down, but these reductions are then overwhelmed \nby a 27- to 30-percent increase in premiums because of the coverage \nrequirements that are mandated within the bill. The Democratic analysis \nthat is out there omits this 27- to 30-percent increase, fundamentally \nflawing the analysis.\n  What are some of the other things ISER has taken a look at as it \nrelates to this bill that is before the Senate right now? They have \nstated that because Alaska is a high-cost State, it is highly likely \nhealth insurance plans in Alaska will become subject to the excise tax \non health insurance sooner than the U.S. average. The preliminary \nestimate is that roughly 50 percent of health plans in Alaska will be \nsubject to the tax by the year 2016 compared to only a 19-percent \naverage in the rest of the lower 48. They have also indicated that \nwhile the uninsured population will be reduced in Alaska, adding \napproximately 65,000 new enrollees to the market, their concern--and \nthis is a statement I think is very important--is that the newly \nenrolled Medicaid expansion, and through the new exchange, will create \na big surge in demand that could easily create what they call a \n``traffic jam'' in the health care system and send the Medicare \nbeneficiaries to the back of the line in Alaska due to Medicare's low \nreimbursement rate. This is exceptionally important for us to \nunderstand.\n  On today's front page of the Washington Post there is an article \nabout Texas----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. The only statement we need to remember from this \narticle is that even with insurance, you need somewhere to go.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I rise to tell my colleagues why I am going to vote \nagainst the Lincoln executive compensation amendment. This amendment \npicks out one set of executives in the entire health care arena and \nsingles out that one set of executives for limits on compensation. In \nthe entire health care\n\n[[Page S12482]]\n\nsector of the economy, this amendment suggests that only one group of \nexecutives warrants this sort of special treatment, and that happens to \nbe the executives of health insurance companies. This amendment then \ntakes that excess compensation that apparently Congress knows is the \nappropriate amount for compensation and devotes that excess money to \nthe Medicare trust fund.\n\n  Well, a very commonsense question in this town of nonsense is, why \nnot limit compensation for executives in other areas of health care? \nWhat about the executives of hospitals? Shouldn't their excess \ncompensation go to protect Medicare? Why not executives of nursing \nhomes then? Why not executives of medical device manufacturers? Why not \nlimit compensation on the people who run home health agencies? Why not \nlimit compensation for doctors? Why not limit compensation for \nexecutives at the drug companies?\n  Well, let's wait a second on that one. We know the answer to the one \nabout why not include drug companies. This amendment can't touch drug \ncompany executives because their industry cut a secret deal where they \nagreed to some things in this bill, and they are going to get a huge \npayoff in profits once this goes into effect, as long as they don't \nopen their big mouth and fight this legislation.\n  Of course, this all adds up because if you are watching TV at home, \nor even here on the Hill, big PhRMA is running ads all over the country \nin support of this 2,074-page Reid bill.\n  If the idea is for Congress to set the precedent of limiting \ncompensation to protect the Medicare trust fund, then shouldn't we \nbranch out even beyond the health care industry? We could get a lot of \ncompensation--or we could get a lot of income into the Medicare trust \nfund by limiting compensation beyond health care to say, for instance, \nexecutives of trade associations or union leaders or trial lawyers or \nbaseball players or movie stars. But, no; this amendment focuses on one \nspecific group of executives who weren't going to be bought off by this \nbill. So let's just call this amendment out for the brazen political \nstunt it is, and if we do that, vote it down.\n  I wish to remind everyone in closing that I asked the sponsor to \ninclude drug company executives in her amendment but was turned down.\n  I yield the floor and yield 5 minutes to Senator Brownback.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I wish to thank the ranking member \nfrom Iowa for his comments on the amendment.\n  I wish to speak on the Johanns motion and its effect on the State of \nKansas and the underlying bill in particular. Cuts to home health \nagencies of $42 billion have a huge impact in my State, and I wish to \nurge my colleagues to support the Johanns amendment and restore that \namount of money to the home health care agencies.\n  Years ago I did some work with the home health care agencies, and \nanybody who has been around them knows these groups don't operate on \nmuch of a profit margin. They are frequently not highly capitalized. \nThey are high on people and people skills. They take care of folks in \ntheir homes. They do a great job of it. They take care of people where \nthey want to be taken care of, which is in their homes and not in \nhospitals or extended stay facilities.\n  Home health care and hospice frequently work with people in some of \nthe most difficult times in their lives, when they are facing those \ndifficult, often final, illnesses and they want to do it at home. They \ndon't want to be in the hospital. They want to be at home with family \nand friends around comfortable surroundings. In this underlying base \nbill, home health care is cut $42 billion from the people who need it \nthe most and from agencies that need it the most and are in dire \nstraits.\n  I have a chart up here which shows the impact on my State, \nparticularly on home health care agencies. Roughly $240 million in cuts \nto home health care agencies in the State of Kansas will take place \nunder this base bill. In this base bill, 64 percent of the home health \nagencies in Kansas will go broke by 2016, 64 percent by 2016. So just \nat the point in time where you have a lot of uptake and need for home \nhealth care for some people who are aging at that point in time, you \nare going to cut and you are going to cut this much, $240 million in my \nState, 64 percent of them go broke, and for what?\n  Supposedly, it is to save a bunch of money, right? Well, on top of \nthis, the CMS Office of the Actuary recently pointed out that the \ndrastic cut to home health care will not produce savings to the \nMedicare Program. According to OACT, the savings from permanent annual \nproductivity adjustments are unrealistic.\n  Again, that just stands to reason; if you are going to force people \nout of their homes into a hospital for extended care because you are \ncutting home health care, you are not going to save money in that \nsystem. You are going to spend more money in that system. This is not \ngoing to work. It is going to hurt people overall, and it is going to \nbe at a point in their lives when they would rather be at home than in \nthe hospital.\n  I think these are cruel cuts. I think it is at a terrible time. That \nis just for home health care, that alone, and then with the hospice. I \nhave a letter from the Kansas Home Care Association that I wish to ask \nunanimous consent of the Presiding Officer to have printed in the \nRecord at the end of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. They say in this sentence, among other things:\n\n       This will cause an increase in patients seeking care in \n     more expensive institutions which will only cause more of a \n     drain on State and Federal budgets.\n       It is projected that over 58 percent of Kansas home health \n     agencies will operate at a negative margin in 2010. . . .\n\n  I noted to you the number that is going to go broke by 2016. This \nisn't a far-off prospect. This is even next year, under the current \nsetting. Then they are going to cut another $240 million from the \nKansas ones that will cause even more of them to have great difficulty \nand financial trouble at this point in time.\n  I ask my colleagues to revisit this issue. Vote for the Johanns \nmotion that supports home health care agencies. The Johanns motion is \nsimple. It says: Look, restore this piece. Don't take these moneys from \nhome health care agencies. For a number of us who represent a number of \nrural States, home health care is key. It can be expensive in a rural \nsetting. They need the resources to be able to meet the needs of the \nseniors we have.\n  On top of that, in the overall cuts that are taking place are key and \nmajor cuts to Medicare Advantage programs. Referring to the chart, \nthere will be a 63.7-percent cut to Medicare Advantage benefits that \nwill affect more than 1 in 10 Kansas Medicare beneficiaries. A $1.5 \nbillion cut to Kansas hospitals is taking place and an 11.8-percent cut \nin hospice payments. Home health care agencies often do hospice care as \nwell. So this is a double cut for them.\n  Again, this is at a point in time in life where it is the most \ndifficult. There is $124 million in cuts of skilled nursing facilities \nas well. This will force more people into that setting.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                 Kansas Home Care Association,\n\n                                     Topeka, KS, December 4, 2009.\n     Hon. Pat Roberts,\n     Senator from Kansas.\n       Dear Senator Roberts: On behalf of the Home Health Care and \n     Hospice agencies of Kansas, we would like to support the \n     Republican Senators motions to commit back to the Senate \n     Finance Committee the HCR bill with changes that do not \n     include cuts in payments to both home health and hospice \n     agencies.\n       This bill includes cuts to home health agencies that total \n     $42.1 billion and cuts to hospice agencies of $7.7 billion. \n     In Kansas a number of our member agencies service both home \n     care patients and hospice patients, so they would be hit \n     twice with monstrous cuts.\n       It is projected that over 58 percent of Kansas home health \n     agencies will operate at a negative margin in 2010 and that \n     number increases significantly in years to follow. Hospice \n     agencies have already sustained cuts that have limited access \n     to the Hospice benefit, particularly in rural areas, which of \n     course is much of Kansas.\n       Last week Governor Mark Parkinson announced a 10 percent \n     cut to Medicaid providers in order to balance the state \n     budget. Agencies that provide services to Medicaid clients \n     cannot sustain such drastic cuts and access will be severely \n     limited. This will cause an increase in patients seeking care \n     in more expensive institutions which will only cause more of \n     a drain on state and federal budgets.\n\n[[Page S12483]]\n\n       On behalf of the Kansas Home Care Association members, we \n     applaud your efforts to block cuts to home health care and \n     hospice benefits that the citizens of Kansas and the United \n     States need and deserve.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                       Jane Kelly,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nTexas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I want to talk about the breathtaking \naudacity of this bill, in a takeover of yet another important sector of \nour economy, at a time when our economy is in recession--and the \nPresident was wondering at his job summit just on Thursday, how come \nthe private sector seems to be on the sidelines when they should be \nback in the game creating jobs. This bill is exactly one of the reasons \nfor that outcome.\n  This bill is chock-full of avenues that lead to more and more \nWashington control over our health care system and our economy. The \namendment of the Senator from Arkansas would give Washington control \nover how much money health care executives would make. But we know as a \npractical matter, in terms of limiting executive compensation, section \n162(m) has been a disaster.\n  Actually, in the past, when Congress has attempted to do this, it has \nexacerbated the problem by encouraging companies to come up with \ndifferent ways of compensating their executives that would not be \nsubject to those limitations. This is ineffective in accomplishing the \ngoal the Senator claims she wants.\n  This amendment also adds to the complexity--it adds mud to the \nalready muddy waters--by imposing complex limitations on just one \nindustry, as has been described.\n  I listened this morning--amazed--when there were offers to include \nother organizations such as AARP, which has reaped hundreds of billions \nof dollars of income from insurance sales, and executives at Walmart in \nthe Senator's home State, who are also involved in the health care \nindustry. Of course, those were rejected. Our favorite game around here \nis to try to demonize certain parts of the private sector and, of \ncourse, if the private sector is not involved in creating jobs, all \nthat leaves is the government.\n  In health care, all that will do--once there is no private health \ninsurance available because of draconian mandates, taxes, and \nlimitations on compensation--is eventually leave the government as a \nsingle-payer provider of health care in this country. I suspect that \nmay be the ultimate goal.\n  We already know the Reid bill will force millions of seniors to \npurchase so-called Medicare gap products which, by coincidence, are \nsold by AARP. We have heard Senators come to the floor and quote AARP \nas if it was holy writ, and somehow they represent all seniors. We know \nthey have a blatant conflict of interest in supporting this bill, \nparticularly as to stripping out Medicare Advantage benefits so they \ncan sell more of our seniors Medigap coverage, which Medicare Advantage \neliminates the need for.\n  We also know this bill provides more power to Washington and is \ntaking it away from individuals in other ways by limiting individuals \nto only four different options for what kinds of health coverage they \ncan get. There is no room for innovation or flexibility. We know, \nultimately, that drives up the cost for people who have insurance now--\ntheir health insurance premiums.\n  We ought at least be as good to the American people as we are to \nourselves as Members of Congress. We have almost 300 different health \ncare plan options under the Federal employees health care benefits. Why \nshould the American people accept less choices when it comes to their \nhealth care than Members of Congress? They should not.\n  These health insurance market reforms are designed to give Washington \nmore power. More and more studies have said new controls by Washington \nwill do nothing but drive up the cost of insurance. The Congressional \nBudget Office said they will go up by $2,100 for American families. A \nnew study came out yesterday saying that, in Texas, premiums would go \nup for 61 percent of individuals purchasing their insurance in the \nindividual market.\n  The President of the United States said his goal for health care \nreform was to lower the cost of health insurance for the average \nAmerican family by $2,500. By that test, this bill fails to deliver on \nthe President's promise.\n  Then there is, of course, the expansion of other government programs \nthat, while they promise coverage, limit access to care by the way they \nare structured. This bill purports to give 94 percent of the American \npeople health care coverage but does so by putting 15 million more \nAmericans on the Medicaid Program. Of the 31 million newly insured \nunder the Reid bill, the only choice of 15 million would be Medicaid. \nOf course, we know Medicaid--for example, in Dallas, TX, only 38 \npercent of doctors will see a new Medicaid patient because \nreimbursement rates are so low that a doctor cannot see Medicaid \npatients and leave his or her door open to see other patients. We, in \nessence, condemn low-income persons to a health care gulag, where they \nare offered coverage but have no access to health care. For 60 million \nAmericans, Medicaid would be their only choice.\n  The $120 billion cuts to Medicare Advantage that we talked about \nearlier gives more power to Washington and takes it away from the \nindividual. By cutting the private part of Medicare under Medicare \nAdvantage, it would result in seniors having no choice but Medicare fee \nfor service. Medicare fee for service compensates doctors at about 80 \npercent of what private insurance does. That is why, in Texas, 42 \npercent of the doctors will not see a new Medicare patient under the \nMedicare fee-for-service payment formula. Frankly, it pays so low that \nthey cannot afford to see new Medicare patients.\n  That means, again, this fraud is perpetrated on the American people--\nour seniors--saying we are going to keep our promise to them by \nproviding coverage by effectively denying access to care because the \nreimbursement rates are so low.\n  This bill gives the government more power over people, and it takes \nit away from individuals in a number of other ways. While advocates \ndescribe it as a way to create competition and choice, the reality is \nit would drive out competition from the market and ultimately become \nthe only choice for millions of American people. The so-called public \noption, which sounds relatively innocuous until people realize the \neffect of that, and the pay-or-play mandate on small businesses, which \nkills jobs, creates a rational decisionmaking process, and employers \nthat will drop employees from the current private coverage, only to be \nleft on a government-run plan, the so-called government option, which \nwill end up, in the end, being anything but optional--denying power to \nthe individual to make their own decisions in consultation with their \ndoctor and family, and giving Washington more power over their lives.\n\n  There are good reasons the vast majority of Americans don't trust \nWashington with running our health care system--an issue that so \nintimately affects all 300 million of us in America. We know Washington \nhas a lousy record at managing spending. We have a $12 trillion \nnational debt and, before the end of this month, the administration and \nthe majority leader will come to Members of Congress and say: Would you \nplease lift the statutory debt limit because we maxed out our credit \ncard and we need to lift the statutory debt limit.\n  Our entitlement programs are out of control, with Medicare running an \nunfunded liability of $38 trillion. The majority wants to take $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from Medicare and use it not to fix Medicare but to create a \nnew entitlement program. Washington running health care means the \npersonal health care decisions will be impacted by lobbyists and \nspecial interests rather than the interests of the American people. \nThat is the reason the insurance industry has been supportive of health \ncare up until now. There is $450 billion in tax dollars that will flow \ndirectly to the insurance industry under this bill in the form of tax \ncredits.\n  The hospital associations cut a deal so they would not be subject to \nthe axe of the so-called ``independent'' Medicare advisory board.\n  Everyone has heard about the deal that the pharmaceutical industry \ncut,\n\n[[Page S12484]]\n\nin which it would result in them running ads supporting Members of \nCongress who support this bill because they want to protect their \nspecial deal cut behind closed doors. We heard Senator McCain talk \nabout the special deal cut in this bill for Medicare Advantage \nbeneficiaries in Florida--another special political deal in order to \nsecure a vote to support this bad deal--but it left out seniors in \nPennsylvania and California.\n  I believe if there is any special deal to be cut, every senior who is \na beneficiary under Medicare Advantage ought to have the same deal, not \nany more of these behind-closed-doors special deals in order to secure \nvotes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. CORNYN. There is just one job-killing policy after another in \nthis bill, and this is the latest.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield the remaining time to the \nSenator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, you know as well as I that the \nPresident promised the American seniors that if they liked the care \nthey had, they could keep it. Nothing could be further from the truth.\n  Looking through this bill we are debating, there is an incredible \namount of cuts to Medicare, which is a program seniors rely upon for \ntheir health care: $120 billion of cuts to Medicare Advantage. One in \nfour people in America who depend on Medicare for their health care--11 \nmillion Americans--are on Medicare Advantage. The reason they chose it \nis because it is an advantage. It helps with coordinated care and \npreventive care. Having practiced medicine for 25 years, I know the \npeople at home get it. That is why they chose that program. It also \ncuts $135 billion from hospitals and $115 billion from nursing homes.\n  I want to focus a little bit on the $42 billion cut from our home \nhealth agencies. I don't know how anybody on the other side of the \naisle can say with a straight face that the legislation before us \ndoesn't cut Medicare and doesn't hurt our seniors because it does.\n  I will tell you, having taken care of people in hospitals, the \nservices that are provided through home health care is what helps get \npeople out of the hospital sooner, gets them home faster, gets them out \nof nursing homes, and helps keep down their costs. These services \ninclude skilled nursing care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, \nspeech and language therapy, and medical social services.\n  I have a letter from the director of home health services of Wyoming, \nthe Home Health Care Alliance.\n  I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 December 5, 2009.\n     Senator Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \n         Pensions, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Over the past ten years the Medicare \n     home health benefit has taken a larger hit in spending \n     reductions than any other benefit. As home health has become \n     an increasingly important part of our health care system with \n     highly skilled and often technically complex services that \n     enable millions of senior citizens and disabled Americans to \n     avoid being hospitalized or admitted to nursing homes, these \n     home health services save Medicare millions of dollars each \n     year.\n       I believe that further reduction in home health payments \n     would place the quality and availability of home health \n     services at risk. I urge you to oppose the cut in Medicare \n     dollars for home health agencies through out our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                  Mari Irelan,\n\n                                                        President,\n                             Home Health Care Alliance of Wyoming.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. This letter talks about the devastating impact of the \ncuts proposed in this bill we are considering today. There are 43 home \nhealth agencies in Wyoming and a number of them are in communities--the \noccupant of the chair is from a State where there are a lot of rural \nareas. A number of our agencies are in communities that don't even have \nhospitals. So it helps people stay in their homes, in their home \ncommunities, stay out of the hospital, out of the nursing home, and it \ngives them the dignity and the opportunity and the independence they \nneed to stay at home.\n  Yet this bill, according to the folks in Wyoming and the folks \nnationally, is going to make it that much harder for our seniors to \nstay at home.\n  Taking $42 billion from home health care, raiding that program to \nstart another program, to spend it on a new government program is going \nto absolutely impact the ability of home health care providers in this \ncountry to offer services. These nurses, therapists, and home care \naides all drive hundreds of miles on a daily basis in Wyoming, going \nfrom ranch to farm, to help care for people and to help them stay at \nhome. It is all around the country.\n  There is a front-page story in the New York Times today, a wonderful \nstory of a delightful 94-year-old lady, Bertha Milliard. She lives in \nMaine. There is a picture of her with her nurse during a home health \ncare visit. Bertha is very worried that they are going to lose this \nservice, which is the service that keeps her out of the hospital.\n  It just seems, as we look at this, that there is no way home health \ncare agencies around the country are going to be able to sustain these \nkinds of cuts and continue to remain available to the Medicare patients \nwho depend on home health care.\n  Even the National Association for Home Care & Hospice said that in a \nfew short years, Medicare will be paying home health agencies less than \nit costs to even provide the services. We are talking about less than \nthe gas in the cars and the salaries of the folks who drive around. We \nare not talking about profit. We are talking just about keeping doors \nopen.\n  As I think about the patients in Wyoming whom I have taken care of \nover the years who have benefited from home health services, who have \nbeen able to receive care from nurses, therapists, home care aides and \nallow them to stay at home, to be more independent--not totally \nindependent but more independent--I think anything that cuts into this \nis not good for America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that we continue \nwith debate, and debate only, as under the previous order, for an \nadditional hour, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes \neach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Michigan, \nMs. Stabenow, 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nMontana, who has been here morning, noon, and night counteracting \nfalsehoods and scare tactics on the floor and putting forward what is \nreally in this legislation that is so important to millions of people \naround the country. Everyone benefits, in one way or the other, by \neither costs coming down or by direct access to more affordable \ninsurance. I thank our distinguished leader from Montana.\n  We have talked so much about Medicare and Medicare Advantage, but I \ndo have to take a moment to respond to what has been said over and over \non the floor. It is very difficult for me--and I know for others around \nthe country--to listen to our friends from the other side of the aisle \nlamenting that they want to protect Medicare, when it was a Democratic \nCongress and a Democratic President who created Medicare, over the same \nobjections, by the way. You can take a look at the objections in 1965, \nthe debate: The world was going to come to an end if, in fact, we \npassed Medicare. Of course, Medicare has become a great American \nsuccess story for tens of millions of seniors and people with \ndisabilities.\n  Our friends now talk about how they are going to protect Medicare, at \nthe same time that just a couple weeks ago, on the House side, 80 \npercent of Republicans voted to do away with Medicare as we know it \ntoday and make it a voucher system and put insurance companies back in \ncontrol.\n  One of the frustrations for me is to hear the unfortunate negative \ncomments that have been made about a very distinguished organization \nthat represents senior citizens across the\n\n[[Page S12485]]\n\ncountry, the American Association of Retired Persons, that I might add, \nwhen we were doing the prescription drug bill, my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle used in every single speech because they were \nsupporting them at that time. Now they are supporting our position. \nThey disagree with them. They have said:\n\n       Most importantly, the legislation does not reduce any \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits.\n\n  Now we are hearing how horrible they are, which I think is a real \ndisservice to a very important national organization. I think it is \nimportant, in the name of truth and in the name of fairness, to look at \nquotes that have been made about AARP that are different from what we \nhave heard on the floor today and since this debate began.\n  Our distinguished colleague from Arizona, who sponsored an amendment \nrelated to Medicare Advantage and has been on the floor numerous times, \nincluding today, disparaging AARP, said at an AARP convention:\n\n       I say God bless AARP--\n\n  This is the senior Senator from Arizona.\n\n       I say God bless AARP for everything they are doing, not \n     only for the present generations of Americans, but for future \n     generations. That's your duty, that's your strength, and \n     that's why I love to see you at every town hall meeting.\n\n  The unfortunate thing is now our colleagues on the other side of the \naisle don't want to see AARP at every townhall meeting because they are \nnot saying what they want them to say.\n  I also have to express concern that we had 6 years of our colleagues \nin full control of the Federal Government--the Presidency, House, and \nSenate--and we did not get legislation to bring down health care costs \nor legislation to make sure every American, small business, and family \ncould afford insurance as we are doing today. So it is a little \ndifficult, even though we have come together on other issues on health \ncare, on this particular one it is difficult now to hear all the \ncriticisms that are flying and all the things we should be doing, but \nthey were not brought forward a number of years ago, when they actually \nwere in charge and could have done something about it. That is \nconcerning to me.\n  This legislation is about saving lives, it is about saving money, and \nit is about saving Medicare.\n  I wish to share one story because not too long ago--it seems like a \nlong time since we have been working so diligently this week--it was \njust Thanksgiving, and families all across America came together to \nreminisce around the dinner table, to watch football, and share a \nfamily meal. Even in tough times we stop, reflect, and give thanks for \nour many blessings. I know that is true for my family, and I am sure \nall our families.\n  This year, there were 45,000 empty place settings at tables across \nthe country for men and women whose lives were cut short because they \ndid not have health insurance. I wish to share one story.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask for an additional minute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. One of those place settings was for a young man named \nDr. Joe Hines, from Okemos, MI. He was a recent graduate of dental \nschool. He had just completed his residency and had lined up a job in \nprivate practice in Detroit. He did not have health insurance. He \nbecame ill. He called his mom who urged him to go to a doctor, but he \ndid not have insurance. He waited too long, figuring it would pass and \nit did not pass. It got worse. He died at age 27.\n  This legislation is about Joe Hines. It is about his family. It is \nabout every one of the 45,000 families who lost loved ones this year. \nIt is about the 14,000 people who got up this morning--today--on a \nSaturday, with insurance and will go to bed without it. Saving lives, \nsaving money, saving Medicare, that is what we are fighting to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield to the Senator from Alabama 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank Senator Grassley, and I \nappreciate his leadership on this very important issue.\n  As I have reviewed the legislation and looked at the analysis, the \nfinancial accounting that has gone into it, I have been astounded, \nbeyond my ability to express it, by the errors and fictitious promises \nthat have been made by the bill's supporters.\n  My colleagues and people listening to or reading these words may \nthink what I am saying cannot be true, that this is an exaggeration or \nhas absolutely another side to the issue. But the statements I am \nmaking, I believe, are accurate, and if I am in error, I am glad to \nstand corrected.\n  The numbers are so huge they cannot, in reality, be hidden. The \nnumbers simply do not add up. President Obama had a grand concept in \nhis mind. He was following, I think, a great chimera of reform that he \nbelieved he could accomplish. He was able to express it on the campaign \ntrail with cadence, passion, and skill. People liked those promises. As \nso often is the case with many of us, he came to believe his own \nrhetoric, his own words, and those words took on a reality of their \nown.\n  But once one takes office, words cease to be reality. Facts then \ndominate. Promises easily made in the Iowa spring or the New Hampshire \nwinter, if not carefully constructed when made, become unreachable when \na candidate takes office. Realities, I have to say, have risen to \ndefeat his vision. They are not compatible.\n  One, the basic promises he has made financially under this bill \ncannot be met. The numbers do not add up. They do not work.\n  Two, the present debt crisis we are in, a crisis that will lead to \ndoubling of the national debt in 5 years, the debt accumulated from the \nfounding of the Republic, will double in 5 years and triple in 10, \naccording to our own Congressional Budget Office. That does not include \nany money spent on this legislation because it is not current law. It \nwill only make it worse. The financial crisis we are facing makes it \neven more important that we act with care and caution before we move \nforward.\n  I also note that many people today are happy with the quality of the \nhealth care they receive. They are nurses, they are doctors, the \nquality of the diagnostic equipment, the hospitals they have to \nutilize. They do not have any desire, whatsoever, for the Federal \nGovernment to take that over.\n  What they have been concerned about--and rightly so--are the rising \ncosts. But the promises in this bill to reduce costs for the average \nAmerican have not been achieved. Costs will continue to go up for \naverage Americans.\n  There are many flaws, many fictions in the legislation. Its promises \nsound good, but reality, in fact, is interfering. I will point out a \nnumber of promises that have been made and the facts that dispute \nthose. I will then point out what I think are the real facts. I will \nask and evaluate this bill on how well it meets the promises that have \nbeen made for it. From this analysis, it becomes clear to me that it is \nan offer we can and an offer we must refuse.\n  Fiction No. 1: The allegation has been made and statements have been \nmade from the beginning that the bill would cost $848 billion.\n  The facts are, when the new programs created by this bill are fully \nimplemented, the bill will cost $2.5 trillion. I think the sponsors of \nthe bill acknowledge that.\n  No. 1, is the cost $848 billion as promised? The answer is, no, it is \nmuch more than that. In fact, $2.5 trillion--2,500 billion dollars.\n  How can we be that far apart? The bill's new benefits programs, the \nexpenditures the bill calls for are not phased in until 2014, the fifth \nyear of the 2010-2019 period, during which the cost of this bill is \nscored by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  For example, the insurance subsidies funded by the Federal Government \ndo not begin until 2014. Also, according to the bill, Medicaid will be \nexpanded up to 133 percent of Federal poverty level, but that does not \nhappen until 2014. It is disingenuous at best--just not accurate, some \nwould say dishonest--for promoters of this legislation to claim the \ncosts of the bill are only $848 billion, when they don't begin to pay \nout the new benefits in the 10-year period until 5 years from now. So \nshouldn't\n\n[[Page S12486]]\n\nyou score the bill from the time the benefits start and then for 10 \nyears to get a 10-year honest score of the legislation?\n  The Reid bill that is on the floor today, that was written basically \nin secret and added to this unrelated piece of legislation to get it to \nthe floor, this piece of legislation begins to collect fees from \ninsurers, medical device companies, and others--they are collecting \nmoney in increased fees and taxes--as soon as 2010. But when the true \n10-year score, when the expenditures start from 2014 to 2023--the first \n10 years of real implementation of the bill--that is when the cost of \nthe program is $2.5 trillion. I don't think that is disputable in any \nsignificant way. Maybe a little here or there. I am just explaining \nwhat the facts are.\n\n  Overall, costs rise too. They do not go down. The Congressional \nBudget Office states that, ``Under the legislation, Federal Government \noutlays for health care would increase during the 2010-2019 period, as \nwould the Federal budgetary commitment to health care.'' So the Federal \nGovernment spending on health care, far from going down, is increased \nunder this legislation.\n  We currently spend one-sixth of our total gross domestic product--\none-sixth of the productivity of our economy--on health care. How much \nmore can we afford to pay? And wasn't it the original intent of the \nbill to rein in health care spending to reduce the percentage of GDP \ngoing to health care? Wasn't that one of the concerns our business \ncommunity has had--that too much of America's wealth is going to health \ncare? They would like to see something that would reduce that.\n  I suppose the fact that it utterly fails in that regard and, in fact, \nincreases the national health care expenditures from 17 percent of GDP \nnow--more than any other country--to 21 percent is the reason groups \nsuch as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce have said this bill must be \ndefeated and have aggressively opposed it. They do not always get \nengaged in these issues, but on this question they are engaged, and \nthey have said it will not do and not meet the concerns President Obama \nreflected upon. He talked about the need to reduce the percentage of \nGDP on health care, but it is going up under this legislation, \naccording to the scoring of the CBO.\n  One more question. If the benefits don't start until after 5 years \nfrom today, why is it so important to pass this monstrous bill today? \nWhy can't we slow down a little bit? Why can't we do exactly as we are \nasking and go step by step and find out the things we know can work and \ndo those things--particularly those things we can do now--that don't \ncost money but can actually help increase the quality of health care \nand maybe even bring costs down? Why don't we do those things?\n  Fiction No. 2: The President said in his State of the Union Address \nto the Congress, the joint session of Congress, that not one dime would \nbe added to the Nation's surging debt.\n  Now, is that true or not? If it is not true, then I think people--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the opportunity to speak. \nI will talk about the other points as the time avails itself and we \nhave the time to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nRockefeller be added as cosponsor to the Lincoln amendment, No. 2905.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, may I ask how much time remains on each \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 19 minutes 40 seconds \nremaining; the majority has 23\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chairman.\n  Madam President, the Senator from Alabama has just said to the \nSenate: Slow down; you are going too fast on health care reform here.\n  Today, across America, 14,000 Americans will lose their health \ninsurance. Tomorrow, 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance. \nMonday, the same, and every day of the week.\n  Are we going too fast? The first time this issue came before us was \nover 100 years ago. Theodore Roosevelt, a Republican, said: We need to \ntalk about health care for all Americans. It was a cause that was \nrepeated by Franklin Roosevelt, certainly by Harry Truman and Lyndon \nJohnson. For 100 years now, there have always been voices in the Senate \nwho have said: Slow down, you are going too fast.\n  This year, 45,000 Americans will die because they do not have health \ninsurance. We are the only civilized country in the world--the only \nWestern industrialized, developed country in the world--where a person \ncan die because they do not have health insurance. That is a fact of \nlife.\n  Slow down, they say on the other side of the aisle; you are going too \nfast. Well, we are here on a Saturday. It is a rare occurrence for the \nSenate to meet on Saturday, but I am glad we are here. If there were \never a time we should be here, it is right now. And we are here to \ndiscuss this bill--a 2,000-page bill. You know what went into this \nbill? Two committees: the Senate Finance Committee, under the \nleadership of the Senate Finance Committee chairman, Max Baucus of \nMontana, and the HELP Committee, now chaired by Senator Dodd of \nConnecticut. They spent days and weeks preparing this bill. Why did it \ntake that long? Because health care represents $1 out of every $6 spent \nin America--one-sixth of our economy. It is that big a deal. And we \nproduced this bill, this 2,075-page bill, after the considered effort \nof Democrats and Republicans writing it over the course of 1 year. Yet \nthe other side says: Slow down.\n  You know what, the American people ought to ask our Republican \nfriends: Where is your bill? Why haven't you prepared a bill? You have \nhad a year to do it. You knew this was coming. I know you have many \nideas because we have heard them in speeches, we have seen them in \ncharts, and we have seen them in press releases. But we don't see a \nbill. Nothing. It leads you to two conclusions--one of two. This is too \nhard to do, so they didn't do it, too difficult to write a bill, so \nthey didn't do it, or they really don't believe we need to change the \ncurrent system. Well, they are wrong.\n  Today, health protection for Americans is not affordable. The cost of \nhealth insurance is going up so fast--faster than wages, faster than \nbusinesses can keep up with it--and people are being tossed aside, one \nafter the other. Fourteen thousand Americans a day are losing health \ninsurance because they lost their job or the business they work for \nsays: We just can't pay the premiums anymore. That is the reality.\n  This bill makes health insurance more affordable, No. 1 and, No. 2, \nthis bill, at the end of the day, means that 94 percent of the people \nliving in America will have health insurance. We have never in our \nhistory ever reached that level of protection--94 percent. I wish it \nwere 100 percent, but it is 94 percent. Have the Republicans produced a \nbill that adds health insurance protection for anyone in America? No. \nNothing.\n  There is something else this bill does, and it took a lot of hard \nwork to achieve it. This bill not only tackles health reform, but it \nreduces our deficit, and we should. This is a debt our kids are \ncarrying. So Senator Baucus and the Finance Committee worked with \nSenator Reid of Nevada. This bill, by the Congressional Budget Office \nestimates, will reduce the deficit by $130 billion in the first 10 \nyears, $650 billion in the next 10. How does it do that? Well, if the \ncost of health care goes down, the cost of government goes down for the \nsame health care--real savings. Have the Republicans, who stand here \nday after day saying we have to do something about the deficit, \nproduced a health care reform bill that reduces it? No. Nothing. They \nhave nothing to bring to us.\n  Let me talk about one other aspect of this bill that is critically \nimportant. This bill gives to the American families and consumers, for \nthe first time in a long time, a fighting chance against the health \ninsurance companies. Do you know what they do to you? Do you know what \nhappens when you get sick? You not only have to battle your illness, \nyou have to battle\n\n[[Page S12487]]\n\nyour insurance company. Your doctor says you need this prescription, \nyour doctor says you need this surgery, and then the doctor calls some \nclerk in some office in the middle of nowhere who says: Not covered. We \nare not paying for it. And do you know what happens next? The battle \nrages. It isn't just you against the disease; it is you against your \ninsurance company. Do you know what they do? They turn you down. They \nsay: We looked at your application for insurance, and you forgot to \nmention a preexisting condition, such as acne, when you were a \nteenager. I am not making that up. You didn't take into consideration \nthat there is a limit on how much we will pay, and when you get really \nsick, we just stop paying. You didn't realize that you thought your \nchild was covered by your family health insurance company, but your \nyoung son just reached the age of 24 and he is not covered anymore. He \nis on his own.\n  Well, we take care of every one of those things in this bill. We give \nfamilies, for the first time in history, a fighting chance to take on \nthese insurance companies--real reform. I have yet to hear the first \nRepublican come to the floor and endorse that concept. Why? Because the \nhealth insurance companies hate it. This is how they make money.\n  Did you see what Aetna just announced? Aetna is one of the biggest \nhealth insurers. Their CEO makes a very modest $24 million a year in \nsalary--$24 million. They had their most profitable quarter ever, and \nthey announced they need more. So in order to add to their profits next \nyear and add to the payments to their CEO and their shareholders, they \nare going to take 650,000 people out of coverage at Aetna. They are \ngoing to drop the people they think may just get sick someday. So they \ntry to cherry-pick the healthiest people to keep their profits high. \nWhat is going to happen to those 650,000 people? Do you think they are \ngoing to join in the chorus from the other side that says slow down \nwhen it comes to health insurance for everybody in this country? Of \ncourse not.\n  Senator Lincoln has an amendment that challenges the CEOs of these \nhealth insurance companies and says: Enough is enough. We will let you \ndeduct from your taxes, we will give you a subsidy for $400,000 in \nincome for a CEO of a health insurance company--that is how much the \nPresident gets paid, incidentally--but beyond that, we will not let you \ndeduct it. We won't subsidize these obscene bonuses and payments to the \nhealth insurance executives. That is part of this as well.\n  I also think it is great to hear our colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle with their newfound belief in Medicare. They come before us \nand say: You know, we are standing here to fight for Medicare. That is \nwhat this battle is really all about. Historically, that party has not \nstood to fight for Medicare; they have stood to fight Medicare. They \nopposed it when it was created, they have tried to privatize it, and \nthey have basically ridiculed it as a government health insurance \nprogram. But for 45 million Americans, it is a lifeline to insurance \nwhen they retire so that their savings don't melt away and disappear \nbecause of high health care bills.\n  Most of our colleagues have ignored a vote they just cast 2 days ago. \nOne of the most important votes we have had on the floor--in addition \nto Senator Mikulski's amendment which helped the women of America get \npreventive health services--was the amendment of Senator Michael Bennet \nof Colorado. He offered an amendment that basically said any of the \nsavings that come forward out of this Medicare change in this bill have \nto be put into giving sound financial footing to Medicare, more \nservices for the elderly, and making certain we protect the services \nthat are already guaranteed. That passed 100 to 0. My friends on the \nother side of the aisle know that. They all voted for it.\n  So we are protecting Medicare. We are going to put it on sound \nfinancial footing. And for the 45 million people currently receiving it \nand those who look forward to it in the future, this bill will make \nMedicare stronger.\n  Slow down? No, we are not slowing down. This time, we are going to \npass health care reform. This time, we are going to make America a \nhealthier country with quality, affordable health care for everybody.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield myself such time as I might \nconsume on this side.\n  I listened to the distinguished majority whip. I don't know how many \ntimes we on this side have to tell him that if they want to read \nRepublican bills here is an opportunity to come and read them. They do \nexist and they have existed for a long time, going back to some of \ntheir entries into the Senate in the spring.\n  Another thing I heard was that Republicans have no ideas, taking on \nthe insurance companies. I would refer him to the Coburn-Burr bill that \ndoes away with the discrimination, that insurance companies cannot deny \nhealth insurance because of preexisting conditions.\n  I heard him say we are newfound supporters of Medicare. Let me \nsuggest to him that when we learned from the complaints of his party 4 \nyears ago, when they were berating the fact that we wanted to take $10 \nbillion out of Medicare and how that was ruining Medicare--we are faced \nnow with $464 billion out of Medicare and we think they have talked out \nof both sides of their mouth, in the sense that 4 years ago, if \nMedicare would be hurt if $10 billion were taken out, surely if $464 \nbillion were taken out, it is hurting Medicare.\n  I rise not to take on the Senate majority whip at this point but I \nrise because we keep hearing from the other side about how premiums are \ngoing to go down. I referred in previous remarks in this past week to a \nletter sent to Senator Bayh that provides a very comprehensive analysis \nof what health insurance premiums will look like as a result of this \nReid bill now before us.\n  That reminds me of one other thing the Senate majority whip said, \nthat we want to delay action on this bill. What we want to have is 99 \nSenators have the time to consider what is in this 2,074-page bill, \nwhen you have to remember that in the secrecy of the Senate leader's \noffice, Senator Reid's office, from October 2 until about the Saturday \nbefore Thanksgiving, it took that long in secrecy to put two bills \ntogether out of two separate committees. That is one Senator putting \ntogether the 2,074-page bill we have before us. Don't you think that 99 \nother Senators ought to have at least that same period of time to \nconsider what is in this bill? I think so.\n  Anyway, getting back to the increase in premiums and Senator Bayh's \nletter from the Congressional Budget Office saying that premiums are \ngoing to go up, I wonder if anyone has actually read that letter. I \nhear a lot of people saying this letter proves that premiums would go \ndown under the Reid bill, even though that is not what that letter \nsays. So I am here to tell people what the letter says. The letter \nmakes it very clear that premiums will increase on average 10 to 13 \npercent for people buying coverage in the individual market. I think \nyou saw a specific figure given by the Senator from Texas, that in his \nState for a large percentage of the individual market premiums would go \nup, just for people in the State of Texas.\n  I have a chart here in case you missed what this letter actually \nsays. The people who keep saying premiums are going to go down \nconveniently forget to mention this 10 to 13-percent increase that is \ngoing to happen for the individual market. No, they would prefer to \ntalk about 57 percent of Americans in the individual market who are \ngoing to get subsidies. Yes, it is true. The Government is spending \n$500 billion of hard-earned taxpayers' dollars in addition to the cuts \nthey are having in home health care that is a pending amendment before \nthe Senate. These cuts and these tax increases cover up the fact that \nthis bill drives up premiums faster than current law.\n  I repeat, premiums will go up faster under this bill. Supporters of \nthis bill are covering up this increase in costs by then handing out \nthese subsidies. But if you are 1 of the 14 million people who does not \nget a subsidy--well, what? You are out of luck. You are stuck with the \nfact that this is 10 to 13 percent more expensive and, coupled with it, \nan unprecedented new Federal law that mandates that you buy and \npurchase insurance.\n  Some may say this is the individual market, it only accounts for a \nsmall\n\n[[Page S12488]]\n\nportion of the total market. Again, if you are comfortable, as the \nother side seems to be, with 14 million people paying more under this \nbill than they would under current law.\n  I wish to also have you look at the employer-based market. The \nCongressional Budget Office analysis says this bill maintains the \nstatus quo in the small group and large group insurance market. Is this \nsomething we ought to be celebrating, maintaining the status quo? Are \nexpectations so low at this point that Democrats are celebrating that \nthis bill will increase premiums for some 14 million people and \nmaintain the status quo for everybody else?\n  I am being generous in using the phrase status quo, because this bill \nactually makes things worse for millions of people. This bill is so bad \nthat Democrats are trying to convince the American people that this is \nmore of the same when even that is not the case.\n  What happened to bending the growth curve? In other words, the \ninflation we have historically had in health care costs, going up three \nor four times the rate of inflation, going up now 8 or 9 percent even \nwhen we have deflation in the economy at large? What about the \nPresident's promise that everyone will save $2,500? According to CBO, \nalmost every small business will pay between 1 percent more or 2 \npercent less for health insurance. That means compared to what \nbusinesses would have paid under current law, this bill will raise \npremiums 1 percent or maybe decrease them by a whopping 2 percent. That \ndoesn't sound like this bill is providing real relief, and $2,500 in \nsavings for every American, as President Obama pledged repeatedly \nduring the campaign, is not going to happen.\n  The larger businesses will pay the same or up to 3 percent less for \nhealth insurance. Once again, that doesn't sound like relief, it sounds \nlike more of the same. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office has \nconfirmed that between now and the year 2016, premiums will continue to \ngrow at twice the rate of inflation.\n  I thought Congress was considering health reform to put an end to the \nunsustainable premium increases. This bill cuts Medicare by $500 \nbillion, raises taxes by $500 billion, restructures 17 percent of our \neconomy, spends $2.5 trillion, and some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle are celebrating that they have achieved the status \nquo when in fact the situation will be worse. I thought the status quo \nwas not something that was acceptable to most Members of this body.\n  Our constituents want to lower costs. That is their main concern. \nThat is what our constituents begged for, lower costs. But this bill \nfails to address that concern. It raises premiums and, despite offering \nnew ideas throughout the committee process and on the floor, \nRepublicans are being accused of supporting the status quo when our \nbills are right here for anybody to look at if they think there are not \nany ideas we would put forth.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has spoken and it is pretty clear my \ncolleagues across the aisle are not only OK with the status quo, they \nare OK with making things worse--higher taxes, higher premiums, \nincreased deficits and less Medicare. Just think, we are approaching \nthe Christmas holiday season and a Christmas gift coming from this \nSenate, with a 2,074-page bill: higher taxes, higher premiums, \nincreased deficits, $464 billion cuts in Medicare and not doing \nanything about inflation in health care costs. They are celebrating \nthat they spend $2.5 trillion to raise premiums for 14 million people, \nnot bending this growth curve, not cutting costs.\n  Don't take my word for it. You have to read this letter from the \nCongressional Budget Office. It is there in black and white as \nevidenced by the chart I have here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I will yield myself such time as I will \nuse.\n  There have been times during this debate that I have listened with \nastonishment to the minority. They agree with the diagnosis--that our \nhealth care system is in need of treatment. But they offer no remedy, \nno prescription, no cure.\n  We don't need a second opinion on what the problems are with our \nhealth care system. Our country leads the world in the advancement of \nmedical science. We have the best doctors, the best technology and the \nbest hospitals in the world. It is no surprise to see kings and queens \ncome to the United States for medical treatment.\n  But for all that, the system is dysfunctional, wasteful and abusive. \nIt rewards quantity over quality. And it delivers profits more than \ncare. It is a system in which too many American families are just one \nillness or one injury away from financial ruin.\n  I would like to thank Majority Leader Reid, Chairman Baucus, Chairman \nDodd and Chairman Harkin for getting us to this important point in our \nlong march toward a health care system that is affordable and available \nto all Americans. Their efforts have presented us an opportunity to \ncast a vote that will make life better for every single American. It \nisn't often that we get a chance to do that. But we have that chance \nnow.\n  I know the majority leader, the Senate Finance Committee, and the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committees have each tirelessly \nworked on the provisions in this bill and have taken great care to \nensure that Medicare beneficiaries will maintain access to their \nguaranteed benefits and will receive additional preventive benefits and \nexpanded prescription drug coverage.\n  The amendment offered Senator Johanns is very similar to the McCain \namendment we debated over the last few days. Once again, the opponents \nof this bill are endorsing the status quo that leaves Medicare on the \nbrink of going bankrupt and seniors facing higher costs. My amendment \nsimply ensures that no beneficiary would receive a reduction in their \nguaranteed Medicare home health benefit.\n  Let me remind my colleagues again what will happen if we stick with \nthe status quo. The status quo means Medicare will be broke in \napproximately 8 years. The status quo means seniors will continue \npaying higher and higher premiums and cost-sharing due to wasteful \noverpayments to providers. The status quo means that each year billions \nof Medicare dollars will continue to be wasted on lining the pockets of \nprivate insurance companies. And the status quo means that seniors will \ncontinue struggling to pay for prescription drugs.\n  The stakes for seniors and for the Medicare Program have never been \nhigher. Senators have a choice: Endorse the status quo or strengthen \nMedicare. Regarding Medicare changes for home health providers, let me \ndescribe what is in the Senate bill.\n  As most of my colleagues would agree, home health care is an \nimportant benefit in the Medicare Program. Today more than 3 million \nMedicare beneficiaries receive home health services across the \ncountry--including those with acute illnesses and injuries and those \nafflicted with numerous chronic conditions.\n  Across the country, more than 9,800 home health agencies provide care \nto seniors in their homes. This care helps seniors get better and avoid \nexpensive rehospitalizations. Home health providers make a real \ndifference in improving seniors' health. We should support their \nefforts.\n  While I have great respect for the services of home health providers, \nwe also have a responsibility to protect the Medicare Program. As part \nof this, we must make sure Medicare is paying appropriately--and not \noverpaying--for Medicare services. We must also take action to root out \nfraud and abuse in the Medicare Program. I believe the policies in the \nSenate bill achieve both goals.\n  First, the Senate bill would ``rebase'' home health payments to \nensure payments reflect actual costs of providing care. These changes \nare based on MedPAC recommendations, which is the nonpartisan group \nthat advises Congress on Medicare.\n  When the current home health payments were set, seniors received an \naverage of 31 visits per episode. Today, they only receive 22 visits. \nThe Senate bill directs CMS to ``rebase'' payments to reflect this \nchange. That is common sense.\n  The Senate bill also roots out fraud in the system by revising how \nMedicare pays for ``outlier'' cases. Medicare provides an extra payment \ntoday for providers who treat sicker or ``outlier'' patients. \nUnfortunately, the GAO found\n\n[[Page S12489]]\n\nthat some providers were gaming the system and getting more outlier \npayments than they deserve.\n  For example, GAO found that in one Florida County, providers were \nreceiving 60 percent of all total outlier payments--even though the \ncounty had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare population. \nClearly, something was going on there that needs to be changed.\n  The Senate bill addresses this problem by placing a cap on the amount \nany individual provider can receive in outlier payments. In addition, \nit establishes a productivity adjustment for home health providers \nbeginning in 2015. These changes ask home health providers--like all \nother providers--to offer more efficient and higher quality care over \ntime.\n  I believe the Senate policies are fair and reasonable. In making \nthese changes, we worked closely with the home health industry to \nensure these changes were reasonable and fair. On the rebasing policy, \nMedPAC recommended we fully implement these changes in 2011. To ensure \nproviders could adapt to the new payment rates, the Senate bill phases-\nin the changes over 4 years. The home health providers support this \nphase-in.\n  The outlier policy and fraud changes were actually suggested by the \nhome health industry. The home health industry fully supports these \nchanges. For the productivity changes, the Senate bill holds off on \napplying these reductions while the rebasing policy is taking effect.\n  This will give providers extra time to adapt to the payment changes \nand is much less aggressive than the proposals put forth by MedPAC, the \nHouse bill and the administration, which require all of these payment \nchanges to be implemented at the same time.\n  Finally, the Senate bill includes special protections for rural home \nhealth providers. From 2010--2015, rural providers will receive a 3 \npercent extra payment each year. This payment will ensure that rural \nproviders are protected as we reform the broader home health system. In \ntotal, the Medicare delivery reforms in the Senate bill strike a fair \nbalance between ensuring seniors have access to care, while also \nrooting out inappropriate payments from the system.\n  The opponents of these Medicare changes do not have a plan to protect \nseniors and strengthen the Medicare Program. They advocate doing \nnothing. The opponents of health reform are now claiming that Medicare \nbeneficiaries will be harmed by this bill. And here is what AARP--for \nexample--has said about these claims:\n  AARP:\n\n       Opponents of health reform won't rest. [They are] using \n     myths and misinformation to distort the truth and wrongly \n     suggesting that Medicare will be harmed. After a lifetime of \n     hard work, don't seniors deserve better?\n\n  I would like to remind my colleagues of the positive changes in the \nbill. It improves the solvency of the Medicare Program by 5 years. It \nputs $30 billion back into the pockets of seniors in the form of lower \nMedicare premiums. It makes prescription drugs more affordable. It \nguarantees that seniors can continue to see the doctor of their \nchoosing. It provides free wellness and prevention benefits to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. And it also includes fair and appropriate changes for \nhome health that protect access to care.\n  The truth is the Johanns amendment is harming seniors, harming the \nMedicare Program, and harming taxpayers. For this reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose the amendment by Senator Johanns and to support my \nhome health amendment which ensures that no beneficiary would receive a \nreduction in their guaranteed Medicare home health benefit.\n  I just listened to my friend, Senator Grassley. He and I have a good \nrelationship; we work together here; we both serve on the Finance \nCommittee. I have enjoyed a lot of the things we do together. Clearly, \nwhatever I am saying is going to be substantive, but there is nothing \npersonal in it. I have to say there is a lack of reality here in a lot \nof the comments we are hearing from our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle, and a persistance in perpetuating a myth.\n  A lot have seen the politics of this country where, if you say \nsomething over and over, no matter how true it is, it can have an \nimpact. I know that personally. But let me tell you, I heard the \nSenator from Iowa say--I am going to quote him; I wrote it down:\n\n       Certainly if $450 billion is being taken out of Medicare, \n     it is hurting Medicare.\n\n  That is what he said. Let me review what is happening here. I want to \ngo back to the comments of the Republican nominee for President last \nyear. This is a quote. John McCain, from an article in the Wall Street \nJournal:\n\n       John McCain would pay for his health care plan with major \n     reductions to Medicare and Medicaid, a top aide said, in a \n     move that independent analysts estimate could result in cuts \n     of $1.3 trillion.\n\n  After I said that on the floor, the Senator from North Carolina, \nSenator Burr, stood up and said:\n\n       Have you seen factcheck.org?\n\n  I said I haven't read the specific article but we didn't see that \ncorrected in the course of the campaign.\n  Now I have seen the article. I wanted to know what the Senator from \nNorth Carolina was referring to, so I went and got factcheck.org. \nFactcheck.org went through the Obama campaign ads and their ads and \nfact checked what was being said. The McCain adviser is a fellow named \nHoltz-Eakin. In a conference call with reporters after the ad was \nreleased, what he said was:\n\n       No service is being reduced. Every beneficiary will in the \n     future receive exactly the benefits that they have been \n     promised from the beginning.\n\n  That is the same thing as we are doing. No benefit is being cut. But \nhe didn't say he was not going to reduce the overall amount of money. \nWhat he said subsequently, and I am quoting from factcheck.org--here it \nis as late as October 17, about 2 weeks before the election--Mr. Holtz-\nEakin said in a telephone conference call with reporters, representing \nthe campaign for the Republican party:\n\n       Any shortfall in McCain's health care plan will be covered \n     without cutting benefits by such measures as Medicare fraud \n     and abuse reduction, employing a new generation of treatment \n     models for expensive chronic diseases, speeding adoption of \n     low-cost generic drugs, and expanding the use of information \n     technology in medicine.\n\n  That is exactly some of which is happening right here--some of which \nis happening right here.\n  Let's get this conversation into a place of reality. Here is what \nhappened in arriving at the reductions in overall Medicare \nexpenditures, which does not reduce any benefit to any senior \ncitizen, which is why AARP, that represents 40 million senior citizens, \nis supporting the Democratic legislation. They have written that to us \nas late as yesterday.\n\n  Madam President, $120 billion comes from reducing overpayments in \nMedicare. Someone on the other side of the aisle has to explain to me \nhow you hurt Medicare by stopping the charging of a $90 overprice of \npremium to seniors, which is what happens. Do you know how the \noverpayments are paid for? Every senior couple, in a traditional \nMedicare plan, pays an additional $90 per year in order to finance the \noverpayments. What they are suggesting is, we shouldn't cut \noverpayments. What they are suggesting is, Medicare is OK, paying \nseniors in a certain group an overpayment that doesn't even go to the \nseniors. Guess whom it goes to. It goes to the insurance company. Are \nyou telling me we ought to go to the taxpayers and say: Hey, folks, we \nknow we are paying a 14-percent overpayment for the service compared to \nwhat we pay for everybody else and we are going to keep on paying it. \nThat is exactly what our friends on the other side of the aisle are \nsaying.\n  What we are saying is: No, we think we ought to reduce that payment, \nand that is the $120 billion. That doesn't cut one benefit for a \nsenior, but it makes the program more effective.\n  Let me go further. Here are the people who have come together in a \nseries of meetings to say: Yes, we can live with a reduction in our \noverall Medicare payment because we can be more efficient. The \nhospitals came to the White House and said: We are willing to reduce \nthe payments we are receiving by $150 billion. Guess what. We are not \neven doing that. We are only asking them to reduce their payments by \n$106 billion. That is what is in this bill. The hospitals have agreed. \nI represent hospitals in Massachusetts. We have one of the best \nhospital systems in America in the network of hospitals we have. People \ncome from all over the\n\n[[Page S12490]]\n\nworld to come to our hospitals. I see the Senator from Minnesota. They \ncome from all over the world to go to some of the hospitals Minnesota \nhas. The fact is, those hospitals agree we can do this more \nefficiently, and we can reduce the overall payments under Medicare. We \nhave worked very hard to protect the way we do that so it doesn't do \ninjury.\n  The insurers have come to the table. Home health care came to the \ntable. I read the letter earlier from home health care services. It is \nfrom the President of the National Association for Home Care & Hospice. \nHe writes: We support the provisions of your health care reform \nlegislation as they relate to home health care. That is what we are \ndebating on the floor. They do support it.\n  The fact is, the Senator from Georgia, who stood and said: In our \nState, we have a letter that says--well, first of all, that is based on \nan earlier assumption. Secondly, we have no idea what the assumptions \nare in the analysis they made. Thirdly, it is based primarily on the \nHouse bill, which has $13 billion more in reductions than we have. So \nbefore we get stuck there, we ought to listen to the national \nassociation that is working with us on a daily basis, where we agree on \nwhat the reductions ought to be.\n  The skilled nursing facilities, the rehab facilities, the long-term \nacute care hospitals have all come to the table and said: We can do \nthis. Is that their preference? Do they love it? Nobody wants their \nbudget to be tightened, where they have to make changes to try to be \nmore effective. But the bottom line is, every single one of them has \nagreed with what we are doing on this side of the aisle. \nNotwithstanding that, our friends on the other side of the aisle keep \ncoming back and keep trying to stand for grandma or stand for some \nsenior citizen who is being falsely scared into believing their benefit \nis going to be cut or that Medicare is somehow going to be less \navailable to them.\n  My amendment, which we will ultimately vote on, will guarantee that \nno benefit is going to be cut for any senior under this plan. That is \nwhat we are going to do.\n  In addition to that, let me remind my colleagues and people listening \nwhat this bill does. This bill actually improves the solvency of \nMedicare. We have heard any number of people say Medicare is going to \ngo bankrupt by 2017. Indeed, it is. We stretch that out. We improve \nthat so we can then take the improvements in the health care system----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield myself an additional couple of minutes.\n  It improves the solvency of the Medicare program by 5 years. It puts \n$30 billion back into the pockets of seniors in the form of lower \nMedicare premiums. It makes prescription drugs more affordable. It \nguarantees that seniors can continue to see the doctor of their choice. \nIt provides free wellness and prevention benefits to Medicare \nbeneficiaries. They are busy talking about the cuts, when this actually \nimproves what Medicare beneficiaries are going to get. They don't have \nwellness and prevention benefits today. It provides for them.\n  It guarantees they will see the doctor of their choice. It actually \nputs $30 billion back into their pockets, and it also includes fair and \nappropriate changes for home health that actually protects access to \nhealth care.\n  The truth is, the Johanns amendment is the amendment that actually \nwould wind up hurting seniors. This amendment provides additional \nbenefits. We all understand the importance of this. The Senate bill \nreleases home health care payments so those payments actually reflect \nthe real cost of providing care. We do that not in a partisan way. We \ndo that based on the nonpartisan MedPAC commission recommendations to \nus of how you can improve Medicare.\n  Our colleagues have a long way to go on the other side to begin to \ntalk about real health care change. This bill roots out fraud from the \nsystem, revises how Medicare pays for the outlier cases; that is, the \ncases that treat the sicker or what we call outlier patients. \nUnfortunately, GAO found some providers were gaming the system and \ngetting more outlier payments than they deserve. Do they want us to \ncontinue to overpay people, providing service that people either don't \nneed or charging more for the service that they do need but could have \ngotten at a lower price? Those are the changes we make. The American \npeople will be proud of it.\n  Let me give an example. The GAO found that in a Florida county, \nproviders were receiving 60 percent of all the other outlier payments, \neven though the county had less than 1 percent of the total Medicare \npopulation. That is absurd. What we do is fix those kinds of \nabsurdities that make Americans so angry about the administration of \ntheir tax dollars in Washington.\n  I believe the Senate bill addresses a number of these problems in a \nthoughtful way.\n  We need to have a debate about what is in this bill and what the real \nimpacts are and what the negative impacts are of not doing these \nthings. Our colleagues stand for the status quo. This is going to be \nhistoric when we pass it because it is going to benefit people in so \nmany different ways, getting rid of preexisting condition restraints, \nnot having people kicked off insurance they thought they had but when \nthey get sick, they find it is gone. We end that. We get 31 billion \nmore people covered in a way that spreads the risk of being sick in a \nsensible way and reduces the costs for other Americans. That is common \nsense. I am proud of what we are doing.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, as much as I would like to put the last \nPresidential campaign behind me, we seem to be continuing to dredge it \nup in a totally false manner, time after time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that my campaign position paper on a specific \nplan of action lowering health care costs be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         A Specific Plan of Action: Lowering Health Care Costs\n\n       John McCain Proposes a Number of Initiatives That Can Lower \n     Health Care Costs. If we act today, we can lower health care \n     costs for families through common-sense initiatives. Within a \n     decade, health spending will comprise twenty percent of our \n     economy. This is taking an increasing toll on America's \n     families and small businesses. Even Senators Clinton and \n     Obama recognize the pressure skyrocketing health costs place \n     on small business when they exempt small businesses from \n     their employer mandate plans.\n       Cheaper Drugs: Lowering Drug Prices. John McCain will look \n     to bring greater competition to our drug markets through safe \n     re-importation of drugs and faster introduction of generic \n     drugs.\n       Chronic Disease: Providing Quality, Cheaper Care For \n     Chronic Disease. Chronic conditions account for three-\n     quarters of the nation's annual health care bill. By \n     emphasizing prevention, early intervention, healthy habits, \n     new treatment models, new public health infrastructure and \n     the use of information technology, we can reduce health care \n     costs. We should dedicate more federal research to caring and \n     curing chronic disease.\n       Coordinated Care: Promoting Coordinated Care. Coordinated \n     care--with providers collaborating to produce the best health \n     care--offers better outcomes at lower cost. We should pay a \n     single bill for high-quality disease care which will make \n     every single provider accountable and responsive to the \n     patients' needs.\n       Greater Access and Convenience: Expanding Access To Health \n     Care. Families place a high value on quickly getting simple \n     care. Government should promote greater access through walk-\n     in clinics in retail outlets.\n       Information Technology: Greater Use Of Information \n     Technology To Reduce Costs. We should promote the rapid \n     deployment of 21st century information systems and technology \n     that allows doctors to practice across state lines.\n       Medicaid and Medicare: Reforming the Payment System To Cut \n     Costs. We must reform the payment systems in Medicaid and \n     Medicare to compensate providers for diagnosis, prevention \n     and care coordination. Medicaid and Medicare should not pay \n     for preventable medical errors or mismanagement. Medicare \n     should lead the way in health care reforms that improve \n     quality and lower costs. We need to change the way providers \n     are paid to move away from fragmented care and focus their \n     attention on prevention and coordinated care, especially for \n     those with chronic conditions. This is the utmost important \n     step in effectively caring for an aging population. We must \n     work in a bipartisan manner to reform the physician payment \n     system, focus efforts on eliminating fraud and move Medicare \n     into a new generation of coordinated, quality care.\n       Smoking: Promoting the Availability of Cessation Programs. \n     Most smokers would\n\n[[Page S12491]]\n\n     love to quit but find it hard to do so. Working with business \n     and insurance companies to promote availability, we can \n     improve lives and reduce chronic disease through smoking \n     cessation programs.\n       State Flexibility: Encouraging States To Lower Costs. \n     States should have the flexibility to experiment with \n     alternative forms of access, coordinated payments per episode \n     covered under Medicaid, use of private insurance in Medicaid, \n     alternative insurance policies and different licensing \n     schemes for providers.\n       Tort Reform: Passing Medical Liability Reform. We must pass \n     medical liability reform that eliminates lawsuits directed at \n     doctors who follow clinical guidelines and adhere to safety \n     protocols. Every patient should have access to legal remedies \n     in cases of bad medical practice but that should not be an \n     invitation to endless, frivolous lawsuits.\n       Transparency: Bringing Transparency To Health Care Costs. \n     We must make public more information on treatment options and \n     doctor records, and require transparency regarding medical \n     outcomes, quality of care, costs and prices. We must also \n     facilitate the development of national standards for \n     measuring and recording treatments and outcomes.\n\n                Confronting the Long-Term Care Challenge\n\n       John McCain Will Develop A Strategy For Meeting The \n     Challenge Of A Population Needing Greater Long-Term Care. \n     There have been a variety of state-based experiments such as \n     Cash and Counseling or The Program of All-Inclusive Care for \n     the Elderly (PACE) that are pioneering approaches for \n     delivering care to people in a home setting. Seniors are \n     given a monthly stipend which they can use to: hire workers \n     and purchase care-related services and goods. They can get \n     help managing their care by designating representatives, such \n     as relatives or friends, to help make decisions. It also \n     offers counseling and bookkeeping services to assist \n     consumers in handling their programmatic responsibilities.\n\n     Setting the Record Straight: Covering Those With Pre-Existing \n                               Conditions\n\n       Myth: Some claim that under John McCain's plan, those with \n     pre-existing conditions would be denied insurance.\n       Fact: John McCain Supported The Health Insurance \n     Portability And Accountability Act In 1996 That Took The \n     Important Step Of Providing Some Protection Against Exclusion \n     Of Pre-Existing Conditions.\n       Fact: Nothing In John McCain's Plan Changes The Fact That \n     If You Are Employed And Insured You Will Build Protection \n     Against The Cost Of Any Pre-Existing Condition.\n       Fact: As President, John McCain Would Work With Governors \n     To Find The Solutions Necessary To Ensure Those With Pre-\n     Existing Conditions Are Able To Easily Access Care.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Then I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a statement from FactCheck.org, of October 20, 2008, that says: \n``Obama's False Medicare Claim,'' which were the attacks on me which \nwere not based on fact. I quote from FactCheck.org:\n\n       These claims are false, and based on a single newspaper \n     report that says no such thing. McCain's policy director \n     states unequivocally that no benefit cuts are envisioned. \n     McCain does propose substantial ``savings'' . . .\n\n  I did propose savings, and we can make savings. Nowhere in my wildest \nimagination did I ever believe we were going to cut benefits in order \nto create a $2.5 trillion new entitlement program when the system is \nalready going broke. I will have those put in the Record.\n  Mr. KERRY. Reserving the right to object----\n  Mr. McCAIN. The Senator from Massachusetts wants to distort my \nrecord, and that is fine. But it gets a little----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to having the document \nprinted in the Record?\n  Mr. McCAIN. As Ronald Reagan once said: Facts are stubborn things.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I am not going to object to putting \nsomething important in, but I would like my colleague to stay for a \nmoment because this is very important.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Regular order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the remaining time on our side to Senator \nThune.\n  Mr. KERRY. I have objected to a statement being put in unless I have \na chance to explain it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from \nMassachusetts be allowed 3 additional minutes and I be allowed 2 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank my friend from Arizona because this is the way the \nSenate ought to work. I totally agree with what the Senator said. I \nwant the Senator to know I agree with him. He is correct that the \nstatement in FactCheck.org calls the Obama campaign to account for a \nmisstatement about his proposal. I agree. It did that. It did not \nrecommend a reduction in benefits. But that is not what I suggested \nthat it did. What I am talking about is, the Senator said--and his \nstaff insisted--he could get the savings for his reductions that would \nbenefit Medicare from waste, fraud, and abuse from new treatment \nmodels, from expanding the use of information technology and that there \nis a complete similarity between what we are doing in order to achieve \nthese savings and what he was doing. I am trying to point out the \nsimilarity, not the difference. I am not here to debate the campaign \nad. I think it didn't accurately reflect the Senator's position. But do \nI believe, if you read the whole article, which is why I will not \nobject to it being put in there, you will see it clearly says he is \nsupportive of savings in Medicare, so you can do it without cutting \nbenefits, which is exactly what we are doing.\n  I yield the floor and thank my colleague for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Massachusetts. \nThis has been a vigorous debate. I see my prime adversary, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, on the floor, whom I look forward to doing battle with \nadditionally, as well as my friend from Massachusetts. The fundamental \npoint, I would say to my friend from Massachusetts, is that I never \nenvisioned, nor do I believe the American people ever envisioned, we \nwould be ``cutting'' benefits or, as the Senator says, making savings \nin order to transfer that to a brand new entitlement program. That is \nwhat the debate is about, whether we are going to take a failing system \nthat in 7 years is going bankrupt, according to the Medicare trustees, \nand then take all this money, no matter how these savings are made--and \nI believe they are cuts of huge magnitude--and then fund a brandnew \nentitlement program.\n  That is what this real debate is about.\n  I thank my friend from Massachusetts for his courtesy. I look forward \nto the rebuttal from the Senator from Illinois, as well as the Senator \nfrom Montana. Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair is in doubt.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the Senator from Iowa be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I yield the remainder of the time to \nthe Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, this is a great discussion. I have to say \nthe fundamental point in this discussion should not be lost on anybody \nin this Chamber or on the American people; that is, whatever was said \nduring the course of the campaign last year was said in the context of \nprotecting and preserving and prolonging the lifespan of Medicare.\n  Senator McCain is very accurate in the way he describes his position. \nBut the American people need to understand what the other side is \nproposing: a $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal Government, \nfinanced with $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts in the first 10 years \nand, as the Senator from New Hampshire said, $3 trillion in the first \ntwo decades of this program--which does nothing to extend the lifespan \nof Medicare by 1 day, nothing. What it does is it creates an entirely \nnew entitlement program that is going to be paid for by future \ngenerations of Americans.\n  So Medicare, which is destined to be bankrupt by 2017--is sitting out \nthere floundering with this huge unfunded liability. It is going \nbankrupt. What we are talking about doing is piling a $2.5 trillion new \nentitlement program on top of that. That is what this debate is about.\n  They can say these Medicare cuts are not real. But we have 11 million \npeople in this country who get Medicare Advantage benefits, and if \nthere is going\n\n[[Page S12492]]\n\nto be $118 billion cut, somebody is going to feel some pain. Surely, \nyou jest when you say these cuts are not going to hurt anybody. \nHospitals, home health agencies--$15 billion out of nursing homes.\n  In the State of South Dakota, home health care agencies, like they do \nin Montana, provide services to people in rural areas. Some home care \nspecialists have to travel 50 or 60 miles to serve a patient in their \nhome. What we are talking about doing is cutting, in my State, $35 \nmillion out of home health care. These cuts are $\\1/2\\ trillion. Of \ncourse, somebody gets hurt by that.\n  But what is probably most troubling of all, I guess, about the whole \nproposal the other side has made is, after all that--cutting Medicare, \nraising taxes--at the end of the day 90 percent of the people in this \ncountry either have their health insurance premiums stay the same or go \nup--over 6 percent if you are in the small-employer market, 5 percent \nif you are in the large-\nemployer market--double the rate of inflation. That does not change \nanything.\n  If you are a family today, and you are paying $13,000 for health care \ninsurance--this is according to the Congressional Budget Office--in \n2016 you will be paying over $20,000 a year for health insurance. That \nis a $7,000 increase. Now, tell me how that reforms or helps anybody in \nthis country?\n  I want to show you how far we have come because the President said, \nin 2007, when he was campaigning: When I become President, we will have \na health care reform bill that reduces premiums for people in this \ncountry by $2,500 per family and covers everybody. We all know this \nbill leaves 24 million people uncovered, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office. It raises premiums by 10 to 13 percent for everybody who \nbuys in the individual marketplace. It keeps them the same--and when I \nsay ``the same,'' there will be yearly increases of 5 to 6 percent year \nover year for this foreseeable future--for everybody else.\n  The best you can hope for, America--90 percent of America--is the \nstatus quo. That is the best you can hope for under this bill. How does \nthat change the status quo? How is that reform? You can call this an \noverhaul. You can call this a takeover. You can call it lots of things. \nBut it is not reform because when the American people think about \nreform, they are thinking about something that drives their health care \ncosts down not up.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said that under this bill, health \ncare costs in this country will go up by $160 billion over the first 10 \nyears, not down. If you are 90 percent of Americans, you stay the same \nor your premiums--at worst--go up by 10 to 13 percent. That is \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So I want to point out how far this debate has evolved from what the \ngoals were in the first place. I have some comments some of my \ncolleagues have made. Senator Stabenow said:\n\n       High health care costs are causing cuts in benefits and \n     increases in premiums, adding to the ranks of the uninsured \n     at alarming rates. But the impact of this problem goes beyond \n     individual families. Skyrocketing health care costs make our \n     businesses less competitive in the global marketplace and \n     cost us good-paying jobs.\n\n  This is about jobs, and this proposal does nothing to help small \nbusinesses create jobs. It kills jobs. That is why the National \nFederation of Independent Business, the Chamber of Commerce, the \nNational Association of Wholesalers and Distributors--all the major \nbusiness organizations--are opposed to this legislation. They know the \nimpact it will have on jobs.\n  I want to read one final quote. This does not come from a business \norganization. This comes from the dean of the Harvard Medical School. \nThis was in an op-ed just recently in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Speeches and news reports can lead you to believe that \n     proposed congressional legislation would tackle the problems \n     of cost, access and quality. But that's not true. . . . So \n     the overall effort will fail to qualify as reform.\n       In discussions with dozens of health-care leaders and \n     economists, I find near unanimity of opinion that, whatever \n     its shape, the final legislation that will emerge from \n     Congress will markedly accelerate national health-care \n     spending rather than restrain it.\n\n  That is from the dean of the Harvard Medical School. He goes on to \nsay:\n\n       This will make an eventual solution even more difficult.\n\n  So these Medicare cuts are real. They are $\\1/2\\ trillion in the \nfirst 10 years. As the Senator from New Hampshire has said, $3 trillion \nover the first two decades. It cuts Medicare Advantage. There are 11 \nmillion seniors in this country who get Medicare Advantage. So do not \nsay they are not going to get hurt. Their benefits are going to go \ndown. Of course they are going to get hurt.\n  Home health agencies, nursing homes, hospices--as I said, in my State \nof South Dakota, home health care delivery will feel an impact of $35 \nmillion in an area of the country where we have vast distances in \ngeography and where we already have home health agencies closing up \nshop because the reimbursements do not keep up with the costs, \nparticularly when you have to travel the distances we have to in our \nStates. If you have to put them in the hospital, the costs go up by \nmultiples. It is so much more efficient to have somebody served in a \nhome health setting rather than have them stay overnight in a hospital \nor staying successive nights in a hospital.\n  So this is not reform. This actually keeps costs the same or drives \nthem up for 90 percent of Americans. It does nothing to preserve the \nlifespan----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that 10 more \nminutes of debate be allowed, evenly divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Hearing no objection?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I would just like to state as clearly as \nI possibly can, so people understand, the Medicare savings are being \nused for Medicare. There is a strong implication by many Senators that \nthe savings are not going to be used for Medicare, that it will go \nsomeplace else. That is not true. The Medicare savings are going to be \nused for Medicare.\n\n  What are the savings? I think all Senators would like to reduce \nwaste. All Senators agree there is too much waste in the current \nsystem. It makes good sense to try to attack that waste, root out that \nwaste, and where there are overexpenditures, to try to get the levels \ndown to a reasonable level. Everybody knows we have spent too many \ndollars on Medicare Advantage. Everybody knows that. That is why we are \nbringing that cost down.\n  There is also waste and fraud--I know my good friend from South \nDakota understands this--in home health care agencies. In the State of \nFlorida, for example, the Government Accountability Office showed that \nin Florida 60 percent of the outlier payments--the extra money that \ngoes for sicker patients--were in one county. That county has 1 percent \nof seniors. It had 60 percent of the outlier payments, according to the \nGovernment Accountability Office. That is fraud. They rooted out a lot \nof fraud in home health.\n  Home health is very good. My mother is in home health right now. It \nworks really well. I am very proud of the home health caretaker there \nwho takes care of my mother. But we are reducing some of the \noverpayments. We are getting the waste out. And guess what. Those \nsavings, where do they go? They go back into Medicare. I repeat that. \nThey go back into Medicare. I do not know if any Senator wants to open \nup his ears or her ears and hear that. They go back into Medicare. \nGuess what. That is why the solvency of the Medicare trust fund is \nextended.\n  If these so-called cuts, which we hear about on the other side, were \nreally cuts, as implied by the other side, you would think that would \nhurt Medicare. You would think that might reduce the period in which \nthe trust fund would be solvent; that it would go insolvent at an \nearlier time, if we were really cutting Medicare. No, it is the \nopposite. These are savings in Medicare which extend the life of \nMedicare.\n  Please, please--I see my friend from Iowa. I think he understands, \nthese Medicare savings go into Medicare for extending the solvency of \nthe Medicare trust fund. I see my friend from South Dakota. I think he \nunderstands--he is sitting there and grinning at me now--\n\n[[Page S12493]]\n\nI think he understands those savings go back into Medicare and extend \nthe solvency of the trust fund. So let's make that very clear.\n  Second, we are using some of the money to reduce Part B premiums. \nThat helps seniors. If Part B premiums are reduced, that helps seniors. \nBy how much? Madam President, $30 billion over 10 years. That will \nreduce seniors' Part B premiums. That helps seniors. We are not taking \nmoney away from seniors; we are helping seniors, giving more dollars to \nseniors in this legislation.\n  In addition, there are additional benefits for seniors in this \nlegislation. We are starting to close the doughnut hole--that is \nsomething seniors talk about--in prescription drug benefits. They want \nthat doughnut hole closed.\n  I might add to that, there are other benefits: new preventive \nbenefits under Medicare for mammograms, preventive screenings, \ncolonoscopies, annual wellness visits--all new benefits.\n  So I want to make it very clear that it is not true when some \nSenators say we are taking money away from Medicare and creating a \nwhole new entitlement program. We are not taking money away from \nMedicare and hurting seniors. We are reforming how dollars are paid, \ntaking the waste out, and extra, excessive payments, and putting the \nmoney back into Medicare, back for seniors, back for beneficiaries.\n  Also, not one penny of guaranteed benefits will be cut. Not one penny \ncan be cut. So please, people, understand that the savings go to help \nseniors, with more benefits, extending the solvency of the trust fund. \nThat is what we are doing. If we keep that firm point in mind, then \nmaybe we can go address some of the next steps that are in this bill. \nBut that is very important.\n  Madam President, I do not know how much time I have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 16 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, he can probably extend a little bit. I \nsee the Senator from Minnesota anxiously sitting over there in the \ncorner. Maybe we could give him a couple----\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I will just take the 16 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. I do have the microphone, and I thank you for the 16 \nseconds.\n  I would like to now--oh, I have used it up.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, first, I ask unanimous consent that an \narticle that was discussed earlier and had some objection to it--but \nthat objection has been resolved now--from FactCheck.org be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      Obama's False Medicare Claim\n\n                          (By Brooks Jackson)\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       In a TV ad and in speeches, Obama is making bogus claims \n     that McCain plans to cut $880 billion from Medicare spending \n     and to reduce benefits.\n       A TV spot says McCain's plan requires ``cuts in benefits, \n     eligibility or both.''\n       Obama said in a speech that McCain plans ``cuts'' that \n     would force seniors to ``pay more for your drugs, receive \n     fewer services, and get lower quality care.''\n       Update, Oct. 21: A second Obama ad claims that McCain's \n     plan would bring about a 22 percent cut in benefits, ``higher \n     premiums and co-pays,'' and more expensive prescription \n     drugs.\n       These claims are false, and based on a single newspaper \n     report that says no such thing. McCain's policy director \n     states unequivocally that no benefit cuts are envisioned. \n     McCain does propose substantial ``savings'' through such \n     means as cutting fraud, increased use of information \n     technology in medicine and better handling of expensive \n     chronic diseases. Obama himself proposes some of the same \n     cost-saving measures. We're skeptical that either candidate \n     can deliver the savings they promise, but that's no basis for \n     Obama to accuse McCain of planning huge benefit cuts.\n\n\n                                Analysis\n\n       The Obama campaign began the Medicare assault with a 30-\n     second TV ad released Oct. 17, which it said would run \n     ``across the country in key states.''\n       Announcer. John McCain's health care plan . . . first we \n     learned he's going to tax health care benefits to pay for \n     part of it.\n       Now the Wall Street Journal reports John McCain would pay \n     for the rest of his health care plan ``with major reductions \n     to Medicare and Medicaid.''\n       Eight hundred and eighty-two billion from Medicare alone. \n     ``Requiring cuts in benefits, eligibility, or both.''\n       John McCain . . . Taxing Health Benefits . . . Cutting \n     Medicare. We Can't Afford John McCain.\n       Obama. I'm Barack Obama and I approved this message. The ad \n     quotes the Wall Street Journal as saying McCain would pay for \n     his health care plan with ``major reductions to Medicare and \n     Medicaid,'' which the ad says would total $882 billion from \n     Medicare alone, ``requiring cuts in benefits, eligibility, or \n     both.''\n       Obama elaborated on the theme Oct. 18 in a stump speech in \n     St. Louis, Mo., claiming flatly that seniors would face major \n     medical hardships under McCain: ``Obama, Oct. 18: But it \n     turns out, Senator McCain would pay for part of his plan by \n     making drastic cuts in Medicare--$882 billion worth. Under \n     his plan, if you count on Medicare, you would have fewer \n     places to get care, and less freedom to choose your doctors. \n     You'll pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and \n     get lower quality care.''\n       Update, Oct. 21: A second and even more misleading Obama ad \n     begins: ``How will your golden years turn out?'' It states \n     flatly that McCain's plan would mean a 22 percent cut in \n     benefits, higher premiums, higher co-pays, and more expensive \n     prescription drugs, and claims that both nursing home care \n     and a patient's choice of doctor could be affected.\n       As the narrator says that McCain's plan ``means a 22 \n     percent cut in benefits,'' the ad displays a footnote citing \n     an Oct. 6 Wall Street Journal story as its authority.\n       But, in fact, the Journal story makes no mention of any 22 \n     percent reduction, or any reduction at all. To the contrary, \n     the story's only mention of what might happen to benefits is \n     a quote from McCain adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin promising to \n     maintain ``the benefit package that has been promised.'' The \n     story quotes him as saying ``savings'' would come from \n     eliminating Medicare fraud and by reforming payment policies \n     to lower the overall cost of care.\n\n\n                    Obama-Biden Ad: ``Golden Years''\n\n       Obama. I'm Barack Obama and I approve this message.\n       Announcer. How would your golden years turn out under John \n     McCain? His health care plan would cut Medicare by $800 \n     billion. That means a 22% cut in benefits. Higher premiums \n     and co-pays. More expensive prescription drugs. Nursing home \n     care could suffer and so could your choice of doctor. After a \n     lifetime of work, seniors' health care shouldn't be a gamble. \n     John McCain's plan, it's not the change we need.\n       The fact is that McCain has never proposed to cut Medicare \n     benefits, or Medicaid benefits either. Obama's claim is based \n     on a false reading of a single Wall Street Journal story, \n     amplified by a one-sided, partisan analysis that piles \n     speculation atop misinterpretation. The Journal story in turn \n     was based on an interview with McCain adviser Holtz-Eakin. He \n     said flatly in a conference call with reporters after the ad \n     was released, ``No service is being reduced. Every \n     beneficiary will in the future receive exactly the benefits \n     that they have been promised from the beginning.''\n\n\n                    Twisting Facts to Scare Seniors\n\n       Here's how Democrats cooked up their bogus $882 billion \n     claim.\n       On Oct. 6, the Journal ran a story saying that McCain \n     planned to pay for his health care plan ``in part'' through \n     reduced Medicare and Medicaid spending, quoting Holtz-Eakin \n     as its authority. The Journal characterizes these reductions \n     as both ``cuts'' and ``savings.'' Importantly, Holtz-Eakin \n     did not say that any benefits would be cut, and the one \n     direct quote from him in the article makes clear that he's \n     talking about economies: ``Wall Street Journal, Oct. 6: Mr. \n     Holtz-Eakin said the Medicare and Medicaid changes would \n     improve the programs and eliminate fraud, but he didn't \n     detail where the cuts would come from. ``It's about giving \n     them the benefit package that has been promised to them by \n     law at lower cost,'' he said.''\n       Holtz-Eakin complains that the Journal story was ``a \n     terrible characterization'' of McCain's intentions, but even \n     so it clearly quoted him as saying McCain planned on ``giving \n     [Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries] the benefit package \n     that has been promised.''\n       Nevertheless, a Democratic-leaning group quickly twisted \n     his quotes into a report with a headline stating that the \n     McCain plan ``requires deep benefit and eligibility cuts in \n     Medicare and Medicaid''--the opposite of what the Journal \n     quoted Holtz-Eakin as saying. The report was issued by the \n     Center for American Progress Action Fund, headed by John D. \n     Podesta, former chief of staff to Democratic President Bill \n     Clinton. The report's authors are a former Clinton \n     administration official, a former aid to Democratic Sen. Bob \n     Kerrey and a former aid to Democratic Sen. Barbara Mikulski.\n       The first sentence said--quite incorrectly--that McCain \n     ``disclosed this week that he would cut $1.3 trillion from \n     Medicare and Medicaid to pay for his health care plan.'' \n     McCain said no such thing, and neither did Holtz-Eakin. The \n     Journal reporter cited a $1.3 trillion estimate of the amount \n     McCain would need to produce, over 10 years, to make his \n     health care plan ``budget neutral,'' as he promises to do. \n     The estimate comes not from McCain, but from the Urban-\n     Brookings Tax Policy Center. McCain and Holtz-\n\n[[Page S12494]]\n\n     Eakin haven't disputed that figure, but they haven't endorsed \n     it either.\n       Nevertheless, the report assumes McCain would divide $1.3 \n     trillion in ``cuts'' proportionately between the two \n     programs, and comes up with this: ``The McCain plan will cut \n     $882 billion from the Medicare program, roughly 13 percent of \n     Medicare's projected spending over a 10-year period.'' And \n     with such a cut, the report concludes, Medicare spending \n     ``will not keep pace with inflation and enrollment growth--\n     thereby requiring cuts in benefits, eligibility, or both.''\n\n\n                        ``Savings'' vs. ``Cuts''\n\n       For the record, Holtz-Eakin said in a telephone conference \n     call with reporters Oct. 17, after the ad was released, that \n     any shortfall in McCain's health care plan could be covered, \n     without cutting benefits, by such measures as reducing \n     ``Medicare fraud and abuse,'' employing ``a new generation of \n     treatment models'' for expensive chronic diseases, speeding \n     adoption of low-cost generic drugs, and expanding the use of \n     information technology in medicine.\n       Interestingly, Obama proposes to pay for his own health \n     care plan in part through some of the same measures, \n     particularly expanded use of I.T. and better handling of \n     chronic disease. Whether either candidate can achieve the \n     huge savings they are promising is dubious at best. As \n     regular readers of FactCheck.org are aware, we're skeptical \n     of Obama's claim that he can achieve his promised $2,500 \n     reduction in average health insurance premiums, for example.\n       But achievable or not, ``savings'' are what McCain is \n     proposing. It's a rank distortion for Obama's ad to twist \n     that into a plan for ``cuts in benefits, eligibility or \n     both,'' and for Obama to claim in a speech that seniors will \n     ``receive fewer services, and get lower quality care.''\n       Update, Oct. 21: The Center for American Progress Action \n     Fund issued a rebuttal to this article, claiming our analysis \n     is ``flawed,'' that this article ``relies solely on the \n     denials of McCain senior policy adviser Douglas Holtz-Eakin'' \n     and that we failed to conduct a ``thorough analysis of the \n     implications'' of McCain's health care proposals.\n       We disagree. Our criticism of both Obama and American \n     Progress is that they themselves misinterpret and \n     misrepresent what Holtz-Eakin said to the Wall Street Journal \n     in the first place. He was quoted in the Journal, and stated \n     again to reporters in a conference call, that what McCain is \n     proposing is to reduce the costs borne by Medicare and \n     Medicaid, and that benefits will not be reduced. American \n     Progress simply ignores that clear statement in its analysis, \n     and the Obama ads take the extra step of telling seniors that \n     McCain plans to cut benefits, when McCain says the opposite.\n       The American Progress argument rests on the idea that \n     because McCain has also promised to make his health care plan \n     budget neutral--neither raising nor cutting total federal \n     spending--and that because American Progress' analysis \n     concludes that he cannot achieve the savings that he claims, \n     that McCain therefore must be forced to break his promise not \n     to cut benefits.\n       We are also skeptical that McCain can achieve such savings, \n     and we said so at the outset of our article. And we've twice \n     called into question the campaign's claim that its plan is \n     budget neutral. But it is false logic to conclude that \n     Medicare benefit cuts would be McCain's only option should \n     his promised savings fail to materialize. McCain could simply \n     run up the deficit. Or he could choose to water down his \n     health care plan to make it less expensive.\n       It is certainly possible that McCain will break his promise \n     not to cut benefits, just as it is possible that Obama will \n     break his promise to raise taxes only on families making over \n     $250,000 a year. We have no crystal ball, and we don't \n     pretend we can predict the future. But for Obama or American \n     Progress to state as a matter of fact that McCain will be \n     forced to cut benefits, or that he is proposing any such \n     thing, is simply a falsehood designed to frighten elderly \n     voters.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I thank the manager of the bill.\n  I rise in support of the motion offered by my colleague from Nebraska \nto commit this bill in order to strike the more than $42 billion in \ncuts in the Medicare home health benefit.\n  Madam President, you, too, come from a pretty rural State, so I know \nyou understand just how important home health care is to the seniors in \nour States. Home health care has become an increasingly important part \nof our health care system. The highly skilled services and \ncompassionate care that our Nation's home health agencies provide have \nhelped to keep families together. They have enabled millions of our \nmost frail and vulnerable senior citizens to avoid hospitals and \nnursing homes and, instead, to receive care just where they want to be, \nin the privacy, comfort, and security of their own homes.\n  Moreover, by helping these individuals to avoid more costly \ninstitutional care, home health saves Medicare millions of dollars each \nyear. That is why I find it so frustrating and so ironic that once \nagain the Medicare home health benefit is under attack.\n\n  The bill before us would cut payments to home health providers by \nmore than $42 billion over the next 10 years. Moreover, these cuts are \na double whammy because they come in addition to $7.5 billion worth of \ncuts that have been imposed by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices through regulation.\n  These cuts are particularly unfair and disproportionate for a program \nthat costs Medicare less than $16 billion a year. That is simply not \nright, and it is certainly not in the interests of our Nation's seniors \nwho rely on home health care in order to keep out of more expensive \nhospitals, nursing homes, and other institutions.\n  The Medicare home health benefit has already taken a larger hit in \nspending over the past 10 years than any other Medicare benefit. In \nfact, home health as a share of Medicare spending has dropped from 8.7 \npercent in 1997 to only 3.6 percent today.\n  There was an excellent article in today's New York Times talking \nabout the disproportionate impact this bill would have on home health \ncare. As the reporter points out, under this legislation, home care \nwould absorb a disproportionate share of the cuts. It currently \naccounts for 3.7 percent of the Medicare budget but would be required \nto absorb 10.2 percent of the savings from Medicare under the House \nbill and 9.4 percent of savings under the Senate bill. That does not \nmake sense.\n  Home health care has consistently proven to be a compassionate and \ncost-effective alternative to institutional care. In rural States where \nhome health providers have to travel long distances to deliver care, \nthe impact of these cuts will ultimately fall on our seniors because \nhome health agencies simply will not be able to afford to serve seniors \nwho are living in smaller communities off rural roads in isolated parts \nof our States.\n  These deep cuts are completely counterproductive to our efforts to \ncontrol overall health care costs. They also place the quality of home \nhealth services at risk, particularly given ever-rising staffing, \ntransportation, and technology cuts.\n  As our Nation faces the continuing challenges of caring for an aging \npopulation, now is not the time to be making such deep cuts in the \nMedicare home health benefit. I urge support for the motion to commit \nintroduced by my friend and colleague from Nebraska.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. As long as it is equally divided between the two sides.\n  Mr. ENZI. That would be fine with me, and I would even allow the \nSenator from Minnesota to go first. I would use the same amount of time \nhe uses.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. How much time do I have? Two minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, let me use the 16 seconds I had but use \nit in a better way, so maybe it won't be 2 minutes. I was going to talk \nabout Senator Lincoln's amendment to limit tax benefits health \ninsurance companies receive on salaries for CEOs, but let me just talk \nabout the nature of this debate.\n  My esteemed colleague from Arizona, Senator McCain, quoted Ronald \nReagan saying facts are stubborn things. We just had my distinguished \ncolleague from South Dakota say that this bill does not extend for 1 \nday the solvency of Medicare. Well, according to the Office of the \nActuary for the\n\n[[Page S12495]]\n\nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services, it extends it for 5 years. \nNow, facts are either stubborn things or they aren't. The Actuary for \nCMS is either the Actuary for CMS or not. You can't have a debate such \nas this and throw things around. Facts are stubborn things. We are \nentitled to our own opinions. We are not entitled to our own facts. You \ncannot stand up here and wave your arms and say this doesn't extend \nMedicare 1 minute, 1 day, when the Actuary for Medicare says the bill \nextends it for 5 years.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has no time.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the agreement was that whatever time he \ntook, our side would get.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would then have 2 minutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Thank you.\n  Madam President, the first thing I wish to do is mention that some of \nthese things are facts, particularly if you go to specific situations. \nIn Wyoming, our home health care is a specific situation, and we have \nhad letters pouring in. I have one here from the Home Health Care \nAlliance of Wyoming, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  Home Health Care\n\n\n                                          Alliance of Wyoming,\n\n                                  Wheatland, WY, December 5, 2009.\n     Senator Michael B. Enzi,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Health, Education, Labor & \n         Pensions, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Enzi: Over the past ten years the Medicare \n     home health benefit has taken a larger hit in spending \n     reductions than any other benefit. As home health has become \n     an increasingly important part of our health care system with \n     highly skilled and often technically complex services that \n     enable millions of senior citizens and disabled Americans to \n     avoid being hospitalized or admitted to nursing homes, these \n     home health services save Medicare millions of dollars each \n     year.\n       I believe that further reduction in home health payments \n     would place the quality and availability of home health \n     services at risk. I urge you to oppose the cut in Medicare \n     dollars for home health agencies throughout our nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Mari Irelan,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, the letter says:\n\n       Over the past 10 years the Medicare home health benefit has \n     taken a larger hit in spending reductions than any other \n     benefit. As home health has become an increasingly important \n     part of our health system with highly skilled and often \n     technically complex services that enable millions of senior \n     citizens and disabled Americans to avoid being hospitalized \n     or admitted to nursing homes, these home health services save \n     Medicare millions of dollars each year.\n       I believe that further reduction in home health payments \n     will place the quality and availability of home health \n     services at risk. I urge you to oppose the cut in Medicare \n     dollars for home health agencies throughout our Nation.\n\n  The New York Times today pointed out that in the Reid bill:\n\n       Home care would absorb a disproportionate share of cuts. It \n     currently accounts for 3.7 percent of the Medicare budget, \n     but would account for 9.4 percent of the cuts in the Senate \n     bill according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n\n  That is from the New York Times.\n  The last time Congress made similar cuts was in the Balanced Budget \nAct in 1997 when about 15 percent of home health agencies ended their \nparticipation in Medicare. So there is a history on this that shows \nthat if we do what we are talking about doing here, we will put people \nout of business and we will put an end to services to seniors and the \nmore rural----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, if my good friend would allow me to \ninterrupt to propound a unanimous consent agreement so Senators know \nwhen votes are going to come up, and then continue.\n  Mr. ENZI. Sure.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that once this \nagreement is entered, it be in order for Senator Kerry or his designee \nto be recognized to offer the majority side-by-side to the Johanns \nmotion; that the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Kerry \namendment; and that upon disposition of the Kerry amendment, the Senate \nthen proceed to vote in relation to the Johanns motion; that no \namendments be in order to the Kerry amendment or the Johanns motion; \nfurther, that upon disposition of the above-referenced amendment and \nmotion, the Republican leader's designee be recognized to call up an \namendment related to the Lincoln amendment No. 2905; further, that on \nSunday, December 6, after the Senate has resumed consideration of H.R. \n3590, the time until 3:15 p.m. be for debate with respect to the \nLincoln amendment No. 2905, and the Republican amendment identified \nabove; with the time on Sunday equally divided and controlled, with \nSenators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each; that at 3:15 \np.m., the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Lincoln amendment \nNo. 2905; that upon disposition of amendment No. 2905, the Senate then \nproceed to vote in relation to the Republican amendment related to the \nLincoln amendment; that all of the amendments and motions covered in \nthis agreement be subject to an affirmative 60-vote threshold and that \nif any achieve it, then they be agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table; that if they do not achieve that threshold, \nthen they be withdrawn; that prior to the second votes covered in this \nagreement, there be 2 minutes of debate; that after the first vote, \neach succeeding vote covered here be limited to 10 minutes each; \nprovided further that no other motion be in order, except a motion to \nreconsider a vote with respect to the above-referenced amendments and \nmotion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, and I will not be \nobjecting, I also wish to make clear that the majority leader and I \nhave an understanding that we will actually have four votes tomorrow--\nnot just two, four. Bearing that in mind, I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I might say, that is our understanding \non this side as well.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2926 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I call up the Kerry amendment which is \nat the desk and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for Mr. Kerry, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 2926.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n               (Purpose: To protect home health benefits)\n\n       On page 869, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 3143.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the Johanns motion to commit.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this is very simple. A vote for the \nJohanns amendment is a vote for the status quo. What does that mean? It \nmeans seniors will continue to pay higher and higher premiums, higher \ncost sharing due to wasteful overpayments. A vote against Johanns means \nwe can extend the solvency of the Medicare trust fund that helps \nbenefits.\n  I think we are for seniors in this body. I urge a vote against \nJohanns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, home health care is the compassionate, \ncost-effective alternative to institutional care. It allows our seniors \nto receive care just where they want to be--in their own homes. Under \nthis bill, home health care would take a disproportionate cut.\n  Let me quote a home health care director in my State who sums up what \nthe approach will be, what will happen if this motion is agreed to. She \nsays:\n\n       Our staff is scared, but it is our patients who will pay \n     the price if Congress makes cuts in home care.\n\n  I urge support for the motion to commit offered by the Senator from \nNebraska.\n  Ms. COLLINS.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to waive the \nreading of the amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. _. LIMITATION ON AMOUNT OF ATTORNEY'S CONTINGENCY FEES.\n\n       (a) In General.--An attorney who represents, on a \n     contingency fee basis, a plaintiff in a medical malpractice \n     liability action may not charge, demand, receive, or collect \n     for services rendered in connection with such action \n     (including the resolution of the claim that is the subject of \n     the action under any alternative dispute resolution system) \n     in excess of--\n       (1) 33\\1/3\\ percent of the first $150,000 of the total \n     amount recovered by judgment or settlement in such action; \n     plus\n       (2) 25 percent of any amount recovered in excess of the \n     first $150,000 recovered by such judgment or settlement,\n     unless otherwise determined under State law. Such amount \n     shall be computed after deductions are made for all the \n     expenses associated with the claim other than those \n     attributable to the normal operating expenses of the \n     attorney.\n       (b) Calculation of Periodic Payments.--In the event that a \n     judgment or settlement includes periodic or future payments \n     of damages, the amount recovered for purposes of calculating \n     the limitation on the contingency fee under subsection (a) \n     may, in the discretion of the court, be based on the cost of \n     the annuity or trust established to make the payments. In any \n     case in which an annuity or trust is not established to make \n     such payments, such amount shall be based on the present \n     value of the payments.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Contingency fee.--The term ``contingency fee'' means \n     any fee for professional legal services which is, in whole or \n     in part, contingent upon the recovery of any amount of \n     damages, whether through judgment or settlement.\n       (2) Health care professional.--The term ``health care \n     professional'' means any individual who provides health care \n     services in a State and who is required by the laws or \n     regulations of the State to be licensed or certified by the \n     State to provide such services in the State.\n       (3) Health care provider.--The term ``health care \n     provider'' means any organization or institution that is \n     engaged in the delivery of health care services in a State \n     and that is required by the laws or regulations of the State \n     to be licensed or certified by the State to engage in the \n     delivery of such services in the State.\n       (4) Medical malpractice liability action.--The term \n     ``medical malpractice liability action'' means a cause of \n     action brought in State or Federal court against a health \n     care provider or health care professional by which the \n     plaintiff alleges a medical malpractice claim.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, the amendment I am offering is an \namendment on medical liability reform. I believe meaningful medical \nliability reform should be included in any overall health care \nlegislation that we do this year. I have a separate bill from this \namendment, a complete comprehensive medical liability reform bill, \nwhich I introduced earlier, known as S. 45. In an effort to find a \ncompromise, however, I am offering this amendment today.\n  This amendment was originally offered by Senator Edward Kennedy back \nin 1995. While many Members of the Senate, including myself, were not \nhere in 1995, 21 Members from the other side of the aisle were here at \nthat time, and they supported this amendment. Those Members included: \nSenator Akaka,\n\n[[Page S12497]]\n\nSenator Baucus, Senator Bingaman, Senator Boxer, Senator Byrd, Senator \nConrad, Senator Dodd, Senator Dorgan, Senator Feingold, Senator \nFeinstein, Senator Harkin, Senator Inouye, Senator Kerry, Senator Kohl, \nSenator Lautenberg, Senator Leahy, Senator Levin, Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Murray, Senator Reid, and Senator Specter. I would hope these \nMembers will today continue to support Senator Kennedy's amendment from \n1995.\n  Clearly, the issue of medical liability reform is even more pressing \ntoday than it was back in 1995. We, as Americans, spend more money on \nlawsuits than any other country in the world and more than twice as \nmuch as all but one other country. According to a recent nonpartisan \nstudy, the direct cost of health care lawsuits is around $30 billion a \nyear. That is the direct cost to our health care system--around $30 \nbillion a year. These costs are multiplied by indirect costs, \nespecially doctors ordering costly tests out of fear of being sued.\n  Estimates of wasted money spent on unneeded tests range from over \n$100 billion a year annually to $250 billion a year annually. Let me \nrepeat those numbers. The estimates range from $100 billion to $250 \nbillion annually in unnecessary tests conducted by doctors due to fear \nof lawsuits.\n  In 2006, an article in the New England Journal of Medicine suggested \nthat as much as 40 percent of medical liability lawsuits are without \nmerit. Medical liability insurance premiums are threatening the \nstability of our Nation's health care system. These rates are forcing \nmany physicians, hospitals, and other health care providers to move out \nof high-liability States, limit the scope of their practices, and even \nto close their doors permanently. This crisis is affecting more and \nmore patients and is threatening access to reliable, quality health \ncare services.\n  I have a good friend in southern Nevada who practices obstetrics. In \nhis practice, he specializes in high-risk pregnancies. Because of the \nmedical liability problems we have seen in the past several years, his \ninsurance company limits the number of high-risk pregnancies in which \nhe can assist. So you have one of the best doctors practicing \nobstetrics who--because of fear of lawsuits by his insurance company--\nis limited as to the number of high-risk pregnancies in which he can \nassist.\n  If you are a woman with a high-risk pregnancy, it would seem to me \nyou would want the best doctors to take care of you. That only makes \nsense. Because of the medical liability crisis we are facing in this \ncountry, however, the best of the best are limited to the number of \ncases they can handle. Because of unaffordable medical liability \ninsurance premiums, it is now common for obstetricians to not even \ndeliver babies and it is also common for other specialists to no longer \nprovide emergency calls or to provide certain high-risk procedures.\n  Ask yourself this question: What if you were in need of an emergency \nprocedure; what if you were the woman who had a high-risk pregnancy and \ncould not find a specialist to provide you with the care you needed?\n  The medical liability crisis is threatening patient access to \nreliable quality health care services all over America. Additionally, \ncostly medical liability insurance premiums have forced some emergency \ndepartments to shut down temporarily in recent years.\n  In my home State of Nevada, our level I trauma center closed for 10 \ndays in 2002. This closure left every patient within a 10,000 square \nmile area unserved by a level I trauma center.\n  Unfortunately, Jim Lawson was one of those in need of the trauma unit \nat that time. Jim lived in Las Vegas, and was just 1 month shy of his \n60th birthday. He had recently returned from visiting his daughter in \nCalifornia. When he returned, he was injured in a severe car accident.\n  Jim should have been taken to University Medical Center's level I \ntrauma center, but it was closed. Instead, Jim was taken to another \nemergency room, where he was to be stabilized and then transferred to \nSalt Lake City's trauma center. Tragically, Jim never made it that far. \nHe died that day due to cardiac arrest caused by blunt force from \nphysical trauma.\n  Why was Nevada's only level I trauma center closed? Due to a simple \nfact: the doctors could not afford medical liability premiums, and \nthere were not enough doctors to provide care. Ultimately, the State \nhad to step in and take over the liability to reopen the trauma center.\n  More than 35 percent of neurosurgeons have altered their emergency or \ntrauma call coverage because of the medical liability crisis. This \nmeans that patients with head injuries or those who are in need of \nneurosurgical services must be transferred to other facilities, \ndelaying much needed care.\n  Dr. Alamo of Henderson, NV, brought another example of this problem \nto my attention. Dr. Alamo was presented with a teenager suffering from \nmyasthenia gravis. She was in a crisis and in need of immediate medical \ntreatment. Because of the medical liability situation, there was no \nemergency neurologist on call to assist this young woman.\n  Dr. Alamo called several in the area, and none of them wanted to take \nher case because of the medical liability situation. So Dr. Alamo had \nthe young woman transported to California by helicopter to receive the \nmedical care she needed. Just imagine if that was your daughter or some \nclose friend or relative. How would you feel?\n  These kinds of situations should not happen and should not be forced \nto happen because of the medical liability crisis we have in America \ntoday. Stories such as these are all too common across our country.\n  To address the growing medical liability crisis in my State of \nNevada, the State enacted legislation that includes a cap on \nnoneconomic damages and a cap on total damages for trauma care. Several \nother States have enacted similar reforms.\n  This should not be a Republican or Democratic issue; this is \nfundamentally a patient issue. Simply put, the current medical \nliability crisis means patients cannot find access to care when they \nneed it most in many areas.\n  Without Federal legislation, the exodus of providers from the \npractice of medicine will continue, and patients will find it \nincreasingly difficult to obtain needed care.\n  As we work on a comprehensive healthcare reform bill, one of our \nprimary goals must be to enact meaningful medical liability reform to \nhelp ensure patients access to care. As you know, President Obama \naddressed the entire Congress on health reform in September. During his \nspeech, he said, ``I don't believe malpractice reform is a silver \nbullet, but I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive \nmedicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs.'' I think that is \nquite an understatement. Talk to health care providers. It drastically \ncontributes to unnecessary costs, not just maybe contributes.\n  The President went on to say that he has asked Secretary Sebelius to \nmove forward on demonstration projects in individual States to test \nways to put patient safety first and let doctors focus on practicing \nmedicine.\n  Let's face reality. There is no doubt that defensive medicine occurs \nevery day and that the costs to the health care system are staggering. \nAs I mentioned earlier, tens if not hundreds of billions of dollars are \nwasted every year due to the practice of defensive medicine, largely in \nan attempt to avoid frivolous, junk lawsuits.\n  Just think of how many uninsured patients we could take care of with \nthat money or how much cheaper premiums would be for those who have \ninsurance. We must stop playing games and start doing something real to \naddress this important healthcare issue.\n  Unfortunately, the underlying bill does not meaningfully address \nmedical liability reform--it only contains a toothless sense of the \nSenate. The Sense of the Senate notes that Congress should consider \nestablishing a State demonstration program to evaluate alternatives to \nthe current civil litigation system.\n  Let's be honest with ourselves. This is just windowdressing. The \nSense of the Senate is just fluff. It ignores the substantial progress \nthat many States have already made with medical liability reform. \nCapping noneconomic damage awards has been highly successful in a \nnumber of States, such as Texas and is something that should be part of \nhealth care reform.\n  But, if we cannot reach a consensus on this, then we should at least \nfollow Senator Kennedy's example and limit the amount of attorneys' \ncontingency fees as an important first step.\n\n[[Page S12498]]\n\n  Let's do the right thing. Let's enact real medical liability reform.\n  The amendment that I am proposing today would place reasonable limits \non attorney's contingency fees in medical malpractice cases. The limit \nwould be 33\\1/3\\ percent of the first $150,000 of the total amount \nrecovered by the judgment or settlement. There would be a further limit \nof 25 percent of any amount recovered in excess of the first $150,000 \nrecovered by the judgment or settlement.\n  While helping to reign in the cost of frivolous medical malpractice \nlawsuits, this amendment also ensures that States' rights are \nprotected. This amendment explicitly allows States that have different \nfee limitations to keep them in place instead of these caps. This \namendment ensures appropriate State flexibility while at the same time \nhelping to improve access to care and reduce health care costs. Let me \nrepeat. Back in 1995 when Senator Edward Kennedy offered this \namendment, these 21 Senators, part of the Democratic majority, all \nvoted for the Kennedy amendment.\n  To be clear, my Medical Care Access Protection Act contains more \ndetailed limitations on contingency fees than those contained in the \namendment I am proposing today. But in the interest of finding a \nstarting point on medical liability reform, I am willing to start off \nthe debate by enacting Senator Kennedy's limitations first.\n  By the way, the other side is going to say that the trial lawyers \nneed this money to be able to take these cases. Let's face it, the \ntrial lawyers are mostly the ones who get the money out of these cases. \nWe want to make sure that money goes mostly to the patient. So when you \nsee pictures put up by the other side, you will notice that my \namendment would actually help those very patients who are in the \npictures that those on the other side will put up.\n  Medical liability reform works, and it is already turning the tide \nagainst frivolous lawsuits and outrageous jury awards in some States. \nWe have seen it in California, in Texas and in my home State of Nevada, \nwhere the number of medical malpractice lawsuits has decreased \ndrastically. It has been a crisis driving doctors out of business for \ntoo long. It is time to protect patients across the country and ensure \naccess to quality health care.\n  To illustrate my point, I would like to tell you about the success of \nmedical liability reform in several States. First, take the example of \nTexas that passed medical liability reform in 2003.\n  To begin with, access to health care has improved, with 18,252 new \nphysicians coming to Texas. The number of high-risk medical specialists \nin Texas is growing. Since 2003, Texas has added 768 emergency medicine \ndoctors, 481 heart doctors, 218 obstetricians, 212 orthopedic surgeons, \nand 48 neurosurgeons. These additions are not limited to metro Texas. \nThe ranks of rural obstetricians have grown by 27 percent; 22 rural \ncounties have added an obstetrician and ten counties have added their \nfirst OB; 23 rural counties have added at least one emergency medicine \nphysician and 18 counties added their first ER doctor.\n  In addition to improvements in access to health care, charity care \nhas also greatly expanded due to medical liability reform. Today, Texas \nhospitals are rendering $594 million more in charity care annually than \nthey were just 6 years ago. That is a 24 percent increase in charity \ncare, which is due to liability savings.\n  Liability savings in States across the country have allowed hospitals \nto: upgrade medical equipment; expand the emergency room; expand \noutpatient services; staff ER rooms 24/7 with high-risk specialists; \nimprove salaries for nurses; and launch patient safety programs.\n  Without reforms and the attendant savings, these healthy developments \nwould not have been possible. Lawsuit reform has been a magnet for \nattracting doctors and the funding mechanism to improve access to care \nand enhance patient safety.\n  Physicians have seen a decrease in their medical liability premiums. \nSince 2003, physicians in Texas have saved a collective $574 million on \ntheir liability premiums. Today, most Texas doctors are paying lower \nliability premiums than they were in 2001. All major physician \nliability carriers in Texas have cut their rates since the passage of \nthe reforms, most by double digits. Texas physicians have seen their \nliability rates cut, on average, 27.6 percent. Eighty-five percent of \nTexas doctors have seen their rates slashed 30 percent or more. More \nthan 43 percent of Texas doctors have seen their liability premiums \nreduced in half. Twenty-five rate cuts have occurred since the passage \nof the 2003 landmark reforms.\n  In my home State of Nevada, limitations on noneconomic damages has \nhelped to stabilize the medical liability climate and allowed the \nIndependent Nevada Doctors Insurance Exchange to keep rates steady in \n2008, following a 20 percent decline in 2007. And rates stayed steady \nafter years of increasing dramatically.\n  In Mississippi reform in 2004 created a hard $500,000 limit on non-\neconomic damages. Since that law took effect, the number of medical \nmalpractice lawsuits has fallen nearly 90 percent, which in turn has \ncut malpractice insurance costs by 30 percent to 45 percent, depending \non the county.\n  Ohio and West Virginia have also seen sizable reductions in frivolous \nlawsuits and as a result less costly medical liability insurance.\n  These examples prove that lawsuit reform can improve access to care, \nexpand the number of doctors and types of care that hospitals are able \nto offer, and help reduce medical costs.\n  According to a conservative estimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, if Congress adopted my full Medical Care Access Protection Act, \nthe deficit would decrease by $54 billion over 10 years.\n  It would also, according to the CBO, save the private sector about \nthe same amount of money. So over $100 billion in savings that now goes \nto propping up a lot of frivolous lawsuits across the country.\n  By the way, think about it. If you had medical malpractice committed \nagainst you, I believe you should have access to the courts. I believe \nyou should be able to sue. I believe you should be able to get just \ncompensation. The problem is now, because our courts are so clogged \nwith all these frivolous lawsuits, it takes years if not up to a decade \nto be able to get through the court system. For many of these patients \nwho were severely hurt--many of them die before the case is ever \nsettled. That is another reason we need medical liability reform and we \nneed it now.\n  Let me tell you why I believe medical liability reform has been left \nout of this bill. Actually, I don't want to tell you why. Let me let \nHoward Dean tell you why. Howard Dean, obviously, is the former \nchairman of the Democratic National Committee. I am going to quote from \nhim.\n\n       [T]he reason why tort reform is not in the bill is because \n     the people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial \n     lawyers in addition to everybody else they were taking on, \n     and that is the plain and simple truth. Now, that's the \n     truth.\n\n  That is a direct quote from Howard Dean, the former chairman of the \nDemocratic National Committee.\n  I hope as this debate unfolds many of my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle will change their minds about enacting serious medical \nliability reform. I hope that at least these 21 Senators who voted for \nthis amendment before will vote for it again when it comes to a vote \ntomorrow. This isn't a battle between the right and the left; it is a \nbattle between right and wrong.\n  This amendment is a helpful prescription for patients. I know many on \nthe other side of the aisle would like to cap salaries of people who \nwork in the health insurance industry. I hope these same Members would \nsupport this simple amendment to limit trial lawyers' contingency fees \nin a responsible manner.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \nconclusion of the remarks of Senator Ensign, I be recognized for a \nperiod of time equal to that utilized by Senator Ensign; further, that \nupon the conclusion of my remarks, Members be recognized in an \nalternating fashion and that they be permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each; further, if any extensions of time are requested, the \nother side be accorded the same addition; further, that the Democratic\n\n[[Page S12499]]\n\nspeakers following me be as follows: Senators Franken, Lautenberg, \nStabenow, Dodd, and Kaufman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ENZI. Reserving the right to object, and I will not, I wish to \nmake a clarification that you wouldn't object to a couple of people \nwithout alternating so that we can have a couple of people who also go \nwithout alternating. Hopefully, we can make some arrangements on the \ntime. I would like a provision that if one goes longer, the other side \ncan go longer too. With that provision, I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Chair inform me how much time the Senator from \nNevada used?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twenty-one and a half minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this issue is very personal and very important. I know \na little bit about this because many years ago, before coming to \nCongress, I was a trial lawyer. I spent many years defending doctors \nwhen they were sued for medical malpractice, and I spent as many years \nrepresenting plaintiffs who claimed to be victims of medical \nmalpractice. I have literally been at both tables in the courtroom. At \nleast in a previous life, I knew a little bit about this field of legal \npractice.\n  What the Senator from Nevada is trying to do is to reduce the \ncontingency fee that can be paid to a lawyer who represents a \nplaintiff.\n  Here is how it works. If you believe you or a member of your family \nhas been a victim of medical malpractice, where you have either been \nhurt or someone in your family has died, you will go to a lawyer and \nsay: I don't think I was treated right.\n  The lawyer will say to you: If I think you have a good case we can \nprove in court, I will represent you. But I know you don't have enough \nmoney to pay me my legal fee. I will take your case, accept your case \non a contingency, which means if you win, I get paid, and if you lose, \nI don't get paid.\n  That is what a contingency fee is. For most Americans who are not \nwealthy, this is the only way they can get a good attorney to go into \ncourt, is to pay a percentage if they win, a contingency fee. That is \none side, one table in the courtroom.\n  There is another table in the courtroom. At that table sits the \ndoctor or hospital and an attorney. That attorney isn't paid on a \ncontingency fee; that attorney is paid by the hour, by the insurance \ncompany. No matter how many hours that attorney puts into the case, \nthat attorney is confident at the end of the day he will be paid, win \nor lose.\n  The Senator from Nevada comes here and says: We think it would be \njust to limit how much victims' attorneys can get paid. I waited \npatiently and listened, hoping that at some point he would say: And in \nall fairness, we think defense attorneys should be limited in what they \nare paid too. But I didn't hear that because what it gets down to is \nreally not about attorneys. If we are about making it fair and equal \nfor both tables in the courtroom, we would limit both attorneys' fees. \nNo. What this is all about is to discourage attorneys from representing \nvictims, limit the amount of money a plaintiff's attorney can receive \nas a contingency fee.\n  There has been a lot said about frivolous lawsuits for medical \nmalpractice. I want to tell you, as a person who did this for a living, \nthe last thing in the world I would ever consider doing is taking a \nfrivolous lawsuit. It costs a fortune. At the end of the day, you are \nlikely to lose. You can't keep the doors open and the lights on in a \nlaw practice taking lawsuits that are going to lose, taking on \nfrivolous cases. You carefully weigh the cases you take because you, as \na plaintiff's attorney representing a victim, have to make a massive \ntime-and-dollar commitment to bring that case to trial, realizing that \nat the end of the day, if there is a ``not guilty,'' you are \nemptyhanded. You have nothing to show for all of that effort and all of \nthat money spent. That is what is behind contingency fee cases.\n  That is why the Senator from Nevada has focused on only one table in \nthe courtroom--the victims' table--saying we want to discourage lawyers \nfrom taking on victims' medical malpractice cases, we want to \ndiscourage them by paying them less. Defense lawyers--no limit \nwhatsoever on how much the insurance company can pay them. That is the \nEnsign amendment in summary.\n  I am sorry in a way that Senator Ensign has invoked Senator Kennedy's \nname to support his effort. I am sorry that Senator Kennedy is not here \nbecause I think I know what Ted Kennedy, sitting right back here, would \nbe saying at this very moment. He would explain to the Senator from \nNevada that the amendment he is referring to was part of the Gingrich \nrevolution, which some may recall, which was an attempt to change tort \nreform laws across America with some onerous provisions--removing, for \nexample, the right of people to recover punitive damages in a lawsuit, \nall sorts of limitations or bars against filing lawsuits. It was an \nonerous law which Senator Kennedy offered his amendment to in the hopes \nof slowing it down. Senator Kennedy was not successful. At the end of \nthe day, this bill passed, this Gingrich revolution bill passed. It was \nsent to President Clinton, who vetoed it. So to suggest this was \nSenator Kennedy's life's work--it was his attempt to slow down a \nsteaming locomotive coming through the Senate. It didn't work. To \ninvoke his name at this point is to at least not tell the whole story \nbehind the amendment.\n  If you are going to tell the whole story about this amendment, you \nneed to get beyond lawyers and start talking about victims going into \ncourtrooms.\n  For the longest time, the argument on the other side of the aisle has \nbeen, if you go into a courtroom saying you are the victim of medical \nmalpractice and prove that you are, they want to limit the amount of \nmoney a jury can give you for your injury. They used to call it caps. \nRight now, if you are a victim of medical malpractice and you are \nsuccessful in a courtroom, you are likely to recover your medical bills \nand your lost income and some money for what they call noneconomic \ndamages. Those would be scarring, disfigurement, pain and suffering. So \nwhat most of the effort has been on the other side is to limit the \namount you can recover for these noneconomic losses--scarring, \ndisfigurement, pain and suffering. For people who have proven they were \nthe victims of malpractice, they have tried to limit the amount they \ncan take from a jury. In over half the States in the Nation, those \nlimitations or caps have been put in place.\n\n  What is the scope of this problem? The Institute of Medicine tells \nus--at least this was a finding they made back in 1999--that there are \nup to 98,000 deaths in America each year, preventable deaths, because \nof medical malpractice--98,000. When you look across the board at the \nnumber of paid malpractice claims each year against doctors in America, \nit is about 11,000. One in 10 of the deaths and injuries--frankly, a \nmuch smaller number than 1 in 10--actually ends up in a lawsuit. So the \nvast majority of victims of medical malpractice don't bring a lawsuit. \nEither they don't know they were victims or they decide it is not \nsomething they want to do. A very small percentage do.\n  What the Senator from Nevada did not tell us is that since 2003, when \nthis issue has been addressed by so many States, the number of medical \nmalpractice lawsuits each year has gone down and continues to go down. \nThe premiums for medical malpractice insurance have started to come \ndown as well. So there is a positive trend here because of State reform \nand other circumstances which have led to fewer medical malpractice \nlawsuits.\n  But make no mistake, there are still victims and there still will be. \nWe have to be honest about what those victims face and what the Ensign \namendment will mean. What the Ensign amendment means is that many of \nthem won't be able to find a lawyer. Some of them should. Let me tell \nyou some real-life stories of victims of medical malpractice and what \nhappened to them.\n  This beautiful couple, Molly Akers of New Lenox, IL, and her husband \ntell a story that is heartbreaking. Molly had a swelling in her breast, \nand her doctor performed a biopsy and determined she had breast cancer. \nShe had several mammograms which found no evidence of a tumor. The \ndoctors decided, however, that it must have been some rare\n\n[[Page S12500]]\n\nform of breast cancer, and they said that Molly, to be safe, needed a \nmastectomy. They removed her right breast. After the operation, the \ndoctor called her into the office and revealed that they discovered she \nnever had breast cancer. Instead, the radiologist who reviewed her \nslides accidentally switched Molly's slides with those of another \nwoman. Molly was permanently disfigured because of this mistake, this \nnegligence.\n  She said:\n\n       I never thought something like this could happen to me, but \n     I now know that medical malpractice can ruin your life.\n\n  By the way, the other woman, whose slides were switched with Molly's, \nwas told she was cancer free. That was a medical error that ended up \ninjuring two people, not just one.\n  Is she entitled to her day in court? Is she entitled to be \ncompensated for what she went through? Is she entitled to have at least \nthose responsible pay for her medical bills, her lost wages, pain and \nsuffering, scars and disfigurement? By most standards of justice, the \nanswer would be yes. But if she isn't rich enough to pay an attorney's \nfee, she walks in and says: The best I can do is tell you that if I \nwin, you win. It will be a contingency fee basis to the lawyer. What \nthe Senator from Nevada wants to do is to reduce the likelihood that \nshe will find a lawyer to represent her.\n  This is another story of another person from Illinois. Glenn \nSteinberg is shown here. In 2004, Glenn went for surgery in Chicago to \nremove a tumor from his abdomen. Ten days after surgery, while he was \nstill in the hospital, he was having pain and problems. They did an \nxray of his abdomen and they found a 4-inch metal retractor lodged \nagainst his intestine that had been left in his body after the surgery. \nA second surgery was performed to remove this metal instrument, during \nwhich time Glenn's lungs aspirated and he died. Glenn's wife Mary lost \nher husband. She said:\n\n       Not a day goes by that I don't miss Glenn's companionship \n     and the joy he brought to our home. Because of gross \n     negligence, he was not here to support me when my son went \n     off to serve our country in Iraq.\n\n  A real-life story. This man did nothing wrong--an innocent victim \nwho, in our system of justice, is entitled to compensation. But if his \nwidow didn't have enough money to pay the attorney's fees and went in \nfor a contingency fee, she might be limited because of the amendment \noffered by the Senator from Nevada.\n  This next case in Illinois involves children. I have met the little \nfellow we are going to talk about, Martin Hartnett. He is the second \nboy from the right. When Martin's mother, Donna, arrived at the \nhospital to deliver him, her labor was not progressing. Her doctor \nbroke her water and found it was abnormal. Rather than considering a C-\nsection, Donna's doctor tried administering a drug to help induce \ncontractions. Six hours later, Donna still hadn't delivered, but her \nson's fetal-monitoring system began indicating he was in severe \nrespiratory distress. The doctor finally decided it was time to perform \nan emergency C-section but waited another hour before she was taken to \nthe operating room. During that time, the doctor failed to administer \noxygen or take other immediate steps to help Martin breathe.\n  After Martin was born, he was in intensive care for 3 weeks. Later, \nDonna learned that Martin had substantial brain damage and cerebral \npalsy--a direct result of the doctor's failure to respond to \nindications of serious oxygen deprivation and to deliver in a timely \nmanner.\n  Donna's doctor told her not to have any more children because he said \nthere was a serious problem with her DNA which could result in similar \ndisabilities in the future.\n  Well, that turned out not to be true. Donna has given birth since to \nthree perfectly healthy sons who are shown in this photo as well. Donna \nsued the doctor responsible for Martin's delivery and received a \nsettlement in the case. Here she is, a young mother who is being told \nthe problem was her problem, and it turned out it was a problem in the \nway she was treated when she went to the hospital.\n  Again, the Senator from Nevada would reduce the likelihood that \nDonna--the mother of this child who is going to face a lifetime of \nchallenges--would have the attorney to come to court for reasonable \ncompensation.\n  These are real-life examples. I know the other side--the Senator from \nNevada said specifically: Oh, you are going to hear about the victims, \nbut this is really about lawyers.\n  These victims would not have their day in court, would not have a \nchance to recover from medical malpractice that was eventually admitted \nor proven if it were not for an attorney to bring them to court. It \ndoes take a long time. I will concede, the Senator from Nevada said it \ntakes a long time on these cases. Well, I have been there, and I know \nwhy. The attorneys representing the other side try to drag it out as \nlong as they possibly can, filing motions and requiring discovery. It \ncan go on and on. So an attorney who takes up one of these cases better \nnot take up a frivolous case because it will be a lifetime of futility \nif you take that approach.\n  I took a look and asked my staff: Well, if Senator Ensign's amendment \nis dealing with victims' attorneys, are they really getting paid a lot \nmore compared to the defense attorneys? Well, we went and looked at the \ninformation. We found that in a recent year, there was around $1.3 \nbillion paid to victims' attorneys who filed medical malpractice cases \nin America--$1.3 billion. At the same time, $2.1 billion was paid to \ndefense attorneys.\n  So to argue we just want to reduce the plaintiffs' or the victims' \nattorneys' fees and ignore the defense attorneys' fees is to ignore a \nmismatch already. The defense attorneys in America are being paid \nsubstantially more--50 percent more--than those who represent the \nvictims.\n  In 2008, in Texas, medical malpractice insurers earned $369 million \nin premiums. They paid out $17 million in losses. If one-third of that, \nsay $5.5 million, went to victims' attorneys, how much went to defense \nattorneys in medical malpractice cases in Texas? Mr. President, $41 \nmillion. So $5.5 million for plaintiffs' attorneys, $41 million for \ndefense attorneys.\n  This amendment does not even address the cost of defense attorneys.\n  In Tennessee, in 2008 malpractice insurers paid $79 million in losses \nto victims, so perhaps $26 million went to victims' attorneys' fees, \nand $83 million was paid in defense attorney fees.\n  There is no similar outrage on the other side of the aisle when it \ncomes to how much money the defense attorneys are being paid.\n  In the State of Mississippi in 2008 they paid out $874,000 in losses, \nand paid $4.1 million in defense attorneys' fees.\n  So it just goes on and on. The evidence is clear. Overwhelmingly, in \nthe courtroom, the race goes to the swift, and the swiftest are the \nones with the most resources--the most attorneys, the most discovery, \nthe most expert witnesses, and they all cost money. Time and again, \nplaintiffs' attorneys come into many courtrooms at a distinct \ndisadvantage to the insurance companies that would be benefited by \nthis.\n  Now, what are we going to do about this issue? And it is an issue. \nWell, I think the President is on the right track. First, we know it is \na State issue when it comes to medical malpractice. Historically, the \nStates set the standards, and the States initiate the reforms. A \nmajority of States have already done that, limiting recoveries, even \nlimiting fees in some cases. They have done it. Why would we come in at \nthe Federal level and preempt that?\n  Secondly, the President said: Let's encourage some positive thinking \nabout ways to end this. How can you reduce the number of medical \nmalpractice lawsuits? There is one simple way, and many States have \ndiscovered it. It is when a doctor walks in and says to a patient: I \nmade a mistake, and I am sorry. It sounds simple, doesn't it?\n  It happened in my family recently. One of the members of my family \nwent for back surgery and had complications afterwards. It went on for \nweeks. He went in, and the doctor said: I am sorry. When I did your \nback surgery, I should have cauterized you right then and there rather \nthan waiting through 2 miserable weeks until we finally did it. It was \nmy mistake.\n  Well, my relative did not file a lawsuit. That doctor was honest. We \nknow doctors are human. They make mistakes. Some States have protected \nthe\n\n[[Page S12501]]\n\ndoctors' right to say: I am sorry. Many times that is all that is \nneeded. There are other cases where States have put together panels to \nreview lawsuits before they are filed. They do it successfully. There \nare other cases where they have to file an affidavit from a doctor that \nsays this is a lawsuit with a real possibility of medical malpractice \nbeing proven.\n  All of these things are working, and we want to encourage them. But, \nplease, do not close the door of the courtroom to victims and their \nattorneys. Do not benefit the defense attorneys, the insurance \nattorneys, at the expense of the victims' attorneys.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BROWN. I say thank you to Senator Durbin.\n  My understanding is, some States have stricter licensing requirements \nfor doctors, and that typically very few doctors, relatively, commit \nsignificant, repeated mistakes as they are practicing medicine. But \nsome small number of doctors are responsible for the large number of \nmedical errors and negligence and malpractice.\n  How important is it that the States strengthen their licensing \nrequirements so those doctors--the small minority of doctors--who \nreally do seem guilty of the most malpractice are disciplined either by \nlosing their license or by being disciplined in other ways so they are \nnot inflicting this on their patients?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I think the Senator from Ohio has put his finger on a \npart of the problem. It turns out, the vast majority of lawsuits \ninvolve a very small percentage of doctors, many of whom are making \nerrors repeatedly. I would recommend to my friend from Ohio a book to \nread, and I know he reads them. It is called ``Complications.'' It is \nby Dr. Atul Gawande, who is a Boston surgeon with whom we are familiar. \nI read it, and it was an eye opener about what a surgeon learns and \ngoes through. But he spends a whole chapter in there about doctors and \nnurses of practicing doctors who are not up to skill anymore because of \nage, alcoholism, and drug addiction, and they are afraid to speak out.\n  That is not common. It is rare. But it should not happen at all. \nThose doctors who consistently make mistakes, consistently get sued, or \nhave these problems should be identified and removed from the practice \nuntil they can be rehabilitated or go off to another job.\n  Mr. BROWN. If the Senator will yield for a moment, again, don't the \nState licensing boards have the ability to do disciplinary action? I \nknow in my State, in Columbus, they do. Are they not doing that enough? \nIs there a way to strengthen that?\n  Mr. DURBIN. The point Dr. Gawande makes is there is this conspiracy \nof silence, this fear of outing a doctor.\n  Mr. BROWN. Nurses are not willing to speak up?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Nurses are not willing to speak up, other colleagues are \nnot willing to speak up, and they should for the sake of their own \nprofession, but certainly for the sake of the patients.\n  Mr. BROWN. So the Senator is arguing that if there was a mechanism or \nan environment where nurses and doctors would be willing to speak up, \nif there was a doctor, a surgeon who had a problem with alcohol, this \nissue would not go away certainly, but this issue would be much less \nserious, the issue of malpractice, the medical errors, the deaths, the \ninjuries that come from some kind of medical error? Medical malpractice \nwould be much alleviated?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am.\n  I see my time is over. I thank the Senator from Ohio, and I would say \nthis is one part of the answer. But denying victims a day in court I do \nnot think brings justice to this country or fairness, and I know \nSenator Kennedy would be saying the same thing if he were here today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I yield time to the Senator from Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, there is an urban myth that people like \nto talk about when they are discussing health care reform. It is like \none of those rumors that runs rampant on the Internet. Nobody knows \nwhere it started, but you are sure it must be true.\n  The story is about Canadian health care: everyone there is covered, \nand they have a progressive health care system that we should somehow \ncopy.\n  Well, it is time to bust this myth and tell the American people what \na government-run health care system like Canada's would mean for us in \nthe United States.\n  Canada and Great Britain offer what is typically referred to as \nuniversal coverage. Universal coverage, however, does not mean \nunlimited access to care or readily available care. Let me tell you \nwhy.\n  Let's talk about spending first. The U.S. spends about 16 percent of \nits gross domestic product on health care, while Canada spends about 10 \npercent. I know some Members of this body have been asking: If Canada \ncan spend less money on health care, why can't we?\n  Well, there is a right way to reduce spending with technology, \nhealthier behaviors, common sense, medical liability reform, other \nthings I have talked about; and there is a wrong way.\n  In Canada, the government spends 10 percent on health care by setting \na global budget. When the demand for health care exceeds that amount, \nthe Canadian Government does not increase funding. Instead, medical \ncare is often delayed and/or denied. Some estimate that about 750,000 \nCanadians are currently on a waiting list for medical procedures or \nreferrals to specialists.\n  Madam President, can you imagine waiting up to 6 months for a hip \nreplacement or up to 6 months for cardiac bypass surgery? What if you \nhad to wait up to 4 months to get an MRI.\n  People who live in countries that have government-forced health care \nsystems often wait, and then wait some more, for medical care. This \nchart shows typical patient wait times in Canada. The blue bar shows \nmedian clinically reasonable wait times. The red bar shows actual wait \ntimes. So this, in the blue, is what a reasonable patient wait time \nshould be and what is shown in red is what patients actually \nexperience.\n  If you look at this chart and study the wait times, you can see that \nin every single one of these cases whether it is general surgery, \ngynecology, internal medicine, neurosurgery, or ophthalmology, the \nactual wait times are always much longer than what a clinically \nreasonable wait time should be in Canada.\n  For example, the median clinically reasonable wait time for \nneurosurgery is 5.8 weeks. But, as we see from this chart, the actual \nwait time is 31.7 weeks. That is for neurosurgery. That is shown on \nthis part of the chart. Can you imagine having to wait that long for \nneurosurgery?\n  For orthopedic surgery, the clinically reasonable wait time is 11 \nweeks. The median actual wait time is 36.7 weeks. This is hard to \nfathom.\n  In Canada, the wait time depends on many factors. Getting in to see a \ndoctor depends on the province in which you live, whether you are an \nurban or rural resident, the urgency of your medical condition, and \nyour age.\n  I want to encourage all Americans not to take my word for it on these \nwait times. You can go to this Web site, http://ontariowaittimes.com, \nand it will actually tell you what the wait times are for various \nprocedures.\n  As a matter of fact, my assistant who is on the Senate floor with me \ntoday broke her arm several months ago. Interestingly, she went to this \nWeb site to find out how long her wait time would be for surgery in \nOntario. By the time she would have got in to see a doctor in Canada to \nhave the necessary procedure conducted, her arm would have already \nhealed. It would have healed incorrectly, but it would have already \nhealed.\n  That is unacceptable, but that is typical of what happens in \ncountries where there is government rationing, and where the government \nsets a global budget.\n  Think about how frustrated you would be if you had to wait that \nlength of time. Some Canadians get tired of this waiting. They leave \nthe queue and catch planes, trains, and automobiles to the United \nStates to get medical care when they need it most.\n  The Mayo Clinic, for example, sees about 2,000 Canadian patients each\n\n[[Page S12502]]\n\nyear. The Henry Ford Clinic in Michigan saw 191 hospital patients from \nCanada and had about 1,400 outpatient visits from Canada last year \nalone.\n  Those numbers have increased steadily over the past 3 years. In fact, \nrevenue from Canadian patients has increased by $7.5 million at the \nHenry Ford Clinic in the last 3 years. Although these major medical \nclinics do not track why some Canadian patients come to the United \nStates for medical care, I believe the significant wait times in Canada \nare one of the primary reasons they choose to cross the border.\n  I also believe that Canadian patients come to the United States to \nreap the benefit of America's research and development and to access \nnew breakthroughs in medical technologies.\n  Many of my colleagues have heard the story of Shona Holmes. Shona, a \nCanadian citizen, was experiencing numerous conditions, including \nheadaches, fatigue, and severe vision problems. Her primary care doctor \nin Canada ordered an MRI and the results suggested a brain tumor. Shona \nwould have to wait 4 months to see a neurologist or 6 months to see an \nendocrinologist in Canada. She couldn't wait that long. Since it would \nbe illegal for her to see a doctor outside the government-run health \ncare system in her own country, she traveled 2,000 miles to the Mayo \nClinic to Scottsdale, AZ, and paid for the visit herself. Doctors at \nthe Mayo Clinic diagnosed Shona with Rathke's cleft cyst.\n  Shona returned to Canada with her diagnosis and attempted to have \nsurgery under Canada's government-run health care plan. The Canadian \nGovernment wasn't able to do the necessary surgery within a 6-month \ntime period. Since Shona's vision was rapidly declining, waiting more \nthan 6 weeks for surgery was completely unacceptable. So her husband \ngot a second job, took out a second mortgage on their home, and \nborrowed money from family and friends for surgery at the Mayo Clinic. \nIncidentally, the Mayo Clinic recommended a second surgery to remove \nher adrenal gland. So Shona went back to Canada and got in line. It \ntook 3 years for her to get her second surgery in Canada--3 years.\n  In written testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee, \nShona said:\n\n       If I had relied on my own government-run health care system \n     in Canada, I would not be sitting before you today. At the \n     very best I would be blind and at the very worst I would be \n     dead.\n\n  Shona isn't the only Canadian citizen who has come to the United \nStates for access to timely medical care. A private company called \nTimely Medical Alternatives was created in 2003 to help Canadian \ncitizens obtain medical care in the United States. Over the years, the \ncompany has sent more than 500 Canadians to the United States for \ntimely medical care. Richard Baker, the founder of Timely Medical \nAlternatives said:\n\n       The Canada Health Act is responsible for more pain, more \n     suffering, and more death than any other piece of domestic \n     legislation in Canadian history.\n\n  I am concerned that the inclusion of a government-run health plan in \nthe Democrats' health reform bill will destroy the American health care \nsystem as we know it today.\n  Section 1323 of this bill establishes the community health insurance \noption. Don't let the name fool you; it is a government-run plan. \nStates can opt out of the government-run plan if they enact a law \nprohibiting the offering of the government-run plan in the exchange, \nbut I honestly expect that few States will take this course of action. \nRegardless of the language indicating that people won't be forced to \nparticipate in a public health insurance program and won't be penalized \nfor not participating, I still believe that some individuals will be \nforced into this government-run plan. I also believe this is just the \nfirst step toward a complete government-run plan.\n  Under the bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services will be \nrequired to negotiate provider reimbursement rates. The government \ntypically doesn't negotiate with doctors and hospitals. The government \nwould likely resort to price-setting based on Medicare or Medicaid or \nuse existing government programs as leverage for negotiations, creating \nsimilar effects. Remember, Medicare and Medicaid currently reimburse at \nmuch lower rates than the private sector.\n  Madam President, I ask for an additional 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, Democrats claim that they will not be \nputting private health insurance companies out of business, but it \nseems to me that they are doing everything possible to make it harder \nfor these companies to stay in business. I also question whether \nMembers of Congress will be required to participate in this government-\nrun program. We should be required to do so. If we decide that a \ngovernment-run plan is good enough for the American people, then I \nbelieve that Members of Congress should subject themselves to the same \ntype of care. I know there will be an amendment to do just that.\n  I want to tell a story about how federal government officials don't \nalways think that they should be subject to the same type of care as \ntheir country's citizens. Belinda Stronach, a former Canadian Member of \nParliament, opposed the privatization of Canada's health care system. \nWell, that was at least until she got sick. She was diagnosed with \nbreast cancer in June 2007. Although she had led the charge against \nhaving a private system in Canada, she didn't want to wait in line in \nCanada to obtain treatment--so what did she do? As a matter of fact, \nshe traveled to the United States for care--on the advice of her \ndoctor. She went to UCLA for surgery and she paid for that treatment \nout of her own pocket. I have a feeling that she came to the United \nStates because she knew that if she waited for care in Canada, the \nchances of her having successful treatment would be a lot lower.\n  Madam President, the wait to see a doctor is not the only wait \nCanadian patients face. Canada and other countries with government-run \nhealth care systems are slow to adopt new medical technologies. And, \naccess to the latest medical technologies is limited. As a result, \npatients often have to rely on old or outdated medical equipment for \ntreatment.\n  Canadians have less access to MRIs, CT scanners, and lithotroptors \nthan patients in other countries belonging to the Organisation of \nEconomic Co-Operation and Development. Lack of access to cutting-edge \nmedical technology has significant consequences. New medical \ntechnologies can often provide faster and more efficient identification \nand treatment of disease. They can offer the patient safer, less \ninvasive and more comfortable treatments and care, as well as offering \nnew treatment options where none previously existed. What is the secret \nto other countries' keeping costs down? One is refusing to approve or \ncover new life saving drugs and medical devices.\n  In 2007, the United States had 25.9 MRI machines per million people. \nCanada had 6.7 MRIs per million people and the United Kingdom had 8.2 \nper million people. In 2007, the United States had 34.3 CT machines per \nmillion people. The same year, Canada had 12.7 machines and the United \nKingdom had 7.6 machines per million people.\n  It took France 5 years to approve the endoscopy pill camera and 10 \nyears to approve implantable defibrillators. Japan is well known for \nrefusing to pay for the latest technologies because of budgetary \nconstraints and has yet to approve, for example, prosthetic titanium \nribs and imaging masks for head surgery that have been approved in the \nUnited States for the past 6 years.\n  In my home State of Nevada, robotics surgery has become an exciting \nnew frontier. Across Nevada, six hospitals are now equipped with the da \nVinci Surgical System which allows patients access to cutting-edge \nminimally, invasive surgery. In all of Canada, the entire country, \nthere are nine such machines. The United States has 968 machines. \nWouldn't you prefer a system that thrives on innovation in medical \ntechnology? Where you have access to the most cutting-edge technology \nthat can better diagnose and treat you?\n  Even with this clear discrepancy in technology investment, Democrats \nhave argued that the United States spends more money than any other \ncountry on health care and gets worse results. The implication is that \nwe should look to other countries for guidance on how to run our own \nsystem\n\n[[Page S12503]]\n\nbetter. But if we look, for example, at cancer survival rates, we see \nthat the United States gets better results than other countries that \nhave experimented with broader government control of health care.\n  International studies have found Americans have far better access to \nnew cancer drugs than do patients in Europe and the United Kingdom. The \nUnited States also has higher rates of cost-effective prevention \nmeasures that can detect certain cancers early when they are cheaper, \neasier, and more effective to treat. As a result of this superior \nprevention and treatment, the United States has higher cancer survival \nrates.\n  Madam President, I would like to show another chart. This chart shows \nthe European cancer survival rates for the major cancers in comparison \nto the United States. The United States data is in gold; the European \nUnion data is in red. This chart shows 5-year survival rates. This part \nof the chart shows kidney cancer survival rates. We have significantly \nhigher survival rates in the United States for colorectal cancer, \nbreast cancer, cervical cancer, breast cancer, and skin cancer. You \nname it, across the board we have better survival rates because we \ndon't ration care, we don't delay care, and we have access to better \ntechnology in the United States.\n  Madam President, I would like to be a little more specific when it \ncomes to these facts and figures. A study published in The Lancet \nOncology found that when comparing 5-year cancer survival rates, the \nUnited States had better outcomes than European countries. Among men, \nnearly two in three American cancer patients survived for at least 5 \nyears, while fewer than half of Europeans did. Among women, 63 percent \nsurvived for 5 years in the United States, versus 56 percent in Europe. \nAccording to the study, survival rates for breast cancer were 11 \npercentage points higher in the United States than in Europe. Prostate \ncancer is even more alarming, with a 99 percent 5-year survival rate in \nthe United States versus 78 percent in Europe. Colorectal cancer rates \nwere 10 percentage points higher in our country than in Europe. And, \nsurvival rates for kidney cancer, cervical cancer, and melanoma were \nhigher in the United States than in Europe.\n\n  Madam President, I think this body should take a look at what it \nwould mean for quality of care and access to medical care in the United \nStates if we were to adopt a government-run health care system. Many of \nus on this side of the aisle are opposed to government-run health care \nsystems. We don't want these type of survival rates that are common in \nthe European Union. We don't want people from Canada coming here and \nnot having a place to go to obtain medical treatment. As a matter of \nfact, if the United States ends up going to a government-run healthcare \nsystem, where will Americans go for high-quality care when they need it \nmost? All Americans should think about that as this bill is being \nconsidered on the floor of the Senate.\n  We should be very careful that reforms to our health system do not \nlead to reduced preventive care and poor access to lifesaving drugs. \nThese reforms have led to lower rates of survival in places with \ngreater government control over health systems.\n  These reforms have also proven unsustainable in other countries. The \nBritish National Health Service trust is issuing a report that says it \nwill face the most severe and sustained financial shortfall in its \nhistory after 2011. In fact, the NHS trust is asking staff to work a \nday for free, take unpaid leave, and carry forward their vacations in \norder to save money. Germany's new proposal to reform the health care \nsystem met with thousands of protesters because it faces a massive \nbudget shortfall due to rising costs. What are they looking at doing? \nIntroduce fees, raise taxes, and do away with private plans to bring \npeople with those plans into the public system. Sound familiar? France, \ntoo, has a gaping hole in its health care budget. France is looking at \ncutting subsidies in order to stop the problem. Japan faces one of the \nmost difficult problems because of its rapidly aging population. It too \nhas budget problems and has to find a way to offset a 5-percent \nincrease in next year's health care budget despite all of its massive \nprice controls on doctor, medical device, and drug prices. Is this the \nfuture of U.S. health care?\n  These are not health care systems that we should want to copy. \nContrary to the opinion of some, the United States provides among the \nbest care in the world for patients. The World Health Organization \nidentifies the United States as 37th in the world, but these ratings \nare faulty. The United Nations World Health Organization uses \nsubjective criteria such as ``fairness'' to rate many countries. \n``Fairness'' means that any out-of-pocket expense by a patient is \nregressive and therefore penalizes poor people more. So, in the view of \nthe United Nations, the United States is 54th in terms of their view of \nfairness. Consequently, according to the WHO ratings, countries like \nColombia, Cuba, Micronesia, Mozambique, Saudi Arabia, Samoa, and \nUruguay are ``fairer'' and therefore better than the United States. \nSomething is wrong with that rating.\n  In contrast, the United States is No. 1 in responsiveness to patient \ncare according to WHO. So, if you are sick and want the best care, even \nthe United Nations agrees that the United States is the place to be \ntreated.\n  Michael Moore's movie ``SICKO'' advertised how great Cuban health \ncare is, but he apparently did not see the system used by the 11 \nmillion ordinary Cubans where patients ``have to bring their own food, \nsoap, sheets'' with them to the hospital.\n  Some of my colleagues ask, if the United States is No. 1 in \nresponsiveness according to WHO, then why is there lower life \nexpectancy compared to other developed countries? Simple. Because the \nnumbers are wrong. Life expectancy in the United States has been rising \nas it has been in most of the developed world. All of the life \nexpectancy statistics include accidental and even intentional deaths \nthat clearly have no relation to the merit of our health care system.\n  For example, if you remove car accidents and homicides, both of which \nare higher in the United States for reasons unrelated to the \neffectiveness of health care, then the actual U.S. life expectancy is \nhigher. Some economists rank the United States near the top of world \nrankings when that point is factored in. Moreover, the history of \nexceptionally heavy smoking in the United States and the recent \nincrease in obesity means that diseases and shortened life expectancies \nrelated to these factors have little to do with the effectiveness of \nour health care system. That is why my approach to health care reform \nincludes creating incentives for people to make healthier choices. We \nneed to get to the root of health problems, not chase phantom foreign \nstatistics.\n  Another example is high infant mortality. The United States has a \nhigher level than other countries in part because of the higher number \nof low weight babies from teenage pregnancies. That social problem is \nnot related to how effective our health care system is. In fact, a low \nbirth weight baby in the United States has a better chance of survival \nthan in Canada, but we have three times the quantity of low weight \nbabies as Canada does.\n  The bottom line is that the United States has the best doctors, \nnurses, medical and nursing schools, medical research, medicine, \nhospitals, medical devices, innovative companies, and health care in \nthe world. It is like that because we demand it.\n  Every night on the news for the past month or so, there are stories \nabout the lines for the H1N1 vaccine. The vaccine supply has been \nslowly trickling out, and Americans are not accustomed to waiting for \ntheir care. They are frustrated about these lines and the priority \ngroups that have denied some of them the vaccine. Welcome to \ngovernment-run health care.\n  What Canada and Great Britain and other countries do with their \nhealth care systems is their business. They have determined that they \nwant the government at the center of their health care system. The \ngovernment decides what treatments patients can have, how long they \nhave to wait, and how much is invested in technology. Here in the \nUnited States, that is the last kind of system we need. Instead, we \nneed to move to a patient-centered system. We want to continue to \nempower patients to make decisions about their own treatment, to be \nconsumers in the process, and to have access to the care they need.\n\n[[Page S12504]]\n\n  The United States is home to some of the greatest medical \nadvancements in the world. Turning away from that system at a time of \ngreat medical promise is not the direction we should be heading.\n  For generations, American researchers, scientists, physicians, and \npatients have worked together to push the envelope on the best tools \nfor diagnosis and treatment. We have invested in finding cures and \nvaccines for illnesses. We could be on the cusp of cures for cancer, \nAlzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease. The list goes on and on. But \nwhat happens when we become a one-size-fits-all, government-centered, \nbureaucracy-run health care system? We become like Canada and Great \nBritain, where wait times are unacceptable, where care is rationed, \nwhere technology and innovation are not a priority, where the doctor-\npatient relationship is devalued, and where patients have lost their \nsay in their own care. So, it is not surprising that when people in \nother countries want the best, they come here.\n  Madam President, let's not put Americans in a position where they may \nhave to wait weeks and even months for medical care. Let's not put \nAmericans in a position where they can't access the latest medical \ntechnology or the best prescription drugs. And, let's not have \ngovernment bureaucrats stand in the way of medical care. This is about \npatients. This is about creating a patient-centered healthcare system. \nThe bill before us is not the answer.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I thank the other side for their indulgence and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized. As a \nresult of the previous agreed-upon conditions, 3 minutes will be added \nto the Senator's time.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I actually was kind of feeling bad \nbecause I thought I was going to be changing the subject, when Senator \nDurbin said I would be the next Democrat to speak. Because our good \ncolleague from Nevada brought up an amendment on medical malpractice \nliability and the Senator from Illinois responded to it and I thought \nthe Senator from Nevada was going to respond to his response with some \nfactual information or something, he completely changed the subject. So \nhe went from the Canadian system to rationing, and he will include his \nentire statement, which included this: We don't ration care here in the \nUnited States, we let--meaning the government--we let the private \nsector do that.\n  They do a great job of rationing care in the private sector. That is \nwhere we ration care in this country. They ration it by cutting off \nyour insurance when you get sick. They ration care by not giving you \ninsurance if you have a preexisting condition.\n  I wish to speak about an amendment I have--that is why I was going to \nchange the subject--but let me talk a little bit about tort reform, \nliability insurance. Senator Durbin mentioned Atul Gawande. He wrote \nthat article in the New Yorker. Senator Ensign talked about how great \nthe tort reform was in Texas. McAllen, TX, has the most expensive \nhealth care in the country. What kind of progress is that? They have \nthe most draconian medical liability reform. In Minnesota, we don't \nhave anything such as that. We do it for a third of the cost that they \ndo it for in Texas and with better outcomes.\n  The reason I actually asked for time today is to express my support \nfor Senator Lincoln's amendment to limit the tax benefits that health \ninsurance CEOs receive--not limit their salaries, limit the tax \nbenefits. This does not limit their compensation, as was claimed by the \nSenator from Nevada.\n  Most Americans would agree that the government, though, shouldn't be \ngiving tax breaks to insurance companies for lining the pockets of \ntheir CEOs at the expense of working families who are forced to pay \nmore and more as their premiums spiral out of control. The savings from \nremoving this tax deduction in Senator Lincoln's amendment will go \ndirectly to our seniors as a direct deposit into the Medicare trust \nfund. This amendment is immensely important because it reinforces one \nof our primary goals with this bill, which is to rein in the cost of \nhealth care. One of the key ways we can control costs is by holding \ninsurance companies accountable.\n  I am pleased to be working with Senator Lincoln on another effort to \nmake our health care system focused on patients, not profits. \nYesterday, Senator Lincoln joined me, Senator Rockefeller, and others \nin introducing an amendment to require that at least 90 percent of your \npremium dollars go toward actual health services. We do that in \nMinnesota. We do that in Minnesota--91 cents, actually.\n  I urge my colleagues to support both our amendments to ensure we get \nthe highest possible value for our premium dollars because nobody can \ncontest the fact that for-profit health insurance companies have been \nmaking obscene amounts of money, while Americans watch their premiums \nskyrocket. From 2000 to 2007, insurance company profits rose 428 \npercent--in 8 years. During that same time, we saw more than 6 million \nmore Americans become uninsured. During that same period, American \nfamilies saw their premiums almost double.\n  So nobody can stand on this floor and argue that American families \naren't suffering. No one can dispute what I hear from Minnesotans every \nday, that in this economic downturn, one of the greatest fears families \nhave is: What happens if I get sick? What happens if my spouse or my \nchild gets sick? We are hardly holding on now. We are just one illness \naway from losing everything. That is what I hear. That is what I hear \nfrom Minnesota families, and this is a State that has less-expensive, \nhigher quality health care than the rest of the country. If Minnesotans \nare struggling, we know we have a crisis on our hands.\n  That is why I am working to make sure this bill does everything it \ncan to bring down costs, improve quality, and hold private insurance \ncompanies accountable.\n  The current reality is, most of us don't know where our health \ninsurance premiums go. It is difficult enough to understand a billing \nstatement from your health insurer, much less track where your money is \nspent. Well, we are going to change that. We are going to change that \nwith transparent reporting of how health insurance companies are \nspending your money. That is in this bill. Clear reporting, written in \nplain English will help us hold them accountable for every dollar we \nspend on health insurance. But reporting isn't enough because, right \nnow, some of the health insurance plans being marketed and sold in this \ncountry are nothing short of a rip-off.\n  A recent report in BusinessWeek magazine described a policy being \nsold in Florida to college students in which only 10 percent of the \npremium went toward actual health services. Again, only 10 cents out of \nevery dollar goes to health care in this plan. The rest goes to \nmarketing, wasteful administrative costs, and, of course, profits. And \nthis is legal. It has been legal. It was legal when the Republicans had \nthe White House and controlled this Congress. We are going to make it \nillegal.\n  I don't think this is what we want for our children--insurance \ncompanies pocketing millions of dollars at the expense of our physical \nand economic health. Is that the kind of country we want to be? I \nbelieve we can all agree this health care reform bill must guarantee \nthat Americans get value for the premiums we pay.\n  I implore my colleagues to support these efforts because health \ninsurance should be about providing the best possible health care, not \nabout marketing, wasteful administrative costs, CEO pay, and profits.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, how much time is available?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. I ask unanimous consent to be able to speak for up to \n10 minutes. It will be less, I promise. I think we had a little miscue \nin our timing. Is there any objection to that?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, would it be \npossible\n\n[[Page S12505]]\n\nfor the Senator from Arizona to do a 5-minute speech and then the \nSenator from New Jersey do his speech?\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. All right. If we can be assured that the Senator who \nspeaks will not take more than 5 minutes, I will consent to that. That \nincludes a unanimous-consent agreement for me to have up to 10 minutes. \nI also see our colleague from Michigan, and I don't know whether that \nwould disturb her.\n  Mr. ENZI. I am willing to let her go as well, and we will make up the \ntime on our side after that.\n  Ms. STABENOW. May I ask my friend a question. Do I understand it \nwould be the Senator from New Jersey and then the Senator from Arizona \nand then myself?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from Arizona, the Senator from New Jersey, and \nthen the Senator from Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for their courtesies. I \nam sure the Chair will cut me off at 5 minutes.\n  I wish to respond to some comments made earlier relative to the \namendment of the Senator from Nevada on capping attorney's fees. We \nhave an amendment we will vote on tomorrow that caps executive \ncompensation, effectively, and the response to that from Senator Ensign \nwas, if we are going to do that, let's cap the attorney's fees because \nwe can accomplish something by doing that in medical malpractice cases. \nWe can make sure the people who were injured get more of the money \ncoming from these awards, with less going to the attorneys.\n  I think this would be a very salutary situation. This contingent fee \nsystem can really result in some abuses. I will cite some statistics \nfrom the Jury Verdict Research in a study done in 2005: Fifty-two \npercent of all awards in medical liability lawsuits exceed $1 million. \nThink about that. Over half of the awards in these malpractice cases \nexceed $1 million. The average award now weighs in at $4.7 million. \nThat is a lot of money. Obviously, juries have felt that is what the \nvictims in these cases needed in order to be properly compensated.\n  The Ensign amendment would limit the amount of contingency fees in \nthese kinds of lawsuits to no more than a third of the first $150,000 \nrecovered and a quarter of any recovery in excess of $150,000. For \nexample, an attorney representing a client in this average case, with a \n$4.7 million verdict, would still receive $1,187,500 for his or her \nservices under the Ensign amendment. That is not a bad deal with a $4.7 \nmillion verdict. The attorney gets $1.1 million-plus and the injured \nparty, the plaintiff, gets the remainder. I ask my colleagues, in that \nsituation, isn't $1.1 million-plus enough compensation?\n  We are limiting the compensation for an entire year for an executive \nof an insurance company to $400,000 as the amount that would be \ndeductible to the company as a usual and ordinary business expense. \nHere, a lawyer has just one case, and you can have many cases in a \nyear. He would be limited, in this particular situation, to $1.1 \nmillion.\n  A lot of folks have been asked to sacrifice under this legislation--\nhospitals, doctors, and States, by accepting more Medicaid patients \nunder their program; seniors would face sacrifices because of the $500 \nbillion cuts in Medicare; individuals would see their premiums rise; \nand small businesses would get hit. The one constituency that hasn't \nbeen asked to sacrifice anything is the trial lawyers. I don't think it \nis much of a sacrifice to say, when you get this kind of award--a $4 \nmillion award--for your client, your fees should not exceed a little \nbit over $1 million.\n  Even Howard Dean stated:\n\n       Tort reform is not in the [health care] bill because the \n     people who wrote it did not want to take on the trial \n     lawyers. And that is the plain and simple truth.\n\n  We know that to be the case. Surely, it wouldn't be too much to ask \nour trial lawyer friends to limit just a little bit the contingency \nfees they make in these cases.\n  There is a study that was recently conducted by the Institute for \nLegal Reform that found that medical liability lawsuits are being \ndriven by the plaintiffs' bar. It cites all the advertising costs and \nthe increase in the amount of advertising they are doing. That is where \na lot of this money is going--to advertise for these lawsuits. \nAdditionally, it showed that spending for these ads has increased \ndramatically in the last few years.\n  The threat of these ``jackpot justice'' suits against doctors is one \nof the reasons health insurance premiums are rising faster than the \nrate of inflation. In fact, a PricewaterhouseCoopers study concluded \nthat approximately 10 percent of the costs of health insurance premiums \nare attributed to the cost of litigation and defensive medicine.\n  An even bigger health care cost related to the threat of frivolous \nlawsuits is the practice of defensive medicine. A 2005 survey in the \nJournal of the American Medical Association found that 93 percent of \nphysicians reported practicing defensive medicine, costing the health \ncare system $200 billion annually.\n  We clearly need to reform the tort system, and not in the form of \nsome sense of the Senate but in the way of something real. It seems to \nme the Ensign amendment begins that process by saying: Let's at least \nallow the injured plaintiffs in these cases to keep more of the award \ngranted to them and have less of that go to the lawyers who bring the \ncases. Surely, it is an adequate incentive that they receive about $1 \nmillion out of a $4 million lawsuit.\n  I thank my colleagues from New Jersey and Michigan for allowing me to \nspeak first.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \namendment proposed by Senator Lincoln from Arkansas. I thank her for an \nexcellent idea.\n  At the outset, before I came to the Senate, I was a founder and CEO \nof a major New York Stock Exchange company--a company now employing \nover 40,000 people. I say that because I do understand how business \nworks. I know we have to pay executives to encourage their full \ncapacity. But the money being paid to top health insurance executives \nis simply outrageous.\n  Most of these companies where these executives work get subsidies \nfrom the Federal Government through payments to Medicare Advantage and \nMedicare Part D. Our tax dollars then wind up stuffing the pockets of \ninsurance company executives.\n  Remember, these companies are obliged to provide health care funding \nwhen people are ill or need counseling to improve their health and \ntheir longevity.\n  The average compensation package for the top five insurance chief \nexecutives between 2006 and 2008 was almost $15 million a year.\n  I think their services in these companies more closely resemble a \nfire department or an emergency response organization than a \ntraditional product producer or a Wall Street firm. These companies are \nnot selling lawnmowers. They have a different obligation, to provide a \nguarantee to help people maintain better health, which is essential for \nindividuals and should be great for our country. Our country will save \nmoney by reducing overhead and improving programs that will fight to \nhelp people live better and longer.\n  As their executives make millions of dollars every year, their \ncustomers are getting messages such as this: Sorry, this operation or \nthat operation is not covered by your policy, or, we don't pay for that \nkind of medication.\n  Here is an example that really lays it out perfectly.\n  There is a company called UnitedHealthcare. It is a major health \ninsurance company. After that company engaged in the practice of \nbackdating hundreds of millions of dollars in stock options--and that \nwas done to get an even better price than the shielded gain they get--\nafter backdating hundreds of millions of dollars of stock options, \ntheir CEO, William McGuire, was forced to quit for his questionable \nperformance. Despite this scandal, United gave Mr. McGuire a golden \nparachute of more than $1 billion. Where did that money come from? It \ncame from the pockets of senior citizens and from the people who had \nprograms that were covered by this company--$1 billion for an outgoing \nCEO who engaged in misconduct, while hard-working, everyday Americans \nget turned down for needed and critical\n\n[[Page S12506]]\n\nmedical procedures. There was a disease in that boardroom when they \npermitted those inexplicable decisions.\n  While health insurance executives have been gouging working families, \nthey are gorging themselves with their outrageous pay, corporate jets, \nand other perks. A cancer victim may not get critical chemotherapy. A \nfamily may not be able to cover the ravages of a child with diabetes. \nBut health insurance company executives draw down millions of dollars. \nIt doesn't add up.\n  This amendment will not tell insurance companies what they can pay \ntheir executives. They can pay them whatever they choose to. But only \n$400,000 annually can be treated as an expense. That is what the \nPresident of the United States makes. The rest of it will be taxed, \nwith those funds going to make Medicare more solvent. Again, the \nLincoln amendment wisely uses that new tax revenue generated by this \nmeasure to further shore up Medicare.\n  An observation I wish to make is that I have listened to the debate \nover a long period of time--not just in recent weeks but long before \nthat--about getting health care improved for the people across our \ncountry, the over 40 million people who cannot go to a doctor but who \nwill go to an emergency room, draw a ticket as if they are waiting for \na table in a restaurant, and hope they get seen before some critical \ndisease gets worse. What we hear is objection after objection. They \nlike the status quo. They have their friends in the industry. Look at \nthe advertising budgets we see and the percentage of commercials paid \nfor by those who are opposed as contrasted with those who desperately \nneed the insurance.\n\n  We are seeing now, for instance, that one element of our reform \nprogram is the government plan, the plan that makes the industry more \ncompetitive, the public option. We hear all kinds of reasons why that \ncannot be.\n  What is the ultimate conclusion? It is that this lush field these \ninsurance companies plow day after day, year after year, should be held \nintact. It is the wrong way to go. I say to them: Stand up, say you \ndon't want 40 million people, or somewhere near that number, to get \nhealth care coverage. Say they don't deserve it because they may not be \nable to afford it. Say you don't deserve it, you don't have the money \nto pay for it. Who do you think you are, citizens of this country.\n  People who are here, who have worked, in many instances, who have \nlost jobs in this recession, are being told--they don't use the \nlanguage but the message is clear--you don't deserve it. But they want \nthe insurance company executives to be treated particularly well.\n  We need clarification of the thinking of the Republicans--and I have \na lot of good friends over there, and I know there are a lot of good \nthinking people. But when the Senator from South Carolina said publicly \nthat if we can bring down this health care plan, we will present a \nWaterloo for President Obama, what they are seeking is a political \nvictory. They are not seeking to help people who are desperate.\n  More people are worried about the loss of their health insurance than \nthey are about their jobs because a job of some sort often can be \navailable. But if you lose your health care, if you have a condition \nthat the insurance company is not going to cover, you are in deep \ntrouble.\n  I plead with my colleagues and I plead with the people across our \ncountry who may hear our voices to protest this assault against logic, \nthis assault against those who need help, those who understand that \ngovernment can be better.\n  I was a young boy when I enlisted in the Army, 18. My father was sick \nwith cancer. He was 42 years old when he was diagnosed with cancer. He \nwas a healthy man. He used to work out at the Y and take care of \nhimself, but cancer overtook him and after 13 months of illness--a \npainful illness because they did not have the materials in those days \nto reduce the pain victims felt--he died, leaving a 37-year-old widow, \nmy mother, who not only was grief-stricken but flat broke, no money. \nShe owed pharmacists. She owed doctors. She owed hospitals.\n  I learned then that if you cannot turn to government in the United \nStates, you are in bad shape. We have the means to do it, and we must \ndo it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I want to specifically respond to the \nSenator from Nevada who was talking about the Canadian health care \nsystem a little earlier. I appreciate the information, the education. \nOf course, it has nothing to do with this debate, but it was nice to \nhear. We now understand a little bit more about the Canadian health \ncare system.\n  The great news for us is that what we are designing is a uniquely \nAmerican health care system. I want to walk through the elements.\n  About 60 percent of the folks of the great State of Michigan get \ntheir health insurance through their employer. That will continue. We \nare told that either their premiums will stay the same or go down, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. And we believe many of \nthe efforts in this bill will actually bring costs down.\n  One of the reasons that costs will come down is those of us with \ninsurance will no longer be paying through the back door for people who \nuse the emergency room who are sicker than they otherwise would be. \nThey use the emergency room and then the costs are shifted on to people \nwith insurance. We know there is about a $1,100 hidden tax we each pay \non our premiums to pay for people right now who do not have insurance \nand use the emergency room inappropriately. Those with insurance now \nwill not see their insurance change in terms of how they relate to \ntheir employer and their insurance company, but they will see costs go \ndown because others will actually have insurance and not be using \nemergency rooms inappropriately.\n  We also put in place protections for consumers, basically those, as \nthe Senator from Minnesota was talking about, who have a preexisting \ncondition and cannot find insurance now. Or somebody who has insurance. \nI don't know how many times I have heard from constituents of mine who \nhave paid all their life and said, I don't have a problem, I have \ninsurance, and then somebody gets sick and somebody gets dropped. They \nget dropped from their insurance because the insurance company does not \nwant to pay for it.\n  People with insurance now will keep the system they have but will \nbenefit from consumer protections and from gradually seeing costs come \ndown because we are not paying for people who are using other health \ncare services inappropriately.\n  We have about 80, 85 percent of the public right now who are covered \nwith insurance, either through their employer or through Medicare, the \ngreat American success story we have been talking about, or through \nMedicaid, the VA, and so on. For the 15 to 20 percent of the public we \nare trying to provide options for affordable insurance, those are \nmainly people working. A vast majority of the people we are talking \nabout work for a small business, they work part time, they work two \npart-time jobs, they work three part-time jobs.\n  I have been hearing from small businesses for years: We wish we had \nthe same clout as big business. We wish we could pool all the small \nbusinesses and the individuals, that entrepreneur working out of their \ngarage, that realtor who does not have a pool. Pool us and give us the \nsame clout as big business.\n  That is what we are doing in this bill. Versions of this have been \nproposed by the distinguished Senator from Wyoming. I know back during \nthe Clinton years during the debate, Senator Bob Dole proposed \nsomething similar. This has been a Democratic idea and a Republican \nidea for years.\n  We are calling this an insurance exchange where basically if somebody \nright now cannot find affordable insurance by going out by themselves \nin the individual market, they are going to be able to go to a place \nwhere companies will bid on the large pool of everybody who does not \nhave affordable insurance now. Just like what we do for the Federal \nGovernment, like our insurance plan, our Federal employee insurance \nplan, which is an insurance exchange, someone will be able to go to a \nWeb site or be able to get information and be able to find out about \nthe private insurance companies that want to offer insurance to them \nthrough this insurance pool.\n\n[[Page S12507]]\n\n  One of the things we are debating is whether there should be a public \ninsurance choice for people. I believe there should be. I believe that \nin order to provide competition for the for-profit companies, we should \nhave that. But the exchange is set up basically for small businesses \nand individuals to purchase--and we are told that people will see \ncheaper rates being able to do that. And to be sure they are able to do \nthat, we are including tax cuts, refundable tax credits for \nindividuals, for small businesses that cannot afford insurance today, \nto help them afford insurance. That is what the exchange is about. That \nwill affect 15 to 20 percent of the public who do not have insurance \ntoday.\n  We also have in the bill another option where a State could choose to \ntake the tax credits available to people in the exchange and could \ndecide to pool those and do a basic health insurance plan and negotiate \nwith an insurance company to get a better deal for people in their \nState.\n\n  We also have something I wish had been in place a couple of years ago \nfor my own children, and that is, we are going to say to young people \nthat you can stay on your parents' insurance until your 27th birthday. \nWe also have a policy that is more geared to young people within the \nexchange that will be less cost to them.\n  Can you imagine all of the young people today, college or not, who \ncome out, get the first job, like my children, no health insurance, who \nwill benefit by saying you can stay on your parents' insurance until \nyour 27th birthday? That is in this bill, and it is very important. \nAlso basically make Medicaid for low-income individuals a safety net so \nthat anyone below 133 percent of poverty can qualify. What that says \nis--and this is very important to people in my State where we have the \nhighest unemployment rate in the country--if you lose your job, you are \nnot going to lose your insurance. It is a very important right for \nAmericans.\n  We are improving the Medicare system. We have certainly talked about \nthat for a long time on the floor. A lot of time has been spent on the \nMedicare Program. We are cutting out overpayments to insurance \ncompanies, the for-profit companies right now that are being paid more \nthan they should be and putting that back into the Medicare system to \nmake it stronger for the future, to help pay for prescription drugs and \nto create more preventive care for seniors.\n  Then another very important piece I was very proud to coauthor with \nSenator Kerry relates to early retirees. We have a lot of folks who are \nretiring early not by choice. They are being told they are going to \nhave to retire early at age 55 or age 58 or 59. They may or may not \nhave insurance. If they do, they are a higher cost for their employer, \nand if they do not, it is extremely difficult to find affordable \ninsurance for somebody more likely to be using health care at that \npoint.\n  We have a provision where the Federal Government will partner with a \nbusiness, with an insurance plan to make sure the costs are lower for \nthe early retiree. It is called reinsurance. But for higher cost \nprocedures or episodes, the Federal Government will come in above a \ncertain level and cover the costs. It is a partnership between the \nprivate sector and the Federal Government to make sure early retirees, \nwho are already being hit with a thousand different challenges as a \nresult of early retirement, can afford insurance.\n  This is a snapshot of what we are doing. Again, the vast majority of \npeople are in private employer-based insurance today. That will not \nchange, other than this will over time bring their costs down and it \nwill give them new protections because if something happens--and it is \nhappening every single day where an employer has to decide, Do I pay \nthe 30 percent increase in premiums or do I keep people employed? If \npeople find themselves in a situation where their employer drops \ninsurance or drops employees as a result of costs, they have another \noption. They have someplace to go where they cannot today. They can go \ninto the insurance exchange. They can get tax cuts that will help them \npurchase more affordable insurance from a large group pool as a big \nbusiness does.\n  Let me say that bottom line for all of this for us, despite \neverything that is being said, is that this is about saving lives, it \nis about saving money, and it is about saving Medicare. Every year we \nare losing 45,000 Americans who are dying prematurely because they \ncannot find health insurance and cannot get the health care they need. \nWe have a variety of ways in this bill in which we are saving dollars. \nWe have analysis from the Congressional Budget Office and Joint Tax \nshowing that. And finally, we are saving Medicare for the future.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has spoken for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I have found this afternoon to be very \ninteresting. We have actually two debates going on at the same time, \nand sometimes they do not seem very related, but they are.\n  One of the amendments we are debating is the one authored by the \nSenator from Arkansas, and it limits the deductible compensation for \ninsurance executives to $400,000. Then we have the Ensign amendment \nwhich suggests that we should do the same for lawyers bringing junk \nlawsuits, although it doesn't go quite as far or is not quite as \nunreasonable in that it only limits it as a portion of the lawsuit.\n  Of course, one of the reasons being given on the Senate floor for \nsupporting the amendment of the Senator from Arkansas is that \nRepublicans are funded by insurance companies. Well, I have to object \nto that kind of wording. We could make a lot of insinuations about who \njunk lawsuits are being supported by and where the money from those \nfolks goes. The Democrats say: Well, the evidence is that the insurance \ncompanies are putting so much money into defeating this piece of \nlegislation. Well, I found out the pharmaceutical industry is now so \nfirmly in the President's camp that it is developing plans to spend \n$150 million promoting the plan on TV. That certainly makes me kind of \ncurious as to why the Arkansas Senator did not include executives of \npharmacy companies in her piece of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I don't begrudge anybody anything that they make, but \nI do find it interesting that the CEO of Abbott Laboratories makes $28 \nmillion, the Allergan CEO makes $14 million, the CEO of Bristol-Myers \nSquibb makes $23 million, the CEO of Eli Lilly makes $12 million, the \nCEO of Johnson and Johnson makes $29 million--the Senator from New \nJersey was mentioning these things, so I checked--and the CEO of Merck, \nwhich is New Jersey based, makes $25 million; the CEO of Pfizer, $15 \nmillion; Schering-Plough, $18 million; Valeant Pharmaceuticals, their \nCEO makes $20 million; and Wyeth Pharmaceuticals' CEO makes $25 \nmillion.\n  Why would we want to leave these people out of the same formula? Is \nit because they are taking the side of passing the bill as opposed to \nthe side of opposing the bill and informing the people? We ought not to \nbe about that sort of thing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from CBS News titled, ``White House & Big Pharma: What's the \nDeal?''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               White House & Big Pharma: What's the Deal?\n\n                         (By Sharyl Attkisson)\n\n       While much of the health care debate has been carried out \n     publicly, some very private negotiations have gone on too--\n     between the White House and the pharmaceutical industry. So \n     private, neither side will release all the details, yet they \n     potentially involve millions of Americans, reports CBS News \n     correspondent Sharyl Attkisson.\n       Sources say negotiations involving the White House and the \n     pharmaceutical industry shifted to fast-forward in mid-June. \n     President Obama had just taken a serious hit on the \n     escalating cost of his health care plan and needed a shot in \n     the arm. Days later, he got it with the full backing of the \n     pharmaceutical industry and its promise to save Americans $80 \n     billion in health care costs.\n       ``This is just part of the legislative process--working \n     with industry, part of getting this done,'' said Nancy-Ann \n     Deparle, director of the White House Office of Health Reform. \n     ``And the great thing is the pharmaceutical industry and \n     others in the health care sector are supporting reform this \n     time.''\n       But what did the pharmaceutical industry get in return? \n     Initial reports said the White House agreed not to seek price \n     controls on drugs for seniors on Medicare and would not\n\n[[Page S12508]]\n\n     support importing cheaper drugs from Canada. Both the White \n     House and the pharmaceutical industry now dispute that.\n       But news of a backroom deal riled even some fellow \n     Democrats, including a key committee chairman Henry Waxman.\n       ``We're not bound by that agreement,'' Waxman said. ``We \n     weren't part of it and we feel strongly that the drug \n     companies shouldn't get off with a windfall at the expense of \n     our seniors.''\n       Whatever the case, the pharmaceutical industry is now so \n     firmly in the president's camp, it's developing plans to \n     spend up to $150 million dollars promoting it with TV ads.\n       ``The president and Congress have a plan,'' reads one ad.\n       Consumer watchdog Dr. Sidney Wolfe says there's reason for \n     the public to be skeptical.\n       ``We'll give you this, you'll give us this,'' Wolfe says. \n     ``All sort of off the record, not really incorporated in any \n     kind of legislation and I believe in the long run a very bad \n     deal for the American public even if it's a good deal for the \n     drug industry.''\n       The president may have won crucial support from the \n     pharmaceutical industry but the question is whether that \n     could jeopardize support among Democrats and the public.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am sorry the Senator from Minnesota \nfinished his presiding in the Chair. I will still address the question \nto him--I did not expect him to give me an answer at the moment \nanyway--because he said there was a 428-percent increase in profits for \nthe insurance companies. I didn't quite get what the dates were, but he \nwas talking percentages. As the accountant, I like to talk dollars. I \nwould like to know what those dollars were from that first year to the \nfinal year because, for example, if a person makes $1 in the first year \nand in the last year cited they make $5.28, that is a 428-percent \nincrease. If you start with the low number of zero, you can have an \nunlimited--or infinity--increase in whatever year you pick after that, \nif they even make a penny. So percentages can give some bad numbers.\n  Also, the Senator from New Jersey was talking about administrative \ncosts, and so was the Senator from Minnesota. I would like to get the \nfigures from Minnesota to see how that is working--to have a limitation \nof 91 percent of all insurance money going to evidently pay claims--\nbecause I am not aware of the administrative costs being quite that low \nin almost any business. Again, as the accountant, I find that most \npeople--and when I say most people, I would include my colleagues--\nthink most businesses are pretty simple. But when I visit one of those \nbusinesses, and I learn a little about it, I find that when I scratch \nthe surface, there is a lot going on that the average person out there \ncouldn't handle.\n  Some of that shows up in the legislation that we do. For instance, \nCash for Clunkers. That was supposed to be a 4-month program. We ran \nout of money in 4 days. That shows how much we knew about the car \nbusiness.\n  So when we are talking about these different things, I got involved \nwith some of these administrative costs when I was working on health \nplans. I did small business health plans, and that is something that \nhas been rattling around here for about 12 years. It still is, and now \nit is 15 years. Now, how that works is that it allows small businesses, \nthrough their associations, to group together to form a big enough pool \nso that they can effectively lobby against insurance companies or \nnegotiate with providers. They can make these associations across State \nlines, even make them nationwide if that will work better.\n  Presently, they have to do it within their own State. That is the law \nthat we have set up. But I found an example of one in Ohio that is very \nsuccessful. It works well. That is kind of how I modeled my small \nbusiness health plan. When I did small business health plans, I was \ntaking on the insurance companies. They were pretty upset that I was \ndoing anything in that area, and they joined with some other people to \nkeep me from getting cloture on the motion to proceed to the debate on \nthat. So I know how tough health care is to move along.\n  But Ohio has that association within its State boundaries, and it \nworks because they have a huge population. We have less than 500,000 \npeople who live in Wyoming, and so if you break that down by \nassociations, it would be small pools, and you don't get the actuarial \nvalue out of it that you would if you go to a big population. But in \nOhio they can do it within the State, and in Ohio they did do it within \nthe State. It brought down the cost of health insurance. It brought \ndown the cost.\n  Now, not only that, the biggest savings was actually in \nadministrative costs. It costs a lot more to keep track of all of the \nclaims and everything from a small business than it does from a big \nbusiness. The bigger the pool, again, the more capable you are of \nhandling unusual situations. But administrative costs came down from 37 \npercent to 12 percent, which is a 25 percent savings. Every business \nwould like to have that. But that is how much it costs to administer \nsmall ones, so that is why they wanted to group together to form \nassociations to form this bigger pool, which we haven't been able to \ndo.\n  I would ask the Chair how much time I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Landrieu). There is 2 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. ENZI. I do want to make some quick comments about the junk \nlawsuits. We do have to do something about that. When I am talking \nabout junk lawsuits, I am talking about a bunch of them being filed \nthese days that are $25,000, $45,000, $95,000, or whatever is less than \nwhat it would cost to defend that lawsuit because if it is less than \nwhat it would cost to do the lawsuit, the insurance company is going to \nsay: Let's just pay them and we will be saving money. It is bad \nprecedent and it leads to more junk lawsuits being filed.\n  It is interesting to note that both lawyers who are with the \ninsurance companies and lawyers who are with the people who have been \nharmed don't want to have tort reform. That kind of surprised me. Then \nI thought: Well, they probably learned a lot of this in law school. In \nlaw school they probably are taught how important it is to somebody's \nretirement. Then I remembered the Old West and the story about how when \none lawyer comes to town, he is broke. But if they can get two, they \ncan both make a good living. It does take lawyers on both sides working \nthese lawsuits, and it does amount to a lot of money.\n  So we do have to do something, particularly in the medical area, \nbecause we could save $45 billion a year if we were to have something \ndone about junk lawsuits, particularly with OB-GYNs. We are losing all \nof them in Wyoming, and it is because there is such a long tail on it. \nSomebody can sue for 18 years after they are born. So the OB-GYNs have \nto pay a lot longer insurance tail than that.\n  We had one dramatic case of a doctor attending a basketball game in \nDouglas. The reason he chose to announce his retirement is because he \ncouldn't afford the insurance he had to pay. The reason he did is \nbecause he had birthed almost every kid on both teams. So the mothers \nthere don't have OB-GYN help as a result of his retirement, simply \nbecause of what it cost him for insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I come to the floor pretty often reading \nletters from people in my State who have had problems with their health \ninsurance. What is interesting about these letters is that in almost \nevery case, if you had asked these people--Mary from Madison County, \nAnn from Montgomery, Sheila from Richland County--a year or two years \nago if they were satisfied or happy with their insurance, most of them \nwould have said yes. But today they say something very different, maybe \nbecause a baby was born with a preexisting condition, so they can't get \ninsurance now or maybe they got very sick and the insurance company \ntook them off their plan, kicked them off their plan because they were \ncosting too much or maybe they changed jobs and lost their insurance or \nmaybe they got laid off.\n  The other thing I noticed--and as the Presiding Officer knows, from \nwhat happens in Louisiana and the letters you get from Baton Rouge and \nShreveport and all over--is so many people who are 58 or 62 or 63 years \nold, and who don't have insurance, they just pray that they can make it \nuntil they are 65 because they know they have a good strong public plan \nat 65 that doesn't deny people with preexisting conditions. Medicare \ndoesn't do that, of\n\n[[Page S12509]]\n\ncourse. It is a plan that is predictable and they can stay with it and \nit will help them.\n  I want to share a handful of these letters, Madam President, and I \nwill start with Mary from Madison County. Madison is just west of \nColumbus. And Mary writes:\n\n       For the past 26 years, I've worked hard and carried my own \n     insurance. When I started a home-based business, I joined my \n     husband's employer-based plan. But when he had an on the job \n     injury and went on Social Security Disability in 2006, I \n     had to find my own insurance. Guess what? I was turned \n     down by almost every health insurance company because of a \n     pre-existing condition--which was a heart attack I had in \n     2004. The only insurance I could buy was a short-term \n     policy.\n\n  Mary says she then got sick and had $40,000 in medical bills from a \nprocedure, that she has wiped out her savings, and she says:\n\n       I'm still unable to buy a major medical policy. I am too \n     young for Medicare and I make too much to qualify for \n     Medicaid.\n\n  Mary is an example of someone who would absolutely be helped by this \nbill. She could go to the insurance exchange, choose a private company \nor choose a public option, and she could make a decision based on what \nher needs are whether she wants the private or the public. She would \nknow that with the public option prices will be more stable and that \nthe quality will be better because there will be more competition than \nthere would be otherwise.\n  Here is a letter from Ann, from Montgomery County, the Dayton area. \nShe writes:\n\n       Our insurance premiums have nearly tripled in the last six \n     years--going from about $560 per month to about $1,500 per \n     month. At the same time, none of our benefits have increased. \n     Since we bought our policy, we have paid the insurance \n     company $68,000 for the insurance.\n\n  Then she writes as though she is writing in a magazine, and she says:\n\n       Anthem's total spending from my family's claims since we \n     bought the insurance: $4,064.24. Anthem's profit from my \n     family: just under $464,000. Anthem's CEO's total \n     compensation last year alone: $10 million.\n\n  Now, clearly, one of the biggest, strongest supporters of my friends \non the other side of the aisle is the insurance industry. They are as \nsupportive of the insurance industry as the industry is of them. Well, \nwe do know that if we do insurance reform right--as I think we will--\nand the Presiding Officer from Louisiana has been in a lot of these \nmeetings where we have discussed some of these changes that we want to \nmake--insurance companies are not going to be able to deny coverage. \nWhen someone gets sick and submits their claims, they are going to get \npaid instead of having to fight over it. And we know if there is a \npublic option, there will be more competition and that these CEO \nsalaries are probably not going to be as high. The average salary for \nCEOs of the top 10 health insurance companies in the country is $1 \nmillion. That kind of salary is probably not going to happen if we have \nthe type of insurance reform we hope to have because they will not make \nthe kind of money to do that.\n  The next letter is from Sheila from Richland County--Mansfield, my \nhometown--and Sheila writes:\n\n       I moved to Ohio five years ago to be with my grand-\n     daughter. I've worked hard all my life, and now, I'm 60 years \n     old still working and paying for my insurance. The other day \n     I learned that my health insurance has doubled. I am alarmed \n     because I'm wondering how long I will be able to pay for my \n     benefits. I've talked to some other people my age and they \n     are feeling the same way. I have always worked, never sat \n     down, or expected hand-outs. But insurance companies are \n     downright greedy. I do have a problem with seniors being \n     gouged because of age and health issues.\n\n  I think that says it all.\n  Most of these people, as you can see, happen to be women. Women are \nmuch more likely to write us about these problems, often not just for \nthemselves but often because they are taking care of their families. \nThey are the major caregivers and they are the ones who navigate their \nway through these complicated policies to advocate for their families. \nThese people who work hard and play by the rules--they do everything we \nask of them as American citizens. We owe them a little better treatment \nthan that.\n  This last one I will read is from Kelly, from Delaware County, north \nof Columbus.\n\n       I am a 39-year-old mother of two young sons. My husband and \n     I decided it would be better for me to leave my job and stay \n     at home and take care of our children.\n       But this also meant we would lose our health insurance \n     through my employer.\n\n  She had the insurance in the family.\n\n       My husband works for a small business that does not provide \n     benefits.\n       We ended up purchasing at what we thought was a reasonable \n     price. But it tripled within a year.\n       In February 2008 I found out I was pregnant and I inquired \n     about the maternity coverage we added despite the high cost.\n       I was shocked to learn there was a nine-month waiting \n     period before the coverage took effect--and that the \n     pregnancy and birth would not be covered because it's a pre-\n     existing condition.\n       That is $15,000 to $20,000 that would not be covered. My \n     husband and I talked about that if I needed critical medical \n     care, could we end up bankrupt? Could we lose our home? [How \n     about] our child's college fund?\n\n  That $15,000 or $20,000 obviously is without major complications.\n\n       By the grace of God my husband's company decided to offer \n     health benefits and pregnancy was covered.\n\n  Then she writes, thinking of people other than herself--Kelly writes:\n\n       Please take up reform in a serious manner and consider \n     among your reforms, a public option. Why can't insurance \n     companies compete? What are they so afraid of?\n\n  Kelly gets it. She understands that a public option will mean that \ninsurance companies will have to compete.\n  For instance, in southwest Ohio, the Cincinnati area, two insurance \ncompanies have 85 percent of the insurance business. You create a \npublic option, it doesn't mean someone from Lebanon or Batavia or \nCincinnati or Blue Ash or Evendale or Middletown or Hamilton has to \ntake that public option. But it does mean, because of the existence of \nthe public option, there will be more competition and the insurance \ncompany will behave better. You get better quality, lower prices, and \nyou will not have these companies dropping coverage because of a \npreexisting condition.\n  Let me add one other thing. There was a Dow Jones story a couple of \nyears ago entitled ``Humana's Third Quarter Profits Up 65 Percent, Sees \nStrong Medicare Advantage Gains.''\n  Let me excerpt from the first few paragraphs. Humana Inc.'s third-\nquarter earnings rose 65 percent amid improved margins in government--\ni.e., Medicare Advantage--segment. The company also gave an initial \n2010 forecast in which the health insurance projects ``substantial'' \nMedicare Advantage membership growth, resulting in revenue of $32 \nbillion to $34 billion--well above analysts' average estimate of 29 \nbillion. Humana's forecast takes into account reductions in Medicare \nAdvantage overpayments.\n  We were on this floor in the last few days, listening over and over \nto my friends on the other side of the aisle defend the insurance \nindustry, saying if you do this the insurance industry is going to be \nin such trouble and they will have to cut benefits.\n  The insurance industry under our plan will get 20, 25, 30 million new \ncustomers because all these people without insurance are going to buy \ninsurance. Of course we are putting some new rules on them. We don't \nwant them to continue to deny care for preexisting condition; we don't \nwant them to continue discriminating against women, as the Presiding \nOfficer knows. As a female, but as a good Senator, she understands that \nwomen are paying oftentimes way more than men for more or less \nidentical coverage and more or less identical situations. The insurance \ncompanies will not be able to do that anymore. So they will have these \nnew customers. We have some rules so they will not be able to keep \ngaming the system.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle I hope would sort of back \noff the defense of the insurance industry because that is not what we \nare here for. We are here to help make this insurance system work \nbetter for all Americans. That is the reason for the public option. \nThat is the reason for the insurance reforms. It will mean people will \nnot be denied for a preexisting condition, it means people will not \nhave to fight so hard when they submit their claims and have the \ninsurance companies turn them down.\n  About a third of claims that people submit to the insurance industry \nare denied. That means on the initial round that people do not get \nreimbursed for their expenses. It also means\n\n[[Page S12510]]\n\npeople have to fight with their insurance companies, far too often, \npeople in a situation where they should not have to do that, they are \nsick, caring for a loved one, whatever it is.\n  That is the reason this insurance reform is so important. I ask we \nmove forward and pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition? The Senator from \nOklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that myself and \nthe Senator from North Carolina consume the next hour discussing the \nhealth care bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, we have been discussing health care in \nWashington for the past 8 months rather vigorously. Four years ago I \nstarted working on a bill with my colleagues in the Senate and we \nintroduced a bill 2 years ago and modified it this year. It was \nintroduced before the House bill, it was introduced before the Senate \nbill. It was introduced before the bill we have on the floor at this \ntime. It is called the Patients' Choice Act.\n  We have heard several times that the Republicans want to stop this. \nAs a practicing physician, I fully recognize the need to significantly \nreform health care. There is no question. I recognize that. In that \nbill is a guaranteed issue--no preexisting conditions are allowed in \nexchanges under our bill. But I also recognize that as we fix health \ncare, some of the things we cannot do are make our fiscal situation \nworse and also our inefficiencies worse.\n  Earlier today I referred to research put out and published in October \nof 2009, which is a white paper on the waste in our health care. This \nis Robert Kelly, vice president, Health Care Analytics, at Thomson \nReuters, a highly esteemed, reputable firm which says that every year \nbetween $600 and $850 billion of money is wasted in health care. It is \nwasted. It doesn't help anybody get well and it doesn't prevent anybody \nfrom getting sick.\n  When you look at the breakdown of where that comes from, it is rather \napparent that the largest component of it is unwarranted use. They \nbreak that down. What is that? That is me as a physician--I am a \npracticing physician, delivered thousands of babies, cared for \nthousands of grandmoms, granddads, kids, set bones, done operations--\nold-time, broad-based practice.\n  But what is this unwarranted use? Madam President, 40 percent of $700 \nbillion is $280 billion a year. They are saying a total of $700 \nbillion, times 10 years in my math, at least from Oklahoma, is $7 \ntrillion.\n  We have not begun to touch in any of these other bills this \nunwarranted use, the fraud and abuse--19 percent--that comes to $175 \nbillion a year in fraud. Most of it is not in the private sector, it is \nin Medicare and Medicaid. That is where most of the fraud is. We have \nnot begun to touch that, we have not attacked it. There is a minimal $2 \nbillion over 10 years of direct fraud elimination in the bill we have \non the floor.\n  Administrative inefficiencies. That is the bureaucratic paperwork \nthat both the hospitals and the doctors spend money on to make sure \nthey maintain compliance with the regulation of medicine--17 percent. \nThat 17 percent comes to somewhere between $100 billion and $150 \nbillion a year that does not help one patient get well. It doesn't \nprevent one patient from getting sick.\n  In this unwarranted use happens to be the very thing that none of the \nbills attack, except our bill, which is the defensive medicine costs in \nthis country. Why would it be important to fix that? Because it is \nclose to $200 billion a year. That is $200 billion of tests that are \nordered on patients, on procedures that are done on patients they do \nnot need, because the doctors need to do it to prevent themselves being \nexposed to unnecessary litigation. That is $200 billion a year, that is \n$2 trillion over 10 years. Yet we do not address it, not one iota in \nthe bill we have on the floor.\n  Avoidable care--those are complications. Those are things that we \ncause. Iatrogenic, they are induced complications. We are not going to \nbe able to do much with that. We could fix this--lack of care \ncoordination with accountable care organizations--by incentivizing \noutcomes, by grouping in payment for how we pay. But we have not done \nany of that.\n  So here is Thomson Reuters that is showing if we want to drive down \ncosts in our health care system, what do we have to do? We have to \nattack where the waste is. There is nary a gnat's rear end of reduction \nin these things in the bill that is before us.\n  The other thing I referred to earlier today was a report by the \nCongressional Research Service, which was issued December 1, this year, \nlast week. What did they say? The question that was asked of them: What \npercentage of health care is run or funded by the Federal Government \ntoday--or the governments today? The number came back--I have been \nquoting 61 percent on my back-of-the-envelope calculation. The number \ncame back, as affirmed by Congressional Research Service, that 60 \npercent of all health care in America is funded through or by your tax \ndollars funding through a government organization.\n  The question has to be asked: How well are we doing? Could there be \nany coordination or connection to the fact that the government is now \nrunning 60 percent of the health care, and health care inflation is \ntwice what all the rest of the inflation is? Could there be any \nconnection between the inefficiencies that are in health care and the \nfact that we have bureaucracies that have themselves in between \npatients and their providers? I think the answer to that is an \nastounding yes.\n  I visited with a cardiovascular surgeon, because I have made this \nstatement on the floor and people have disputed it.\n  Find me a doctor who has trained in the last 30 years in this \ncountry, who spent part of his training at a VA medical center, and ask \nhim or her the following question: If you or your family were sick and \nyou had the choice of where you trained at a VA hospital or any other \nhospital you trained, would you go to the VA hospital or would you go \nto one of the private hospitals where you trained? One hundred percent \nwill say no.\n  Our VA system has markedly improved. I will readily admit, in certain \nareas, they are better than anybody else, especially prosthetics, \nespecially post-traumatic stress disorder. They are better. But on the \nvast majority of the issues, they are not. They are run by the \ngovernment. Look at the Indian Health Service. We have a profound legal \ntreaty obligation to provide health care to Native Americans. Yet \nIndian health care is abysmal. That is a government-run program. Then \nlook at Medicaid, which we are going to put millions of people in. What \nhappens? In Medicaid, 40 percent of the doctors and 65 percent of the \nspecialists will not see you. But we are going to say: We will give you \ncoverage in a system where you have access to only 60 percent of the \ndoctors. That is not choice. That is relegating you to a system that \nsays you can't get care.\n  I have talked on this floor about pediatric subspecialties. Because \nof Medicaid, we have an absolute dearth of pediatric subspecialties \nbecause the payment mechanism is so low that nobody will spend the \nextra time in residency to become a pediatric subspecialist. Whether it \nis a cardiologist or gastroenterologist or pediatric neurologist, we \ncan't find them. Nobody will go there. The rates for reimbursement are \nset so low. So physicians graduating from medical school make an \neconomic decision based on the health and well-being of their family to \nnot go into those areas because we have forced them.\n  What we know is, there are poorer health outcomes in Medicaid. That \nshould not be surprising. Some of the best doctors are not available to \nMedicaid patients because we will not pay for their expertise. We also \npay an extra $1,800 per family, everybody in this country who has \ninsurance, because of the underpayment of Medicare and Medicaid. \nFinally, with the large tranche of people under this bill who are going \ninto the Medicaid Program, we are going to break the States, if they \nare not broken already. We are going to cover it for 4 years. For \ncertain States, we will do a whole lot better than that; Louisiana and \na few others for which we have made special exceptions. But we are \nbasically going to transfer a load of fiscal responsibility, call it \nequal, and put that load on the taxpayers of the individual States.\n  As we look at health care, one of the things I wished to do was to \ntalk about\n\n[[Page S12511]]\n\nthe problems but also talk about the bill we have before us and make \nthis point. Are we better off with the government running health care \nor are we better off changing the system in such a way so the patient \nis put first, the government is put last, and the doctor is a 100-\npercent advocate for their patient? Which would be the better way? \nKnowing that we have $7 to $800 billion a year wasted, why would we not \ndesign a system that goes after that waste and create the same \nopportunity for everybody?\n  When you look at the Patients' Choice Act, which my colleague, \nSenator Burr, will talk about in a minute, there are some important \nthings. First, let me tell what the CBO says about it. The CBO says it \nwill reduce future budget deficits, relative to protections under \ncurrent law, by amounts that increase over time--the first 10 years, \n$70 billion. But what it will do for the States is $1 trillion in \nsavings the first 10 years. It will lead to lower budget deficits. That \nis what the CBO said. It said it also would reduce spending on health \ncare because it will be more efficient spending. Then, finally, the \nFederal contribution for Medicaid would grow at a lower rate, lower \nthan health care inflation, which means it is going to save a ton of \nmoney for the States.\n  The bill we have before us creates 70 new government programs. It has \n1,696 times that we will write bureaucratic rules and regulations that \nare going to cause the government to step between the patient and their \ncaregiver. It is estimated, right now, to add somewhere around 20,000 \nnew Federal employees--we are trying to get a handle on that--20,000 \nnew Federal employees to tell you what you will and will not do in your \nhealth care. It is going to create at least $5 to $10 billion in new \nrequirements for the Internal Revenue Service just to check on you. \nThat is per year to check on you to make sure you are filling out the \nforms right. It will create a massive disruption in the insurance \nmarket.\n  Nobody who practices medicine today likes insurance companies. The \nvery fact that we would have our colleagues claim we are defending the \nprocess is absurd. What we are defending is allowing the free market, \nwith legitimate regulation, to allocate a scarce resource without \nputting the patient second. There is a big difference. I can tell you \nhorror stories about insurance companies, but I can tell you worse \nstories about the Federal Government and the fact that it denies twice \nas many claims per 10,000 claims as all the other insurance companies.\n  So when we are talking about access to care, both of the \nbureaucracies are a nightmare. Yet this bill creates the mother of all \nbureaucracies, the mother of all new programs.\n  I will make one last point and yield the floor. We have been down \nhere fixing things that are wrong. We fixed the Preventive Services \nTask Force. We said it doesn't apply to breast cancer screening. That \nis what we said. We voted for it. It doesn't apply. Are we going to \npass that every time? We didn't get rid of it. We didn't get rid of the \nMedicare Advisory Commission. We didn't get rid of the Comparative \nEffectiveness Panel. Every time they make a bad decision, are we going \nto pass a law and say: You were wrong or are we going to trust the \nprofessionals, the professional societies that guide my practice of \nmedicine today or are we going to have a bureaucrat and a bureaucratic \nsystem that says what you will get and what you won't? Under the bill \nwe have, you are going to have that. We have taken the hot potato off \nthe floor in terms of breast cancer, in terms of what they said. We \nsaid it doesn't apply. We passed something for women's health which I \napplaud. But what about men's health? What about children, what about \nprostate screening for men? What about colon screening for men? What \nabout cardiovascular screening for men? We didn't do a thing. Why \ndidn't we? Because we know a larger percentage of the emotional \nattraction has to do with those things associated with women. So we \npounded our chests and passed the Mikulski amendment for preventative \ncare for women, and we ignored the preventative requirements of \neverybody else. How does that fit with what we should be doing?\n  It doesn't connect. It is political. It makes good news. It satisfies \nvocal interest groups. But does it fix the long-term problem?\n  I yield to my fellow Senator from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, this debate to date has not been about \nhealth care reform. It has been about coverage expansion. We are \nlearning how expensive it is not to do reform. In fact, incorporated in \nthis bill, just short of $900 billion, we are required to offset 100 \npercent of it because you don't receive savings unless you reform.\n  When Dr. Coburn and I started work over 3\\1/2\\ years ago to try to \nfigure out how you change the health care system to the most efficient, \nyet maintaining the same quality of care and innovation and \nbreakthrough, we went on a search. We went to States to look at \ncreative things that States had done. I daresay everybody trumpeted the \nreforms in Massachusetts. What we learned very early on was \nMassachusetts didn't have any reforms. They did coverage expansion. \nWhere they used to pay for it out of the right pocket, now they paid \nfor it out of the left pocket. They promised that coverage would be \nextensive and include everyone.\n  Where are we today, just a few years later? The companies they said \nthey would never send bills to, they are sending an additional \nsurcharge to the Massachusetts people, and they said everybody would be \ncovered. This year they are throwing people off the Massachusetts plan \nbecause they don't have enough money to cover them.\n  Real health care reform means we are going to make sure every \nAmerican has the resources to be covered or to be able to pay out of \npocket because the real boogeyman of health care today is the cost \nshift. It is cost that is incurred when a service is delivered to you \nthat the person or the institution delivering the service isn't \nreimbursed for. If they receive no payment for the service they \nprovide, then they have to shift the cost of delivery of that service \nover to somebody else. The somebody else is people who privately pay. \nThey either pay out of their pocket or they walk in with insurance, and \nthe cost of those services is shifted to everybody who falls into that \ncategory.\n  Up until this debate, most Americans had thought cost shift was only \ngenerated by people who had no insurance. What we have learned in this \ndebate is it doesn't stop there, that the cost shift is also initiated \nfrom somebody who is underinsured, meaning they haven't got enough \ninsurance to take care of the services they need. But it doesn't stop \nthere. For every beneficiary that Medicaid covers, we reimburse at an \naverage rate of 72 cents of every dollar of service provided, meaning \nfor the millions of Americans who are covered under every State \nMedicaid plan, we automatically cost shift 28 cents of every dollar of \nservice they get to the private side.\n  As a matter of fact, for the 35 to 40 million seniors under Medicare, \nwe reimburse at 91 cents for every dollar of service provided. \nTherefore, 9 cents is shifted in some fashion to the private pay side. \nNo wonder health insurance and the cost of health care has continued to \nrise at an unsustainable rate. It is because we keep growing the pool \nof people who don't provide 100 percent of the cost of the service \nprovided.\n  We are here debating a plan that they say is a reform. Well, I will \ngive them credit for this: They do cover 31 million Americans who are \nnot covered today. It still leaves 24 million Americans uninsured, \nuncovered, but they do cover 31 million. Fifty percent of that number, \n15 million Americans, are going to be thrown into Medicaid in the \nStates they live in. If the attempt is to reform health care, the first \nplace you start is with eliminating cost shift. The first place they \nhave started is to take the least-efficient medical delivery system in \nthe country, Medicaid, and jam 15 million Americans into it. Forget the \nfact that it is an unfunded mandate to the States at some point, after \nthe Federal Government pays 100 percent of the initial charge. We are \nexacerbating the problem that exists in health care today because we \nare putting 15 million new covered lives into Medicaid, and we know for \nevery dollar of services they get, we are going to cost shift 28 cents \nof that over to people who pay out of pocket or have insurance.\n\n[[Page S12512]]\n\n  The direction we have started in is flawed because we haven't tried \nto address the cost shift that exists in our health care system. \nSenator Coburn and I attacked that. After we got past Massachusetts, we \nlooked at innovative plans such as North Carolina's for Medicaid, where \nthey were making progress reaching new efficiencies and last year saved \n$200 million in their health care plan.\n  Most people don't know it, but Medicaid is an opt-out program. States \ncan choose to opt out.\n  That word has been used a lot as we talk about health care reform in \nthe United States, and that as long as you do an opt-out, we will be \nfine for a public option for the government-run system. Well, we have \none of those. It is called Medicaid. It is an opt-out government health \ncare program. How many States opt out? None. Why? Because the subsidy \nis so big they cannot do it.\n  But what happens when they want to change their plans? Let's go back \nto North Carolina. North Carolina would like to change their plan \nfurther, now that they have learned things they can do. They asked the \nCenters for Medicare and Medicaid Services for a waiver. Religiously, \nwhat happens? They are denied the waiver to change their health care \nplan to raise the quality and to reduce the cost.\n  Sound eerily similar to what we are talking about, potentially, in a \nhealth care plan we are going to roll out for the rest of the country? \nMaybe an opt-out plan where States could opt out, where they say it is \nnot a government takeover. Well, if you have to go to the government \nand ask their permission to change it, to increase the quality of the \ncare and to decrease the cost because of the efficiencies you get \nthrough how you design it, I will tell you that is a government-run \nplan, plain and simple.\n  We talked to self-insured companies. There was a gold mine of great \nideas from companies such as Dell, SAS, Safeway, and Pitney Bowes, \ncompanies that had frozen their health care costs year after year after \nyear. We had one simple question. How did you do it?\n  They looked at us and said: We invested in prevention, wellness, and \nchronic disease management--even to the degree that one company offered \nthe employees who had chronic disease the ability to have a program \nspecifically designed for them for free, if they would enter into the \nprogram. Employees in some cases chose not to go into it. The company \nturned around and financially rewarded them by writing them a check to \nget into the program.\n  At one company, when they wrote them a check, they had 80 percent \nenrollment, and in the first 18 months they saved $1,782 per employee. \nThat is real savings. That is bending the cost curve of health care \ndown. That is not what we are doing in this debate. Even the CBO says \nyou are going to spend almost $900 billion and you have to raise $900 \nbillion to do it because there is no savings because there is no \nreform.\n  So Senator Coburn and I went through that process, and we began to \nconstruct a bill. He did a majority of the work. What did we find? We \nfound that we needed massive insurance reform in this country. As he \nsaid earlier, you cannot be excluded if you have a preexisting \ncondition. You cannot be excluded because you get sick. What you have \nto have is competition.\n  Well, I will tell you, in this plan, where they say there is choice \nand competition and innovation, they actually mention choice 40 times, \nthey mention innovation 25 times, and, believe it or not, they mention \ncompetition 13 times. Yet when they talk about taxes, fees, and \nrevenues, they mention it 899 times. That gives the American people \nsome insight as to where the focus of this health care bill is.\n  Dr. Coburn and I went exactly the opposite way. This is not a reform \neffort that needs to be dominated by government. We chose the carrot \nversus the stick. In the bill on the Senate floor we are talking about, \nif an individual does not buy insurance, they are fined. They are fined \nif they do not buy insurance. We thought the Constitution said that if \nyou tax the American people, you have to do it equally. You have to \napply the same tax to this group that you do to that group.\n  Through equalizing the application of taxes in this country, we were \nable to come up with a plan that provided every American family $5,700 \nper year in refundable tax credits. So every American family would get \nthat $5,700 every year.\n  If, yes, we had that individual who was not married, and he or she \ngot a $2,800 refundable tax credit, and they did not use it, we gave \nthe States the option that they could opt them in. They could actually \nenroll them with that $2,800 into a high-risk catastrophic plan. We did \nnot penalize the individual. We took what the government had provided \nand made sure they had insurance so that the next weekend, if they were \nriding their Harley-Davidson and they had a wreck and they ended up in \nthe emergency room with no insurance, at least for the $200,000 bill to \nget them well, the hospital was not going to cost-shift that to \nsomebody else because they were going to have catastrophic insurance. \nMaybe the hospital had to eat the first $5,000. But after that, they \nhad an insurance policy.\n  But this is the difference in approaches. We are not penalizing the \nAmerican people. We want them to be part of a health care system that \nis reformed.\n  We looked at Medicaid. We saw this problem with a 28-percent cost-\nshift. We said we have to reform Medicaid. How do you do it? We gave \nStates the option: If you want to enroll your Medicaid beneficiaries \ninto this new plan that we created in this new competitive insurance \nmarket, then we will double the investment in your Medicaid \nbeneficiaries so they can have $10,000 worth of coverage through the \nprivate sector.\n  Again, we did not force them. We did what Dell did, what companies \ndid: we gave them cash because we think we can increase the quality and \ndecrease the overall cost.\n  Tort reform: Dr. Coburn has talked about tort reform. Every doctor \nhas talked about tort reform and defensive medicine, how it has run up \nthe cost of diagnostic procedures because you have to cover yourself \nfor the one lawsuit you get.\n  We came up with quite a unique approach to it. We gave States three \noptions. We gave them the ability to have arbitration, we gave them the \nstability to create a health court, and we said to States: If you adopt \nany one of these three options, we will give you a 1-percent bonus on \nyour Medicaid. You do not have to adopt the tort reform. But if you \nwant the 1-percent bonus on Medicaid, then you have to adopt one of the \nthree options we have put into it.\n  So, in essence, what are the three things we have done in our bill, \nwhich Dr. Coburn, once again, said was the first bill introduced in the \nCongress of the United States? I have sat on this floor, as Dr. Coburn \nhas, as many people have, and, yes; we have had a sharp exchange about \nwhat is in this bill and whether it is beneficial or whether it hurts. \nI happen to think it hurts. But I have also listened to folks on that \nside of the aisle say: When are Republicans going to offer something \nconstructive? When are they going to offer a pathway?\n  We have. We were the first. We were ignored. We will get an \nopportunity to debate it as we go through this. We will get an \nopportunity to vote on it, I can assure you. I do not expect it to \npass. But there are a lot of good things in here.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BURR. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. Does the Senator recall the vote in the HELP Committee \nwhen this bill was offered--this bill that allows you to keep whatever \nyou have, if you like it; this bill that gives no tax increases on \nAmerican families; this bill with no increase in taxes on American \nbusiness; this bill that lowers everybody's health insurance premium; \nthis bill that covers preexisting conditions, period; this bill that \nprotects seniors' high quality of care and keeps their choices; this \nbill that increases personal control over health care; this bill that \ndoes not do a Medicaid expansion but, instead, puts Medicaid patients \ninto real insurance so they can have the same choice as every other \nAmerican; this bill that protects physician-patient relationships; and \nthis bill that empowers patients, families, physicians, and providers, \nbut does not empower the government--what was the vote, does the \nSenator recall?\n\n[[Page S12513]]\n\n  Mr. BURR. All the Republicans voted for it and all the Democrats \nvoted against it.\n  Mr. COBURN. Exactly right. The difference is, you can either trust \npeople or you can put all your trust in a nanny state, and the nanny \nstate is running 61 percent, 60 percent of our health care today.\n  I thank the Senator for answering my question.\n  Mr. BURR. Let me conclude and give the floor back to the Senator.\n  There are three objectives Dr. Coburn and I set out to accomplish for \nall Americans in the bill. The first was to cover all Americans, make \nsure everybody had the capability to access affordable coverage.\n  Two, remember what the companies that were self-insured told us: \nInvest in prevention, wellness, and chronic disease management. The \nonly direct cost savings in health care today is prevention, wellness, \nand chronic disease management. There are a lot of indirect savings--\ntort reform, insurance reform, purchasing insurance across State \nlines--but the only direct savings comes from prevention, wellness, and \nchronic disease management.\n  Third, and probably most important, make sure it is financially \nsustainable.\n  Well, I do not know why, right now, we would create a health care \nplan in America that could not financially be sustainable for decades. \nWhy would we create a health care plan that for the current generation \nentering adulthood would not live with that health care plan in a \nfinancially sustainable fashion for their lives? This one will not. It \ncosts $2.5 trillion. It does not make it through the first 10 years.\n  Yet we have an option. It is an option that Republicans have already \nintroduced. We have let the American people see it. It is not 2,074 \npages. I think it is barely 240-some pages, and it incorporates much \nmore. Oh, by the way, it fulfills--it checks all the boxes the \nPresident said we needed to do when we started on health care reform. \nIt covers all the American people, is financially sustainable, \nmaintains the level of quality, and it bends the cost curve down.\n  What is the most disappointing thing out of this debate so far? It is \nthat we do not have to get down here to tell the American people this \nis going to cost them more. They know it. They know their insurance \npremium is going up if they have coverage today. They know the doctors \nare going to have to charge more because Medicare is going to cut its \nreimbursements. They know more doctors are going to drop seeing \nMedicaid beneficiaries because the reimbursements are going to continue \nto go down. The American people get it. That is why, in an overwhelming \nfashion, they are opposed to what we are here debating.\n  My hope is that at some point in this debate we will talk about some \nrational things, like what we have in the Patients' Choice Act. I do \nnot expect it to become law, but I expect reasonable people to accept \nthings that really do reform health care, and a lot of them are in this \nbill.\n  Madam President, I yield to my good friend.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, could I inquire of the Chair how much \ntime we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). There is 24 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I want to go back over some of the \nthings in the Patients' Choice Act because people ask me why they have \nnot heard of it, and it is because the press does not want to cover a \ncommonsense bill that does not spend money. The majority does not want \nto incorporate the ideas because it is not government-centered, it is \npatient-centered. We have a bill on the Senate floor that is totally \ngovernment-centered.\n  But what does the Patients' Choice Act do? Senator Burr alluded to a \nlot of it. But I want to go into it in a little bit of depth.\n  What it does it is looks at the five preventable diseases in this \ncountry that consume 75 percent of our dollars, five chronic diseases: \nheart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, \nand diabetes. They cause two-thirds of the deaths and consume 75 \npercent of our dollars. The Patients' Choice Act invests in preventing \nthose diseases.\n  The second thing it does is it creates affordable and accessible \nhealth insurance options--not government-run, not government-mandated, \nbut uses the experience of 50 States through exchanges and sets a \nfloor. What is the floor? The floor is the same level of care Members \nof Congress can get. That is the floor. But you get to choose. Nobody \nsays you have to have this.\n  Do you realize that 15 million Americans who are going to be forced \ninto Medicaid in this bill will not have any choice? They will just \nsay: You have Medicaid. And they will be denied 60 percent of the \ndoctors in this country.\n  It eliminates preexisting conditions. It eliminates the ability of an \ninsurance company to drop you if you are sick. You get offered health \ninsurance regardless of your age or regardless of your health. Yet we \nare saving trillions, and they are spending trillions.\n  What is the difference? What is the disconnect? It gives you, as \nSenator Burr talked about, an auto enrollment mechanism. If you choose \nto be irresponsible, that is fine, but the rest of us should not have \nto pay for your irresponsibility. So if you do not sign up, you have an \nautomatic enrollment with your tax credit that puts you in a very high \ndeductible plan, so if you have a catastrophic illness, the rest of us \ndo not have to pay for you.\n  It also allows States to join in pooling arrangements, or regional \nareas, where they increase their buying power through these exchanges.\n  Whatever you have today, if you like it, you really can keep it. That \nis not true in this bill that is coming across the Senate floor. There \nis an absolutely zero tax increase on American families, and it is not \ntrue in this bill on the floor. There is $500 billion worth of tax \nincreases on either families or businesses.\n  It lowers the cost of health insurance premiums. This one on the \nfloor says, at best, in the large group and medium group market, it is \ngoing to be about the same trajectory of twice the inflation rate. But \nif you are in the individual market, it is going to be 10 to 13 percent \nhigher. Our bill lowers everybody's cost. It protects the seniors' \nhigh-quality care and choices today. It doesn't pick winners and \nlosers; it allows patients to pick what is best for them. It increases \npatients' own personal control over their health care, and it converts \nMedicaid to a system where no longer are patients in Medicaid \ndiscriminated against because what we do is we buy them an insurance \nsystem--allow them to buy insurance where nobody will ever know they \nare a Medicaid patient, so nobody will ever know to deny them, because \nthe patient rate will be equivalent to anybody else in the insurance \nmarket. So we give them the same access.\n\n  We treat Medicaid as we treat Indian health care: Here is your health \ncare, but it is not as good, so tough it. Here is your health care. We \nknow the outcomes aren't as good. So what. Those aren't Tom Coburn's \nopinions. Those are published data where we know the outcome in \nMedicaid isn't as good as any of the other insurance programs or it is \nnot as good as people who are in the cash market even though they pay \nmore.\n  It protects patients and their caregivers' relationship. Finally, it \nempowers patients. It empowers mothers to make choices for their \nchildren; gives them a broad array of choices. It empowers, but it \ndoesn't empower the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government is failing in health care right now. It really \nisn't my ingenuity that came up with this chart, but since I am around \nmy three daughters and a lot of younger people who work for me on my \nstaff, this is a comparison of the Patients' Choice Act or the act we \nhave here. It is like comparing old Ma Bell to an iPhone.\n  The Patients' Choice Act is the iPhone.\n  A little over a decade ago, iPhones or even cell phones in general--\nwho would have thought they would be so widespread? Apple's iPhone was \nthe fastest growing smartphone of 2008, and its 2008 sales were 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes higher than 2007. Why the increase? Why did iPhone sales take \noff? What did they do? They are hugely popular because they are user \nfriendly and they allow tons of options and you get a personalized \niPhone experience that you control.\n  So what does an iPhone have to do with health care? Both sides of the \npolitical aisle rhetorically agree that\n\n[[Page S12514]]\n\nAmerican consumers prefer products that are personalized, that fit \ntheir needs, that are affordable, and that are portable. It sounds a \nlot like an iPhone. As a matter of fact, my colleagues across the aisle \nare now using the language ``choice and competition'' to try to sell \nthis monstrosity on the American people, the most massive expansion of \nFederal Government control since Johnson's Great Society.\n  The problem is that the policies in this bill would discard the \niPhone's individual choices and consumer control. But what it would \nembrace is Ma Bell, the old land line black phone with a rotary dial. \nThat is what we are going to embrace with this bill. We are not going \nto embrace the iPhone; we are going to embrace being locked to your \nhouse with limited choices, limited capability to expand your choices, \nand limited freedom.\n  Mr. BURR. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to.\n  Mr. BURR. My question is this: It sounds as though the Patients' \nChoice Act allows an individual to design the coverage to meet their \nage, their income, and their health condition.\n  Mr. COBURN. Absolutely right.\n  Mr. BURR. That is customizing your health care choice.\n  Mr. COBURN. It puts the consumer--i.e, the patient--in charge of \ntheir health care rather than the government in charge of their health \ncare.\n  Mr. BURR. So one could then conclude that the current legislation we \nare debating in the Senate not only limits but it takes away choices \nthat currently exist to seniors, to people who work, and to the younger \ngeneration.\n  Mr. COBURN. I don't think there is any question that is going to \nhappen. Actually, it is even going to be worse than that because we \nhave shrunk the differential for young people. If you are a young \nperson, listen to me. The cost of your insurance is going to double \nunder this bill. If you are a young couple or a young individual--and I \nam talking 40 and under, 24 to 40--your insurance is going to double \nunder this bill. What you are going to do, you are going to do this: \nYou are going to say, I am going to pay the tax rather than coverage \nfor insurance because it is financially much more important for me to \ndo that. And what we know is that between 6 million and 11 million \nyoung people are going to cancel their insurance under this bill, \naccording to a report put out by--and I will reference it here--Oliver \nWyman and Associates.\n  Mr. BURR. But typically children are a lot less expensive to insure \nbecause they are younger and they are healthier.\n  Mr. COBURN. What do you think is going to happen?\n  Mr. BURR. What happens?\n  Mr. COBURN. What is going to happen is the spread--the people who \nhave insurance, if you are over 40, because these young people drop \nout, your premium is going to go up. So what is available today because \nof the mix of people who are in the broad group of pools who are \ninsured--we are going to drop out young, healthy people, so that small \nyounger group insurance is going to go up. But because there are going \nto be 6 million to 11 million fewer of them and the insurance company \nkeeps them in the pot to lower the cost for the older ones, the 65 and \nabove, their premiums are going to go up.\n  So we are going to have exactly the opposite effect because when you \nmandate coverage and you force people to buy it with a big government \nprogram, people are going to make an economic decision--and the first \nyear of this is $250 is all you have to pay, and it goes up to $750--\nthey are going to say: Why would I do that? I will buy the insurance \nwhen I get sick.\n  So what we are going to do is totally disrupt--and it may be planned \nto be that way so we can come back and say: Well, look at the private \ninsurance industry. It is not working. The government needs to take it \nall over. I don't know that is the case, but the consequences of what \nthis bill is going to do----\n  Mr. BURR. From the way the Senator has described it, the current bill \nthat is being debated in the Senate really doesn't benefit anybody. \nEverybody loses.\n  Mr. COBURN. Oh, yes, it does. We will have at least 20,000 new \nFederal Government employees. It will benefit them. It will benefit the \nbureaucracies. It will give them power to control. It is not a soft \ncontrol or a light control; it is a heavy control. We will mandate on \nStates bankruptcy through Medicaid--mandate to the States--the mother \nof all mandates to the States. So it will benefit the Federal \nGovernment and the bureaucracy but will have minimal benefit for the \npatients in this country.\n  Mr. BURR. So at best, we can claim that the bill being debated in the \nSenate is a $2.5 trillion bill designed to try to stop waste, fraud, \nand abuse in the health care system.\n  Mr. COBURN. Supposedly.\n  Mr. BURR. Think about that. We are spending $2.5 trillion to try to \nget waste, fraud, and abuse out of just the government side of health \ncare. Yet the bill itself is making the government a bigger factor in \nhealth care, which means the likelihood is, because of the design not \nchanging, you have more waste, fraud, and abuse. So there is no real \nvalue to the $2.5 trillion, except to the government workers who are \nhired to either collect the fines and the new taxes or sit on the \npanels to determine who gets coverage and who doesn't.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, I wouldn't go quite that far. There is no question \nthat some people who have no coverage today will get Medicaid. But \ncompared to the Patients' Choice Act, they could get a private \ninsurance policy instead of Medicaid. They would get access to all of \nthe physicians, not just 60 percent of them.\n  Mr. BURR. And save $2.5 trillion of the American people's money.\n  Mr. COBURN. And save $2.5 trillion and have the flexibility of choice \nbased on what they need and what they perceive their children or family \nneeds.\n\n  So they do increase coverage, but how do they do it? They put you \ninto a substandard plan. They put you into a plan that doesn't give you \nthe same access Members of Congress have. They put 15 million people \ninto that, and they decrease the flexibility and choice for those \npeople, 11 million people, in Medicare, because we know better.\n  Mr. BURR. My good friend probably remembers the day we marked this up \nin the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee. As a matter of \nfact, it wasn't a day, it was 3\\1/2\\ weeks and 56\\1/2\\ hours, if I \nremember exactly. One of the amendments they accepted was an amendment \nthat is titled this: The 2220 rule. My good friend being a doctor would \nrecognize this was a program the Federal Government had to allow \nmedical students to delay the repayment of their student loans until \nthey actually got their practice up and running. That was eliminated \nabout 2 years ago. I am sure the good doctor remembers that was \naccepted under a UC in the committee. But if you read the 2,074 pages, \nit was noticeably absent in the 2220 rule. Yet, as you know, we have \nless than a million doctors in the United States of America trying to \nprovide medical coverage to 300 million people and growing. And some \nsuggest that if this bill passed, we would lose 25 percent of our \ndoctors in the first year who decided: This is it. I am going to \nretire. I am out of here.\n  The 2220 provision is the only thing we had in our bill that actually \ncreated an incentive for more individuals to seek medicine as a career.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, if I may inquire how much time we have \nremaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you.\n  Again, going back to incentive, carrots versus sticks, how is it that \nwe have a shortage of primary care physicians in the country? Why is \nthat? We have put a lot of money into medical schools. The States have \nput a lot of money into medical schools. We have student loans for \nphysicians who average about $170,000 in debt when they get out of \nthere. How is it that people don't want to be a pediatrician and a \ngeneral internist or a family practice doctor? Why is that?\n  Mr. BURR. Reimbursements.\n  Mr. COBURN. The reimbursements, where you can invest 1 additional \nyear in residency and double the income you can make from being a \nphysician.\n  How did the payment rates get where they are? Who set the payment \nrates? The Federal Government set the payment rates because 60 percent \nof the payments to private physicians come from Medicare, Medicaid, \nTRICARE.\n  Mr. BURR. Indian Health.\n\n[[Page S12515]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Those are contracted. Those are even lower. So they set \nthem. Private insurance sets all the rates based on what the government \ndoes. So the government has created a shortage of primary care which we \nare going to see just explode as we put other people--the CBO has \nrightly said, if you add lots of people, you will get some increased \nutilization, a significant amount. They are not there. They are not \nthere.\n  So you take somebody in their late fifties, mid- to late fifties or \nearly sixties, who planned on practicing 10 or 15 years, and all of a \nsudden you say--and we don't in this bill. We had the claim today that \nthis extends the life of Medicare. Well, here is how it does that. It \nuses the Medicare Advisory Commission to force cuts in Medicare, not \nfraud necessarily, just cuts. It doesn't pay for the doctor fix, which \nis $250 billion, and then it cuts Medicare.\n  So the reason--and I don't have any problem extending the life of \nMedicare--I think so--but it ought to be all about fraud. It ought to \nbe all about--the vast majority of fraud in health care today is \nthrough government programs, not the private sector. The fraud rate in \nthe private sector is less than 1 percent. Here we have $150 billion. \nWe could save $1 trillion over the next 10 years if we had an effective \nfraud program, which this bill minimally addresses, which our bill \naggressively addresses--aggressively addresses. We even have undercover \npatients, undercover doctors where we create sting operations to put \npeople in jail--not fine them, not ban them from Medicare; we put them \nin jail if you are stealing from the American people.\n  There is nothing anywhere close to that in this bill. So, in fact, we \nare aggressively going after the largest problem of the $800 billion \nthat is wasted every year, which is fraud.\n  The second largest problem is we need to incentivize the States to \nfix the tort extortion that is going on in this country that causes \npeople to have tests done on them, not necessarily without any \nconsequence to their health, and money wasted on tests so the doctors \ncan be in a better defensive position.\n  Mr. BURR. How could a group such as AARP, whose primary role, by \ndesign, is to represent our Nation's seniors, be in favor of a reform \npackage that doesn't provide any additional benefits to our Nation's \nseniors?\n  Mr. COBURN. And it doesn't reform. I have wondered that.\n  Mr. BURR. As the Senator knows, we drastically cut Medicare \nAdvantage, the only private sector option that a senior has for \ncoverage. We basically eliminate that. That is 11 million seniors in \nthis country.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, we have protected some through earmarks in this \nbill--certain States; we have protected some. In some States, if you \nhave Medicare Advantage, you are protected. In other States, if you \ndon't happen to be on that side of the aisle, or you don't need help in \nyour reelection, you don't get that.\n  Mr. BURR. If somebody didn't have Medicare Advantage as a choice, \nwhat insurance product would they have to go into the marketplace to \nbuy?\n  Mr. COBURN. If they could afford it--and that is where a large number \nof Medicare Advantage people will be hurt; most of those people cannot \nafford to buy a supplemental policy. The fifth largest seller of \ninsurance policies in the country happens to be AARP.\n  Mr. BURR. AARP, yes. So to eliminate Medicare Advantage is a \ntremendous financial windfall to AARP.\n  Mr. COBURN. For AARP.\n  Mr. BURR. That association supposedly looking out over the seniors in \nthis country.\n  Mr. COBURN. We are fairly cynical, and we don't mean to be. We need \nto wrap up, if we can. There are two ways of fixing health care in this \ncountry. One is, we have the government running it--I make this point. \nEverybody agrees that in 2017 or 2019, Medicare will go belly up. \nMedicaid is already belly up. They are all in trouble. They are running \ndeficits. The Census is broke. Social Security is going to be broke. \nThe U.S. Post Office is absolutely broke. Cash for clunkers was broke \nbefore we started. The highway trust fund is $18 billion in the red. \nAnd we are going to put another 16 percent of health care--76 percent \ninstead of 60--in the hands of the government. Or we can utilize what \nwe know works, which if you incentivize the management of chronic \ndisease and incentivize prevention, incentivize transparency, and you \ncreate a way for people to have access, the Patients' Choice Act will \ninsure 94 percent of Americans with a real insurance policy, not \nMedicaid or Indian health care.\n  By the way, Native Americans, listen up. Under our bill, if you are \ndue health care, you get a card and you can go anywhere you want and it \nwill be paid for. We need to do that for veterans, too.\n  The point is there is a choice. We can run a large government option \nor we can run a small government with 50 States, incentivizing them to \ndo the right and best thing for their citizens, where we will actually \nlower costs, increase access, and have better care, and we won't \ndestroy the best health care system in the world.\n  I challenge my colleagues to come down here to the floor and debate \nme on that, because I guarantee you that in their families I can find \nsomebody who was saved because they lived in this country and, had they \nnot, they would not be alive. It is the best health care system in the \nworld. Why should we destroy that as we try to fix what is wrong in \nhealth care in America today?\n  Mr. BURR. I ask my colleague to put that next chart up.\n  I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, this is self-explanatory, I think. Today \nwe are borrowing 43 cents out of every dollar we spend; 43 cents of \nevery dollar we spend in the Federal Government we are borrowing from \nsomebody. You know, we talk about these unbelievable numbers in \nWashington--billions and trillions. The most popular bumper sticker out \nthere is this: Don't tell Congress what comes after a trillion. \nPersonally, I don't want to know, because I know if we get there, we \nare at the point of no return. Senator Coburn and I are close to the \nsame age. We have kids just getting started raising families. We know \nwhat they are going to be faced with to raise their families, to make \nsure their children and grandchildren get educations, to make sure they \ngo to college and have that opportunity, and make sure they have an \nopportunity after that for a place to work and an income. Do you know \nwhat is going to be the thing that dictates most of what they are faced \nwith? It is right there on that chart. For every penny we borrow, it \nmeans we have an obligation to pay interest on that penny. Today \ninterest is practically zero. We provide, as a Federal Government, \nmoney to banks they can lend out, and we charge them practically zero. \nThat will not last forever. At some point, interest rates will go up.\n  Depending upon how much money we have borrowed, that will dictate how \nmuch we are obligated to pay in interest.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me interrupt my colleague. Here is what the \nconstellations show. Walk with me slowly. If you are 25 years of age or \nyounger today in America--and we go out 20 years--that will be 45 and \nyounger--that is 103 million Americans who will be in that group. Here \nis what they are each going to owe based on the unfunded liabilities of \nMedicare, Medicaid, and Social Security: 103 million Americans, 45 \nyears and younger, will each owe $1.119 million. That is what they will \nbe responsible for. They will have to pay the average interest on that, \nwhich will be about 6 percent. Before they ever pay the first bit of \nincome taxes, they will have to cover that interest; otherwise, that \nwill grow.\n  How does that fit a young family 20 years from now? We are talking \nabout tax rates that allow no increased standard of living. As a matter \nof fact, they are rates that decrease the standard of living by 35 \npercent. That is the heritage we are creating and what we are going to \nexpand with this health care bill the majority leader has brought to \nthe floor. We are going to steal the future and the opportunity for \nthose 25 years and younger today, because we cannot live and make the \nhard choices that are necessary, and we think the answer to every \nproblem is more government, rather than more personal responsibility, \ncompetition, transparency in a market, and incentivizing people to do \nthe right\n\n[[Page S12516]]\n\nthing, rather than punishing them when they do the wrong thing.\n  Mr. BURR. The Senator is absolutely correct. What we can only hope to \npass on to the next generation is an opportunity equal to what we have \nhad. To strap them with this debt, to continue to go down this road and \npile on the obligations, we will limit the next generation's \nopportunity. As you choke that opportunity for them, you will choke the \nfabric of this country in a way that the problems we are faced with \ntoday are minor in comparison to what they will deal with in the \nfuture.\n  As we sit here and debate the pluses and minuses of this health care \nlegislation, I remind my colleagues, when you talk about $2.5 \ntrillion--and you probably never will save that money out of Medicare; \nyou probably never will cut that doctors' reimbursement quite as much \nas in there--every time you don't do that, we are borrowing 43 cents of \nevery dollar we spend. That is the obligation our children will inherit \nfrom us.\n  I am not willing to do that anymore. I want to make sure we are \nfocused on the opportunity that is there for them. We can only do that \nif we do it in a responsible way, do the right thing as it relates to \nhealth care here.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no \namendments be in order to the pending amendments prior to the votes on \nSunday, December 6.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/05/senate-section/article/S12516-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12516]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. PRYOR.

Madam President, I rise today to talk about Shane Bauer, \nSarah Shourd, and Josh Fattal. These three young Americans have been in \ncustody in Iran since July 31, 2009. That is more than 4 months.\n  Shane is from Minnesota, where his devoted mother, Cindy Hickey, \nstill lives. I have been in constant and close touch with Cindy over \nthe phone, and last month I was able to meet with all the families of \nthe young hikers, and they have been back in Washington again this \nweek. I have to say, they are a remarkable group of people who want \nnothing more than to be reunited with their children. On behalf of \ntheir families, I have come to the floor today to urge the Government \nof Iran to make a humanitarian gesture and release these young \nAmericans so they can be together with their families again.\n  As many of you know, Josh, Sarah, and Shane were hiking near the \nIraqi-Iranian border in a remote region that is famous for a beautiful \nwaterfall when they were taken into custody by Iranian authorities. The \nIranians have indicated that the Americans strayed across the border in \nthis remote region. There can be no doubt that it was an accident. Four \nmonths later, Josh, Sarah, and Shane remain in prison in Iran.\n  The Iranian Government has allowed the Swiss Embassy, in its capacity \nas protection power for U.S. interests in Iran, to have consular access \nto them twice during the time they have been held. I hope this will \ncontinue, and continue more regularly.\n  The Swiss have been enormously helpful in working with us to resolve \nthe situation to bring these Americans home. I have been assured by one \nof the Swiss that Josh, Sarah, and Shane were all in decent physical \ncondition as of the last visit. But it is also clear the imprisonment \nis taking its toll on these young people.\n\n  The President of Iran has indicated that their case will be examined \nexpeditiously and with compassion, which is encouraging. President \nAhmedinejad first made that statement around the time the U.N. General \nAssembly met this past September.\n  These young American tourists find themselves in unfortunate \ncircumstances. One thing is clear: These circumstances do and should \nhave nothing to do with politics. I hope that Josh, Sarah, and Shane's \nsituation can be resolved on the same basis--as purely a human gesture \nby the Government of Iran. I understand that people on all sides tend \nto get caught in the middle of geopolitical events they have nothing to \ndo with. That is a cycle that can and should be stopped. We do not want \nto perpetuate that cycle. Above all, I hope the Iranian Government will \nrecognize that these Americans have committed nothing more than an \ninnocent mistake and want nothing more than to be brought back together \nwith their families. The Americans should be released.\n  In the meantime, I hope Josh, Sarah, and Shane will be able to speak \nwith their families by phone immediately. That would be the first \ndirect contact they have had since their detention over 4 months ago.\n  As we approach the holiday season and the end of the year, this is an \nespecially important time for families to be together. That is not an \nAmerican value or an Iranian value, it is a human value. It is my \nfervent hope that Josh, Sarah, and Shane will be brought back together \nwith their families now. I urge the Government of Iran to make a \nhumanitarian gesture and make that family reunion possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/05/senate-section/article/S12516-3", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S12516-S12517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL COSPONSORS\n\n\n                                 S. 605\n\n  At the request of Mr. Kaufman, the name of the Senator from Utah (Mr. \nHatch) was added as a cosponsor of S. 605, a bill to require the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to reinstate the uptick rule and \neffectively regulate abusive short selling activities.\n\n\n                                S. 1857\n\n  At the request of Ms. Stabenow, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n(Ms. Mikulski) was added as a cosponsor of S. 1857, a bill to establish \nnational centers of excellence for the treatment of depressive and \nbipolar disorders.\n\n\n                                S. 2833\n\n  At the request of Mr. Reed, the name of the Senator from Minnesota \n(Mr. Franken) was added as a cosponsor of S. 2833, a bill to provide \nadjusted Federal medical assistance percentage rates during a \ntransitional assistance period.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2789\n\n  At the request of Mr. Coburn, the name of the Senator from Wisconsin \n(Mr. Feingold) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 2789 intended \nto be proposed to H.R. 3590, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case of \nmembers of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal employees, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2871\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from Maryland \n(Mr. Cardin) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 2871 intended to \nbe proposed to H.R. 3590, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case of members \nof the Armed Forces and certain other Federal employees, and for other \npurposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2882\n\n  At the request of Mr. Johanns, the names of the Senator from Kansas \n(Mr. Roberts) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson) were added as \ncosponsors of amendment No. 2882 intended to be proposed to H.R. 3590, \na bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify the first-\ntime homebuyers credit in the case of members of the Armed Forces and \ncertain other Federal employees, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2884\n\n  At the request of Ms. Stabenow, the name of the Senator from Oregon \n(Mr. Wyden) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 2884 intended to \nbe proposed to H.R. 3590, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case of members \nof the Armed\n\n[[Page S12517]]\n\nForces and certain other Federal employees, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2895\n\n  At the request of Mr. Brown, the name of the Senator from Michigan \n(Ms. Stabenow) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 2895 intended \nto be proposed to H.R. 3590, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case of \nmembers of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal employees, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2905\n\n  At the request of Mr. Baucus, the name of the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. \n2905 proposed to H.R. 3590, a bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code \nof 1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case of \nmembers of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal employees, and \nfor other purposes.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 2921\n\n  At the request of Ms. Stabenow, the name of the Senator from \nMinnesota (Mr. Franken) was added as a cosponsor of amendment No. 2921 \nintended to be proposed to H.R. 3590, a bill to amend the Internal \nRevenue Code of 1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the \ncase of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \nemployees, and for other purposes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/05/senate-section/article/S12517-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S12517]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2924.
