Madam President, I applaud and commend my friend, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee, Senator Chris Dodd, \nfor the bill we have on the floor. I also express my appreciation for \nthe work done by the chair of the Agriculture Committee, Senator \nBlanche Lincoln. The work of these committees is the bill on which we \nare working, offering amendments to this most important piece of \nlegislation. The bill that is now before the Senate is a strong bill. I \nagain express my appreciation to the two chairs for the good work they \nhave done.\n  This bill will hold Wall Street accountable and put consumers in \ncontrol. It ends taxpayer bailouts and guarantees taxpayers will never \nagain be forced to bail out reckless Wall Street firms by creating a \nway to liquidate failed firms without taxpayer money. That is going to \nbe underlined and underscored with an amendment that is first up, the \nBoxer amendment, which indicates that is, in fact, the case. It ends \ntoo big to fail with strict new capital and leverage requirements to \nprevent firms from growing too big to fail. It brings sunlight and \ntransparency to shadowy markets.\n  It was really a revelation to me to read a book entitled ``The Big \nShort'' by Michael Lewis, who wrote the book that was made into a movie \nand received an Academy Award, ``The Blind Side.'' This book is good. \nIt indicates to anyone who reads it the shadowy markets which are now \nin existence and which we are trying to stop. This legislation will \nstop them by bringing in sunlight and transparency, where Wall Street \nexecutives make gambles that threaten the entire economy.\n  The legislation reins in CEO pay by giving shareholders a nonbinding \nvote on excessive compensation. It, again, brings this into the light. \nIt protects community banks and streamlines bank supervision to create \nclarity and accountability. It protects a dual banking system that \nsupports community banks and protects consumers in many different ways. \nIt puts a new cop on the beat, creates an independent agency with broad \nauthority to monitor firms for abusive practices, and we allow \nintervention to protect consumers.\n  An important provision the American public will easily identify with: \nit guarantees clear information in plain English and ensures consumers \nget the information they need to shop for mortgages, credit cards, and \nother financial products, that it will be in English they can \nunderstand. There are no more abusive practices. It protects consumers \nfrom hidden fees, abusive terms, and deceptive practices. It also \nprotects against Bernie Madoff-type scams. It is a strong piece of \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page S3052]]\n\n  There will be efforts made to make it even stronger with amendments \non our side. We hope Republicans will join with us in passing this \nlegislation. There are some who have said that by the time this bill \ngets off the floor, a significant majority of Senators will vote for \nit. I hope that is the case.\n  I also hope we don't get locked into something that appears to be the \norder of the Congress around here; that is, everything has to have 60 \nvotes. I can't speak for everyone, but I will certainly do everything \nwithin my power to tell my Senators, let's just have 50-vote margins. \nWhy do we need to have 60 votes on everything we do around here? It \nmakes it so much more difficult. I believe it is unnecessary.\n  I hope we can move forward and get this legislation done. We have to \nfinish it by next week. We will finish it one way or the other by next \nweek. We have to do that. We have so much more to do. We have the \nexpiring provisions of the tax extenders. Unemployment benefits will \nexpire at the end of this month. We have the doctors, and we have to \ntake care of them. That is a commitment we made, all of us, Democrats \nand Republicans--that we would take care of the doctors with the SGR. \nWe were able to pass, with pay-go, a 5-year fix. They have a 10-year \nfix on the House side. But we have to take care of these doctors. They \ndeserve that. We have to do that before the end of this month. There \nare other important issues we would like to deal with. We have small \nbusiness we would like to deal with. There are many good things we can \ndo there that have partisan agreement, and we can move forward.\n  I hope we can move quickly on this legislation. I hope there can be \nsome work with the two managers to move this legislation along, the two \ninitial managers, Senators Dodd and Shelby, who will manage most of \nthis bill. When we get into the derivative section, Senators Lincoln \nand Chambliss will be managing that part.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3052-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3052]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, Americans were happy to learn this \nmorning that late last night Federal and local officials in New York \nCity apprehended the man they believe to have attempted a terrorist \nattack in Times Square on Saturday.\n  I join all Americans in thanking the law enforcement officials who \nworked around the clock these past two days. It looks like they got \ntheir man, and we are grateful for their efforts on our behalf.\n  It is my understanding that the suspect, a naturalized American \ncitizen, is a native of Pakistan and that he traveled there at some \npoint in the past year. Hopefully the appropriate officials are using \nthis opportunity to exploit as much intelligence as he may have about \nhis overseas connections and any other plots against Americans either \nhere or abroad.\n  But this is very good news, and again, we want to thank those who \nwork so hard to keep us safe and to protect us from ongoing threats.

Tragically, four people have been confirmed dead as a result \nof flooding in Madison, Barren, Allen, and Lincoln Counties.\n  My office has been in contact with the Governor's office, and we will \ndo all we can to assist him. It is my understanding that Governor \nBeshear has spoken with the President about the situation and that FEMA \nis already working with State authorities in Kentucky to render \nassistance.\n  Our prayers are with the victims of the flooding in both the \nCommonwealth and in her sister State of Tennessee and our gratitude \ngoes out to the first responders and emergency personnel rendering aid \nto the impacted communities.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, we all agree our financial system \nshould never again be on the brink of total collapse. We all agree we \nmust never again allow Americans to fall victim to the unconscionable \nrecklessness and unbridled greed we have seen over the last decade. No \nlonger should a no-show regulatory attitude rob Americans of their \njobs, of their homes, of their retirement savings, of their credit \nratings, and the list goes on and on. We all agree American taxpayers \nshould never again have to foot the bill for bailouts to the very firms \nwhose cowboy attitudes got us into this mess in the first place.\n  So how do we put a stop to the madness that left our economy in a \nshambles? We stop it in its tracks. That means hard decisions. It means \ndecisive action. It means doing more than taking action when we \nrecognize the symptoms of collapse. It doesn't mean waiting until it is \ntoo late and too many people suffer. It means eliminating the \ningredients of collapse.\n  Chairman Dodd's bill is strong. It sets the stage for recognizing \ntrouble, and it helps use regulatory tools to reverse it.\n  Senator Kaufman and I think we owe it to the American people to take \none more significant step. We need to take action now so trouble never \nhas the chance to brew. That means taking on the financial institutions \nthat are too big to fail and doing that now and doing that in this \nbill.\n  Former FDIC Chair William Isaac said these institutions are ``too big \nto manage and too big to regulate.'' Senator Kaufman and I want to do \nmore than monitor banks that must be bailed out if they gamble \nthemselves into a corner. We want to put a hard limit on the size of \nthese behemoth banks so they don't control so much of our economy that, \ncome crisis time, we have to save them; we have to bail them out to \nsave the economy. We want to limit their size so they can't back \ntaxpayers into a corner, where it is either help them or hurt \nourselves. We don't want that obsequent choice. We think that should be \na concern whether it comes through acquisition or organic growth. \nCertainly, risk is the biggest problem, but size is almost as big a \nproblem, and together they can spell disaster. Our measure only affects \nthe six largest megabanks.\n\n[[Page S3053]]\n\n  As this chart shows--and I have cited it often in recent weeks--the \nassets of these six banks, the assets of the largest six banks in the \nUnited States 15 years ago was 17 percent of gross domestic product. \nThe total assets of the six largest banks today are 63 percent of gross \ndomestic product. Seventeen percent of gross domestic product 15 years \nago, six largest banks, 63 percent of gross domestic product today. \nThese banks have $9 trillion--that is $9,000 billion--in assets.\n  Research shows that a bank's size stops providing benefits to its \ncustomers once it reaches approximately $100 billion. So we can get all \nthe economies of scale in a bank with $100 billion--$100,000 million. \nThose are large banks, $100 billion banks. You can get the economies of \nscale with $100 billion banks. You don't need a $1\\1/2\\ trillion bank.\n  I have heard some argue that smaller banks are actually less stable \nthan larger banks. Evidence shows, though, that larger banks actually \nexhibit greater risk due to the higher volatility of their assets and \ntheir activities. Look what happened in the last 2 years. The simplest, \nmost effective way to manage this risk is to spread it out, to have \nseveral modestly sized institutions instead of a few giant ones. But \nthe risk in the financial system is clearly collecting in a few \ngigantic banks.\n  This chart shows the industry concentration in top bank holding \ncompanies. When Gramm-Leach-Bliley passed in 1999, the five biggest \nbanks had 38 percent of the assets of the financial industry. Today \nthey hold 52 percent. So we can add up all the community banks in my \nState--and there are dozens and dozens of them and they serve the \ncommunities well--you can add up all the regional banks in my State; \nyou can add up KeyBank and Fifth Third and Huntington and 1st Mariner--\nall the regional banks--and when we do that all over the country, these \nfive banks still have most of the assets. Five banks have 52 percent of \nthe assets.\n  I know some people think it is too late--the horses are out of the \nbarn--and we can't go back to a time when we had a group of 15 modestly \nsized banks, as opposed to 6 gargantuan banks. We allowed big financial \nfirms to merge into giant ones, and that led to a $4 trillion bailout. \nIn the last few decades, the banking industry has become so \nconcentrated it no longer functions as a competitive market. Since \n1990, the 20 largest financial firms have increased their control of \nbanking assets. They once controlled 35 percent. They now control 70 \npercent. Some firms are now 30 percent, 40 percent, in some cases, \nlarger than they had been before the crisis.\n  So what does it mean? We are twiddling our thumbs as Wall Street, \nonce again, places our Nation at risk.\n  Former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan said:\n\n       In 1911, we broke up Standard Oil. So what happened? The \n     individual parts became more valuable than the whole. Maybe \n     that's what we need to do.\n\n  This is Alan Greenspan, who clearly has never come down on this side \non issues such as this.\n  President Franklin Roosevelt investigated and imposed structural \nregulations on utilities through the Public Utility Holding Company of \n1935. That worked for the prosperity of business, and it worked for the \nprosperity of the country as a whole.\n  In 1984, the court split AT into a group of regional Bells. That \nworked for business. That worked for the country as a whole.\n  In all these cases, size was detrimental to the marketplace. Now \nthese megabanks have grown so large they control the fate of our \neconomy.\n  The large banks have effectively become huge securities and \nderivatives trading operations grafted on top of commercial banks. \nRight now they are using their trading businesses, and they are \nneglecting their lending businesses. Ask people in Hanover. Ask people \nin Mansfield. Ask people in Toledo or Shelby, OH. Ask small businesses, \nand they will tell you they simply can't get the credit they need for \nmanufacturing and other kinds of small businesses.\n  These large banks have too often put a virtual freeze on lending to \nsmall businesses, despite receiving a taxpayer bailout. Three of the \nlargest banks slashed their SBA lending by 86 percent from 2008 to \n2009. In Ohio, SBA-backed loans went from 4,200 in 2007 to 2,100--cut \nin half--in 2009.\n  I have heard from manufacturers and entrepreneurs, from energy \nstartups and mom-and-pop operations, from small business owners to the \nlocal corner store operator, all part of the middle class who are \nstruggling to get the credit they need to hire their workers.\n  Our amendment simply says too big to fail is too big.\n  We are going to call up the amendment sometime this week. Senator \nKaufman is one of many cosponsors who played a major role in crafting \nthis legislation.\n  I yield to Senator Kaufman.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Senator. I think Senator Brown has given a \npresentation that is perfect and that explains this. I am just going to \nmake a few points. I gave a speech on the floor yesterday, if anybody \nis interested in more detail.\n  Let's look at some charts that kind of take what Senator Brown says \nand slices and dices it in a slightly different way.\n  This is the average assets relative to gross domestic product of U.S. \ncommercial banks. Would anybody like to guess when Glass-Steagall was \nrepealed? How about right about here. I don't know if my colleagues \nhave seen the charts. One of the reasons I thought there was a housing \nbubble is, if you look at the charts on the housing industry in \nAmerica, the price of housing in this country from 1990 until about \n2003 was just like that and then it went right through the roof. This \nis a very bad sign in anything. The fact that our banks are operating \nthis thing is truly scary.\n  Let me show my colleagues another chart. This is average assets \nrelative to GDP. This is the concentration of the U.S. banking system. \nDoes that chart look familiar? Let me tell my colleagues the worst \nthing about this. This does not include what we did during the \nmeltdown, when we took Washington Mutual and pushed it into JPMorgan \nChase, when we took Merrill Lynch and pushed it into Bank of America, \nand when we took Wachovia and pushed it into Wells Fargo. That doesn't \neven include this. We can only imagine where this line would be now. I \nhave to get the chart updated. This is incredible. Of course, the red \nline is when we passed Glass-Steagall.\n  So the clear indicator is Glass Steagall. In 1929, we had a credit \nmeltdown in this country. Our forbears on this very floor said we have \nto do something about it. We have to pass laws, not go back to the \nregulators who didn't serve us well over the last 8 years--no, no. We \nhave to pass laws. So we passed Glass-Steagall that not only said you \ncan't be a commercial bank and an investment bank under the same roof--\nwhich, when I was in school, we learned was one of the basics for our \nsuccess and why we went 60 years without a bank panic, which we had all \nthrough the 19th century and right up to 1929.\n  We should not have investment banks and commercial banks under the \nsame roof. Commercial banks should be there to protect the small \ninvestor, the small depositor, make sure it is safe, and that is why we \ngave it guaranteed FDIC insurance. We never thought we would have FDIC \ninsurance for an organization that had investment banking in it.\n  Commercial banking should be a low-risk, basically low-return \nbusiness. That is what we wanted. That is what the vast majority of \nAmericans have at their local bank. It should not be included under the \nsame roof as an investment banking operation that is high risk, high \nreturn. We could have had this argument 5 years ago, and I would have \nsaid: Oh, that is a good argument. Let's talk about it. Let's see what \nhappened and how we got to where we are.\n  The other sentiment we hear, just to expound on some of the points \nmade by my colleague from Ohio: We can't break up the banks. You don't \nunderstand, Ted. We need these banks to compete internationally.\n  Let me get one thing straight. Do my colleagues know what we are \ngoing to do under our bill if Brown-Kaufman passes? We are going to ask \nCitigroup to go back to what they were in 2003. Was Citigroup competing \ninternationally in 2003? I think they were. So we\n\n[[Page S3054]]\n\nare not saying we are going to take them apart. All we are trying to do \nis get them back to what they were.\n  Goldman Sachs. The balance sheet of an investment bank such as \nGoldman Sachs will be scaled down from $850 billion to a more \nreasonable level of above $300 billion or around $450 billion. That \nsounds pretty draconian, right? We are asking them to go from $850 \nbillion down to $450 billion. Would anybody like to guess what Goldman \nSachs' assets were in 2003? Would you believe $100 billion? We are \nallowing them to grow to 3\\1/2\\ to 4 times the size they were in 2003.\n  One of the people who didn't do real well during this last crisis was \nAlan Greenspan. He is the one who said self-regulation works. He said a \nwhole lot of other things, but he said two very important things \nregarding where we are right now. One of them is the quote Senator \nBrown used: Too big to fail is too big. This is Alan Greenspan. This is \nnot some populist in bib overalls, with a pitchfork in the middle of \nthe streets raising his hands. This is Alan Greenspan.\n  I have to read this. You have to believe this. The next time somebody \ntells you we need these banks to compete and they need economies of \nscale, listen to what Alan Greenspan says:\n\n       For years the Federal Reserve had been concerned about the \n     ever larger size of our financial institutions.\n\n  Alan Greenspan:\n\n       Federal Reserve research has been unable to find economies \n     of scale in banking beyond a modest-sized institution.\n\n  There is a fellow named Andrew Haldane, who is the executive director \nof the Bank of England. Do my colleagues know what he says the size is? \nHe says $100 billion. That is what Haldane says. I commend everybody to \nread his report. It is very good. Just realize right now we have banks \nin this country that are $2 trillion and Haldane says $100 billion. \nGreenspan says we can't find economies of scale beyond a modest-sized \ninstitution.\n  Alan Greenspan:\n\n       A decade ago, citing such evidence, I noted that megabanks \n     being formed by growth and consolidation are increasingly \n     complex entities that create the potential for unusually \n     large systemic risks in the national and international \n     economy should they fail.\n\n  That is exactly what Senator Brown and I have been saying and what a \nnumber of us have been saying about where we are. But this is Alan \nGreenspan:\n\n       Regrettably, we did little to address the problem.\n\n  I just hope 2 years from now--I will not be here--somebody on the \nfloor will not be saying: Regrettably, in 2010, we did little to \naddress this problem.\n  This seems, to me, to be so incredibly complex but at the same time \nso incredibly simple. I just ask my colleagues, every time someone says \nsomething about the Brown-Kaufman bill, Maria Cantwell and John \nMcCain's bill or the bill being offered by Senator Levin and Senator \nMerkley, ask this question when they start laying out the problems: Are \nour banks too big, No. 1; and No. 2, are they too big to fail?\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I thank the Senator from \nDelaware.\n  It is so clear, first of all, that the Dodd bill is a huge step, a \ngood step, a solid bill in reforming Wall Street.\n  It is what we ought to do. There will be three or four major chances. \nOne of them is the amendment Senator Kaufman and I are working on. \nThere will be three or four major votes coming up to strengthen the \nbill. There will be efforts--particularly from my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle--to weaken the bill. There are clearly many \npeople in this institution who want to do the work of Wall Street, and \nWall Street has always been their benefactor. The big banks are their \nallies. They may do their bidding on the Senate floor. There will be \nefforts to strengthen the bill, such as Merkley-Levin, and some of the \nwork we do with derivatives.\n  Let me close and put a bit of a human face on this. This is technical \nstuff. When you look at these charts that we put up and what happened \nwith the size of these banks--again, I cite this number that astounds \nme every time I think about it: Only 15 years ago, the largest 6 banks \nin the country had assets of 17 percent of GDP. Today, it is 63 percent \nof GDP--some $9 trillion. Those are astounding numbers.\n  Let me shift and put a bit of a human face on what this means. I want \nto share two quick letters, one from someone in Columbus, and one in \nLorain. Joann, from Franklin County, says this:\n\n       As a small family-owned business owner, I'm trying to find \n     help to keep our business open. Our 20 employees and their \n     families count on us to continue operating. They will end up \n     unemployed and looking for work if we can't keep money \n     flowing.\n\n  They cannot get the kind of credit they need from these banks.\n\n       My neighbor had to close her business; she cut prices, \n     selling everything she could. Now she works two part-time \n     jobs. The building her store was in sits empty. Banks didn't \n     help her either.\n       The banking industry is responsible for the economic crash. \n     They should be assisting businessowners. Keeping us in \n     business means jobs. Shutting us down is not helping the \n     economy recover.\n\n  Senator Kaufman and I don't want retribution from the banks. We want \nthe banks to pull their load and start treating small businesses and \nconsumers more fairly. They should be assisting businesses.\n  Barbara, from Lorain County, west of Cleveland, says this:\n\n       Please stand up for the working folk of the middle class. \n     As a law-abiding taxpayer, I believe that it is time for \n     fiscal integrity of the U.S. bankers.\n       We are holding on to our jobs and homes by a thread. There \n     are also many people in Lorain County out of work and \n     businesses continue to close their doors.\n       I'm sure that there is no one single, simple solution, but \n     holding the bankers responsible for what happened in our \n     financial [industry and our country], but it is necessary to \n     help remedy the financial crisis that most of us are in.\n       Please support law-abiding people by demanding integrity of \n     the banking industry. We are depending on you.\n\n  There are many people in my State of Ohio, and also in Dover and \nWilmington, DE, in the banking industry. When institutions get this \nlarge--when six institutions have this kind of economic power in our \nsystem, we know that even someone as conservative as Alan Greenspan \nsays that is a problem for our economy, risk is a big problem, size is \na problem. This amendment will affect only the six largest banks in the \ncountry. They will operate better and more efficiently, and probably \nmore profitably, if they are a little bit smaller. This addresses that \nissue.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I have a comment. I see common cause \nhere with the other side of the aisle. When I talk to colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, it is not just the small businesses, it is the \nsmall banks that get hurt by these massive banks. I am a market guy. I \nam a free market guy. It is one of the things that made this country \ngreat. There are two things, democracy and our capital markets. We \nalmost lost our capital markets in 2008. We cannot afford to risk that \nagain. I look to the markets to tell me. Do people think these six \nbanks are too big to fail? What does the market say? Not me or some \nindustry. See what the market says about too big to fail.\n  Dean Baker and Travis McArthur, of the Center for Economic and Policy \nResearch, compared the borrowing costs of the 18 largest banks, all of \nwhich have over $100 billion in assets, to smaller banks, which make up \nthe vast majority of banks in America. They estimated that the effect \nof government subsidy, because of the implicit guarantee that they are \ntoo big to fail--and this is what the market says, not me or Senator \nBrown--guess what. It results in a 70-to 80-basis point borrowing \nadvantage for smaller banks, resulting in lower borrowing costs, \nequaling approximately $34 billion over smaller banks. Right now these \nbig banks, because the market says they are too big to fail, don't \nworry, ABC down on the corner, they give them a rate. But when it comes \nto the 6 big banks, they give them 70 to 80 basis points less because \nthey know they can fail.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 20 minutes of the two Senators \nhas expired.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. We yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank my colleagues for raising this\n\n[[Page S3055]]\n\nimportant issue pending on the floor of the Senate, this major piece of \nlegislation, the Financial Stability Act. Of all the many amendments \nthat will be offered, this is clearly a game changer. I am supportive \nof this amendment even though I know some of my friends in the banking \nindustry won't be happy with it. They are talking about dealing with \nthe concentration of wealth and of economic power to a level that can \nliterally bring the economy down. That is what we went through, leading \ninto this recession. That is what led to massive taxpayer bailout and \nthat is what the Brown-Kaufman amendment addresses foursquare. I \ncommend them for their leadership on the amendment.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  I want to speak to an issue that is timely in light of recent news \nevents. Ninety-nine years ago, a boat pulled into the harbor in \nBaltimore, MD, which came over as a passenger ship from Germany. Down \nthe gangplank walked three individuals--my grandmother, my uncle, my \naunt, and my mother, who was 2 years old, in the arms of my \ngrandmother. They had come from Lithuania to the United States. When \nthey arrived, none of them spoke English. My grandmother carried a slip \nof paper with her, which had the words ``East St. Louis, Illinois'' \nwritten on them, because she knew that is where her husband was and \nthat was her destination. I cannot imagine how they navigated \nthemselves onto a train to East St. Louis to meet my grandfather, but \nthey did it. I am sure there were people standing by that gangplank in \nBaltimore watching these foreigners coming in, saying: Oh, my God, not \nmore of those people.\n  It has been a natural reaction in this Nation of immigrants that we \nlook at newcomers as perhaps new problems. Those who are here and lucky \nenough to be in America have historically been critical of new \nimmigration. That is nothing new in American history.\n  But what has happened in Arizona in the last several weeks has taken \nthis to a different level. The passage of the law in Arizona, in my \nmind, is not only unjust but unconstitutional. The Arizona law requires \npolice officers to check the immigration status of any individual if \nthey have ``reasonable suspicion'' that he or she is an undocumented \nimmigrant. How will police determine whether there is reasonable \nsuspicion that someone is undocumented? The law doesn't tell them. Law \nenforcement experts say it is likely that they are going to look for \nthose who appear to be Hispanic.\n  Under this law, any undocumented immigrant can be arrested and \ncharged with a State crime solely on the basis of their immigration \nstatus, and it is a crime for a legal immigrant to fail to carry their \ndocuments at all times. One out of three people legally living in \nArizona are Hispanic. We understand the anxiety they have over a law \nthat would at least lead to the suspicion that they may be illegal and \nbe challenged as they go about their daily business in a perfectly \nlegal way.\n  Here is what the Arizona Daily Star newspaper said about the new law:\n\n       The measure would turn legal residents into police targets, \n     as well as those who are here illegally. It would foment \n     racial profiling of Hispanics.\n\n  Phil Gordon, mayor of Phoenix, the largest city in the State, said \nthis of the new Arizona law, signed by Governor Brewer:\n\n       It unconstitutionally co-opts our police force to enforce \n     immigration laws that are the rightful jurisdiction of the \n     Federal Government.\n\n  Here is the reality: There are 450,000 undocumented immigrants in \nArizona. Law enforcement clearly doesn't have the time to stop, \nprosecute, or remove anything near that number. Making undocumented \nimmigrants into criminals will simply drive many of them farther into \nthe shadows. When we look at this law, I also like to look at it from \nthe viewpoint of those in law enforcement in Arizona. I have read their \nquotes. They feel this is an unnecessary, at least an indefensible, \nburden being placed on them. I have read that one chief of police in a \nsmall town in Arizona said: I am not going to be going out and stopping \npeople on the streets and seeing if they are gathering on the street \ncorner. My job is to fight crime. I thought that is why they hired me. \nIf I want to keep this community safe, I cannot spend a lot of time \nchecking the papers of people walking down the street.\n  In 2005, there was a law passed in the House of Representatives known \nas the Sensenbrenner amendment, which was a step in the wrong direction \nas well. It made it a felony for anybody to provide services or \nassistance to undocumented immigrants. I have some friends in Chicago \nwho run a home for battered women. It is in the Pilsen neighborhood, \nwhich is a Hispanic neighborhood. They literally ran the risk of being \ncharged with a Federal felony by allowing somebody to come through \ntheir door, a woman who had been beaten by her husband, perhaps \ncarrying a child, offering them any help or protection made them \nunfortunately subject to being arrested under the Sensenbrenner \namendment. I offered an amendment on the floor of the Senate to remove \nthis and even in a Republican-controlled Senate, I was successful. My \ncolleagues believed, as I did, that this went too far.\n  I believe the Arizona law goes too far. This is not the first time \nthat we have gone too far and have moved back to a more moderate \nposition. In 1982, there was a Texas law passed that said elementary \nschools could refuse entry to undocumented children.\n  In the landmark Supreme Court decision of Plyler v. Doe, the Supreme \nCourt struck down that Texas law. At the time, Chief Justice John \nRoberts was a lawyer in the Justice Department, and he criticized the \nJustice Department for not supporting the Texas law.\n  It has been 23 years since Plyler v. Doe was decided. As a result, \nmillions of children have received an education and become citizens. \nThey are doctors, soldiers, policemen, and others who contribute to our \nsociety every day. Imagine what would have happened if that Texas law \nhad been allowed to stand and was the law of the land. I asked John \nRoberts, during his confirmation hearing to the Supreme Court, if that \nlaw that was struck down was settled law in America. He would not \nanswer. It leaves some question on what would happen if this law comes \nbefore his Court.\n  Arizona faces serious law enforcement challenges. There is \nintolerable violence on Arizona's border with Mexico because of drug \ncartels. The reality is, it is the American appetite for narcotics that \nis fueling the drug war in Mexico. It is American money and guns \nflowing south of the border that has created the situation, and we need \nto be more honest about it as well. But it is a fact, and it is \ndangerous. I can understand why the people of Arizona would feel some \ntrepidation and real concern about that.\n  Last month, Robert Krentz, an Arizona rancher, was murdered near the \nborder with Mexico. To say violence is not part of the scene in Arizona \nis unrealistic and unfair.\n  In March of 2009, I held a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee \non Mexican drug cartels. I invited Terry Goddard, Arizona's attorney \ngeneral, to testify about the situation in Arizona. He told me this:\n\n       Sophisticated, violent, highly organized criminals . . . \n     are smuggling drugs, human beings, guns, and money across the \n     border and are using unimaginable violence to protect and \n     grow the criminal enterprise. Law enforcement officers in the \n     State of Arizona have been on the front lines of the efforts \n     to combat one of the most serious organized crime threats of \n     the 21st century.\n\n  If the Arizona law is wrong, what is the right answer? I think, in \nthe framework of the bill that we brought before Members of the Senate, \nconsidered last week, there are three elements to it. First, we have to \ndo everything in our power to police our border, make sure we have the \nright technology and people, and that we are doing everything to stop \nthe flow of illegal immigration into the United States. Those who say \n``seal the border first'' are setting an impossible standard. Imagine, \nif we set a standard that said seal Interstate 95 so that no vehicle \npassing over that interstate will be carrying illegal narcotics or \nguns. Well, there are tens of thousands of vehicles and people passing \nlegally between the U.S. and Mexico every day, and amidst this legal \nflow is an illegal flow. We need to find a way to reduce that.\n  The second part of that bill, the framework, would say that the lure \nof America is the lure of jobs. Let us establish a Social Security card \nwith biometric identification so that it clearly shows whether a person \nis legal. I think that is a step in the right direction.\n\n[[Page S3056]]\n\n  Third is to deal not with amnesty but setting up a process where they \nwould have to work their way and prove their way into legal status. It \nwill never be automatic. It would not be unconditional.\n\n  The trouble we have is that many of those who say the Federal laws \nhave broken down and we do not have a good immigration law are \nunwilling to stand up and join us in writing a new law.\n  I invite all of my friends on the other side of the aisle to join \nwith the Democrats in writing a good immigration law. Doing nothing is \nnot an option. It invites more laws such as those in Arizona which, \nunfortunately, are going to have results which I do not think are \nconsistent with our values in this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the framework. I hope \nthey will also consider cosponsoring the DREAM Act, a bill which I \nintroduced many years ago--and Senator Dick Lugar is my cosponsor--\nwhich says those brought to America--undocumented, who finish school, \nno criminal record, who are willing to finish 2 years of college and \nserve in our military--will have a chance to become legal in the United \nStates of America. It is a step in the right direction. It was not a \nstep 99 years ago when my 2-year-old mother came to this country. Thank \ngoodness she did. Thank goodness I am here today to tell the story.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, are we in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Yes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3056-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3056-S3059]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, the business before the Senate this \nweek is financial regulation reform. It is hard to pick what the \nbusiness should be this week. There is so much going on that is of \ngreat concern to so many of us.\n  We have a briefing this afternoon on the dimensions of the oilspill \nin the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Those of us in Tennessee are deeply concerned about the 1,000-year \nrain--an event that only happens every 1,000 years or so, according to \nsome of the engineers in the Army Corps--that has wreaked havoc on \nmiddle Tennessee and which is beginning now to hurt west Tennessee.\n  Also, we have the Arizona immigration debate, which the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois was discussing a little earlier.\n  We have a new START treaty the President has asked us to consider.\n  Just around the corner, we have a nomination coming for a vacancy on \nthe Supreme Court of the United States which will dominate, as it \nshould, the attention of this body for 2 or 3 months or so until it is \nthoroughly considered.\n  Of course, the American people would like for us to focus on jobs.\n  I have great respect for the Democratic Governor of Tennessee who was \nquoted in the Wall Street Journal yesterday saying the following:\n\n       ``If I have 100 conversations with people, 95 of them will \n     be about jobs and none of them will be about cap-and-trade \n     and none of them will be about bank reform,'' said Tennessee \n     Gov. Phil Bredesen, a conservative Democrat, in an interview.\n\n  That is according to the Wall Street Journal. Financial regulation \nreform is the current topic and financial regulation is important. The \nimportance of it is that this is a country that produces, year in and \nyear out, about 25 percent of all the money in the world. We sometimes \nforget how privileged we are in our standard of living. We are just \nabout 5 percent of the people of the world, but 25 percent of the \nwealth of the world is created here. It is because entrepreneurs have \nan advantage. They can create new jobs one right after the other.\n  Our well-being is not measured by the number of jobs we lose. It is \nmeasured by the difference of jobs we create and the number of jobs we \nlose. The problem we have right now is we are not creating enough new \njobs in the United States of America. We need to focus on doing that.\n  One aspect of that is the kind of system of financial regulation we \nhave. All of us were appalled by some of the hi-jinks on Wall Street \nthat helped lead us to the great recession in which we find ourselves \nand for which we had to take extraordinary action. The purpose of the \nfinancial regulation bill should be to minimize the possibility of \nthose [Wall Street] hi-jinks occurring again, but at the same time, to \nleave an environment in the United States where we can create the \nlargest number of good, new jobs. When I say ``we,'' I do not mean the \ngovernment. We have had too much attention on creating government jobs.\n  The one place the stimulus has worked is Washington, DC. Salaries are \nup here. There are more jobs here. The place where the stimulus is not \nworking is out across the country where, if we continued with the \neconomy over the next year at the rate of growth it had in the first \nquarter, which was 3.2 percent, we are told the unemployment rate at \nthe end of the year will still be about 9 or 10 percent. Why? Because \nwe are not creating enough new jobs in the private sector.\n  As we deal with financial regulation, we must be careful to leave an \nenvironment in which we can continue to create jobs, which is why there \nare five major issues that have come toward us. I heard someone on \ntelevision this morning say: There go the Republicans. They want to \nslow down the financial regulation bill. They cannot agree on it in the \nSenate.\n  What we want to do--especially after the health care debate--is \nprovide some checks and balances to make sure we have a good bill.\n  These are the issues that are before the American people on this \nbill: Is there a Washington takeover of Main Street lending? Community \nbanks, credit unions, plumbers, and dentists say there may be. We need \nto make sure there is not.\n  The last thing we need to do is make it harder to get a loan in \nNashville or Manchester or Knoxville or San Antonio. Because if you \ncannot get a loan, you can't hire a person, you can't invest in \nsomething, and you can't create a new job, and the economy does not \nmove. That is the first issue: Is there a Washington takeover of Main \nStreet lending.\n  The second issue: What about this czarina or czar? What about this \nperson the President would appoint to be in charge of millions of \ntransactions in the consumer bureau? Unlike our other independent \nagencies, this person would barely be accountable to the President and \nwould not be accountable to the Congress. Doesn't that lead to the \npossibility that this person could write some rules and regulations \nunaccountably and might make the same sort of mistake we made when we \nencouraged people to buy houses who could not afford to pay for them--\nwhich most agree is the principal event that led us into the great \nrecession that we now have? And that nearly led us into another \ndepression, which brings us to the third issue: Why are we not dealing \nwith the big housing agencies? Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have about as \nmuch debt outstanding as the United States does, and we taxpayers \nimplicitly guarantee their debt.\n  In the health care debate, it was said: We do not add to the national \ndebt with this bill. But we did not include doctors--we did not include \npaying doctors in the health care bill. That would be about like my \ngoing to the Congressional Budget Office and saying: Tell me how much \nit is going to cost to run the University of Tennessee for the next 10 \nyears, and the Congressional Budget Office might say to me: With or \nwithout the professors? If I wanted a low-ball number, I would say: Oh, \ngive me a number without paying the professors.\n\n  That is what we got in the health care bill. We left out $200 billion \nor $300 billion. The President's budget says it is $371 billion over \nthe next 10 years because we assumed that we would not increase pay for \ndoctors to serve Medicare patients, which would create for them a 21-\npercent cut in pay. And for those Medicare patients, it begins to \ncreate a health care bridge to nowhere because no doctors are going to \nsee them if they are not properly reimbursed.\n  We are doing the same thing in financial regulation reform when we \nleave out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Why are we leaving them out? It \nis not because they didn't make a contribution to the big recession we \nare in. Everyone agrees they did. The Democrats are leaving them out \nbecause if Democrats\n\n[[Page S3057]]\n\nput them in, we would have to deal with the $200 billion, $300 billion \nor $400 billion cost in the current year. According to the Wall Street \nJournal today, the Congressional Budget Office says the deficit would \nbe about $291 billion bigger in 2009. So, Congress is going to put them \nin the drawer or put them under the table or act like they aren't \nthere, and say to the American people: Hooray, we fixed financial \nregulation, but we're not dealing with housing? When we fix financial \nregulation without addressing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac it's like not \npaying doctors when we pass a comprehensive health care bill. That is a \nthird issue.\n  There are a couple more issues. One is the so-called derivatives \nissue. The so-called derivatives issue is a complicated issue for many \npeople, but the head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation says \nthe bill before us may actually create less regulation for these \ncomplicated transactions rather than more. This is an area in which we \nwant to make sure we do not make a mistake.\n  Then there is the so-called big bank bailout provision. Most \nAmericans don't want a provision in the law that allows or encourages \nbig banks to take risks that cause them to fail and take the rest of us \ndown with them. So, the point of our debate ought to be to make sure in \nour financial regulation reform that we don't provide incentives for \nbig banks to take imprudent risks that will cause them to fail and hurt \nus because they are so big.\n  How are we making progress on this issue? As the Republican leader \nhas said, we have Goldman Sachs and Citibank that have said they like \nthe bill. I would say there are a number of people worried about the \nbill. I am hearing from community banks, credit unions, auto dealers, \ndentists, furniture retailers, plumbers, and candy companies with \nconcerns.\n  A New York Times article says: ``Senate Financial Bill Misguided, \nSome Academics Say.'' That was yesterday. A Professor at MIT says, `` . \n. . we need to proceed about this in a much more deliberate and \nrational and thoughtful way.'' That is what we would like to do.\n  A professor at New York University says leaving out Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac from the discussion is ``outrageous.''\n  FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair warns against new curbs on bank trading \nthat I just mentioned.\n  My point is that this is an opportunity for us on the Republican side \nand those on the Democratic side to take an important piece of \nlegislation--not such a visible piece of legislation today because we \nhave issues from immigration to the oilspill to the flooding in \nTennessee--vastly important for our country and work together to make \nit better.\n  Some progress, I understand, is being made on one of the five \nprovisions. That is the too-big-to-fail provision. We will see what \nSenator Shelby has to say on that. But that still leaves the question \nof whether we ought to have an independent czarina or czar. That still \nleaves the question of whether we are dealing properly with \nderivatives. That still leaves the question of whether we ought to \nleave out of a financial reform bill the two great housing agencies \nthat are just sticking there in front of us like a sore thumb, \nreminding us we have not done our job if we don't include them. And of \ngreat importance, why can't we simply have a provision in the bill that \neliminates any possibility that we have a Washington takeover of Main \nStreet? It is not the business of this bill to make it harder to extend \nand get credit up and down Main Street America.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a series of articles.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 3, 2010]\n\n          Senate Financial Bill Misguided, Some Academics Say\n\n                        (By Andrew Ross Sorkin)\n\n       As Democrats close in on their goal of overhauling the \n     nation's financial regulations, several prominent experts say \n     that the legislation does not even address the right \n     problems, leaving the financial system vulnerable to another \n     major crisis, Binyamin Appelbaum and Sewell Chan report in \n     The New York Times.\n       Some point to specific issues left largely untouched, like \n     the instability of capital markets that provide money for \n     lenders, or the government's role in the housing market, \n     including the future of the housing finance companies Fannie \n     Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       Others simply argue that it is premature to pass sweeping \n     legislation while so much about the crisis remains unclear \n     and so many inquiries are in progress.\n       ``Until we understand what the causes were, we may be \n     implementing ineffective and even counterproductive \n     reforms,'' said Andrew W. Lo, a finance professor at the \n     Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ``I understand the \n     need for action. I understand the need for something to be \n     done. But what I expect from political leaders is for them to \n     demonstrate leadership in telling the public that we need to \n     proceed about this in a much more deliberate and rational and \n     thoughtful way.''\n       Senate Republicans echoed some of these concerns as they \n     delayed debate on the legislation last week. Democrats agree \n     that significant issues remain to be addressed. But they say \n     that the government must press forward in responding to the \n     problems that already are clear.\n       The bill, which was introduced by Christopher J. Dodd, \n     chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, would extend \n     oversight to a wider range of financial institutions and \n     activities. It would create a new agency to protect borrowers \n     from abuse by lenders, including mortgage and credit card \n     companies. And it seeks to ensure that troubled companies, \n     however large, can be liquidated at no cost to taxpayers.\n       A diverse group of critics, however, say the legislation \n     focuses on the precipitators of the recent crisis, like \n     abusive mortgage lending, rather than the mechanisms by which \n     the crisis spread.\n       Gary B. Gorton, a finance professor at Yale, said the \n     financial system would remain vulnerable to panics because \n     the legislation would not improve the reliability of the \n     markets where lenders get money, by issuing short-term debt \n     called commercial paper or loans called repurchase agreements \n     or ``repos.''\n       The recent crisis began as investors nervous about mounting \n     subprime mortgage losses started demanding higher returns, \n     then withholding money altogether. The government is now \n     moving to prevent abusive mortgage lending, but Mr. Gorton \n     said investors could just as easily be spooked by something \n     else.\n       The flight of investors is the modern version of a bank \n     run, in which depositors line up to withdraw their money. The \n     banking industry was plagued by runs until the government \n     introduced deposit insurance during the Great Depression. \n     Professor Gorton said the industry had now entered a new era \n     of instability.\n       ``It is unfortunate if we end up repeating history,'' \n     Professor Gorton said. ``It's basically tragic that we can't \n     understand the importance of this issue.''\n       Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner agreed in April \n     testimony before the House Financial Services Committee that \n     ``more work remains to be done in this area,'' but he said \n     that regulators could address the issue without legislation. \n     The government plans to require lenders to hold larger \n     reserves against unexpected losses and to require that they \n     keep money on hand to meet short-term needs.\n       David A. Skeel Jr., a corporate law professor at the \n     University of Pennsylvania, said it would be a mistake for \n     Congress to leave the drafting of these standards to the \n     discretion of regulators.\n       ``Regulators working right now will be tough,'' Professor \n     Skeel said. ``But we know from history that as soon as this \n     legislative moment passes, the ball is going to shift back \n     into Wall Street's court. As soon as the crisis passes, what \n     inevitably happens is that the people that are paying the \n     most attention are the banks.''\n       A second group of critics say the government helped to seed \n     the crisis through its efforts to increase home ownership, \n     including the role of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in buying \n     mortgage loans to make more money available for lending. The \n     companies are now owned by the government after incurring \n     enormous losses on loans that borrowers could not afford to \n     repay.\n       Lawrence J. White, a finance professor at New York \n     University, said it made no sense to overhaul financial \n     regulation without addressing the future of federal housing \n     policy. He said he was trying to find the strongest possible \n     words to describe the omission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     from the legislation.\n       ``It's outrageous,'' he finally said.\n       Republicans have repeatedly criticized the administration \n     for advancing legislation that does not address the \n     companies' future. The Obama administration says drafting a \n     new housing policy is on its agenda for next year.\n       Other critics warn that the proposed legislation would \n     insert the government deeply into the financial markets, \n     creating new distortions and seeding future crises. They say \n     the focus of financial reform should instead be on increased \n     transparency.\n       Andrew Redleaf and Richard Vigilante, hedge fund managers \n     who started warning investors in 2006 that a housing crisis \n     was inevitable, proposed a minimalist version of reform in \n     their recent book ``Panic.'' They want to require all \n     financial institutions, including investment banks and hedge \n     funds\n\n[[Page S3058]]\n\n     like their own, to disclose, at least once a week, every \n     position in tradable securities.\n       ``The Dodd bill is almost entirely irrelevant,'' Mr. \n     Vigilante said in a telephone interview. ``All it does is \n     strengthen what we've had for years,'' a system that depends \n     on judgments made by regulators behind closed doors.\n       Proponents of the legislation say that it significantly \n     expands transparency, for example by requiring many \n     derivatives contracts to trade in public view. But they say \n     that the government also needs to expand the scope of its \n     oversight because the worst excesses that led to the crisis \n     began and flourished at nonbank financial institutions that \n     were not subject to federal regulation.\n       The most basic critique comes from Professor Lo and others \n     who say that Congress is moving too quickly. The origins of \n     the crisis remain a subject of intense controversy. \n     Investigations continue to unearth surprising information. \n     The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, a bipartisan panel \n     created by Congress, is not scheduled to report until \n     December. Why not wait, they ask, until the targets are \n     clearer?\n       Phil Angelides, the chairman of the inquiry commission and \n     a Democrat, says that the problems raised by the crisis will \n     not be solved in one stroke and that he supports the \n     Democratic push to begin the process soon.\n       But the critics point to the words of Nicholas F. Brady, a \n     former Treasury secretary who led the bipartisan \n     investigation into the 1987 stock market crash: ``You can't \n     fix what you can't explain.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 4, 2010]\n\n     Derivatives-Spinoff Proposal Opposed as Part of Overhaul Bill\n\n                           (By Brady Dennis)\n\n       A dramatic proposal that could force banks to spin off \n     their derivatives businesses, potentially costing them \n     billions of dollars in revenue, has run into opposition on \n     multiple fronts as the Senate prepares to take up legislation \n     to remake financial regulations.\n       Obama administration officials, industry groups, banking \n     regulators and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle have \n     taken aim at the measure proposed by Sen. Blanche Lincoln (D-\n     AR), chairman of the Senate agriculture committee.\n       Their main objection: If a central goal of regulatory \n     overhaul is to make financial markets more transparent and \n     accountable, Lincoln's provision would have the opposite \n     effect. Barring banks from trading in derivatives would force \n     those lucrative business into corners of the market where \n     there's even less oversight, critics warn.\n       ``If all derivatives market-making activities were moved \n     outside of bank holding companies, most of the activity would \n     no doubt continue, but in less regulated and more highly \n     leveraged venues,'' Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Chairman \n     Sheila C. Bair wrote in a recent letter to lawmakers.\n       She said that Lincoln's measure could push $294 trillion \n     worth of derivatives deals beyond the reach of regulators. If \n     some FDIC-insured banks simply transferred this type of \n     business to affiliated firms, it could still pose a danger \n     because the affiliates would not be required to set aside as \n     much capital as banks to cover losses from derivatives \n     trading, Bair said.\n       She added that a possible unintended consequence of the \n     legislation ``would be weakened, not strengthened, protection \n     of the insured bank and the Deposit Insurance Fund, which I \n     know is not the result any of us want.'' She said this danger \n     exists because financial troubles at an affiliate could in \n     times of crisis threaten the bank. Some administration \n     officials share Bair's worry that the provision could \n     undermine the goal of making derivatives trading less opaque.\n       ``You'd rather make sure that it's regulated,'' said one \n     administration official, who spoke on the condition of \n     anonymity because the matter has not been resolved. ``The \n     whole principle of [regulatory] reform is not to push things \n     into dark corners.''\n       Federal Reserve officials expressed their reservations to \n     Lincoln's staff members when they were working with their \n     counterparts from the Senate banking committee to combine \n     legislation passed by each panel. The agriculture and banking \n     committees both have had a traditional interest in \n     derivatives, which originated decades ago with trading in \n     farm products.\n       In a memo, Fed officials said that forcing banks to \n     separate derivatives trading from banking operations would \n     ``impair financial stability and strong prudential regulation \n     of derivatives,'' ``have serious consequences for the \n     competitiveness of U.S. financial institutions'' and ``be \n     highly disruptive and costly, both for banks and their \n     customers.''\n       Lincoln has stood by her proposal, which has garnered \n     support from consumer advocates, saying she wants to protect \n     bank depositors from risky trading activities. ``It ensures \n     banks get back to the business of banking,'' said Courtney \n     Rowe, Lincoln's spokeswoman.\n       But other lawmakers have raised concerns.\n       ``As we try to put in place new rules around derivatives, \n     we don't want to push the whole derivatives market \n     offshore,'' Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA) said recently on the \n     Senate floor.\n       Sen. Judd Gregg (R-NH) said Monday that Lincoln's measure \n     would not only push derivatives transactions offshore but \n     would constrict credit to Main Street businesses that benefit \n     from the ability to hedge against changes in asset prices.\n       ``This is a real job killer. It would cause contraction in \n     the economy,'' Gregg said. ``It's really a poor idea, and it \n     has no purpose, in my opinion, that's constructive. It's just \n     a punitive exercise aimed at Wall Street.''\n       Amendments aimed at killing the Lincoln provision are \n     likely to emerge as lawmakers begin this week to consider \n     dozens of changes to the financial overhaul bill, according \n     to congressional sources.\n                                  ____\n\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 4, 2010]\n\n                    What About Fan and Fred Reform?\n\n                         (By Robert G. Wilmers)\n\n       Congress may be making progress crafting new regulations \n     for the financial-services industry, but it has yet to begin \n     reforming two institutions that played a key role in the 2008 \n     credit crisis--Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n       We cannot reform these government-sponsored enterprises \n     unless we fully confront the extent to which their outrageous \n     behavior and reckless business practices have affected the \n     entire commercial banking sector and the U.S. economy as a \n     whole.\n       At the end of 2009, their total debt outstanding--either \n     held directly on their balance sheets or as guarantees on \n     mortgage securities they'd sold to investors--was $8.1 \n     trillion. That compares to $7.8 trillion in total marketable \n     debt outstanding for the entire U.S. government. The debt has \n     the implicit guarantee of the federal government but is not \n     reflected on the national balance sheet.\n       The public has focused more on taxpayer bailouts of banks, \n     auto makers and insurance companies. But the scale of the \n     rescue required in September 2008 when Fannie and Freddie \n     were forced into conservatorship--their version of \n     bankruptcy--was staggering. To date, the federal government \n     has been forced to pump $126 billion into Fannie and Freddie. \n     That's far more than AIG, which absorbed $70 billion of \n     government largess, and General Motors and Chrysler, which \n     shared $77 billion. Banks received $205 billion, of which \n     $136 billion has been repaid.\n       Fannie and Freddie continue to operate deeply in the red, \n     with no end in sight. The Congressional Budget Office \n     estimated that if their operating costs and subsidies were \n     included in our accounting of the overall federal deficit--as \n     properly they should be--the 2009 deficit would be greater by \n     $291 billion.\n       Worst of all are the tracts of foreclosed homes left behind \n     by households lured into inappropriate mortgages by the lax \n     credit standards made possible by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac \n     and their promise to purchase and securitize millions of \n     subprime mortgages.\n       All this happened in the name of the ``American Dream'' of \n     home ownership. But there's no evidence Fannie and Freddie \n     helped much, if at all, to make this dream come true. Despite \n     all their initiatives since the early 1970s, shortly after \n     they were incorporated as private corporations protected by \n     government charters, the percentage of American households \n     owning homes has increased by merely four percentage points \n     to 67%.\n       In contrast, between 1991 and 2008, home ownership in Italy \n     and the Netherlands increased by 12 percentage points. It \n     increased by nine points in Portugal and Greece. At least 14 \n     other developed countries have home ownership rates higher \n     than in the U.S. They include Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, \n     Poland and Spain.\n       Canada doesn't have the equivalent of Fannie and Freddie. \n     Nor does it permit the deduction of mortgage interest from an \n     individual's taxes. Nevertheless, its home ownership rate is \n     68%. Canadian banks have weathered the financial crisis \n     particularly well and required no government bailouts.\n       This mediocre U.S. home ownership record developed despite \n     the fact that Fannie and Freddie were allowed to operate as a \n     tax-advantaged duopoly, supposedly to allow them to lower the \n     cost of mortgage finance. But a great deal of their taxpayer \n     subsidy did not actually help make housing less expensive for \n     home buyers.\n       According to a 2004 Congressional Budget Office study, the \n     two GSEs enjoyed $23 billion in subsidies in 2003--primarily \n     in the form of lower borrowing costs and exemption from state \n     and local taxation. But they passed on only $13 billion to \n     home buyers. Nevertheless, one former Fannie Mae CEO, \n     Franklin Raines, received $91 million in compensation from \n     1998 through 2003. In 2006, the top five Fannie Mae \n     executives shared $34 million in compensation, while their \n     counterparts at Freddie Mac shared $35 million. In 2009, even \n     after the financial crash and as these two GSEs fell deeper \n     into the red, the top five executives at Fannie Mae received \n     $19 million in compensation and the CEO earned $6 million.\n       This is not private enterprise--it's crony capitalism, in \n     which public subsidies are turned into private riches. From \n     2001 through 2006, Fannie and Freddie spent $123 million to \n     lobby Congress--the second-highest lobbying total (after the \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce) in the country. That lobbying was \n     complemented by sizable direct political contributions to \n     members of Congress.\n       Changing this terrible situation will not be easy. The \n     mortgage market has come to be structured around Fannie and \n     Freddie and powerful interests are allied with the status \n     quo. I recall a personal conversation with a member of \n     Congress who, despite saying he understood my concerns about \n     the two GSEs,\n\n[[Page S3059]]\n\n     admitted he would never push for significant change because \n     ``they've done so much for me, my colleagues and my staff.''\n       Nonetheless, Congress must get to work on the reform of \n     Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. A healthy housing market, a \n     healthy financial system and even the bond rating of the \n     federal government depend on it.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate to \ntalk about not only the environmental but economic disaster that has \nhappened in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to fly over the scene of the spill \nfrom the Deepwater Horizon rig along with my colleagues Senator \nSessions, Senator Shelby, and Congressman Jeff Miller who represents \nFlorida's First Congressional District.\n  What we saw was pretty startling. As we flew out over the ocean, we \nsaw the beginning of a spill. At first, it looked like a sheen, \nsomething one might see with gasoline laying on a concrete floor at a \ngas station. But as we got closer to where the Deepwater Horizon oil \nplatform was located before, where it fell into the water, we began to \nsee these great bands of orange, rust-colored oil that streaked across \nthe Gulf of Mexico. We began to see small clumps of what looked like \ntar.\n  As we got closer to the scene of the incident, those small clumps \nturned into what I would describe as large pads of tar that floated to \nthe surface.\n  We saw the new rigs that are being set up to start the drilling to do \nescape drilling to allow for the pressure to be taken off the spill \nwhere it is located now. We saw some of the cleanup vessels. There were \nabout 10 vessels out there. We understand there are close to 100 \ninvolved in the total containment of this spill.\n  What is concerning to me--and I know is concerning to many Members of \nCongress--is what could happen, what might happen next. There are a lot \nof folks working very hard in the Coast Guard and the government. We \nmet with Captain Pullen at the Mobile training facility for the Coast \nGuard, who briefed us on what is going on so far.\n  If we do not get this wellhead to stop leaking oil into the ocean, \nestimated at 5,000 barrels a day--we don't know how much is leaking. It \ncould be less than that; it could be a lot more. If we do not stop the \nwellhead from leaking, we are going to have a lot bigger problem. This \narea has grown every day since April 21 when we had this disaster. It \nis measured by the size of States. First, it was Rhode Island, then it \nwas Delaware. It is growing bigger and bigger.\n  When the storms subside, as they are doing now, that sheen is going \nto spread out even further. It certainly is going to likely impact my \nState of Florida and our beaches and our commercial fishermen and our \nrecreational fishermen. There is cause for great concern.\n  The reason I come to the floor today is to make this point. There are \nthose who are casting blame on British Petroleum. There are those who \nare casting blame on the government. There will be time for that. \nWhether the government has done a proper job of getting on this problem \nfrom day one, as we are hearing; whether British Petroleum properly \nworked along with the folks who ran this rig, the Transocean folks; \nwhether they made mistakes--certainly, mistakes were made--there will \nbe time for us to evaluate that. What we must do now is spend all of \nour energy and efforts stopping the leak from this well because if we \ndon't, we may see an oilspill that is the entire expansion of the Gulf \nof Mexico. We may see oil that not only hurts the gulf coast of \nFlorida, Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, and Texas, but we potentially \ncould see this oil go around the southern part of Florida, into the \nEverglades, into Florida Bay, into the Thousand Islands area--not to \nmention the coast on the western side of Florida, come up on the \nAtlantic side and get in the Gulf of Mexico and come all the way up the \ncoast.\n\n  I am here to urge that all my colleagues support the administration \nand BP and everyone else who is working on this to stop the leak we \nhave now. To me, it is the most important thing.\n  There were obviously issues of negligence that caused this disaster \nto happen in the first place. The questions of whether the Federal \nGovernment did everything it should have done in the beginning days \nwhen this happened will have to be answered, and folks are going to \nhave to come before our committees to answer those questions. But right \nnow, we have to stop this leak and we have to have an increased sense \nof urgency of stopping that leak and containing the oil.\n  We are putting this dispersant in now at the site of the wellhead. \nThat is apparently having some good effect. BP has also been able--as \nwe learned yesterday from Captain Pullen at the Mobile station--to \nclose one of the hydraulic fail-safe valves. We know it wasn't fail-\nsafe, but at least some of that has been closed, which is stopping, we \nhope, in some way the amount of oil going into the Gulf of Mexico. \nThere is a crisis now, but the crisis to come could be far worse if we \ndo not stop the leak from the wellhead.\n\n\n               Dangerous Ties Between Venezuela and Iran\n\n  Mr. President, over the last 6 months, we have seen two more attempts \nthat we know of against the United States from terrorist attacks--most \nrecently at Times Square. Thanks to the vigilance of some New Yorkers \nand the fine work of the New York Police Department, a bombing was \nstopped. We also remember that on Christmas day, when Abdulmutallab \ntried to blow up a plane over the skies of America, thankfully, that \nbomb did not explode. These are very dangerous times.\n  I continue to come to the floor to say that we not only need to pay \nattention to the east, where this danger is stemming from, but we also \nhave to pay attention to the south. We have to continue to pay \nattention to Venezuela and the dangerous ties between Venezuela and \nIran. I have come to the floor to speak about the fact that Hezbollah \nand Hamas are now in Iran. We know a Spanish judge has accused \nVenezuelan authorities of conspiring with the ETA, a radical group in \nSpain, to assassinate the President of Colombia. We know Venezuela is \ncollaborating with the FARC, the narcoterrorist group, which is \nbringing in drugs and destabilizing all of Central America all the way \nup into Mexico. We know of this dangerous situation. We know there are \nflights now between Venezuela and Iran through Syria that don't go \nthrough the normal customs procedures, where folks get off the plane in \nVenezuela and who knows where they go. We also know now that Iran has \nsent shock troops to Venezuela. We have also heard of a foiled attempt \nfrom a company called VenIran--presumably Venezuela-Iran--to ship \nalleged tractor parts to Venezuela that turned out to be explosive \nmaterials.\n  I come to the floor today to update this continuing story and to \nbegin to bring, hopefully, the focus of this Congress and this \nadministration on the gathering storm that is Venezuela and its \ncontacts with Iran. It is not only that there are now shock troops from \nIran in Venezuela, but we see the Chinese Government giving $20 billion \nto Venezuela for derivative--future--potential to purchase oil, \napparently. So lots of questions need to be asked, and we need answers \nfrom this administration about a focus on Venezuela. Hugo Chavez is a \ndangerous man, and the continued attempts by the Venezuelan regime to \nwork with Cuba to spread disharmony throughout the region, to try to \nbring other Latin American countries along with his strong-man tactics, \nare cause for concern.\n  I will conclude with this, Mr. President. Two weekends ago, I had the \nopportunity to go to the Joint Interagency Task Force in Key West, FL, \nwhere tremendous work is done by the Coast Guard, the Navy, the FBI, \nDEA, and all sorts of other agencies to interdict drug trafficking from \nSouth America, Central America, into the United States. We know \nVenezuela is allowing flights to go over its country from Colombia to \nbring those drugs into Central America. We know how violence comes from \nthose drugs, and we are seeing the destabilization of Mexico because of \nit. We also know there are semisubmersible craft--minisubmarines, if \nyou will--that ride just below the water that are being used by drug \ntraffickers out of Colombia, with the\n\n[[Page S3060]]\n\nsupport of Venezuela, to bring large amounts of cocaine into the United \nStates. Those same craft could be used to deliver a weapon of terror.\n  This administration and the world have to focus not just on Iran but \non the dangerous ties between Iran and Venezuela.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor. I see my friend and \ncolleague from Tennessee is here to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nTennessee is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3060-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3060]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      FINANCIAL REGULATORY REFORM\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, before my time to speak today, there were \nsome comments made by the junior Senator from Delaware, but before \ngetting to that, I did want to mention that I hope very soon the \nadministration will work closely--and I am sure they will because I \nknow they are very understanding of what has happened in Tennessee--\nwith those who are dealing with the obvious disaster underway in our \nState. We have people who have lost their lives, people who have lost \ntheir homes, and people who have lost their life's work. I appreciate \nso much the work our Governor has underway, and the many mayors, \nespecially the mayor of Nashville but also mayors across our State. I \nappreciate the response all of them have given in coming to the aid of \nour citizens there. Again, I know this administration will begin to \nwork very closely with them in that same regard, and I thank them in \nadvance.\n  But I came to speak specifically today about the comments of my \nfriend from Delaware regarding the fact that because large institutions \nin this country have a funding advantage over some of the smaller \ninstitutions, we ought to break them up.\n  I certainly have concerns about some of the situations we get \nourselves into when a large institution gets into trouble. I don't \nthink that having 100 Senators here on the floor arbitrarily deciding \nwhat size a financial institution ought to be or when it should be \nbroken up is necessarily the right approach. What I do think is a \nbetter approach--and I think this bill attempts to do this but doesn't \nquite get it right--is to ensure that if an institution fails, it \nactually fails; the shareholders of the company know they are going to \nbe out of their entire investment; the creditors know what is going to \nhappen. The bill attempts to do that, and my sense is that Senator \nShelby and Senator Dodd are working together--and I think may actually \nhave come to an agreement--on a way to close some of the loopholes that \nexist in this bill.\n  What I would suggest to my friend from Delaware is just to support \nthose efforts because I think if that occurs--and my sense is it will, \nbased on the conversations I have had--what will happen very quickly is \nthe credit rating agencies in this country--and they have already \nindicated this to be the case, not that they have been stellar, \ncertainly in these last couple of years or the last 4 years--many of \nthem are beginning to look at these large institutions in a different \nway because they believe we may pass legislation here on the floor that \nsays that if they fail, they actually go out of business. That creates \na situation where that moral hazard doesn't exist; where people, in \nessence, loan money or give credit or invest in these larger \ninstitutions at rates that are less than what might be the case for \nsmaller institutions.\n  The best way we can sort of level the playing field is to ensure that \nif a big company fails, it fails. Again, I think we are on the verge of \ngetting that solved. There will be many people on my side of the \naisle--and by the way, I respect this position very much--who think the \nonly way to do that is through bankruptcy, and they are talking about \neither an 11(f) section of the code or a section 14 of the \nBankruptcy Code, where highly complex financial holding companies would \ngo into bankruptcy if they fail. By the way, I think we should do \neverything we can to strengthen that.\n\n  At the same time, I think--certainly in the interim, anyway--we need \na resolution mechanism so that we know that if a large company fails, \nwe have a mechanism to liquidate it. It may be that you need both \ntools. Maybe you let the resolution provision sunset after the \nbankruptcy laws are completed and fixed in such a way that it works for \na large, highly complex bank holding company.\n  But, again, what I would say to my friend, the Senator from Delaware, \nis--and I certainly love his passion on this issue--the best way we can \nget that level playing field is to ensure these large institutions fail \nwhen they fail, and that will change that funding level he is talking \nabout. As a matter of fact, we are given regulators in this bill, if it \npasses in its form right now.\n  I sure hope we make lots of changes because I cannot support the bill \nas it is today. But the bill actually addresses capital levels. As \ninstitutions become larger and more risky, additional capital \nrequirements are required, which automatically drives up the cost of \nfunding. There is a section Senator Warner and I worked on called \ncontingent capital, where the regulators can actually cause these \ninstitutions to have contingent capital, where if a creditor has loaned \nmoney to an institution and this institution gets in trouble, that \nturns to equity, so it is a buffer. Again, I think the cost of that is \ngoing to be more expensive than most credit that would be given to an \ninstitution such as this.\n  So, again, I think the best way to deal with organizations that are \nlarge in this country is to deal with the many tools that exist in this \nbill that need to be improved, no doubt, and hopefully, over the course \nof the next 2 weeks, will be improved. But that is a much better \nsolution than just arbitrarily having 100 Senators saying: Well, if you \nare X part of our GDP, you have to be taken down to size.\n  I wish to reiterate, as I did last week on the floor, that our \ncountry has by far the largest gross domestic product in the world. We \ndwarf everybody. Yet we have no banks in the top 5 in the world; we \nhave 2 banks in the top 15. So I am not sure that as we work on \nglobalization and as we hope to ship goods and deal with people around \nthe world, that our best solution is to handicap the ability of our \ncompanies that work in that way and create great jobs in this country \nshipping goods across the world. I am not sure it is in our best \ninterest to look at arbitrarily deciding what size a financial holding \ncompany should be.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate being able to speak to this issue. I do \nhope over the course of the next couple of weeks that we can make \nsignificant changes in the consumer title. I am hearing from people all \nacross the State of Tennessee--ordinary citizens who wake up daily and \nwho do things that are outside the financial sphere, at least they \nbelieve they are--who are very concerned about the reach of our \nconsumer protection agency as it is outlined in this bill; the fact \nthat it is unfettered, that there is no board in any way to control it, \nthe fact that there is no Federal preemption, the fact that there will \nbe 50 State attorneys general now dealing with our national banks, the \nfact that this consumer entity has the ability to be involved in \nunderwriting loans. You can imagine some of the problems that have \noccurred through CRA recently. Think about this: It would be CRA on \nsteroids.\n  So those are some issues I do think we need to address in this bill \nand I hope we will address in this bill. And I hope we will realize \nthat this country has an overexpansive government that reaches out \nunnecessarily into their lives.\n  In closing, again, I applaud the efforts the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Alabama have underway to fix this resolution title \nin such a way that we all know that if a firm fails, it is going to go \nout of business. I think that will adequately address the concerns the \njunior Senator from Delaware brought up earlier about these big firms, \nin some cases, having funding advantages. I think once the public \nunderstands these firms can go out of business, just like any other \nentity, that will change. I think we are already seeing that through \nearly indications with credit rating agencies and others that are \nlooking at these entities.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3060-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3060-S3061]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of S. 3217, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3217) to promote the financial stability of the \n     United States by improving accountability and transparency in \n     the financial system, to end ``too big to fail,'' to protect \n     the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect \n     consumers from abusive financial services practices, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid (for Dodd-Lincoln) amendment No. 3739, in the nature \n     of a substitute.\n       Reid (for Boxer) amendment No. 3737 (to amendment No. \n     3739), to prohibit taxpayers from ever having to bail out the \n     financial sector.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be brief at this point.\n  First, let me thank the leadership and my colleagues, Democrats and \nRepublicans, for allowing us to get to this point. Now we are on the \nbill after all this time.\n  I didn't hear all the comments of my friend from Tennessee, but \nclearly we are making an effort to reach agreement where we can on some \nof the critical issues. Senator Shelby and I and our staffs have worked \nvery hard over the weekend to try to come to closure on the resolution \ntitle of the bill, title I and title II, that Senator Corker spent so \nmuch time working on. We thought we had done a pretty good job, but \nthere is always room for improvement to satisfy the interests people \nhave to make sure taxpayers will never be exposed. My hope is we will \nbe able to present that, Senator Shelby and I, to our colleagues to be \nable to close that issue and move on to the other areas of the bill \nthat people have interests in.\n  We have a number of amendments that I believe should be relatively \nnoncontroversial--either bipartisan amendments that Senators want to \noffer dealing with the Federal Trade Commission or dealing with the \nconsumer title. There are a number of amendments on which we have \nalready reached some agreement. My hope is we could have some \nunderstanding--obviously, I want to wait until Senator Shelby comes \nover--that we could enter a time agreement, a brief one, on the Boxer \namendment. We have all talked about the Boxer amendment, so maybe, \nhopefully, we could have that vote when we come back from our \nrespective caucus luncheons.\n  I hope at some point shortly thereafter, Senator Shelby and I will \noffer a proposal dealing with the resolution titles of the bill to \nclose that. I am told Senator Tester and Senator Hutchison have an \namendment, which sounds pretty good to us, dealing with some issues \ninvolving assessments on small banks that we agree with.\n  I know Senator Snowe and some others have amendments which we have \nworked on as well which we think are helpful to agree to.\n  Senators Hutchison and Rockefeller on the Federal Trade Commission, \nwe have reached agreement on that as well. There are a number of issues \nwhich I would like to at least deal with here where we have consensus.\n  Then, obviously, there are going to be some areas and amendments that \nwill come up that are controversial, that will require a good debate on \nthe floor--hopefully, not an endless one but debate on those matters. I \nwish to get to those soon. I know my colleagues who have those ideas \nwish to be heard, and I certainly wish to give them the opportunity to \ndo so. My hope is we will reach time agreements and have up-or-down \nvotes on them. That is the way this institution is supposed to operate. \nWe can avoid filibusters and those who want to extend the debate, even \nthough they are not happy with the amendment and don't like the \noutcome. I think we serve our interests well if, with the exception of \nthose that deserve some sort of attention like that, the overwhelming \nmajority of these issues ought to be debated and voted up or down and \nmove on to the next set of issues.\n  In the meantime, we try to work on ones that we know are coming along \nto see if we can't reach consensus as we have on a number of these \nitems.\n  That is sort of the game plan as I see it, but I obviously am not \ngoing to make any unanimous consent requests regarding time agreements \nuntil my colleague from Alabama is here in order to agree with that, \nbut my hope is to offer such unanimous consent proposal that on the \nBoxer amendment we reach a time certain fairly quickly. Again, it is a \nthree-line amendment that I think everyone has had a chance to hear us \ndiscuss over the last couple days. That goes to the heart of what \nSenator Corker was talking about; that is, to emphatically state \ntaxpayers not be exposed to the costs of any institution that fails and \nis wound down, either through resolution or more likely through \nbankruptcy--there is not taxpayer exposure. Since we all agree on that \nand the language is rather clear, my hope is we could spend a few \nminutes talking about it, making that point and vote and then move on \nto these other matters, seeking time agreements where appropriate.\n  That is how we will proceed. I have talked to the leader. Obviously, \nwe do not have an endless amount of time for this debate and this \nsubject matter, but my hope is, over the next week or two, to conclude, \nstarting early, staying a little later in the evening than we normally \ndo, even, if necessary, spending some time on the weekend. I know that \nis not normally done here, but, again, to get to the finish line on \nthis bill is going to take some time, given the numbers of amendments \npeople have on which they would like to be heard, in order to meet the \ngoals of the leadership to complete our work on this bill and move to \nthe other items that must be debated in this Chamber, aside from the \nfinancial services reform.\n  We have a lot of work to do in the coming 2 weeks on this matter. My \nhope is, people will bring their amendments early to us, to Senator \nShelby and to myself or our committee members, let us look at them and \nwork on them. Where we can accept or modify them, we will try to do so; \nwhere we cannot, provide the time so we can have a debate and vote on \nyour ideas. That is where we stand.\n  I have a number of requests for time. I am not going to make any \nunanimous consent requests for these, but a number of Members have \nasked for some time to speak today either on amendments they are going \nto be proposing or on the bill itself. I have that list. I will try to \naccommodate those Members, when I can, this afternoon. Again, the first \norder of business would be on the Boxer amendment.\n  Let me just say about that amendment, that again, the language of the \nBoxer amendment is rather straightforward. I read it the other day. It \nis a very brief amendment and very clear. It says:\n\n       At the end of title II add the following.\n\n  At the end of the resolution title, which is an elaborate title we \nspent months working on so as to make sure we would get it right; that \nis, the presumption is bankruptcy and, in the most painful alternative, \na resolution but one that you would not like to take at all. It is \nbankruptcy, putting these companies out of their misery and the country \nout of its misery without exposing the taxpayers to the cost. The \nmanagers all get fired under our bill. They are gone. Not only do they \nnot get bonuses, they don't have a job having done what they did. The \nshareholders lose, so shareholders have to pay more attention to what \nis happening to their companies of which they are owners. Creditors \nalso take tremendous hits in this proposal as well.\n  Senator Boxer has offered some very straightforward language, almost \nan exclamation point at the end of title II. I will read the amendment \nbecause it only takes about a minute to do so. She says:\n\n       Liquidation Required.--All financial companies put into \n     receivership under this title shall be liquidated.\n\n  If there was any doubt about the provisions--sentence No. 2.\n\n       No taxpayer funds shall be used to prevent the liquidation \n     of any financial company under this title.\n\n  A very clear, declarative sentence.\n\n       (b) Recovery of Funds.--All funds expended in the \n     liquidation of a financial company under this title shall be \n     recovered from the disposition of assets of such financial \n     company, or shall be the responsibility of the financial \n     sector, through assessments.\n\n\n[[Page S3062]]\n\n\n  Then:\n\n       (c) No Losses to Taxpayers.--Taxpayers shall [again, shall] \n     bear no losses from the exercise of any authority under this \n     title.\n\n  Again, it is very straightforward, a very clear amendment, one that \nbasically incorporates the views shared by all 100 Members of this \nbody.\n  Maybe there is someone who disagrees. If they do, I don't know who \nthey are. Every Senator I heard address this issue agrees with what \nSenator Boxer is suggesting with this very important language. It is \nnot a sense-of-the-Senate resolution. This is statutory language in the \nbill. My hope is, unless people want to have an elaborate discussion \nabout it, it seems pretty straightforward. I would like the first vote \nto be an amendment on which we can all come together as we begin our \ndebate in this Chamber. Not all amendments are going to end up that \nway, but on this one I think there is clarity and we ought to get \nbehind it and demonstrate our willingness to say, without any \nequivocation whatsoever: The taxpayers will not be exposed to the kind \nof charges and costs that they were in the fall of 2008.\n  I will sit and wait for Senator Shelby to come over and, in the \nmeantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3778\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President. I rise to speak about a \nbipartisan amendment, No. 3778, which Senator Lugar and I have filed \nbased on our bill, the Fair Access to Credit Scores Act of 2010. This \namendment has wide and growing support, both with consumer groups and \nlegislators of all political persuasions. I thank Senators Bond, Brown \nof Massachusetts, Brown of Ohio, Hagan, Levin, Lieberman, McCaskill, \nand Shaheen who are also sponsors of this amendment.\n  Our amendment takes a commonsense yet significant step toward putting \nconsumers back in control of their finances by offering Americans \nannual access to their credit score when they access their free annual \ncredit report.\n  I wish to clarify, because this is important. A credit report tells \nconsumers what outstanding credit accounts they have open, such as \nstudent loans, credit cards, even, perhaps, a car or a home loan. \nUnfortunately, it tells Americans little else. One's credit score, on \nthe other hand, which our legislation makes available, has the critical \ninformation consumers need to know. A credit score affects consumer \ninterest rates, monthly payments on home loans, and could be the \ndifference between whether a child is able to afford college. Credit \nscores even affect the consumer's ability to buy a car, rent an \napartment, and get a phone or even Internet service.\n  In 2003, Congress enacted legislation requiring the three major \nconsumer credit reporting agencies to provide a free annual credit \nreport to consumers. This law, known as the FACT Act, was an important \nstep in ensuring financial records of American consumers are accurate. \nHowever, since that time, many of my constituents have been misled to \nbelieve they have free access to their credit score, when what they \nhave is free access to a credit report. So we have the score versus the \nreport. Even thoughtful lawmakers in Congress do not realize American \nconsumers ultimately have to buy access to their credit score.\n  To be clear, banks and lenders can easily obtain these scores while \nconsumers cannot. That simply is not fair. We have all seen the \nfrequent television commercials or Internet advertisements which claim \nto offer consumers free access to their credit score. Unfortunately, \nconsumers are often disappointed to learn they only have access to \ntheir credit report, not the critical information they need to judge \ntheir own creditworthiness, their score. In the most troubling cases, \nconsumers often believe they are signing up to get a free credit score, \nonly to find out later that they unwittingly signed up for a costly \nmonitoring service that could cost nearly $200 a year.\n  In considering reforms to hold Wall Street accountable and rein in \ntheir shady dealings, we believe Congress should also work to protect \nconsumers from other unscrupulous financial practices. When there is a \ndeal that often seems too good to be true, many Americans ask \nthemselves: What is the catch. There certainly is a catch in this \ninstance. The problem is that Federal law tacitly supports it by \ndirecting consumers to credit rating agencies under false pretenses. We \nall know consumers want their score, but it is the last thing they \nreceive. We are literally sending Americans every day into a fine print \ntrap.\n  I am not surprised the credit reporting agencies and their lobbyists \nhave been hard at work over the last several days perpetuating fine \nprint arguments in opposing our amendment. They even claim credit \nscores belong to them, not the consumers whose livelihoods depend on \nthem. Would a doctor say that someone's blood pressure reading is their \ninformation, not the patient's? These agencies have also been \ncirculating a document opposing our effort because, according to them, \nit would not provide consumers any greater benefit than already \navailable. Something is up. They oppose our bill because it does not \noffer consumers enough benefits.\n  This is precisely the kind of misleading information included in \ntheir advertisements, as we see here in this photograph. This snapshot \ndoes not fully reflect the deception in this particular ad. It does \npicture a squirrel directing consumers to one of the Web sites claiming \nto offer a free credit score. But there is more to the story. While it \npatently seems to offer a free score, this credit reporting agency \nrequires consumers to enter their credit card information and registers \nthem for a costly credit monitoring service. We have to look closely at \nthe top of the ad to read the fine print that actually tells consumers \nthe real story. They have to subscribe to the company's service to \nreceive the actual credit score.\n  Members have probably seen this commercial which tells a sad story \nabout an individual whose poor credit score landed him in a dead-end \njob. If only he had access to his credit score, the ad explains with a \ncatchy jingle, he would have been able to take action and improve his \ncredit and his quality of life. Again, we have to look closely to read \nthe fine print. If the consumer goes to this site, they once again have \nto enter their credit card information and register for a service \ncostly of nearly $200 a year.\n  It says:\n\n       Free credit score and report with enrollment in Triple \n     Advantage.\n\n  Ironically, these credit reporting agencies are walking the halls of \nCongress telling Members that our bill is somehow ``unfair and \nunfounded.'' They want to protect a Federal law that has given them a \nmonopoly on this information and continues to direct unwitting \nconsumers their way. We agree, those of us who have sponsored this \nlegislation, with these credit reporting agencies that a credit score \nis important information. Perhaps their misleading ads have convinced \nconsumers they need to know this information. However, luring hard-\nworking Americans into a costly credit monitoring service is simply not \nfair, especially when Federal law nudges consumers in their direction.\n  We have all come to the floor this week from both sides of the aisle \nexplaining what we want to do to protect consumers and do what is right \nfor Main Street. We have a chance to right this wrong here and now, \nthis week. Put simply, this amendment accomplishes what the television \ncommercials and their fine print caveats have deceptively claimed for \nyears--the offer of a free credit score. That is why the Consumer \nFederation of America, the Consumers Union, and a wide range of \nconsumer advocates support this legislation. While free access to a \nconsumer's credit score is only a small part of the larger reforms \nneeded, it addresses one of the fundamental inequities that pervades \nthe current financial system. Put simply, our one-sided marketplace \ntoday is often rigged to benefit large financial institutions at the \nexpense of hard-working Americans struggling to support their families \nand save for retirement.\n  If we want to empower Americans to reclaim their financial health, we \nhave to start with a dose of transparency.\n\n[[Page S3063]]\n\nWhen so much is at stake, this amendment is a small step that will help \nrestore balance and give Americans the tools they need to take back \ncontrol of their personal finances.\n  My strong hope is that we will be able to vote on this important \namendment in order to restore an even greater dose of fairness to \nconsumers in my state of Colorado and all around the Nation.\n  I urge and request that each one of my colleagues support its \npassage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, let me say to my colleague, I \nappreciate his efforts in this regard. He and Senator Lugar and others \nhave worked on it. They are absolutely right. People ought to have a \nright to know what their credit scores are. They are critical when it \ncomes to that home mortgage. The interest rate that one pays, the \ndownpayment they are required to meet, are all linked to what the \ncredit score is. We have seen in the past how credit scores can \nactually be very different than what they should be. When people have \nhad to fight for years to get a credit score restored because of \nidentity theft, all sorts of things can happen. We had a hearing not \ntoo many years ago on this issue where the theft of identity requested \nin a person running wild with some credit cards. The individual who had \nhis credit cards stolen then spent years trying to rehabilitate his own \nname and reputation because of what had happened and could never get \naccess to his credit scores except that every financial transaction he \nwent to engage in, he paid an awful price because the credit scores \nwere obviously low, in light of the fact that people had stolen his \ncards and had run up huge debt. So in, everything else he was involved \nin where an interest rate was involved, his family paid a price for it.\n  Aside from having the knowledge of what it is, the ability to correct \nit as well is something we have spent a lot of time on. There is hardly \nan American citizen at one point or another who hasn't run into this \ndifficulty. Today, in an era when so much of our well-being depends \nupon our credit scores, how we are rated, this becomes a critical \npoint. People ought to know, what is my credit score, so they can \neither strengthen it or understand why they are being charged the \nvarious rates they are.\n  I commend my friend from Colorado and Senator Lugar. He mentioned \nothers who are on the bill with him as well. I thank him for raising \nit. In the coming days, my hope is we will be able to provide some time \nto further debate it, if he so desires, and maybe get agreement to \nadopt the amendment.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. I thank the Banking Committee chairman for his \ninterest in this bipartisan amendment. I take to heart his comments on \nthe importance of having access to one's credit score. We all have \naccess to our credit reports. Those are important. But frankly, one \nought to understand what is in their credit report. It is the loans, \nthe financial obligations and liabilities one has. It is much harder to \nget one's credit score. We hear a lot about financial literacy, about \ntaking control of one's own destiny when it comes to their financial \nfuture. This would be an important tool to have in the hands of \nconsumers.\n  The agencies and the institutions that develop these scores are \nsaying, as I said, that this is unfair and unfounded. But they have \nfound, frankly, when they made the credit reports available on a one-\ntime basis annually for free, it actually created more traffic and more \nbusiness. I predict that when you get your score that one time each \nyear for free, you will want to check over time on that score, and that \nwill create additional business for these companies. Much like when I \nto go my ATM, I am always curious about the flow in and out of my \nchecking account. Sometimes I check the last ten transactions. That \nresults in a little bit of income stream to the bank. I don't resent \nthat because I have the information at hand. When I was given the \nopportunity to have that information initially, that triggered a \ngreater interest in being more financially engaged.\n  This is common sense. Its bipartisan support shows there is \nwidespread support for this idea. I thank the chairman again for his \ninterest and support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3737\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here this morning. I \nam anxious to get started on voting on amendments so we can tackle the \nissue of Wall Street reform. We have to keep an eye on what happened to \nour economy, because Wall Street had no reasonable regulation. Markets \nwere operating in the dark. There was very little fiduciary \nresponsibility involved. There was all of this gambling with credit \ndefault swaps and CDOs. I am reading a book called ``The Big Short.'' \nIf anyone wants to try to understand what happened, read that. It is \nunbelievable what happened with derivatives, all operating in the dark.\n\n  I wish to say to Senator Dodd how much I appreciate the work he has \nput into this bill. To put it simply, what the bill does is it ends \ntaxpayer bailouts, flat out. That is why I was shocked when Members of \nthe Senate on the other side of the aisle came down to the Senate floor \nand started criticizing the bill, saying it didn't end taxpayer \nbailouts, when that is what it does. That led me to think I would like \nto work with Senator Dodd on an amendment that clarifies this main \npoint in the bill.\n  Senator Dodd and his staff--and I worked with the Obama \nadministration on it as well--said let's sit down and work it out. So \nwe have a very strong amendment here that is not a sense of the Senate; \nit is real law. It is strong law. I hope it passes. I say to my friend \nSenator Dodd I hope this passes by a huge number of votes. What we do \nhere is summed up in part C:\n\n       Taxpayers shall bear no losses from the exercise of any \n     authority under this title.\n\n  This isn't saying they shouldn't bear a loss; it says taxpayers shall \nbear no loss. They shall bear no loss. The rest of it basically says: \nNo company is going to be kept alive in this bill with any taxpayer \nmoney. If a company is in trouble and they need to be liquidated, then \nthe funds that are used will be recovered from the disposition of \nassets of such financial company or shall be the responsibility of the \nfinancial sector, through assessments.\n  It is very similar to FDIC. As we know, when we put our hard-earned \ndollars into the bank, we are covered now up to $250,000 because there \nis an insurance program which is paid for via an assessment on the \nbanks. It is called the FDIC, and we all know because we worry about \nthat. If there was anything that was learned from the Great Depression, \nit is that there was a run on the banks, and guess what. The banks were \nout of money. People literally lost their world. So after those years a \nlong time ago, FDIC insured. It is very important.\n  We are doing the same thing here. We are saying that if there is a \nliquidation required of some of these hot-shot firms that continue to \ngamble, that continue to take risks and something goes wrong, they are \nnot going to be kept alive, they are going to be put to sleep and the \nmoney that is expended to do that will come from the financial sector \nitself, and taxpayers, again, shall bear no losses from the exercise of \nany authority under this title.\n  What else does the Dodd bill do? It ends taxpayer bailouts and, with \nmy amendment, that is going to be even clearer. It puts a cop on the \nbeat for consumers. Why is this important? Because the people who were \ntrampled upon during the whole Wall Street crisis were middle-class \nfamilies who depended on these big firms to protect their pension \nfunds, to protect their assets that they might have had in mutual \nfunds. Instead, all of that went out the window.\n  We need to also have a cop on the beat to look at credit card \ncompanies and the kinds of things they do that harm our people.\n  The third thing is it brings disclosure to dark markets. The bill \neliminates loopholes that allow reckless speculative practices to go \nunnoticed, and it brings real regulation to the derivatives markets and \nthe shadow banking system that grew up around it. These kinds of \ninstruments, as they are called--derivatives--they are based on--let's \ntake an example of a bunch of mortgages that are packaged together and \nsold. Somebody came up with the great idea: Well, maybe we should take\n\n[[Page S3064]]\n\ninsurance against them going broke, and they played both sides of it. \nThey had derivatives on derivatives on derivatives. The house of cards \ncame down. We want disclosure for these dark markets; otherwise, the \nregulators simply don't know what is going on.\n  Risky behavior on Wall Street will be curbed. There are strict new \ncapital and borrowing requirements as financial companies grow in size \nand complexity. There are restrictions on proprietary trading, which \nmeans a bank trading for their own interests. We had circumstances \nwhere a bank was telling its customers to buy a stock or a bond and \nthey were shorting. They were making a bet that it would go down while \nthey were selling it to people and saying, Oh, it has a great future. \nThere is something so unfair about this and, frankly, corrupt about \nthis. Where is the fiduciary responsibility? How do you go out and tell \nyour best customers: Hey, this is good. We are going to go forward. Buy \nthis. Then they go back to their office and short it so they can make \nmoney on it collapsing. There is something very wrong with that. We \nhave lost our way. They have lost their way.\n  We have protection against securities market scams, improvements at \nthe FTC, where we will have the Office of Credit Rating Agency that \nwill strengthen the regulation of credit rating agencies, many of which \nfailed to correctly rate risky financial products. My colleagues know \nthat Moody's is one example, Standard & Poor's is the other. They said, \nOh, this is a AAA. These assets that are based on all of these \nmortgages, this is a AAA, feel comfortable with it, when they knew, \nfrankly, it wasn't. It was a conflict of interest. They were getting \npaid by the people who wanted them to come out and say they were rated \nAAA. There is something awful about this. If we cannot trust a rating \nagency, how are we going to know what we want to buy for our portfolio? \nI don't care if you are a very small investor or an institutional \ninvestor, an investor who is investing say for a pension company that \nyou work for. I think we have to have even greater oversight over these \nrating agencies than is in the bill. I applaud what is in the bill. I \nam going to be offering something that holds these people accountable. \nAgain, if my colleagues read the book I am reading, they realize how \nthe people who work at these rating agencies were doing the bidding of \nthose who wanted to get a AAA rate.\n  So we end taxpayer bailouts in this bill. The Boxer amendment is \ngoing to ensure that is so clearly stated. We put a cop on the beat for \nconsumers. We bring disclosure to these formerly dark markets. We curb \nrisky behavior on Wall Street because we require them to have more \ncapital, less gambling. We create an early warning system with a \nfinancial stability oversight council to make sure we see trouble \ncoming before it hits. We protect against securities market scams by \ngoing after these rating companies and saying, Hey, you have a \nresponsibility to be honest when you rate an instrument; it shouldn't \nbe rated a certain way because the person who is paying you wants it \nrated a certain way. That should be criminal.\n  I think it is going to be very clear as we get into this bill.\n  I am a little surprised it is taking so long. I say to Chairman Dodd, \nI am a little surprised it is taking so long to get a vote on the \nsimplest amendment of them all.\n  Let's put this chart back up. What is the problem here? If people \nwant to talk about making this stronger, let's talk, but don't hold us \nup. I would ask my friend, do we have any agreement yet on voting on \nthe Boxer amendment, which is so clear? Here it is on one board. This \nis the whole amendment. Do we have an agreement yet?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, if my colleague will yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I have read the amendment so many times I could almost \nrecite it verbatim. It is only four sentences. As I understand it, I \ndon't hear any objection to it whatsoever. Someone recently said can't \nwe just accept it. I said I think my friend from California would like \nto have a vote on it and she has a right to a vote. So, again, my hope \nis, frankly, we could have an agreement to cast a vote on this at 2:15 \nwhen we return from the respective caucus lunches. I am waiting to hear \nfrom my Republican friends and colleagues because obviously I can't \nmake a unanimous consent without them being in the room.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague. I would say \nthe reason I think it is important to have a vote is because for days \nand days and days, my friend, the Senator from Connecticut, and my \nfriend, the Senator from Virginia, were down on this floor defending \nthis bill and making it clear that this would finally put an end to too \nbig to fail; that, in fact, taxpayers are not going to be on the hook. \nWe are going to wind these companies down and they are going to have to \nbe gone. They are going to go to sleep. They are going to be gone. They \nare going to be liquidated, and then taxpayers are going to be made \nwhole. This is clear.\n  Our colleagues on the other side were all over national television. I \ndon't know how many times they said this bill is ensuring that there \nwill be more taxpayer bailouts. That is why I wrote this. It seems to \nme a little odd that we are waiting and waiting. Since our friends say \nthey want an amendment such as this, why don't we get started.\n  There are lots of amendments on both sides of the aisle, some of \nwhich will make this bill stronger, in my opinion, and some of which \nwill make this bill weaker, in my opinion. We will do what the Senate \ndoes. We will debate these issues. I know my friend is waiting. It \nseems to me that if we are going to this crisis--and I ask to show the \ncharts--we cannot sit around here day after day and waste time.\n  These are some of the headlines we had: ``Economy In Crisis.'' ``What \nNow?'' ``Tax Problems.'' ``This Is A Nightmare.''\n  This is what we saw.\n  We have another chart that shows the headlines.\n  ``U.S. Consumer Sentiment Decreases to 28-year Low.'' ``Jobs, Wages \nNowhere Near Rock Bottom yet.''\n  What a mess.\n  ``Wall Street Crash Leaves New Yorkers In The `Eye Of The Hurricane.' \n''\n  This is just a smattering of these headlines.\n  We have some more to share:\n  ``Where Do We Go From Here?'' ``Nightmare On Wall Street.''\n  This is what the country went through. I know we want to forget it. \nWe never want to have it happen again, but we can't wish it away. \n``Nightmare On Wall Street.'' ``Where Do We Go From Here?''\n  Today we are ready to answer the question. No more nightmares and no \nmore taxpayer bailouts, and no more gambling.\n  Will this bill solve every single problem? No. There will be people \nwho think something else up. But here is the good news about this bill: \nIt puts a cop on the beat, so any of these new ideas that come to the \nforefront--these new instruments, these new derivatives--will finally \nbe under the watchful eye of a consumer regulatory agency that has only \none thing on its plate: protecting consumers from the rip-offs and the \ngambling and the callous disregard for morality that we saw on Wall \nStreet.\n  So I say to my friends on the other side: Let's go. Let's do this. \nLet's get started. Let's have the Senate work its will, and let's be \nable to tell the people of this country that in a bipartisan fashion, \nwe took a stand against the nightmare on Wall Street and we basically \nsaid those days are gone and we will get back to sensible rules of the \nroad.\n  I will close with this. A lot of us I think were interested in \nwatching the Kentucky Derby, a few minutes of the most exciting sport. \nI thought to myself as I watched that there are rules of the road in \nthis sport. It is all about gambling. People out and out gamble. There \nis no hiding it.\n  They just go out and gamble. They put the dollars on the horse they \nchoose. But there are rules of the road. You can't have a horse running \nthat has been drugged. You cannot do that. You cannot have a jockey in \nthe race who uses foul play to knock over another jockey or run in a \nfashion that would disqualify him. So even in a sport like horseracing, \nwhich is out-\n\n[[Page S3065]]\n\nand-out gambling, there are rules of the track, rules of the road.\n  It seems to me that on Wall Street, where you are dealing with the \nlife savings and the hopes and dreams of our people, our businesses, \nand our children, that there need to be reasonable rules of the road \nand no more taxpayer bailouts. Let's get started and vote aye on the \nBoxer amendment and make this bill even better. It is a terrific bill, \nbut we can make it even better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from California who \nhas been patient and has done a good job. I describe her statutory \nlanguage as sort of the exclamation point in this. As the amendment \nreads, the very first line--and, again, I don't have to read it--at the \nend of this title includes the following. So it is at the end of the \ntitle. It is complicated to get this right, so we have a winding down \nand a disposition in receivership and bankruptcy in these institutions.\n  In case anybody had doubts about what the language does, the \namendment says the word ``shall'' in every sentence. There are no \n``mays.'' The taxpayer ``shall'' not be exposed. There ``shall'' be \nliquidation. It is very clear what we are trying to achieve. I know \nnobody objects.\n  We are on the bill. We ought to be able to start on a positive note. \nWe are going to have times of significant division and debate on this \nbill coming up. I thought it might be worthwhile for the American \npublic to witness a Senate that can actually, as it begins debate, do \nso with some unanimity. That doesn't happen with great frequency, but \nto start on that basis makes sense to me.\n  I hope our colleagues will agree with that conclusion and allow this \namendment to be voted on as soon as we come back from our caucuses and \nthen move to other amendments, hopefully, where there is agreement, \ndemonstrating again that we are not fighting every single issue with \neach other. There is a lot of agreement about what ought to be in the \nbill.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank my colleague. The reason I did this, frankly, was \nbecause the other side seemed to be misunderstanding what this bill \ndid. So I was hopeful that they would just say: Terrific; now it is \nclear. No losses to taxpayers--``taxpayers shall bear no losses from \nthe exercise of any authority under this title.''\n  I understand Senator Kyl said yesterday this was a sense of the \nSenate. It is clear. It is not a sense of the Senate: liquidation \nrequired, recovery of funds, taxpayers shall. There is no ``should.'' \nIt is real. So that is why I am hopeful that if we can get started with \na bipartisan vote, it will make the life of our chairman a lot easier \nbecause at least we would come forward with something on which we can \nstand together.\n  I thank the Senator so much for working with me to make sure this is \nclear as a bell. As the Senator says, bills are complex. And people \nsay: Why is this bill 800 pages? Well, it is complicated because we \nhave to amend language in so many parts of the Federal law. But this is \nclear. We sum it up. We sum up the title in this way.\n  I am excited about voting on this. I will be back after the luncheon \nhour to--if I need to--make the case again--not that my colleague \nhasn't done it for me, but I want to lift a little bit of the burden \noff his shoulders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I commend the Senator from California for \nher amendment. As one of the people who was charged by the chairman to \nwork on this section of how we make sure we put appropriate barriers to \nfirms getting too large and barriers to firms being too big to fail, \nand should they fail, making sure taxpayers are never on the hook \nagain, I think the amendment of the Senator from California adds that \nemphasis. We took the chairman's charge at his word.\n  This is an area where there was complete bipartisan agreement. I had \nthe good fortune of working with my friend and colleague, the Senator \nfrom Tennessee, on this issue. We put a strong preference in the bill \ntoward bankruptcy as the normal process, and even put into place a new \nseries of requirements for large firms--particularly internationally \nsignificant firms--to come forward to the regulators and describe how \nthey can unwind themselves through an orderly bankruptcy process, that \nbeing the normal process. But in the event, as we saw in 2008, there \nmay be times, even with the best laid plans, when you may reach a level \nof crisis that would require resolution, if there is resolution, it \nshould not be propping up firms the way we did it in the fall of 2008. \nThe resolution should be a death knell for any firm that is put into \nthat process. It should be something any logical management team or \nseries of shareholders would want to avoid at all costs.\n  We put forward a process where it is postfunded. I think reasonable \nfolks can agree on which is the best option. At the end of the day, if \nthere are any funds used to make sure we can unwind this firm in an \norderly process so that it doesn't cause any further systemic damage to \nthe overall financial system, and indirectly to the American taxpayer, \nand if the financial system is shored up by that action, that any costs \nnot recouped--if this firm goes out of business and it is being put out \nof business, if there are funds expended and they have to be recouped \nfrom some source, that source should not be the American taxpayer.\n  Again, I commend the Senator from California for her efforts with \nthis amendment. It adds that exclamation point. Again, I cannot imagine \nthat my colleagues on the other side, who I know share the same view, \ndo not want to make sure taxpayers will never be exposed again by the \nmistakes made by Wall Street. I think this amendment is a good place to \nstart this debate, where we have that common cause.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3065-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3065]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. DODD.

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a second?\n  I ask unanimous consent that after Senator Brown speaks, Senator \nMikulski be recognized and then I be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                       Honoring our Armed Forces\n\n                       Sergeant Robert J. Barrett\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise today to say a few \nwords about a hero: Massachusetts Army National Guard SGT Robert J. \nBarrett who was killed in Afghanistan on April 19. I had the sad honor \nof attending his funeral this past weekend.\n  So everyone knows, Robert was on foot patrol south of Kabul when an \nIED exploded, killing him and injuring eight of his fellow soldiers of \n1st Battalion, 101st Field Artillery Regiment. He was 21 years old.\n  Robert was from Fall River, a city of 90,000 in the southeastern part \nof Massachusetts. He was a long-time member of the 54th Massachusetts \nVolunteer Regiment. He geared his life toward helping others, \nespecially veterans.\n  He was selected for the regiment's honor guard in early 2008 and took \npart in more than 350 events honoring our fallen soldiers, including \nmarching in the President's inaugural parade a little more than a year \nago.\n  His primary mission in Afghanistan was of the utmost importance. He \nwas training Afghan soldiers so they would be able to stand up and \nprovide security for their own country. Rather than spend his free time \nrelaxing, he gave of his time and knowledge by volunteering at local \norphanages and\n\n[[Page S3066]]\n\nschools. Robert was a shining example of ``selfless service,'' one of \nthe seven Army values.\n  Before his deployment, Robert wrote several lines that summarized his \nthoughts about his service and our mission overseas. I wish to take one \nfinal moment to read one of his thoughts:\n\n       I volunteered to put my life on the line for freedom and \n     country. For my fellow soldiers, for my little girl, for my \n     weeping mother and father. I am going to a land where \n     American freedom is just a dream, a hope, a slow reality. I \n     am an American Soldier.\n\n  That was by Robert J. Barrett before he mobilized.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the issue of \nfinancial services. Before I do, I wish to say to the Senator from \nMassachusetts, Mr. Brown, that we in Maryland express our condolences \nto him and his loss. We have suffered many of our own. We are comrades \nin arms in this moment of grief. We salute him and respect the family.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I thank the Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nan issue about which I care very deeply and have fought for all of my \nlife. That is financial services reform.\n  I am not a Janie-come-lately to this issue. In 1999, I opposed the \nrepeal of the Glass-Steagall Act which led to the crisis we have today. \nI was one of eight Senators to vote against the repeal of the Glass-\nSteagall Act which tore down the walls between conventional banking and \ninvestment banking. Had that bill been defeated in 1999, we would have \nnot had the crisis that faced us in the last 2 years.\n  My family, too, has fought over generations to protect consumers and \nexpand access to credit. At the beginning of the old century when the \ndowntown banks would not lend to people such as my family, whom they \nregarded as on the other side of the tracks, my grandfather, along with \nother small business people in the area, got together and started a \nsavings and loan to serve that community. They lent to people who did \nnot have access to credit. They lent to small business owners, such as \nmy father, who opened a grocery store. They lent to women, such as my \ngrandmother, who opened a bakery. When tough times came during the \nGreat Depression, this savings and loan wanted to make sure that people \nwould not lose their homes. If you paid a nickel a week on your \nmortgage, you were current.\n  I was raised in that sense that financial institutions should be on \nthe side of the people and they should have access to the American \ndream to buy a home, to start a business.\n  As a young social worker working in Baltimore's African-American \ncommunity, I saw, once again, there was no access to credit. The \nAfrican-American community was sidelined and red-lined. What we saw \nwere these local payday vendors who had names such as Happy Harry. Why \nwas Harry so happy? It was because he was charging 18 to 20 percent \ninterest for a loan.\n  I got together with the people in the community at the parish council \nand we were able to start a credit union so there would be access to \ncredit and end the scamming and scheming and gouging of those hard-\nworking people.\n  I continued that fight in the Senate. I helped create a task force in \nBaltimore to end that scheme and scam. I also worked as the Chair of \nthe Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations Subcommittee. I made sure \nin 2009, working with Senator Shelby and listening to the comments of \nSenator Dodd, that we put extra money in the Federal checkbook so the \nFBI could come after the financial fraud crowds, the mortgage fraud, \nthe securities fraud.\n  It sure was not the Securities and Exchange Commission. They were too \nbusy sitting on their wingtips while money was flying out the door with \nthese terrible lending practices.\n  As we deal with this bill pending before the Senate, the Restoring \nAmerican Financial Stability Act, I want you to know I support this \nbill. I have been a reformer and a watchdog all of my life. I have a \ndeep suspicion of how big banks treat the little people and what they \ndo with the little people's money. Time and time again, we see the \nconsequences of loose regulations and wimpy and tepid enforcement. Yes, \nI said it, wimpy and tepid enforcement.\n  Time and time again, I voted for more teeth and better regulation and \nmore enforcement. I always wanted to be sure it was Main Street that \ngot access to credit, and I was against the unfair and abusive \npractices of Wall Street.\n  Here we are again in this financial situation where we bailed out the \nbig banks. We bailed out the whales, we bailed out the sharks, and we \nhave left the people in the community, the little minnows, to swim \nupstream and be on their own.\n  Now is the time to right this reform. Now is the opportunity to pass \nreal financial reform that puts the strongest consumer protections in \nfinancial reform and to ensure that the greed of Wall Street does not \ntrump the needs of Main Street.\n  We need to put government back on the side of the middle class. If we \ncan bail out the banks, how about we make sure we protect the middle \nclass against fraud, duplicity, and gouging? People with limited access \nto credit are being victimized, abused, and defrauded. It is both a \ncrime and a shame.\n\n  Since the people who do it have no shame, maybe we have to make it a \ncrime. In fact, I think we ought to make it a crime. When they get out \nof their pinstripes and start wearing orange jumpsuits and stand out in \nthe crowd on visiting day, rather than cruising parents' weekends, \nmaybe they will have some remorse, and maybe they will be ready to \nchange the nature of their practices.\n  When I travel around my State, whether it is in diners or grocery \nstores, there is anger and frustration in people's voices. They are \nmad, and they are scared. They have watched Wall Street executives pay \nthemselves lavish salaries while they are worried about their job and \nbeing laid off. They have watched Wall Street mortgage brokers profit \noff irresponsible lending while their husbands work an extra shift to \nmake sure they can make the monthly mortgage payment. And they have \nwatched big firms take very risky gambles with their money without any \nregulation. It essentially was casino economics. This is why people are \nmad, and they are losing trust in government. People they counted on to \nprotect them did not.\n  What infuriates the people of Maryland and of this country and me is \nthere is no remorse by Wall Street about what they did. Nothing about \ntheir behavior suggests they have learned or even care what is wrong. \nLook at what happened with AIG after receiving $170 billion in taxpayer \nmoney. They paid themselves $165 million in bonuses. I stood on the \nfloor and said ``AIG'' stands for ``ain't I greedy.''\n  I do not want to have catchy phrases. I want to have concrete, \nenforceable, tough regulations. Again, what bothers me is the lack of \nremorse and a commitment to reform.\n  Right or wrong, if you are in a 12-step program, people usually say \nthat one of the ways to right those wrongs is to say ``I am sorry'' and \nmean it. I did wrong and I will never do it again. I want to make \namends by making it right.\n  Not these guys. They need us to have a tough approach to this \nsituation. They say: We will never do anything like that again. \nActually they do not even say that.\n  What we need to do is to make sure we have the strongest regulations. \nWe have an opportunity now to choose between real reform or business as \nusual. Consumers need protection in regulation to guarantee the safety \nof their deposits and the availability of basic banking services. Small \nbusiness needs credit to grow so that they can create a job for \nthemselves and for those in their community. And we need to hold Wall \nStreet accountable. We need to make sure there are no taxpayer bailouts \never again and to ensure when banks take risks, they do it with their \nown money, not with money out of the deposits of hard-working people.\n  The bill before us is an excellent bill. It provides a 21st century \nregulatory framework for the financial system. No more scheming, no \nmore scamming, no more preying.\n  It is time to pass this bill. There are amendments pending that I \nthink will also help to improve the bill, but I\n\n[[Page S3067]]\n\nthink it is time that we pull the sharks out of the tank, make sure the \nwhales do not crush the little guy, and to make sure that the minnows \nget a chance and that we have an economy that is swimming.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak briefly on the bill that is \nbefore us and how I think it can be improved.\n  First, I congratulate the chairman of the committee, working with the \nranking member. I understand they have reached an agreement on how to \ndo the issue of resolution, which addresses the issue of too big to \nfail, which is a very critical part of this bill. I congratulate them \nfor making that type of initiative. I hope the rumors are true and that \nsuch an amendment will address strong too-big-to-fail language so the \nAmerican taxpayers will not be on the hook for institutions that \noverextend themselves and take on too much risk but are institutions \nthat are so large it is felt they are too big to fail, that concept \nwill no longer be part of our lexicon, and we will essentially put an \nend to that. I congratulate the chairman and ranking member.\n  There are, however, other major issues in this bill that need to be \naddressed. They are substantial and rather complex. A few that are not \neven in the bill--for example, how we address Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac. We know that the American taxpayers today are on the hook for \nsomewhere between $400 billion and $500 billion--$400 billion to $500 \nbillion--that we are going to have to underwrite in order to stabilize \nthose two entities on the credits which they have run up which have \ngone bad and they have purchased. That is serious.\n  There will be a proposal that comes from our side of the aisle. It \nwill not totally be structured to Fannie and Freddie. It should. I \nwould like to see that. It is too complex to do in this bill. It will \nat least address some of the core issues that ought to be addressed. \nFor example, we ought to tell the American people upfront and \nforthrightly how much they owe. It should be put on budget. We ought to \nput on budget what the obligations are, because they are scoreable, \nrelative to the costs the American taxpayers are going to have to bear \nto bail out and maintain Fannie and Freddie. It is going to be \nsomewhere around $400 billion to $500 billion additional debt. It is \ncoming. We do not want to talk about it because it affects other debt \nobligations of this country in a lot of different ways, primarily in \ncrowding out.\n  Second, the bill has language on underwriting but it is not strong \nenough. If you want to look at what caused this event at the end of \n2008, what caused this traumatic event which almost brought the entire \nfinancial system of America down, which almost put us into a depression \nand put us into a very severe recession, cost a lot of people their \njobs--and there are still a lot of people experiencing trauma because \nof it--there are three or four main causes. I have talked about them \nbefore:\n\n  One, of course, is that I believe the money was made too easy to get, \nat too low a price, for too long by the Fed.\n  Another was the fact that the Congress specifically encouraged and, \nin fact, forced lenders, for all intents and purposes, to lend to \npeople who couldn't afford the homes they were buying because it became \ncongressional policy to do that.\n  Another was that people were shopping for the weakest regulators. \nThis is what happened in the derivatives market, and the derivatives \nwere not structured in a way that actually put capital or liquidity or \nmargin behind derivatives.\n  The fourth and I think probably the most significant was that there \nwas a total breakdown in underwriting standards. In other words, the \npeople who were making the loans on subprime mortgages and on other \ntypes of exotic instruments so that people could buy houses who \ncouldn't afford them were making those loans and not looking at the \nunderlying value of the asset, and they weren't looking at the ability \nof the person to pay back that loan. What they were doing, quite \nsimply, was making the loan because they were going to get a fee for it \nand then they were going to sell the loan, securitize it. It was going \nto be chopped up, sent out, and syndicated, and they didn't really care \nwhat the loan did because they were basically making a loan for the \npurpose of making a fee. Those were the one-off lenders.\n  In the banking industry, you had a complete breakdown. Banks were \nlending to people they knew couldn't repay when these loans reset, and \nthey knew the value of the asset could only support that loan if there \nwas an appreciation in the market, which was a gamble.\n  This happens every time we go through one of these events, by the \nway, one of these real estate-driven recessionary events. It happened \nin the late 1970s; it happened in the late 1980s when I was Governor of \nNew Hampshire and New England went through a horrific contraction as a \nresult of an expansive effort of lending money in the real estate \nmarkets--underwriting standards break down.\n  There needs to be a clear national definition of what proper \nunderwriting standards are. Senator Isakson and I and a number of other \npeople--Senator Corker--are going to put forward an amendment in that \narea.\n  One of the core areas here that needs to be addressed and hopefully \nwill be included in this bill and improve the bill in this area--one \narea of this bill that simply has to be changed if it is to be \neffective in doing what it is supposed to do is the language of \nderivatives.\n  Most Americans don't understand derivatives. It is understandable. \nThey are complex products. But basically think of it this way: You are \non Main Street, and you have a business--usually a fairly large \nbusiness--and you are making a product. You want to be able to sell \nthat product to somebody at the price you quote that person and make \nthe profit you expected at that quoted price.\n  But there are a lot of things that affect that product that you can't \ncontrol. If you are selling it to another country, you can't control \nwhat the dollar is going to do in relationship to the currency of that \ncountry--for example, if you are selling it to Brazil, whether their \ncurrency goes up or down vis-a-vis the dollar. If you enter into a \ncontract today and can't sell your product for 6 months, your whole \nprofit could be wiped out by the market devaluing as relates to that \ncurrency. The materials you buy to make that product may change in \nvalue or viability. The person you are getting a loan from to allow you \nto expand your business to build that product may have financial \ntroubles and you may have an issue there or, vice versa, you may have \nan issue with that person. All of these are things which are usually \nbeyond the ability of the individual who is making the product--and in \nthis case, I am talking about making products--to control.\n  So there is something called a derivative, which is an insurance \nitem. Basically, someone insures for you over those risks. There is a \nlot of complexity to this because these insurance items mutate into all \nsorts of different instruments. They can affect financial instruments, \nthey can affect commodities, they can affect goods, they can affect \njust plain currencies, but they are critical instruments--derivatives--\nfor making the economic engine work. They are sort of the grease you \nput in the economic engine to make sure it doesn't seize up, to allow \nthe economic engine to move down the road. They are so critical, in \nfact, that they are approximately $600 trillion--trillion--of notional \nvalue. Notional value is not really what the risk is because there are \nunderlying assets here, but that is a big number--a big number.\n  So we have to make sure that when we amend the derivatives section of \nthis bill to try to have a stronger derivatives industry, we don't make \nbig mistakes and basically undermine the ability of people to use this \ntype of instrument to get credit and to make the markets work and to \ncreate jobs on Main Street because these all tie back to jobs on Main \nStreet. Even if you are not working for the company that uses the \nderivatives, you are probably working for somebody who does business \nwith a company that does derivatives. In Nashua, NH, there are a bunch \nof big companies that do derivatives. There are a lot more smaller \ncompanies that sell products to those companies on Main Street. So it \nwill affect Main Street if we do this wrong because credit will \ncontract.\n\n[[Page S3068]]\n\n  The unique advantage America has is that we are the place in the \nworld where, if you have a good idea and you are willing to take a risk \nyourself and you are an entrepreneur, you can usually get capital and \ncredit to allow you to do that idea, to take that risk and thus create \njobs, which is the bottom line for all of us; we want to create jobs. \nSo derivatives play a large role in making that system work. This bill, \nunfortunately, adopted language which was put forward in the \nAgriculture Committee which literally undermines the safety and \nsoundness of the derivatives market and, secondly, the ability of \nAmerica to be a leader in the derivatives market.\n  Our goal here should be very simple. Our goal should be two steps: \nOne, make our banking and financial system safer, sounder, and a system \nwhich will, to the extent we can anticipate it, avoid systemic risk. \nWhile doing that, our second goal must be to have a vibrant credit \nmarket and capital market and be the primary place in the world where \npeople come to create credit and capital because that gives us a \ncompetitive advantage over the rest of the world. That creates jobs \nhere in the United States. Unfortunately, this bill, as structured, \ndoesn't accomplish that. In fact, it undermines that.\n  A good derivatives reform bill would essentially create an atmosphere \nwhere derivatives are more transparent, where the pricing is more \ntransparent, and where there is standing behind the two parties to an \nagreement on a derivatives contract--assets, liquidity, margin--\nsomething that can be turned to should one of the parties fail to \nperform on the contract. This can be done by creating a reasonable \nexception for end-use derivatives--those are the ones where you \nbasically have a purely commercial purpose--and if people don't fall \ninto that reasonable exception, then requiring essentially all the \nother derivatives to go through what is called a clearinghouse.\n  The clearinghouse becomes basically the situation where the two \nparties to the contract--there are multiple parties to the contract--\nessentially put up collateral, margin, liquidity, so that the contracts \nare supported--the counterparties are supported. The clearinghouse \nitself also has to be collateralized adequately, capitalized \nadequately, so that it doesn't become a risk because it is going to be \nthe insurer, basically, of these contracts--all very doable through new \nregulatory restructure or a modified regulatory restructure.\n  Then, as these contracts become more standardized or are \nstandardized, they move over to an exchange. A lot of them could do \nthat right now, but some simply can't because their contracts are too \ncustomized to move directly to an exchange. But over time, most of them \nprobably will. And that is the way it should be structured.\n  Unfortunately, in this bill, it is directed that we set up a new \nprocess for doing these derivatives by taking basically the market \nmakers in these derivatives--which are the swap desks--and moving them \nout of the financial institutions into separate institutions. Where \nthis idea came from is hard to fathom because on its face it makes \nabsolutely no sense. I mean, it is so counterproductive to the purpose \nof making the derivatives market safer, sounder, and more efficient \nand, as a result, a better market which creates credit in a \ntransparent, fair, effective, and sound way. It is so counterproductive \nto that on its face, you would think anybody who suggested it would \nhave it immediately pointed out that this doesn't work. But for some \nreason, it has found its way into this bill.\n  The practical effect of doing this is that you will create these \nseparate entities. These separate entities are going to have to be \ncapitalized because you have to have capital behind these derivatives \ndesks. That is the whole point. You have to have something standing \nbehind these desks to make them viable so that you don't end up with an \nAIG. What was the AIG problem? There was nothing behind the derivative \ncontracts except for the name AIG. You don't want to do that again. You \nwant capital.\n  It is estimated that it would cost $250 billion to set up these \nseparate desks. What does that mean? That means that capital is not \ngoing to be available for the creation of credit. You will see an \nimmediate contraction. It is estimated by the industry--and again, this \nis an industry number, not mine, so you can take it with a grain of \nsalt--that will cause a $\\3/4\\ trillion contraction in credit. That is \nMain Street not being able to get credit. Let's even say they have \nexaggerated. Say it is only going to contract 80 percent. That is still \n$600 billion to $700 billion of credit that is not available on Main \nStreet to do business, to create jobs, to take risk. It is foolish to \ndo that type of contraction and to set up this structure.\n  Plus, you have nobody who is going to oversight this as effectively \nas the people who oversight the present derivative market makers. The \nFDIC won't be able to get on top of this. The Fed probably will have \ntrouble getting on top of this. You will create a less stable platform \nfrom which to view these markets, when the whole purpose of the bill \nwas to make it more stable. It makes absolutely no sense.\n  This is section 106 in the Agriculture bill. I think it is section \n714 in this bill. And you don't have to believe me on this. I mean, two \nof the major, premier regulatory agencies--which are the fair arbiters \nhere, really; I mean, they are the umpires--have come out in a very \nunusual way, because they do not usually comment in the middle of a \nlegislative process such as this, and said that this--this is my \nparaphrasing--is a stupid idea, a counterproductive idea, the type of \nidea which, if it were to be put in place, would be cutting off your \nnose to spite your face and we would end up with a less sound system.\n  Let me read to you from the commentary of the Federal Reserve staff \non section 106, which is now, I believe, section 714. Here is what the \nFederal Reserve staff said about this approach:\n\n       Section 106 would impair financial stability and strong \n     prudential regulation of derivatives; would have serious \n     consequences for the competitiveness of United States \n     financial institutions; and would be highly disruptive and \n     costly, both for banks and their customers.\n\n  That is pretty specific. That is pretty damning testimony as to the \neffect of this language. It is going to reduce our competitiveness \nbecause a lot of these derivatives will go overseas. It is going to \nmake it much more difficult to have sound regulatory policy toward \nderivatives, and it will be highly disruptive and costly not only for \nthe banks but for their customers. That is called Main Street--the \npeople who create the jobs. This is a very inappropriate idea that has \nbeen put in this bill.\n  But don't just rely on the Fed if you are a Fed hater--and there \nappear to be a number in this body, for reasons I still have trouble \nfathoming. They must have something against having a sound money \npolicy. But if you don't like the Fed, listen to the FDIC. I don't \nthink anybody around here doesn't give great credibility to the way \nSheila Bair, the Chairman of the FDIC, handled the bank crisis. Very \nhonestly, they stepped in, they settled out a lot of major banks, and \nthey did it in a way that was extraordinarily professional. As a \nresult, the markets remained calm, people got their money back, and \ndeposits were not at risk.\n  This is an agency which has high credibility, and this is what \nChairman Sheila Bair has specifically said about this:\n\n       If all derivatives market-making activities were moved \n     outside the bank holding companies, most of the activities \n     would no doubt continue, but in less regulated and more \n     highly leveraged venues.\n\n  In other words, be much more risky.\n\n       Such affiliates would have to rely on less stable sources \n     of liquidity which--as we saw during the past crisis--would \n     be destabilizing to the banking organizations in times of \n     financial distress, which in turn would put additional \n     pressure on the insured banks to provide stability.\n\n  In other words, bad idea. It undermines the banking industry to do it \nthis way.\n  Finally: ``Thus, one unintended''--actually, this is not finally. The \nwhole letter is three pages long and has a lot of strong points. But \nthe final part I am going to read:\n\n       Thus, one unintended outcome of this provision would be \n     weakened, not strengthened, protection of the insured bank \n     and the Deposit Insurance Fund, which I know is not the \n     result any of us want.\n\n  That is pretty specific. So you have the Fed on one side, one of the \nmajor regulators, saying this idea doesn't work, it will undermine the \nstructure of the banking industry. You have the FDIC on the other side \nsaying this proposal doesn't work, it is going to undermine the \ninsurance deposit system.\n\n[[Page S3069]]\n\nSo you do not have to listen to myself or others who pointed out the \nfailure of this section. Listen to these regulators. This section has \nto be removed from this bill.\n  There are other things that need to be done in the derivatives areas \nwhich would improve the language. For example, once you are on a \nclearinghouse, you should not be mandated to go directly to an exchange \nbecause it simply will not work. There needs to be an intermediary step \nas standardization and then the best thing to do would be to require \nregulators to look at these different instruments and then, if they \nfeel they can be standardized, tell the people producing them they can \nbe standardized and then move them over. To unilaterally say everything \nhas to go to an exchange is, I think, going to be counterproductive and \nagain push a lot of business offshore.\n  But clearly this one section is damaging to our efforts to produce a \nsafer, sounder, more transparent derivatives regime which has adequate \nliquidity and capital behind it and which keeps America as the primary \nplace to do credit in the world so our entrepreneurs can get credit at \na reasonable price, so they can go out and take the risks to create the \njobs in America.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have both these statements printed in the \nRecord, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Comments on Senate Agriculture Committee's OTC Derivatives Bill\n\n                             April 24, 2010\n\n     1. Section 106 should be deleted.\n       a. Lending to financial market utilities. Section 106 would \n     prohibit any federal assistance to swap dealers, major swap \n     participants, swap exchanges, clearinghouses and central \n     counterparties. This would appear to override the provision \n     of Title VIII that would allow the Federal Reserve to provide \n     emergency collateralized loans to systemically important \n     financial market utilities, such as clearinghouses and \n     central counterparties, to maintain financial stability and \n     prevent serious adverse effects on the U.S. economy.\n       i. As systemically important post-trade ``choke points'' in \n     the financial system, it is imperative that these utilities \n     be able to settle each day as expected to avoid systemic \n     problems and allow for a wide range of financial markets and \n     institutions to operate. The failure of a systemically \n     important utility to settle for its markets would not only \n     call into question the soundness of the utility as a critical \n     market infrastructure but could also create systemic \n     liquidity disruptions for one or more markets and potentially \n     other financial market utilities. The increased importance \n     that Title VIII places on central counterparties and central \n     clearinghouses to reduce risk in the financial system \n     necessitates ensuring that short-term secured credit is \n     available to these utilities in times of stress.\n       b. ``Push-out'' of bank swap activities. Section 106 would \n     in effect prohibit banks from engaging in derivative \n     transactions as an intermediary for customers or to hedge the \n     bank's own exposures.\n       i. Title VI, which includes the so-called Volcker rule \n     provisions, better addresses the problem of risks from \n     derivatives activities by prohibiting any bank, as well as \n     any company that owns a bank, from taking speculative, \n     proprietary derivative positions that are unrelated to \n     customer needs.\n       ii. Section 106 would impair financial stability and strong \n     prudential regulation of derivatives; would have serious \n     consequences for the competitiveness of U.S. financial \n     institutions; and would be highly disruptive and costly, both \n     for banks and their customers.\n       iii. Banks are subject to strong prudential regulation, \n     including capital regulations that take account of a bank's \n     exposures to derivative transactions. The Basel Committee on \n     Banking Supervision has recently proposed tough new capital \n     and liquidity requirements for derivatives that will further \n     strengthen the prudential standards that apply to bank \n     derivative activities. Titles I, III, VI, VII and VIII all \n     add provisions further strengthening the authority of the \n     Federal supervisory agencies to address these risks.\n     2. The foreign exchange swap exclusion should not be limited \n         to non-exchange-traded non-cleared transactions.\n       a. The bill permits the Treasury to exclude foreign \n     exchange swaps and forwards from coverage as ``swaps,'' but \n     the exclusion applies only if the transaction is not listed \n     or traded on an exchange or a swap execution facility and not \n     cleared through a derivatives clearing organization. A \n     substantial share of foreign exchange swaps and forwards are \n     entered into using electronic trading platforms. The broad \n     definition of swap execution facility appears to capture \n     these platforms, thereby rendering the Treasury's exemptive \n     authority largely meaningless.\n       b. Foreign exchange forward and swap transactions should be \n     treated in a way comparable to other physically settled \n     forwards for securities and nonfinancial commodities that are \n     exempted under the bill. Foreign exchange forwards and \n     foreign exchange swaps are delayed purchases and sales in \n     broad and deep cash markets. Prices for foreign exchange are \n     already readily available and transparent and that existing \n     transparency, coupled with the breadth and depth of the \n     foreign exchange markets, makes the foreign exchange markets \n     not easy to manipulate.\n     3. Core principles for financial market utilities should not \n         be hard-wired in the statute.\n       a. The bill sets out specific core principles for \n     derivatives clearing organizations, swap execution \n     facilities, and swap data repositories, and would not give \n     the CFTC or SEC leeway to adjust the core principles to \n     reflect evolving U.S. and international standards (as does \n     the Dodd bill).\n       b. The current international standards for central \n     counterparties are under review for needed changes in light \n     of market developments, particularly in the OTC derivatives \n     market, and are expected to change, thus potentially creating \n     an immediate conflict with the bill.\n       c. Providing regulatory flexibility would permit changes to \n     the international standards and other future refinements in \n     risk management standards to be addressed. In addition, such \n     flexibility would facilitate the ability of the U.S. \n     regulatory agencies to work together to adopt consistent \n     standards across financial market utilities that perform \n     similar functions.\n     4. The definition of ``swap data repository'' is overly \n         broad.\n       a. The definition (``any person that collects, calculates, \n     prepares, or maintains information or records with respect to \n     transaction or positions in or the terms and conditions of, \n     swaps entered into by third parties'') appears to include \n     entities whose purpose is not related to acting as a central \n     record-keeping facility. For example, the definition may \n     sweep in trade comparison services and news organizations \n     that collect trading information.\n       b. Given its breadth, it will be difficult to apply core \n     principles to such disparate activities and organizations.\n     5. Data-sharing among regulators is unnecessarily restricted.\n       a. The bill would require a swap data repository to notify \n     the relevant Commission of any information requests from \n     other regulators and require that those other regulators \n     indemnify the repository and the Commission from any claims \n     stemming from those requests. These provisions restrict \n     access by relevant U.S. regulators to needed data.\n       b. These restrictions may lead foreign regulators to demand \n     a local repository so that they can have adequate access to \n     the data. Splitting the market data into repositories in \n     different countries will make it significantly more difficult \n     for regulators to get a holistic view of the market.\n       c. The bill allows swap data to be shared with foreign \n     central banks, but not the U.S. central bank (the Federal \n     Reserve).\n     6. Prudential regulators should retain their safety-and-\n         soundness enforcement authority over bank swap dealers \n         and major swap participants.\n       a. Section 131 provides the prudential regulators with \n     authority to enforce the prudential requirements of the Act \n     over bank swap dealers and major swap participants and \n     provides the CFTC with the authority to enforce non-\n     prudential requirements.\n       b. Although section 133 preserves the prudential \n     regulators' authority under other law, the conforming \n     amendments in section 131 limit the prudential regulators' \n     authority under section 8 of the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Act over swap dealers and major swap participants.\n       c. In order to carry out their obligations as safety-and-\n     soundness supervisors over banks, the prudential regulators \n     need to retain their full Federal Deposit Insurance Act \n     enforcement authority over bank swap dealers and major swap \n     participants.\n     7. The Act should clarify that risk management is part of \n         prudential rules.\n       a. Section 121 provides that the prudential regulators are \n     to prescribe prudential requirements, including capital and \n     margin requirements, for bank swap dealers and major swap \n     participants. Section 121 also requires swap dealers and \n     major swap participants to establish robust and professional \n     risk management systems.\n       b. The bill is unclear about which agency should set risk \n     management rules. These rules should be set by the prudential \n     regulator . . .\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Federal Deposit Insurance\n\n\n                                                  Corporation,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Blanche L. Lincoln,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Chairman Lincoln: Thank you for \n     reaching out to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation for \n     our views on Title VII of the ``Wall Street Transparency and \n     Accountability Act'' contained in S. 3217, the ``Restoring \n     American Financial Stability Act of 2010.'' At the outset, I\n\n[[Page S3070]]\n\n     would like to express my strong support for enhanced \n     regulation of ``over-the-counter'' (OTC) derivatives and the \n     provisions of the bill which would require centralized \n     clearing and exchange trading of standardized products. If \n     this requirement is applied rigorously it will mean that most \n     OTC contracts will be centrally cleared, a desirable \n     improvement from the bilateral clearing processes used now. I \n     would also like to express my wholehearted endorsement of the \n     ultimate intent of the bill, to protect the deposit insurance \n     fund from high risk behavior.\n       I would like to share some concerns with respect to section \n     716 of S. 3217, which would require most derivatives \n     activities to be conducted outside of banks and bank holding \n     companies. If enacted, this provision would require that some \n     $294 trillion in notional amount of derivatives be moved \n     outside of banks or from bank holding companies that own \n     insured depository institutions, presumably to nonbank \n     financial firms such as hedge funds and futures commission \n     merchants, or to foreign banking organizations beyond the \n     reach of federal regulation. I would note that credit \n     derivatives--the riskiest--held by banks and bank holding \n     companies (when measured by notional amount) total $25.5 \n     trillion, or slightly less than nine percent of the total \n     derivatives held by these entities.\n       At the same time, it needs to be pointed out that the vast \n     majority of banks that use OTC derivatives confine their \n     activity to hedging interest rate risk with straightforward \n     interest rate derivatives. Given the continuing uncertainty \n     surrounding future movements in interest rates and the \n     detrimental effects that these could have on unhedged banks, \n     I encourage you to adopt an approach that would allow banks \n     to easily hedge with OTC derivatives. Moreover, I believe \n     that directing standardized OTC products toward exchanges or \n     other central clearing facilities would accomplish the \n     stabilization of the OTC market that we seek to enhance, and \n     would still allow banks to continue the important market-\n     making functions that they currently perform.\n       In addition, I urge you to carefully consider the \n     underlying premise of this provision--that the best way to \n     protect the deposit insurance fund is to push higher risk \n     activities into the so-called shadow sector. To be sure, \n     there are certain activities, such as speculative derivatives \n     trading, that should have no place in banks or bank holding \n     companies. We believe the Volcker rule addresses that issue \n     and indeed would be happy to work with you on a total ban on \n     speculative trading, at least in the CDS market. At the same \n     time, other types of derivatives such as customized interest \n     rate swaps and even some CDS do have legitimate and important \n     functions as risk management tools, and insured banks play an \n     essential role in providing market-making functions for these \n     products.\n       Banks are not perfect but we do believe that insured banks \n     as a whole performed better during this crisis because they \n     are subject to higher capital requirements in both the amount \n     and quality of capital. Insured banks also are subject to \n     ongoing prudential supervision by their primary banking \n     regulators, as well as a second pair of eyes through the \n     FDIC's back up supervisory role, which we are strengthening \n     as a lesson of the crisis. If all derivatives market-making \n     activities were moved outside of bank holding companies, most \n     of the activity would no doubt continue, but in less \n     regulated and more highly leveraged venues. Even pushing the \n     activity into a bank holding company affiliate would reduce \n     the amount and quality of capital required to be held against \n     this activity. It would also be beyond the scrutiny of the \n     FDIC because we do not have the same comprehensive backup \n     authority over the affiliates of banks as we do with the \n     banks themselves. Such affiliates would have to rely on less \n     stable sources of liquidity, which--as we saw during the past \n     crisis--would be destabilizing to the banking organization in \n     times of financial distress, which in turn would put \n     additional pressure on the insured bank to provide stability. \n     By concentrating the activity in an affiliate of the insured \n     bank, we could end up with less and lower quality capital, \n     less information and oversight for the FDIC, and potentially \n     less support for the insured bank in a time of crisis. Thus, \n     one unintended outcome of this provision would be weakened, \n     not strengthened, protection of the insured bank and the \n     Deposit Insurance Fund, which I know is not the result any of \n     us want.\n       A central lesson of this crisis is that it is difficult to \n     insulate insured banks from risk taking conducted by their \n     nonbanking affiliated entities. When the crisis hit, the \n     shadow sector collapsed, leaving insured banks as the only \n     source of stability. Far from serving as a source of \n     strength, bank holding companies and their affiliates had to \n     draw stability from their insured deposit franchises. We must \n     be careful not to reduce even further the availability of \n     support to insured banks from their holding companies. As a \n     result, we believe policies going forward should recognize \n     the damage regulatory arbitrage caused our economy and craft \n     policies that focus on the quality and strength of regulation \n     as opposed to the business model used to support it.\n       The FDIC is pleased to continue working with you on this \n     important issue to assure that the final outcome serves all \n     of our goals for a safer and more stable financial sector. We \n     hope that a compromise can be achieved by perhaps moving some \n     derivatives activity into affiliates, so long as capital \n     standards remain as strict as they are for insured \n     depositories and banks continue to be able to fully utilize \n     derivatives for appropriate hedging activities.\n       Please do not hesitate to contact me or have your staff \n     contact Paul Nash, Deputy Director for External Affairs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila C. Bair.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3749\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about amendment No. \n3749, the Tester-Hutchison amendment.\n  Before I talk about this amendment, I want to thank Chairman Dodd for \nhis work on a very strong Wall Street reform bill. I think his work has \nbeen very much appreciated by me and other members of the Banking \nCommittee. I look forward to getting to this bill and making it even \nstronger and passing it out of this body to the President and into law.\n  This amendment would lift a burden inappropriately placed on our \ncommunity banks in this country.\n  These are the banks that make rural America run. They do not deserve \nto be left holding the bag for the risky behavior of big banks.\n  What the Tester-Hutchison amendment does is hold big banks \naccountable for their actions by basing FDIC deposit insurance premiums \non risk.\n  Our amendment would force big banks to pay their fair share of \ninsurance. And it would fix the lopsided assessment system that we \ncurrently have--which unfairly burdens community banks.\n  The recent turmoil in the financial sector has placed significant \nstrains on the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund--the first line of defense \nand resource tapped to provide assistance to troubled federally insured \nbanks.\n  Since the beginning of 2008, the FDIC has closed 229 banks, including \n7 banks last week. That has left a wake of devastation that has \nimpacted the entire banking system.\n  Some of the larger failures--including those of IndyMac and Bank \nUnited--caused significant destruction. They have left the FDIC's \nDeposit Insurance Fund depleted and destabilized. In fact, the fund \nbegan the year with a negative balance of over $20 billion.\n  Why is that? We now know that some of these institutions were engaged \nin risky activities--some far beyond the traditional depository \nfunctions.\n  But, because the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund was still based solely \non the institution's deposits--rather than assets, the fund wasn't able \nto take into account the impact that this risky behavior would have on \nthe fund.\n  In fact, under the current system, community banks pay 30 percent of \ntotal FDIC premiums while only holding 20 percent of the Nation's \nbanking assets.\n  Let me repeat that Mr. President. Under the current system, community \nbanks pay 30 percent of total FDIC premiums while only holding 20 \npercent of the Nation's banking assets.\n  Our bipartisan amendment brings some common sense back into the \nequation.\n  The FDIC--and the fund--have never faced such troubling times. In \nlight of these failures, the FDIC was forced to make emergency, upfront \nassessments on all banks to protect the integrity of the Fund.\n  Montana banks didn't get involved in this risky behavior--they didn't \noffer subprime mortgages or sell sophisticated financial instruments \nmeant to manipulate markets.\n  But Montana banks, like community banks around the country, have had \nto pay the price for the risky behavior of the larger banks that \ndestabilized the fund.\n  Mike Richter, President and CEO of the State Bank of Townsend in \nTownsend, MT, tells me that because of the emergency assessments in \nDecember, his bank had to prepay 3 year's worth of premiums--3 years.\n  For the Bank of Townsend, that was a bill of $190,000 on top of the \n$70,000 that he already paid in 2009 assessments. I am no banker, but I \nknow that is no way to run a business.\n  When I think about the impact that the community banks have in my \nState and the role that they play--originating mortgages and providing \nsmall businesses and farms with credit--it pains me to see them suffer \nas a\n\n[[Page S3071]]\n\nresult of the risky activities of larger banks.\n  That is why I have teamed up with my friend from Texas, Senator \nHutchison, as well as Senators Conrad, Murray, Burris, Brown of \nMassachusetts, Harkin and Shaheen in offering this important, \nbipartisan amendment.\n  We want to ensure that the FDIC implements a genuine risk-based \nassessment system to protect the health of the Deposit Insurance Fund \nand to ensure equity among FDIC-insured institutions.\n  This amendment builds on the underlying language included in the \nbill, directing the FDIC to base assessments on assets rather than \ndeposits.\n  Specifically, the amendment would require the FDIC to implement this \nchange, rather than permitting them to make the change as in the \ncurrent language.\n  It also further shifts the assessment base formula to benefit \ncommunity banks by eliminating ``long term unsecured debt'' as a factor \nin calculating assessments. And it includes language directing the FDIC \nto implement risk based assessments for banker's banks and custodial \nbanks which have different structures than traditional banks.\n  The FDIC has already taken a step forward in recognizing the risks \nthat larger banks pose to the Deposit Insurance Fund, voting to base \ntheir emergency assessments on a bank's assets rather than deposits.\n  The Independent Community Bankers of America also support this \namendment. They believe that it will codify these important changes and \nbring greater equity to the assessment base.\n  In closing, let me say how much I appreciate all of the work of my \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison, and how much I appreciate the \ncommittee's willingness to work with us on this important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield before yielding the floor?\n  Mr. TESTER. I will.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my colleague and friend and our \ncolleague from Texas, Senator Hutchison. This is exactly the kind of \neffort we are trying to achieve in this bill. It is a complicated area \nof law. I appreciate the work of Senator Tester and others. I didn't \nhear all. I gather it is Senator Tester, Senator Hutchison, Senator \nScott Brown, Senator Harkin--you have a list of Democrats and \nRepublicans here who have worked on this amendment to bring it to this \npoint. I support the amendment. I think this is a strong amendment that \nwill require the FDIC, as I understand it--my colleague will correct \nme--to change how it charges for deposit insurance, which I think makes \na lot of sense--from charging each bank's domestic deposits as it does \nnow, to charging its total liabilities, which makes far more sense. \nThis is a great help to community banks across the country, of which \nSenator Tester has been a champion since his arrival in the Senate and \nas a member of our Banking Committee. The change will help ease the \nburden of FDIC assessments on our community banks by requiring the \nlargest banks in the country to shoulder a little more of the \nresponsibility to rebuild and maintain a sound deposit insurance fund.\n  The amendment is fundamentally about fairness, which I think is one \nof its most important features. Community banks, as we all know, have \nbeen victims of a severe economic recession brought on by the behavior \nof major Wall Street firms. This has led to a high rate of community \nbank failures and a sharp increase in premiums necessary to rebuild the \nFDIC's insurance fund. Meanwhile, the largest banks have been saved by \nTARP moneys and other government programs that were necessary, \nobviously, as we all know, to avoid the economic meltdown and \ncatastrophe we were facing in the fall of 2008.\n  The change required by this amendment will lead to a far more \nequitable distribution of the responsibility to maintain a strong \ndeposit insurance fund. It also will free up new resources for smaller \nbanks to lend to households.\n  So on every front, this amendment is a very positive contribution to \nthis overall bill and one of the real features Members ought to keep in \nmind as we try to get this bill done. Without this amendment, which I \nsupport and want to see included, this will make even additional \npressures on our community banks.\n  I thank both our colleagues, from Montana and Texas, as well as our \nnew Senate colleague from Massachusetts, and Senator Harkin as well, \nfor their contribution. As soon as we find a window here to bring this \nup, we wish to see this amendment get adopted and be part of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. I very much thank Senator Dodd. I think he is right. It \nis about equity. It is about assessing the premiums for the FDIC \ninsurance fund to the banks that pose the most risk. Community banks \nare not among them. They played by the rules, they have done things \nright, and they have not tried to manipulate the market. I very much \nappreciate my colleague's comments and appreciate his support.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we have some potential action here. I hope \nin a few minutes to move along. The amendment of Senator Tester and \nSenator Hutchison is an amendment I hope we can deal with at some point \nfairly quickly. Again, it is one of those amendments where we have \nreached an agreement on both sides. My experience is when you have an \nagreement such as that, you better move on it.\n  I know there are others as well. The Boxer amendment I hope we can \nget up. Senator Shelby and I have worked on a larger amendment to deal \nwith the too-big-to-fail provisions. Again, all of us want to see \nlanguage, but let me say in the absence of language, we have reached \nagreement. Obviously we both need to look at the language of it before \nwe can say that categorically. But I am satisfied, as is, I believe, my \ncolleague from Alabama, that we have reached that agreement on the too-\nbig-to-fail provisions which, with the Boxer amendment, takes that \nissue completely off the table as far as any further debate goes about \ntitle I and title II of the bill.\n  We have other issues. Senator Gregg mentioned a couple that obviously \nare going to need some work and some amendments are going to be offered \non those. But in my view the sooner we move along on the ones where we \nhave agreement, such as the Tester-Hutchison amendment, and some ideas \nI believe our colleague from Maine, Senator Snowe, wants to offer, we \nwill demonstrate, I think once again, that we have the capacity to work \nwith each other to actually advance what we are all trying to achieve, \nand that is reform of the financial system. My hope is rather shortly \nwe will get to some agreements on time and bring up these efforts and \nnot have another day go by when we are not actually dealing with \nspecific amendments in this bill.\n  With that, I don't see another Member seeking recognition, so I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the pending Boxer amendment \nNo. 3737 be temporarily set aside and that Senator Snowe of Maine be \nrecognized to call up two amendments, Nos. 3755 and 3757; that no \namendments be in order to either amendment; that upon the conclusion of \ndebate with respect to the Snowe amendments, they be set aside and the \nBoxer amendment reoccur.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maine is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3755 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, the pending amendment was set aside. I \ncall up the Snowe amendment No. 3755.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3755 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n\n[[Page S3072]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                   (Purpose: To strike section 1071)\n\n       Strike section 1071.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nShaheen be added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. I would like to thank the distinguished chairman of the \nBanking Committee, Senator Dodd, for working with me so constructively, \nas well as his staff, on these two amendments I am calling up this \nafternoon. And I thank Senator Shelby, as well, for agreeing to the \nsubstance of these amendments.\n  I think it is important to address these issues that are so \nfundamental to so many small businesses across the country. The first \namendment I have made pending would reduce cumbersome and unnecessary \nrestrictions on the banking industry that may potentially infringe on \nAmericans' privacy rights and curtail the ability of financial \ninstitutions to serve their customers.\n  Specifically, the underlying legislation contains language that would \ncompel banks to make the following disclosures to the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau: Banks would have to report from each \ndeposit-taking facility, including each individual automated teller \nmachine, a record of the number and dollar amount of the deposit \naccounts of customers; a geo-coding, by census tract, of the residence \nor business location of each customer; and a record of whether each \ncustomer is transacting commercial or residential business.\n  This type of detailed reporting imposes a regulatory cost on banks \nand provides an extraordinarily large amount of data to the Federal \nGovernment.\n  While many have advanced the image of banks as monolithically large \nentities with tens of thousands of employees spread across the globe, \nthe vast majority of banks are small community-centered institutions. \nFor small community banks, every dollar spent on complying with \ngovernment regulations is another dollar that cannot be used for \ncustomer service or extending credit. While these existing processes \nmay be in place at large banks--and even if not, their procurement \nwould be relatively inexpensive--for a small bank this could have a \nsizeable impact on their bottom line and prove to be an extremely large \nregulatory burden.\n  In addition, the Federal Government's track record when it comes to \nsecuring its citizens' privacy data is less than stellar. As we all \nrecall, in May of 2006 the Department of Veterans Affairs lost Social \nSecurity numbers and dates of birth of more than 26 million veterans. I \ncannot imagine what would occur if the sensitive deposit data that \nbanks are required to track under this legislation was inadvertently \nlost.\n  The legislation does contain a provision requiring that the personal \nidentities of all customers be removed, but one slip could result in \nthe intimate financial details of bank customers being revealed to \nunscrupulous computer hackers.\n  I would note both the Independent Community Bankers Association and \nthe Credit Union National Association are supporting this amendment due \nto its regulatory burden. I am pleased that we have reached agreement \nto have it accepted in this legislation.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3757 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  I ask unanimous consent the pending amendment be set aside, and I \ncall up Snowe amendment No. 3757.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maine [Ms. Snowe] proposes amendment No. \n     3755 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for consideration of seasonal income in mortgage \n                                 loans)\n\n       At the end of section 1031, add the following:\n       (f) Consideration of Seasonal Income.--The rules of the \n     Bureau under this section shall provide, with respect to an \n     extension of credit secured by residential real estate or a \n     dwelling, if documented income of the borrower, including \n     income from a small business, is a repayment source for an \n     extension of credit secured by residential real estate or a \n     dwelling, the creditor may consider the seasonality and \n     irregularity of such income in the underwriting of and \n     scheduling of payments for such credit.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. This second amendment would fix an unintended consequence \nof the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the underlying \nlegislation, which would have the effect of choking off access to \ncredit by small business.\n  According to the February 2010 survey of the National Federation of \nIndependent Business on the state of credit:\n\n     . . . 16 percent of all small employers have a mortgage on \n     their residence that helps to finance the(ir) business. . . .\n\n  The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy has calculated \nthat there are nearly 30 million small businesses in America. Taken \ntogether, this means approximately 4.8 million small firms, hardly an \nunsubstantial number, rely on a home mortgage for their financing.\n  Many of those small business owners also make loan payments intended \nto reflect the cashflow of their business models. For example, \ninnkeepers often make larger loan payments during their busier seasons, \nand farmers and fishermen borrow funds based on their crop or catch \ncycles.\n  As brought before the Senate, the underlying bill would prohibit \nlending products if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a \n``reasonable basis to conclude that . . . substantial injury is not \noutweighed by counterveiling benefits to consumers.''\n  This means if the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau finds that the \ninjury of a loan product is outweighed by the benefit it might create, \nthe Bureau can prevent a financial institution from offering it.\n  The problem with the manner in which the bill is drafted is that it \ndoes not take into account that many entrepreneurs use home mortgage \nloans with customized repayment terms for business purposes. \nAccordingly, overzealous regulators could determine that such loans, \nwhich are consumer products, are abusive and thereby either prevent or \nmake it extremely difficult for financial institutions to continue \noffering these types of critical products.\n  For example, a loan to a borrower with balloon payments in June, July \nand August and interest-only payments for the rest of the year might \nlook suspicious to the Bureau and be declared abusive. Yet this is \nexactly how many seasonal firms in Maine and throughout the Nation \nfinance their businesses.\n  My amendment simply preserves the ability of small business owners to \nuse their homes as collateral and to make payments based on an \nalternate lending cycle by clarifying that the CFPB must allow banks to \noffer home loan products with customized payment terms for small \nbusinesses.\n  I originally raised my concern that the underlying bill could \ninadvertently harm small business lending during meetings with Treasury \nSecretary Tim Geithner and National Economic Council Chairman Larry \nSummers. They were both immediately receptive and agreed that the bill, \nif not altered, could have unintended consequences that would restrain \naccess to capital for small businesses.\n  The necessity of this amendment is especially critical given the \nsmall business credit crisis that continues to plague the Nation. This \nfact has been underscored by numerous studies including the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation's survey that found outstanding loan \nbalances have dropped by the largest margin since 1942. Furthermore, \nthe Federal Reserve's April 2010 Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey \nshows that only 1.9 percent of banks surveyed had loosened credit terms \nfor small businesses in the past quarter.\n  While harming small businesses, lack of access to affordable capital \nalso has a ripple effect across the greater economy. In his April 14 \ntestimony before the Finance Committee, Dr. Mark Zandi, the chief \neconomist for Moody's Analytics, stated that ``small business credit \n(is) key to job creation.''\n  By preserving financing flexibility for small business owners, this \namendment ensures that home equity will remain as a possible means for \nentrepreneurs to secure funds to start or grow their businesses. With \nsmall businesses adding two-thirds of all net new\n\n[[Page S3073]]\n\njobs, this provision will help small business owners create jobs, \nfinance their businesses, and help us reduce our current 9.7 percent \nunemployment rate.\n  We understand how instrumental small businesses are to job creation. \nWe have to remain deeply concerned that in the last 3 months, we have \nhad static employment growth with a 9.7-percent unemployment rate. \nSmall businesses are the engine that will drive this recovery and will \nlead us out of a jobless recovery. A jobless recovery is not a true \nrecovery. Anything we do here, particularly on this legislation, that \ncould affect small business's access to capital will certainly infringe \nupon our ability to promote job creation. I reiterated that this \nmorning in the Finance Committee hearing, where Treasury Secretary \nGeithner indicated he shared my deep concerns about stagnation when it \ncomes to lending. It is important to improve upon these regulations \nthat are vetted in the underlying legislation.\n  I appreciate the chairman's effort to be flexible and to address and \nmodify some of these issues and these constraints, and for allowing me \nto offer these amendments and agreeing to them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my fellow New Englander and \ncolleague for her two amendments. They are very strong and positive \ncontributions to the bill. She raises very worthwhile points. We have a \ntendency to think of small businesses all operating the same way, and \nthey obviously don't. Particularly, the seasonal businesses have \nmoments of peak activity and then periods when not much happens, \nwhether we are talking about farming or fishing or tourism, other such \nindustries. It was never our intent that they be adversely affected, \nbut the amendment she has offered makes a huge difference in that \nregard. I thank her. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency to allow \nmortgages to be made on the basis of seasonal income is of great value.\n  The second amendment, 3755, on the collection of deposit account \ndata, is a very good suggestion. The last thing we want to do is \noverburden the regulatory environment. The intentions were sound \nenough. We have an awful lot of people who go into the sort of nonbank, \nnontraditional sources of support financially. That was sort of the \nmotivation behind it. Her concern, that this could be burdensome--and \nthe last thing we need is more burdens--is worthwhile. I thank her for \nher contributions. I support these efforts.\n  I believe, at the appropriate moment, we can adopt these amendments.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n              Congratulating Kalamazoo Central High School\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to congratulate the \nstudents, faculty, staff, and parents at Kalamazoo Central High School \nin Kalamazoo, MI, who learned today that President Obama will deliver \nthe commencement address for their high school next month. It is a \ntremendous honor to host a President, particularly this President. I am \nproud not only that Kalamazoo Central High has been accorded this honor \nbut how the school earned it. More than 1,000 schools submitted \napplications for a competition called Race to the Top Commencement \nChallenge. This competition encouraged academic excellence and \ninnovation. Evaluators narrowed the contestants down to six who were \nfinalists. Public voting selected the final three, and the White House \nthen announced today that the President had chosen Kalamazoo Central \nfrom those three finalists.\n  I am not going to make any claim that I am unbiased here, but I \nbelieve it is meaningful that this Michigan school represents what is \npossible for a large, urban public school, open to all students. \nKalamazoo, similar to many communities in my State, is not without its \nchallenges. The tough economic times have given public educators an \nextremely difficult task. Kalamazoo has had to cope with the effects of \nplant closings, corporate mergers, and downsizings that meant \nadministrators have had to do more with less.\n  But the people of Kalamazoo have not allowed those challenges to \nstand in the way of excellence. Kalamazoo is the home of the Kalamazoo \nPromise. Every graduate of the Kalamazoo public schools is entitled to \na scholarship covering a portion of their higher education costs at a \nMichigan public university, up to 100 percent for those who attended \nKalamazoo schools from kindergarten through 12th grade. Since the \nPromise was established, thanks to the generosity of a small group of \nanonymous donors, more than 90 percent of Kalamazoo High graduates have \ngone on to college.\n  This commitment to quality education for all is nothing new to \nKalamazoo. In 1873, a small group of property owners, convinced that \nthey did not need to pay taxes to support a public high school, sued \nthe Kalamazoo School Board. In the ``Kalamazoo Case,'' as it became \nknown, the Michigan Supreme Court upheld the establishment of a public \nhigh school supported by tax dollars and open to all. The case settled, \nonce and for all, the status of public education in Michigan and has \nbeen cited by courts throughout the country where public education has \ncome under attack.\n  Today's announcement adds to the rich history of public education in \nKalamazoo. It is a fitting honor for the students, educators, parents, \nand citizens of a community that has once again demonstrated its \ncommitment to academic excellence.\n  I spoke after today's announcement with the principal of Kalamazoo \nCentral High, Von Washington, and offered my congratulations. He told \nme the news brought cheers and excitement to the high school students \nand even a few tears as the word spread quickly throughout the entire \nKalamazoo community--the justifiably proud community.\n  So we all look forward to President Obama's visit to Kalamazoo, and I \nknow that a proud city and a proud school will offer both the best in \nhospitality and an example for other schools to follow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise to speak on my amendment with \nSenator Tester because we are trying to ensure that safe community \nbanks and large financial institutions are treated equally. I heard \nSenator Tester's speech on the floor just a little while ago on our \namendment, and I am very pleased we are able to put this amendment \nforward. I am also pleased the chairman has said he supports my \namendment. I think that is a great first step for us, for the chairman \nto support an amendment, because we all know this bill came to the \nfloor on good faith, the good faith that we would have amendments and \nwe would try to address the legitimate concerns of many in our country, \nfrom small businesspeople such as dentists to food manufacturers, as \nwell as community bankers. We don't want--and I know the chairman \ndoesn't want and no one wants--to hurt our economy with financial \nreform.\n  I also think I can say we all have a goal of good reform that \neliminates some of the things that happened a couple years ago that \nAmerican taxpayers are paying dearly for right now. We don't want \nbailouts. We don't want taxpayer-funded bailouts of financial \ninstitutions that have taken great risk, and we certainly don't want to \nhurt our economy, which is not all that great right now, we all must \nadmit. I think that going forward we must address the issues that \ncaused the financial meltdown and stop the misuse of derivatives and \nget our financial house in order while also protecting our financial \nhouse.\n  So that is what the Hutchison-Tester amendment tries to do. We want \nto ensure that large banks pay their fair share in deposit insurance \npremiums and community banks are not over-assessed and, therefore, can \ncontinue to\n\n[[Page S3074]]\n\nprovide lending and depository services to creditworthy American \nfamilies and small businesses. I am very pleased we have a group of \ncosponsors. Senator Tester and I are joined by Senator Burris, Senator \nConrad, and Senator Harkin in this amendment.\n  While much debate has centered on systemic risk and the $50 billion \nfund to unwind large financial firms, the Hutchison-Tester amendment \nfocuses on bringing parity to the existing FDIC deposit insurance fund. \nOur amendment will reform the FDIC's assessment base to ensure that \nbanks pay assessments into the deposit insurance fund based on the risk \nthey pose to the banking system.\n  Currently, the FDIC levies deposit insurance premiums on a bank's \ntotal domestic deposits. Unfortunately, domestic deposits are not the \nbest measure to analyze the safety of banks. Financial assets, other \nthan deposits, also create risk in the system but are not considered in \ndetermining FDIC assessments. Yet because the system does not charge \nassessments based on assets, it doesn't fairly assess all the risks in \nthe system.\n  Community banks with less than $10 billion in assets rely heavily on \ncustomer deposits for funding, which penalizes these safe institutions \nby forcing them to pay deposit insurance premiums above and beyond the \nrisk they pose to the banking system. How? Despite making up just 20 \npercent of the Nation's assets, these community banks contribute 30 \npercent of the premiums to the deposit insurance fund. At the same \ntime, large banks hold 80 percent of the banking industry's assets but \npay 70 percent of the premiums.\n  We must fix this inequity. This is a clear imbalance. We must ensure \nthat banks of all sizes pay deposit insurance premiums based on the \nrisk they pose to the system. The Hutchison-Tester amendment will do \nthis by requiring the FDIC to change the assessment base to one which \nis a more accurate measure--a bank's total assets less tangible \ncapital. This change will broaden the assessment base from $8.5 \ntrillion to $11.5 trillion, and it will better measure the risk a bank \nposes.\n  Throughout Senator Dodd's legislation, a bright line asset test is \nused to measure risk to the system. A bank's assets include its loans \noutstanding and securities held. One need only look back over the last \n2 years to realize that assets show a bank's exposure to risk. It \nwasn't a bank's deposits that contributed to the financial meltdown. \nInstead, the meltdown was caused by bad mortgages that were packaged up \ninto risky mortgage-backed securities and used to create derivatives. \nThese risky financial instruments, and the large banks which created \nand held them, were what led to the financial crisis.\n  Our amendment is especially timely because of the great strains \nplaced on the deposit insurance fund because of the crisis. Numerous \nbanks have failed over the past 2 years, forcing the FDIC to dip more \nand more into the fund to cover insured deposits of customers.\n  In February 2009, with the fund already in a precarious state and \nmore failures expected, the FDIC made an unprecedented move and levied \na $5 billion special assessment on all insured institutions. \nOriginally, the FDIC intended this assessment to be eight basis points \nof an institution's domestic deposits.\n  This assessment stood to penalize community banks by forcing them to \npay for the faults of others, despite having nothing to do with the \nrisky practices that caused the crisis and ensuing bank failures. To \nadd insult to injury, community banks would have paid a \ndisproportionate amount based on domestic deposits in the assessment \nbase.\n  The FDIC had the regulatory authority to broaden its base to total \nassets. I raised this point with the FDIC following the announcement of \ntheir assessment. I was pleased the FDIC listened. They altered their \nspecial assessment to a base of total assets less tangible capital.\n  As a result, the assessment was lowered to 5 percent of assets--a \nmove which ensured that large banks with heavy assets paid an \nassessment which fairly accounted for the added risk they posed to the \nbanking system. So I applaud Chairman Sheila Bair for making that \ndecision.\n  However, the broader base was only used one time and the FDIC has now \nreverted to the traditional annual premium based on domestic deposits \nassessments. The Dodd bill continues to give the FDIC the authority to \ncontinue using this narrow base of domestic deposits.\n  The Hutchison-Tester amendment will put in place a statute which \nensures that we will have the fair assessment. That will be the \nmandate. There will not be options to create this unlevel playing field \nbetween the big banks and the community banks. It just makes sure the \ncommunity banks will never have to pay a higher portion of the \ndeposit insurance when they have a lower amount of the assets. Our \namendment levels the playing field.\n\n  Since the beginning of 2008, 229 banks from across the United States \nhave failed, and because of these failures, it has left the deposit \ninsurance fund below the statutory minimum requirement, despite last \nspring's special assessment. The discouraging state of the fund has led \nthe FDIC to make yet another unprecedented move. The FDIC is requiring \nits banks to prepay deposit insurance premiums, all due over the next 3 \nyears, by the end of this fiscal year. We must act now to ensure that \nthese prepaid deposit premiums and all premiums in the future are \nassessed proportionately so banks pay premiums based on the risk they \npose.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Hutchison-Tester amendment, to \nbring additional parity between banks on Wall Street and those on Main \nStreet.\n  I thank my colleagues who have cosponsored the amendment. I thank the \nchairman for supporting the amendment. This is one step we can take. I \nwould love for the first amendment taken up to be one that would have \nbipartisan support, and I hope it is overwhelming support, because our \ncommunity banks did not participate in the financial meltdown and are \nnot at fault. Yet they are paying a much heavier price. But if we ask \nthe small businesspeople in Texas and probably in most parts of the \ncountry where are they getting the loans they need for their businesses \nto continue to operate, it is mostly from community banks. It is the \ncommunity banks that have stepped forward in this crisis and have done \nthe best they could to make sure that in every way possible we keep our \neconomy growing with small businesses that are the economic engine of \nAmerica. So I hope we can have a time agreement very shortly and be \nable to vote on the Hutchison-Tester amendment, and I look forward to \nworking on this bill for the next few weeks.\n  There are many amendments that I think are quite legitimate that will \nhelp this bill to be one that will fix what was bad in our economic \nsystem that caused the financial meltdown but at the same time will \nprotect the legitimate uses of the derivatives, the legitimate banking \nconcerns of our community banks, our Main Street banks, our small \nbusinesses needs, and certainly not create another new level of \ngovernment bureaucracy piled on top of banks that are already \nregulated. I just hope we don't do overkill, as I would say the \nSarbanes-Oxley bill did, which was passed in the aftermath of the Enron \nscandal. Back then I think there was overkill that hopefully we will be \nable to go back and address so we keep the bad things from happening, \nwhile assuring that our economy can go forward and compete not only in \nthe communities across our Nation but globally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, very briefly, let me thank my colleague \nfrom Texas. I already commented when Senator Tester of Montana spoke, \nbut I will again thank her and the Senator from Montana and others \ncosponsoring this amendment. It is a very solid contribution to the \nbill.\n  Again, I think the idea of considering the total liabilities \nobviously makes a lot more sense. It alleviates the burden financially \non smaller institutions. It adds that larger institutions have a \ngreater capacity to share more equitably in these costs. Whether it is \nin our State or not, we read accounts of--as we have seen over the last \nyear and a half--small banks having to close their doors. The pressures \non the FDIC are mounting. Again, you don't want to keep adding \nassessments on institutions that are already trying to lend to\n\n[[Page S3075]]\n\nbusinesses in their communities, to provide mortgages and the like.\n  This is a very constructive amendment and a very solid idea to add to \nthe bill. I thank the Senator from Texas and the Senator from Montana \nand the others involved. As soon as we work out time agreements, \nhopefully we can conclude and give the Senator from Texas a couple of \nminutes before we vote. It is exactly the way I want to manage this \nbill, if I can. There is a lot of commonality and many common \ninterests, and too often the public only sees the fights we have and \nthey don't realize how many issues we agree on. We are making the \neffort to try to reach agreements with each other. Obviously, it is not \nas interesting a story when we agree. It is not as exciting as when \nthere is a brawl on the floor over some issue. I appreciate the media's \nappreciation of the brawls, but my intention is to limit that and get \nus to the point where we have common interests in putting a good bill \ntogether. Senator Hutchison's contribution to this amendment does \nexactly that, just as our colleague from Maine, who talked about her \namendment a moment ago. Senator Warner has also been very helpful in \nthis bill. I see Senator Whitehouse here. He is also interested in the \nsubject matter. I thank my colleague from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, there is certainly one thing we can \nall agree on, and that is our assessment of the media and what they \nreally like to write about. I hope we can make progress on this bill \nand do something good for our country and the economy. I think we have \nthe same goals, and if we really work for the next 3 weeks or so trying \nto get amendments through, that would be great.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, one of the important things about this \namendment is this: There will be amendments offered in which we will \ntake things out of the bill or put things in, but this is an idea which \nhas great value as a freestanding idea in many ways. That is why it has \ngreat value. This is something we clearly need to do. You can talk \nabout other parts of the bill, but this is an idea that brings value to \nthe bill--significant value, in my view, in light of the economic \ncircumstances we are in. I appreciate this amendment more than kind of \na strike something in the bill or modify something. This adds real \nvalue to the legislation. I am appreciative of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I had planned to offer an amendment \nthis afternoon. I have been informed by the managers that the amendment \nslots are full at the moment. I wish to speak about my amendment and \nthen return to the floor at the earliest opportunity to offer it for a \nvote.\n  First, I say to the chairman of the Banking Committee that the bill \nwe are currently debating would do great things to regulate an out-of-\ncontrol Wall Street, to end the pernicious practice of too big to fail, \nand to provide for regular consumers an independent financial \nprotection agency to look out for their interests against all the big \nsharks and lobbyists and lawyers who are ganged up against them on \nconsumer debt. I appreciate the work Chairman Dodd and Chairman Lincoln \nhave done, and I look forward to continuing to work with them on this \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  My amendment is cosponsored by Senators Merkley, Durbin, Sanders, \nLevin, Burris, Franken, Brown of Ohio, and Menendez, and we are \ncontinuing to solicit cosponsorships. We are also receiving \nendorsements from outside of this body.\n  The amendment would address an area that is not yet covered by the \nWall Street reform bill; that is, runaway credit card interest rates. \nIt would do so not by imposing new restrictions on lending but, rather, \nby restoring historic State powers--powers that were eliminated in the \nrelatively recent past.\n  Madam President, when you and I were growing up, a credit card offer \nwith a 20-percent or 30-percent interest rate might have been a matter \nto bring to the attention of the authorities. Such interest rates were \nillegal under the laws of most, if not all, of the 50 States. Laws \nagainst charging excessive interest rates go much further back than our \nyouth, however. The Code of Hammurabi in the third millennium B.C. \nlimited interest rates. Hindu laws of the second century B.C. limited \ninterest rates. Roman law limited interest rates. So when America was \nestablished, there was already a long tradition of protecting citizens \nagainst excessive interest rates, and that tradition carried to the \nfounding of the United States of America.\n  For the first 202 years of our Republic, each State had the sovereign \npower to enforce usury laws against any lender doing business with its \ncitizens. During those two centuries, our economy grew and flourished, \nand lenders profited while complying with those laws.\n  Then, in 1978 came an apparently uneventful Supreme Court case. It \nwas little noticed at the time it was decided. The case was called \nMarquette National Bank of Minneapolis v. First of Omaha Service \nCorporation. The Supreme Court there had to determine what the word \n``located'' meant in an old statute, the National Bank Act of 1863--\nwhether it meant that the transaction between a bank in one State and a \nconsumer in another State was governed by the law of the bank State or \nof the consumer State. The resolution was that the term ``located'' \nreferred to the location of the bank and not the location of the \nconsumer. This meant that in a transaction between a bank in one State \nand a consumer in another, the transaction would be governed by the \nState in which the bank was domiciled.\n  Well, it did not take long for the big banks to see the loophole this \nvery narrow decision created. This loophole was never sanctioned by \nCongress, apparently never intended by the Supreme Court, but it was a \nsignificant loophole. It allowed banks to, for the first time in the \nNation's history, avoid interest rate restrictions by the States of \ntheir consumers. It allowed them to get through that loophole by \nreorganizing as national banks and moving to States with comparatively \nweak consumer protection.\n  Once the banks figured out that loophole, what is called ``a race to \nthe bottom'' ensued. Bank credit card centers moved to States with the \nworst consumer protections, and in some cases States made their \nconsumer protections even worse in order to attract that business to \ntheir State. The result of that is that today the credit card divisions \nof major banks are based in just a few States. That deal with the bank \nState causes consumers in all other States to be denied their \ntraditional, historic, lawful protection against outrageous interest \nrates and fees.\n  With millennia of interest rate protections behind us and hundreds of \nyears of protection by the sovereign States of our Nation, the current \nsystem that has developed since that 1978 decision is the oddity in our \nhistory.\n  My amendment would do nothing more than reinstate the historic, \nlongstanding powers of our sovereign States to protect their citizens \nagainst excessive usurious interest rates. Let me be clear about what \nthis amendment would not do. It would not mandate anything. It would \nnot even recommend interest rate caps. It would not impose any other \nlending limitations. It would just restore to our sovereign States the \npower they enjoyed for over 200 years from the founding of the \nRepublic--the power to say: Enough. Thirty percent or 50 percent or 100 \npercent is too much interest to be charged to its citizens.\n  The current system is unfair to consumers, but it is also unfair to \nlocal banks--banks that continue to be bound by the laws of the State \nin which they are located. A small local bank has to play by the rules \nof fair interest rates. The gigantic national credit card companies can \navoid having any rules at all. That is not fair. We need to level the \nplaying field to eliminate this unfair and lucrative advantage for Wall \nStreet banks against our local Main Street community banks.\n  To make sure lenders cannot find another statute to use to once again \navoid State law, my amendment would apply to all types of consumer \nlending institutions and not just national banks. So no more changing \nyour charter or your means of business to avoid limitations on gouging \nyour customers.\n  My amendment gives State legislatures ample time to revise their \nusury statutes if they wish and gives lenders ample time to adjust. The \namendment would not go into effect until 1 year\n\n[[Page S3076]]\n\nafter the President signs the bill into law.\n  In the meantime, it is worth noting that most States' usury laws are \naround or above 18 percent. Presently, federally regulated credit \nunions do quite well under a Federal 18 percent interest rate cap. So \nthere should not be a large shock when this amendment goes into effect \nas law. It is the 30-percent-and-over interest rates that are the \nrecent anomaly, the historic peculiarity, the oddity, and cruelty to \nconsumers that States have traditionally been able to defend against.\n  We should go back to the historic norm, the way the Founding Fathers \nsaw things under the doctrine of federalism, and close this modern \nbureaucratic loophole that allows big Wall Street banks to gouge local \ncitizens and compete unfairly with local banks.\n  I ask my colleagues for their consideration of this amendment and \nurge them to support it. I think it is a good amendment.\n  I see the distinguished majority whip on the floor. I yield back my \ntime so that he may speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator. I hope to join him \nas a cosponsor. It wasn't that long ago--the Senator will remember--\nwhen we had a debate on the floor about credit card reform. People \nacross America said: There are some things going on with credit cards \nthat aren't fair and right, and we need you to police these credit \ncards and make sure they don't do outrageous things and charge people \nunreasonably.\n  I think we made some progress in the law we passed, but we made one \ncritical error: we gave the credit card companies a long grace period \nto adjust to the changes. If you will notice, over the last year or so \nyou received notices--I got them at my home in Springfield, IL--from \ncredit card companies saying they were going to raise interest rates on \nthe credit cards before the new law went into effect. My wife saved \nthem and said: Mr. Smart Senator, how did you let this happen? It \nturned out that we had no control on those interest rates during that \nperiod of time and very little after the reform bill.\n  What the Senator from Rhode Island is challenging us to look at is \nthis: What is a reasonable amount to charge for an interest rate? His \ndecision--and I concur with it--is, let's let each State make that \ndecision.\n  Thirty-two years ago, the Supreme Court incorrectly removed the \nauthority of States to make that decision. They said: If your credit \ncard company is located in State X, you are bound by the laws of State \nX when it comes to interest rates for all of your customers across the \nUnited States. You don't have to change for a customer living in \nArkansas, which has a cap on interest rates, or for a customer living \nin Illinois. You just take the law of State X and that is the law you \napply to your customers.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island says: Why would we allow that? Why \ndon't we let standards be established by each State? He doesn't dictate \nthe standard--whether it is 5, 10, or 100 percent. That will still be \nup to the State. He doesn't say it will happen overnight. He gives a \nyear for them to phase it in.\n  It will also level the playing field for a lot of community banks and \nlocal financial institutions in each State bound by State law.\n  When the community banks in Illinois are doing business with me as a \nresident of Illinois, there are laws that can apply, and in other \nStates as well. But when it comes to credit cards, they can charge me \nwhatever they want because the States they say they do business in have \nno rules whatsoever.\n  The net result of this most people understand. If the interest rates \nare not regulated, if they literally go to the high heavens, people end \nup paying enormous sums of money. The penalties involved go through the \nroof as well.\n  This is a legitimate issue and a legitimate subject for us to raise. \nI believe, as the Senator from Rhode Island does, that there is a \nreasonable level of interest rates where a reputable institution can \nmake a good profit. Beyond that, it turns out to be a trap that a lot \nof people fall into because they do not realize there is no ceiling \nwhatsoever on the interest rates they are being charged.\n  There will be other amendments on this financial stability bill. This \nis one that I think most people will understand completely. The law of \nyour State will determine the interest rate you are going to pay on \nyour credit card, not the law of some other State. I do not think it is \nan unreasonable amendment. It is a very reasonable one. It reduces the \ncost for families and businesses and the life they lead, and it gives \nto each State the authority to decide what that limit will be within \neach State. For those who argue against Federal control, the Senator \nfrom Rhode Island is taking this right back to the local level where \nthe decisions will be made.\n  I am happy to support his amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to \njoin us in cosponsoring it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the Senate majority whip for \ncosponsoring our legislation. I appreciate his support immensely. He \nhas a wonderful way of making things clear and helping people \nunderstand how basic and simple and historic this amendment is. It \ntakes us back to the way the country was through the vast majority of \nits history.\n  The ``greatest generation'' served in World War II, came home, and \nwent to college and built the society we now live in under these rules. \nGeorge Washington and his men at Valley Forge served under these rules. \nThe Civil War took place and the Korean war took place under these \nrules. There are 202 years of solid history behind this issue.\n  I will close with an appeal to my colleagues to continue to show \ninterest in this legislation, in particular my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle. If you believe in States rights, this is a good \npiece of legislation.\n  If you believe in States as laboratories of democracy, as centers of \ninnovation, as places where you multiply times 50 the chance of getting \nthe right answer when you allow a little bit of innovation to take \nplace, you should support this legislation.\n  If you take comfort in more than 200 years of solid American history \nproving that this is the right way to go, you should support this \namendment.\n  If you want to protect consumers in your State from out-of-State \nbanks that are out of control and have no restrictions on interest \nrates they can charge your consumers, you should support this \namendment.\n  If you think the Federal Government has too much power and you want \nthe States to have more say about what can take place with its own \ncitizens, you should support this amendment.\n  I look forward to continuing to push for a vote on this amendment. I \nthink it is an important one.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, more than 18 months after the collapse of \nLehman Brothers put our financial system into a deep freeze, we are at \na crossroads in history. We can continue to turn a blind eye to the \nvery real threat that excessive risk taking and reckless deregulation \npose to our economy or we can choose to learn from the financial \ndisaster that nearly brought our economy to a screeching halt. I urge \nmy colleagues to choose reform.\n  We can't wait any longer to take on the challenge of overhauling the \nrules of the road for our financial system. We have a regulatory system \nbased on the 1930s and 1970s and a financial world in the year 2010. We \nhave an economic imperative to pass a strong set of financial reforms. \nThe shock waves in the real economy that resulted from the financial \ncrisis are still being felt today by the millions of Americans who \ncan't find a job or are facing foreclosure, who can't pay their \nchildren's college tuition or have to put off retirement because their \nsavings have been decimated.\n  We have 9.7 percent unemployment in this country, not because of any \nreform proposal that has yet to become law\n\n[[Page S3077]]\n\nbut because of an irresponsibility in the financial system and a \nbroken-down financial regulatory system that was last updated in the \n1930s and allowed too many firms, and even whole markets, to slip \nthrough the cracks. If we do nothing, we will surely find ourselves \nfacing a similar crisis in the not too distant future.\n  Senator Dodd and my colleagues on the Banking Committee have put \ntogether a bill with strong forward-looking reforms that make our \nfinancial system stronger and more stable so it can return to its \nfundamental role--helping our economy grow and innovate and create \njobs. The bill lays out new rules of the road, fills gaps in our \nregulations, and protects consumers and investors. Most importantly, by \ncreating a new resolution authority--which I know my colleague from \nVirginia, who is sitting on the floor here now, has worked very hard \non--this bill ensures that taxpayers will never again have to bail out \nlarge financial institutions. Firms that fail, will fail, period. There \nwill be no rescue or bailout, only an orderly unwinding that forces \nstockholders and bondholders to suffer, not taxpayers.\n  As a New Yorker, I see the connection between Wall Street and Main \nStreet every day. The financial industry is responsible for 500,000 \njobs in New York City, and most of them are not the kind of fancy, \nhigh-paying jobs you read about or see in the movies. The average \nsalary for these jobs is about $70,000. But I realize the financial \nsystem plays a special role far beyond Manhattan. There are many \nanalogies. It is the heart of the economy, the lifeblood, the \ncirculatory system, the engine of the economy or the oil that greases \nthe gears. Whatever image you choose, it is absolutely critical to \nhelping businesses grow and innovate and create new jobs. So our reform \nmust be forward thinking and strong but not punitive or vindictive or \nvengeful, because that will hurt the whole economy.\n  With the special status of the financial system come special \nresponsibilities. The industry has reacted to many of the new proposals \nby arguing that they will kill innovation. But because we can make cars \nthat go 200 miles per hour doesn't mean we shouldn't have speed limits. \nIn general, I think this bill strikes the necessary balance between \nmaintaining an innovative and competitive financial system while \nensuring that the recklessness that occurred by some on Wall Street \nwill never again threaten the financial health of Americans on Main \nStreet. Make no mistake about it, these reforms will be good for both \nWall Street and Main Street.\n  The bill will create a financial system where consumers and investors \non Main Street can have confidence in the products and services they \nreceive and where they put their money; a financial system focused on \ngetting capital into the real economy, so people can start new \nbusinesses and grow their existing ones. At the same time, the \ncertainty and stability that reform will provide will make our \nfinancial system even more attractive to investors around the world and \nwill help keep America at the forefront of the world's economy.\n  I believe this bill will strengthen jobs and income creation in my \nState of New York, not leak it, because it will make the system \nstronger. It will make people have more confidence in that system, and \nmoney from around the world will flow into New York, which is the \ncapital of the financial system for our Nation and our world.\n  The bill Senator Dodd put together is stronger in many ways than most \npeople expected it to be a couple of months ago. It contains several \ncore reforms that will go a long way toward fixing the problems that \ncrept up in our financial system over decades. The bill would make sure \ntaxpayers never again have to foot the bill when large institutions \nfail; make sure every large financial institution has a regulator \nlooking over its shoulder to prevent excesses, and a council of \nregulators looking at risks across the whole system; make sure \nderivatives--which, when abused, can put the whole system at risk--are \ntraded transparently, at the very least, and on an exchange whenever \npossible.\n  I should note this is a huge change from the way the derivatives \nmarket works now. We would go from a totally unregulated market to one \nthat is regulated, where regulators know every trade that happens and \nrisks can't build up in the system without anyone knowing better.\n  The bill will also make sure there are stronger consumer protections \nto ensure institutions can't take advantage of average Americans in \ntheir mortgages, credit cards, or other financial instruments. It would \ngive investors additional power to hold their boards accountable so \nthey are not asleep at the wheel the next time their management is \nloading up the company with risk.\n  Like many of my colleagues, however, I believe there are areas of the \nbill I wish to see improved, and I will continue to work with my \ncolleagues on the floor to do that. First, I wish to see even stronger \nconsumer protection in the financial services area, and I am working \nwith Senators Reid and Durbin and others to strengthen this part of the \nbill. This is an area where I have worked hard for decades now in \nCongress, both in the House and Senate. It is clear to me we can't \nforce Congress to pass a new law every time a credit card company \nfigures out a way to skirt the old laws. We need an independent agency \nwhose only mission is to protect consumers, and that agency needs to \nwrite and enforce rulings across the board for all financial \ninstitutions.\n  I am sponsoring an amendment to expand the enforcement authority of \nthe Consumer Protection Bureau over all nonbanks, such as payday \nlenders and rent-to-own companies, to make sure consumers are protected \nno matter who they rely on for financial services.\n  In the area of consumers, small companies can rip off consumers just \nthe way large companies can. And while large companies can pose a \ngreater risk to the system as a whole, small companies can pose every \nbit as great a risk to the individual consumer, and the distinction \nbetween the two is faceted and unfair.\n  I also think the bill could go farther in dealing with credit rating \nagencies, and I am working with Senator Franken on a proposal that \nwould reduce the conflicts of interest inherent in their current \nbusiness model. There are other changes I will proposal as well.\n  In conclusion, we have many tasks in front of us if we are to rebuild \nthe American economy, but a stronger financial system focused on the \nneeds of the real economy is crucial in that effort. There should be no \ndoubt that part of putting us back on the path to prosperity requires \ninstituting smart, thoughtful financial reforms.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                            Enemy Combatants\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share a few remarks about the \nrecent arrest of the Faisal Shahzad, the individual who allegedly \nattempted to detonate a car bomb in Times Square in a plot to kill a \nlot of Americans.\n  I have been asked about that incident several times over the last \nseveral days, and I think I was incorrect in making comments to \nreporters and even to friends about the precise legal situation in \nwhich we are involved. Let me briefly summarize what I think the \ncurrent state of the law is, and all of us will then be better able to \nrespond to the questions we may be asked.\n  The Christmas Day bombing suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, as was \nestablished pretty quickly, is an unprivileged enemy belligerent and is \nthus eligible to be tried for his offenses and detained as a person at \nwar against the United States. Mr. Abdulmutallab is an individual who \ncould be held as a prisoner of war, if the military so chooses, for so \nlong as the hostilities continue, just as we did in World War II and \nevery war the United States has been part of. Also, the military would \nbe entitled to try Mr. Abdulmutallab, the Christmas Day bomber, by \nmilitary commission. That is what we would normally do, and that is \nwhat was done in World War II when we caught Nazi saboteurs plotting to \nblow up targets in the U.S.\n  I believed the administration made a mistake when they treated Mr. \nAbdulmutallab as a civilian criminal and provided him Miranda rights \nand appointed him a lawyer, which we have to do if we are going to \ntreat somebody as a criminal rather than an unprivileged enemy \nbelligerent. I believe firmly that was an error, and the\n\n[[Page S3078]]\n\nnormal procedure should be for these types of individuals to be tried \nor detained by the military because they are not criminals, they are \nwarriors.\n  Yesterday's arrest of the Times Square bombing suspect, Faisal \nShahzad, raises similar questions. My initial thought was that the \nSupreme Court has clearly held that a U.S. citizen who has joined the \nenemy to fight against this country can be designated as an unlawful \nenemy belligerent and could be detained for the duration of \nhostilities. That is a fact Abraham Lincoln never had any doubt about \nwhen he took people prisoners. I guess George Washington, when there \nwas the Whiskey Rebellion, he never had any doubt he had the ability to \nattack, destroy, or arrest people when they were at war with the United \nStates. Fortunately, he did not have to go so far, but that is the kind \nof thing the Supreme Court reaffirmed in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld.\n  In the Hamdi case, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who wrote the \nopinion, made clear that a citizen who has taken up arms in hostilities \nagainst the United States can be designated as an unlawful enemy \ncombatant--``unlawful enemy belligerent'' is the phrase she used--and \nshe wrote the opinion which said:\n\n       There is no bar to this Nation's holding one of its own \n     citizens as an enemy combatant. . . . A citizen, no less than \n     an alien, can be ``part of or supporting forces hostile to \n     the United States or coalition partners'' and ``engaged in an \n     armed conflict against the United States''; such a citizen, \n     if released, would pose the same threat to returning to the \n     front during the ongoing conflict.\n\n  That is perfectly sound and perfectly reasonable. She concluded that \nMr. Hamdi, who was captured alongside the Taliban in Afghanistan but \nwho was an American citizen, could be detained for the duration of the \nhostilities authorized by the Authorization for the Use of Military \nForce that Congress passed, authorizing military force against him in \norder to keep him from rejoining the enemy.\n  We have had quite a number of people who have been released from \nGuantanamo, who have been captured in the process, who have returned to \nthe combat and attacked us. So it is clear that under Hamdi, the \nadministration has the authority to detain the Times Square terror \nsuspect as an unprivileged enemy combatant if he can be linked to our \nterrorist enemies within the definitions of the Military Commission's \nAct.\n  But I want to be clear. There is a distinction: this suspect, unlike \nthe Christmas Day bomber and the 9/11 plotters, cannot be tried via \nmilitary commission under current law. He can be detained by the \nmilitary, but not tried by military commission. In previous conflicts, \nmilitary commissions were used to try civilians who took up arms \nagainst the United States in ways that violated the rules of war. For \nexample, Herbert Haupt was one of the Nazi saboteurs who was prosecuted \nvia military commission after plotting to blow up targets within the \nUnited States in the early months of World War II. He was a naturalized \nU.S. citizen, and the U.S. Supreme Court, in the landmark case of ex \nparte Quirin, allowed the commission to go forward with his trial, and \nI think he was executed. A number of the people involved in that case--\nmost of those who sneaked into the country by submarine, as I recall, \noff our coast, to blow up our cities and infrastructure and kill \ncivilians--were tried for being in violation of the rules of law, very \nmuch unlike a German soldier who was captured on the battlefield during \nthe Battle of the Bulge. They were detained as prisoners of war \nthroughout the war. Because these people had violated the rules of war \nthey could be tried by a military commission.\n  But what happened in the Haupt case ex parte Quirin is no longer law. \nSince 2006, the Military Commissions Act that Congress passed required \nand made it clear that the military commission trials are only \navailable for alien unprivileged enemy belligerents. Accordingly, the \nTimes Square bombing suspect who appears to be a citizen must be \nprosecuted, if he is prosecuted and tried at all, in Federal court--if \nthe reports are accurate that he is a citizen.\n  I want to be sure. I think we have this matter straight. I believe an \nalien unlawful belligerent who is captured should not be treated like a \ncriminal. They should not be appointed a lawyer that day to tell them \ndon't say anything. They should not be advised of their rights because \nthey are prisoners of war. If their actions amount to a violation of \nthe rules of war, an alien unlawful enemy belligerent can be tried in \ncivilian court, if we choose, or tried by a military commission. But if \nthey are a citizen and they are caught under these circumstances, they \ncan be detained in military custody, but they can't be tried by a \nmilitary commission. They can only be tried by the civilian courts in \ncivilian trials.\n  With regard to the matter of Miranda warnings, Miranda is not a \nconstitutional requirement. It was never part of American law until \nrecently--40 years ago, 50 years ago. No nation in the world I think--\nexcept perhaps one, I forget which one--provides that you have to warn \npeople they have a right to remain silent. We can ask them questions. \nThey can remain silent. We can't force them to talk, but we don't have \nto read them the Constitution before we ask them questions. But we do.\n  So, to me, it makes no sense that we would provide this extra \nconstitutional right to unlawful enemy alien combatants like a \nChristmas Day bomber. They should be detained by military custody. If \nthey need to be tried, the choice should be made between whether to be \ntried in civilian courts or military courts. The ability to obtain good \nintelligence about the operation is more enhanced, in my view, without \nany doubt--even though sometimes people who are given the Miranda \nrights talk--but there is no doubt we will have less people talking if \nthey are appointed lawyers and read Miranda rights than if we don't.\n  Since war is won or lost so often on the question of who has the best \nintelligence, we should not provide lawyers to individuals who are at \nwar with us and seek to destroy our country and kill innocent men, \nwomen, and children.\n  I think that is the basic state of the law today. I have been a bit \nconfused myself, and I am glad my staff has helped me get correct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this week, as the Senate moves forward \nwith consideration of Wall Street reform legislation, I am optimistic \nthat legislation will be passed that reforms our financial system and \nprevents those who nearly brought down the economy from ever being able \nto do that again.\n  As we have heard many times over the last several weeks, the bill \ncreates a mechanism to monitor the economy for nationwide trends and \nrisky patterns that could lead to problems. It establishes a consumer \nwatchdog dedicated to identifying and preventing lending trends that \nare harmful to consumers. In addition to preventing future bailouts, \nthe bill also requires that most financial speculation be done in the \nopen, while addressing the underlying problem that allowed the banks to \ngo casino-crazy in the first place. It also brings derivatives into a \ntransparent marketplace. I believe all these changes will make the \nAmerican financial system more transparent, accountable and responsive \nto future risks.\n  It has been discouraging to see some Members and special interests \nopposed to these changes. In fact, I believe it is hard to argue \nagainst these reforms with a straight face. Yet those against reforming \nWall Street have been doing just that, asserting that making markets \nfair and transparent will somehow hurt the economy. These reforms will \nhelp, not hurt, American consumers, small banks and small businesses.\n  As I have said before, our community banks in South Dakota, and \nacross the Nation, have acted responsibly. It was the actions of large, \ninterconnected financial institutions that endangered our economy and \nreceived Federal bailouts.\n  This bill eliminates the likelihood that the government would once \nagain be forced to throw billions of dollars at Wall Street or run the \nrisk of bringing down our entire economy.\n  The community banks in South Dakota, and across the country, are a \nvital part of our economy, as they reinvest money back into the \ncommunities they serve. This legislation will help community banks \nsince it levels the\n\n[[Page S3079]]\n\nplaying field between banks and nonbank financials, such as mortgage \nlenders.\n  In addition, the bill fills many regulatory gaps, helping solve the \nproblem of charter shopping, meaning financial institutions will no \nlonger be able to choose the regulator they think will be the \nfriendliest.\n  I would also like to see the legislation go further in some areas, \nsuch as the registration of private equity and venture capital with the \nSEC, in addition to hedge fund registration.\n  I also believe the legislation fills important regulatory gaps \nrelating to insurance regulation. This legislation establishes the \nOffice of National Insurance, and gives this office the ability to \nnegotiate international agreements, a task that is currently a struggle \nfor our country in a global marketplace.\n  These provisions will give us a better picture of what is happening \nin this national and international industry, something we do not have \nnow. We should resist efforts to take authority away from the Office of \nNational Insurance.\n  This bill has had substantial input from Republicans and Democrats. \nAs the legislation process moves forward, I hope that bipartisan \nlanguage on investor protection can be retained, that we can find \ncommon ground on national preemption and State AG enforcement, and that \nadditional good ideas from both sides of the aisle can be incorporated \ninto this legislation through the amendment process.\n  I believe all Members of this body want to support bipartisan \nlegislation to reform Wall Street. But, as we seek bipartisan \nconsensus, we should assess all amendments from a Main Street, \ncommonsense perspective.\n  South Dakota's small farms, ranches and business operate with \ntransparency and accountability. It is time for that same transparency \nand accountability to be extended to Wall Street.\n  Taxpayers, consumers, and businesses across our Nation have been \naffected by the gambling of Wall Street. The fallout of Wall Street's \nrecklessness has affected all of us, whether it is job loss, \nforeclosure, loss of retirement funds, or decreased access to a loan or \nother type of credit.\n  Nearly 2 years have passed since the financial crisis. It is time to \nmove forward and fix our failed system of financial services \nregulation.\n  A young South Dakotan was in my office last week, and said that he \nthought this bill represents South Dakota values, because he was raised \nwith the value that you should be careful with your money, and even \nmore careful with someone else's money. That is something that Wall \nStreet forgot.\n  Any legislation that passes this body must make our markets safer, \nbetter protect consumers, create a level playing field for industry, \nand remind Wall Street that our Nation's economy is not something they \nare free to gamble away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I just wish to say to my friend how much I \nappreciate his involvement and support and effort over the past many \nmonths that we have worked in this area, since the collapse of our \neconomy back in the fall of--well, it began earlier than that, \nactually, as we witnessed early in 2007 the mortgage crisis occurring \nacross the country.\n  Senator Johnson has been tremendously helpful and valuable. He is my \nseatmate on the Banking Committee. We have been sitting next to each \nother on that committee for the past 3 years and working on these \nissues together. He brought great value to this debate and discussion, \ncontributed significantly to the product before us, and I wished to \nthank him for that.\n  We have some work to do, obviously, in the next number of days on \nthis bill. But it is a good bill. I appreciate his comments about how \nit has been a bill crafted not by one member, not by a chairman of a \ncommittee but by a group of us on that committee, Democrats as well as \nRepublicans who contributed to this bill.\n  So I thank him for his work.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I know the Senator from Connecticut has \nbeen on the floor all of this day managing a piece of legislation, and \nit appears to be kind of a lonely process here. He is managing what is \na very important piece of legislation dealing with financial reform or \nWall Street reform. I know he is perhaps as frustrated as everybody \nelse that we are not making more progress and voting on amendments. I \nknow work is going on behind the scenes as well.\n  I hope we will be able to move ahead and get a good piece of \nlegislation through the Senate. I don't know what time it will take, \nbut what is far more important is that we get it right. The \nconsequences of not making the changes necessary would be that we would \nexperience again at some point in the future the kind of financial \ncrisis we have seen in the last couple years. It is a significant \ncrisis for a lot of Americans--about $15 trillion of lost value, but \nthat is an aggregate number that doesn't mean much.\n  What means something is that millions of people are losing their \njobs, their homes, and many are losing hope. That is the consequence of \nthis kind of very deep recession--the deepest recession since the Great \nDepression.\n  Following the Great Depression, if you read the economic history of \nthe country, you will find that a number of very aggressive pieces of \nlegislation were put into place to protect our country and make certain \nthat could not happen again. Those pieces of legislation enacted into \nlaw lasted for a long time--70 or 80 years--to protect this country's \neconomic interests. But what happened was that a number of people \ndecided they were old-fashioned provisions and needed to be modernized, \nso we had modernization legislation that I did not support. We had to \nmodernize the system. That modernization a decade ago caused massive \nproblems. So now we are back having experienced the last couple of \nyears and a very deep recession that is not a natural economic \ndisaster; it is manmade. I think it is caused by the most unprecedented \ngreed this country has ever seen among some of its largest financial \ninstitutions.\n  It is important to say that banking is critical to this country's \neconomic existence. You need production and you need finance. I don't \nthink we ought to suggest--and nobody has--that finance is not \nworthwhile. It is very important. You can't produce or have businesses \nwithout the ability to provide finance for those businesses. But over a \ncouple of centuries of economic history in this country, sometimes \nproducers have had the upper hand; sometimes those in the finance \nproduction have had the upper hand. For the last 15, 20 years, those in \nfinance production in this country have had an unbelievable amount of \nclout and sway and the upper hand. That has caused us serious problems.\n  Today, I am not talking about the origins of this latest economic \nwreck--I have done that many times before--but starting with the \nsubprime loan scandal that permeated much of the country, there was \nunbelievable greed and excess, securitization of bad mortgages that \nwere rated AAA and passed from one to another, from mortgage bankers, \nto hedge funds, to investment banks, and back and forth.\n  Then even that wasn't enough. They were passing a bunch of bad paper \naround where everybody was making big fees, not knowing what they were \nbuying, and buying things they would not get from people who never had \nit.\n  That wasn't enough. Then we created synthetic securities and naked \nswaps. I guess that was a natural extension by those who were greedy \nenough to believe you have to have something to trade no matter what \nthe circumstances. So they created instruments--debt instruments, \nsecurities, and others--that had no value. They were debt instruments \nrelated to values of things that were extraneous, so there was no \ninsurable interest.\n  A naked credit default swap is something that has no insurable \ninterest on either end. It is simply two people who have decided to bet \non whether a bondholder over there may or may not default, despite the \nfact that neither of these people has an economic interest in the bond. \nThey are just making a wager. They could have just as well put\n\n[[Page S3080]]\n\nit on black or red at the roulette wheel or played the craps table or \nplayed blackjack. It is not an investment; it is just betting.\n  That all went on, and there was a dramatic amount of new leverage and \nborrowing. I cannot begin to describe the excess that occurred. I guess \nthe final circumstance for me to see what was wrong with all of this \nwas that in 2008 the ``Wall Street'' firms earned a net negative of \nabout $36 billion, that is, they had $36 billion of losses, and still \npaid, I believe, $17 billion in bonuses. That represents sort of the \nmost egregious excesses you can imagine.\n  The question now and the circumstance that exists that I know the \nSenator from Connecticut cares a lot about is how do we restore \nconfidence? How do we restore some confidence for the American people \ngoing forward? If we do not have confidence, this economy is not going \nto expand and rebound.\n  The answer is, we put together a piece of legislation called Wall \nStreet or financial reform and construct it the right way to try to \nmake certain the things that were done cannot be done again, to make \ncertain the kind of economic wreck that occurred cannot happen again.\n  My colleague from the Banking Committee, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Dodd, and others have done quite a good job of \nputting together a piece of legislation that moves in that direction. \nIt can be improved, in my judgment, and perhaps will be. I know he will \nagree with that as well. There are other ideas that can be brought to \nthe floor of the Senate on this legislation.\n  I am going to talk about two of them ever so briefly--actually three, \nbut one of them will be very quick.\n  Senator Grassley and I intend to offer an amendment that says to the \nFederal Reserve Board: You must disclose to whom you were providing \nemergency assistance during the financial debacle on Wall Street, \nincluding loans out of the discount window to investment banks for the \nfirst time in history. You must disclose whom you provided loans to, \nwhat the terms were, and how much those loans amounted to. Two Federal \ncourts--the district court and now the appeals court--have ordered the \nFed to do so. The American people, they said, deserve to know. The Fed \nannounced they intend to appeal that once again.\n  Tomorrow, Senator Grassley and I will offer an amendment that says \nthe law will require them to make that disclosure. The American people \ndeserve to know.\n  On the other two issues, one is on too big to fail. This is central \nto the bill. There are a lot of ideas about too big to fail. Mine is, I \nthink, the most direct, the most decisive, and the most effective.\n  If the Financial Stability Oversight Council decides that an \ninstitution is too big to fail--that is, by definition, the construct \nand size of that organization would create a moral hazard to this \ncountry, would create unacceptable risks and grave risks to the entire \nfuture of the American economy--if that is the case, if that is the \njudgment, then it seems to me you have to pare back portions of that \nenterprise until it is not any longer too big to fail and causing grave \nrisk to the future of this economy.\n  In my judgment, the most direct and reasonable thing to do is to \nsimply require that you restructure and require divestiture, where \nnecessary, of those portions of an institution that have become too big \nto fail and cause a grave risk to the future of this country's economy, \nshould they fail.\n  I will be offering that amendment. I know it is different than some \nothers. My colleagues, Senator Brown and Senator Kaufman, have an \namendment which I will vote for and support as well on this issue. I \nthink this is probably the most direct and probably the most effective \namendment on the issue of too big to fail.\n  Finally, I am going to offer an amendment that would ban what are \ncalled naked credit default swaps. If people want to gamble, just bet \none another. There are plenty of places to do that in America. Las \nVegas comes to mind. Atlantic City comes to mind. It seems to me, we \nshould not mistake betting for investing. We ought to get back to \nbasics in our financial institutions.\n  I think we have something close to $25 trillion of credit default \nswaps that exist now. I don't know what percent of them have no \ninsurable interest, that represent just wagers, just flatout bets \nrather than investments. In England, a study suggested that about 80 \npercent of credit default swaps are what are called naked credit \ndefault swaps with no insurable interest. If that is the case on this \nside, we are talking about a notional value of perhaps $16 trillion, \n$17 trillion of instruments out there that simply allow for the making \nof wagers that have nothing at all to do with the insurable interest \nand bonds.\n  I mentioned earlier that Mr. Pearlstein, who writes for the \nWashington Post, once observed a pretty simple question: Why should \nthere be more insurance policies to insure bonds than there are bonds \nto insure? The answer is obvious. They created these excess insurance \npolicies that have no insurable interest so people could just gamble. \nIt is fine if you are gambling with your own money, but once you start \ngambling with the taxpayers' money, if you are a federally insured bank \nand the taxpayers are going to bear the risk, that is a different \nmatter.\n  I am going to offer these amendments. I say, again, as I said when I \nstarted, all of us who come to this debate about financial reform or \nWall Street reform understand that an effective, functioning system of \nfinance in this country is essential to the well-being of America. I do \nnot think anybody wants to take apart a system of finance that has the \ndifferent levels of FDIC insured banking, commercial banking, \ninvestment banking, venture capitals, hedge funds--all those are \nimportant to this country's long-term future. I personally would like \nto see hedge funds and derivatives regulated. I have talked about that \nwith Senator Feinstein and others for a long time. It is very important \nthat we have a system of finance that has the confidence of the \nAmerican people and that we need in order to finance the production in \nthis country.\n  Ultimately, all of us would like the productive sector to be \nrepaired, to grow and hire people once again, employ people, and have \n``Made in America'' put on products once again. All of us would like to \nsee that happen. That will not happen unless we have a working system \nof finance as well.\n  We had a hearing where representatives from three businesses came to \nthat hearing. All three were small- to medium-sized businesses. All \nthree had sailed through this deep recession, with some difficulty, but \nwere still profitable. All three were ready to expand, ready to hire \nmore people, and none of them could find any financing to do it. None \nof them have been delinquent. All of them had existing banking \nenterprises with which they had a relationship and always paid back \neverything they owed. They had never been delinquent. Yet they could \nnot find the funding to expand their business and hire more people. \nThat is what is wrong.\n  Even today, by the way, some of these record profits that are coming \nfrom some of the biggest financial institutions are coming not as a \nresult of their lending money to people but as a result of their \ntrading, in many cases in some of the same securities that caused some \nof the same problems a couple years ago and over the last decade.\n  This reform legislation is essential. This is one of the most \nimportant pieces of legislation we will have considered in this \nCongress--probably the most important. In many ways, the consequences \nof what we do will be with us for a decade or more. That is why it is \nimportant to get this right.\n  I say to my colleague from Connecticut, I wish to be helpful to him. \nHe has written a piece of legislation that has much to commend it. This \nSenate owes him a debt of thanks and the Banking Committee a debt of \nthanks. That does not mean we cannot offer amendments that might \nimprove pieces here and there. But this is an awfully good start.\n  My hope is, Senator Dodd will have sufficient cooperation in the \nSenate to begin getting votes on amendments so we can get through this, \nhave the debate, and get the best ideas that everybody has to offer and \nget a piece of legislation that will give the American people some \nconfidence once again.\n\n[[Page S3081]]\n\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I wish to speak as in morning business \nfor 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Extension of the Biodiesel Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, last Tuesday, President Obama traveled \nto Iowa. He visited counties and towns that have been hit particularly \nhard by the economic downturn. While Iowa's average unemployment rate \nstands at 6.8 percent, Lee County's unemployment rate stands near 11 \npercent. Wapello County's unemployment rate is at 9.5 percent. These \nwere the counties that President Obama visited. Over 1,000 jobs have \nbeen lost in each of the 3 counties he visited since the recession \nbegan.\n  The visit to Iowa was billed as an effort to highlight the steps \ntaken to achieve long-term growth and prosperity by creating a new, \nclean energy economy.\n  During his trip, the President visited a Siemens wind blade \nmanufacturing facility in Fort Madison. I had the opportunity to visit \nthere about a year and a half ago. The President touted Iowa's \nleadership in the production of wind energy. This Siemens facility is a \ngreat facility. I recall just a few years ago speaking to Siemens \nmanufacturing when they were looking for a site for their first wind \nproduction facility in the United States. I told the executives at \nSiemens they would not be disappointed if they chose Fort Madison for \ntheir facility because Iowans are some of the hardest working and \nhonest people in the country.\n  I am particularly proud of the second-in-the-Nation status of Iowa's \nwind production. I first authored and won enactment of the wind \nproduction tax credit in 1992. This incentive has led to the \nexponential growth in the production of wind across our entire United \nStates.\n  It has also helped my State of Iowa to become a leader in the \nproduction of wind energy component manufacturing.\n  The emerging wind industry has created thousands of jobs in recent \nyears in the cities of Newton, West Branch, Cedar Rapids, and Fort \nMadison.\n  When President Obama says energy security should be a top priority, I \nagree with our President. When he says we need to rely more on \nhomegrown fuels and clean energy, I agree with our President. When he \nsays our security and our economy depend on making America more energy \nindependent, I agree with our President.\n  During a subsequent visit to an ethanol facility in Missouri, \nPresident Obama stated unequivocally that his administration would \nensure the domestic biofuel industry would be successful. The President \nand I are in strong agreement that renewable biofuels are a key part of \nour future.\n  Unfortunately, I believe President Obama missed an important \nopportunity to make a push for the message of the biodiesel tax credit. \nWhile the President was in Iowa touting green jobs, this Democratic \nCongress has, in effect, sent pink slips to about 18,000 people who \ndepend on the production of biodiesel for their livelihood.\n  On December 31, 2009, the biodiesel tax credit, which is essential to \nkeep a young bioindustry competitive, expired. In anticipation of the \nexpiration of the tax credit, Senator Cantwell and I introduced a long-\nterm extension in August of 2009. That bill was never considered last \nyear.\n  In December, as the expiration loomed, I came to the Senate floor to \nimplore my colleagues to put partisan politics aside and pass a clean \nextension of the biodiesel tax credit because, without an extension, I \nknew the industry would come to a grinding halt, and it has.\n  For whatever reason, the Democratic leadership in the House and the \nSenate have never considered this extension a priority. Now the \nindustry is experiencing the dire situation I predicted.\n  On January 1 of this year, about 23,000 people were employed in the \nbiodiesel industry. Because of the lapse in the credit, nearly every \nbiodiesel facility in the country is idle or operating at a fraction of \ncapacity. Nearly all of Iowa's 15 biodiesel refineries have completely \nhalted production. This has led to the loss of about 2,000 jobs in Iowa \nalone.\n  The thousands of jobs created by the wind industry in Iowa have \nessentially been offset by the thousands of jobs lost in the biodiesel \nindustry.\n  You do not have to take my word for the dire state of the industry. A \n$50 million biodiesel facility in Farley, IA--that is in northeast \nIowa--announced that they just laid off 23 workers and cut the pay of \nthe rest of the staff. Renewable Energy Group laid off 9 employees in a \nfacility in Ralston, IA, and 13 in Newton, IA. Ironically, the Newton \nbiodiesel facility is 1 mile down the road from a wind manufacturing \nfacility that President Obama visited on Earth Day just last year. \nDuring President Obama's trip to Iowa, he was within a few miles of \nthree biodiesel facilities that are idle: one in Keokuk, IA, one in \nWashington, IA, and another in Crawfordsville, IA.\n\n  According to a press release from the Iowa Renewable Fuels \nAssociation, an Iowan affiliated with biodiesel industry was able to \nspeak to President Obama very briefly following a townhall session in \nOttumwa, IA. Mr. Albin, vice president at Renewable Energy Group, told \nPresident Obama that plants are idle and 90 percent of the biodiesel \nemployees have been laid off simply as a result of the tax credit \nlapse. According to Mr. Albin, President Obama assured him that he \nwould not let the biodiesel industry die.\n  He recalls the President saying something like this--and I want to \nquote what I suppose was a paraphrase by Mr. Albin:\n\n       I'm the President and I promise I will do whatever I can. \n     Look, I'm on your side, but I've got a Congress to deal with.\n\n  Well, I can understand what the President would say. I happen to \nbelieve that in my 4 years of serving with then-Senator Obama, that \nSenator Obama, now President Obama, is very sincere about the promotion \nof ethanol and biodiesel or biofuels--whatever you want to call it. In \nfact, I had the good occasion of working with then-Senator Obama on a \nSenate bill when I was still chairman of the Finance Committee to \npromote the tax credit that is now in place so that filling stations \ncan get a tax credit for putting in for E85 ethanol, as an example. So \nI don't question President Obama's response to Mr. Albin. Of course, we \ndo have checks and balances in government and the President has \nCongress to deal with. But I hope President Obama will take strong \naction to insert himself into this debate in the Congress.\n  It seems that even President Obama, from this quote, is frustrated by \nthe lack of action by the Democratic congressional leadership on this \nissue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthis press release from Iowa RFA at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The board president of Western Iowa Energy in Wall \nLake, IA, recently stated:\n\n       Due to the continued lapse of the biodiesel tax credit, \n     Western Iowa Energy continues to suffer from significantly \n     limited sales and reduced sales forecasts. Due to these \n     market conditions, we have made the difficult decision to \n     idle our facility. Today we are laying off 15 full-time \n     employees. This represents more than 50 percent of our staff.\n\n  On February 10, Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, \nand I worked in a bipartisan fashion to develop an $84 billion jobs \npackage that included a 1-year extension of several energy tax credits, \nincluding the biodiesel tax incentive. Before the ink was even dry on \nthe paper, Majority Leader Reid scuttled our bipartisan package in \nfavor of a partisan approach. That delayed passage of an extension in \nthe Senate for well over a month, until the month of March.\n  Now it has been languishing for 6 weeks. Where is the urgency? This \nCongress jammed through a stimulus bill that spent $800 billion to keep \nthe unemployment rate below 8 percent, and of course it didn't stay \nbelow 8 percent. Yet we can't find the time to pass a\n\n[[Page S3082]]\n\nsimple tax extension that will likely reinstate 20,000 jobs overnight. \nWe are 4 months delinquent in our obligation to these biofuel producers \nwith no end game in sight. The lack of action on this issue defies \nlogic or common sense.\n  So while the Democratic leadership talks about creating green jobs, \ntheir action has led to job cuts. Americans are unemployed today \nbecause of the action--or more aptly the inaction--of the Democratic \ncongressional leadership, particularly on this biodiesel issue.\n  The United States is more dependent upon foreign oil because of the \ninaction of the Congress. Automobiles are producing more pollution \nbecause we have essentially eliminated this renewable, cleaner-burning \nbiofuel. Rural economies are being stripped of the economic gain of \nthis value-added agricultural product.\n  So I urge the Senate to take immediate action to extend this tax \nincentive and reduce our dependence upon foreign oil and save green \njobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           President Obama Gets Biodiesel Message in Ottumwa\n\n\n   IRFA Secretary Albin Uses 90 Seconds with the President to Share \n                         Urgency of Tax Credit\n\n       Ottumwa, IA.--During his Iowa visit on April 27, 2010, \n     President Barack Obama heard firsthand of the urgency to \n     reinstate the biodiesel tax credit from Brad Albin, Vice \n     President at Renewable Energy Group and Secretary of the Iowa \n     Renewable Fuels Association (IRFA).\n       Following President Obama's speech and town hall session at \n     Indian Hills Community College, Albin grabbed the President's \n     attention. During a 90 second exchange, Albin shared the \n     message of the biodiesel industry's state of disruption and \n     uncertainty resulting from the lapse of the federal biodiesel \n     blenders tax credit since January 1, 2010.\n       ``I shook his hand and told him that we're losing jobs as \n     we stand here, which seemed to get his attention,'' explained \n     Albin, who had been sitting in the second row. ``I told him \n     about plants idling and that more than 90 percent of \n     manufacturing staff at U.S. biodiesel plants have been laid \n     off as a result of the tax credit lapse.''\n       President Obama acknowledged that his biodiesel tax credit \n     updates are coming through USDA Secretary Vilsack. The \n     President continued to listen as Albin explained that for 20 \n     years Americans have worked to meet the challenge of \n     increasing energy independence, that farmers and families \n     have invested billions, and that now companies are bleeding \n     to death or bankrupt. Albin further explained that the five \n     month lapse of the tax credit could not have come at a worse \n     time as the Renewable Fuels Standard goes into effect July 1, \n     2010.\n       ``We're going to die without this tax credit,'' Albin added \n     even after the President's assurances. ``The President then \n     responded, `We won't let you die.' ''\n       ``Those that know me know I want to make sure my message is \n     clearly understood; so as the President was walking away to \n     shake another hand, I asked him if he could commit to the tax \n     credit being in place by May 31,'' Albin said. May 31, 2010, \n     the start of the Memorial Day recess, is the date Chairman \n     Sander Levin of the House Ways and Means Committee promised \n     as a reinstatement deadline for the biodiesel tax credit \n     during an energy hearing earlier this month.\n       ``The President heard me ask him again about the May 31 \n     date. He turned back to me and said, `I'm the President and I \n     promise I'll do whatever I can,' '' Albin recalled of the \n     exchange. ``President Obama then assured me of his commitment \n     to clean energy by saying, `Look, I'm on your side, but I've \n     got a Congress to deal with.' ''\n       ``I believe he now has our urgent message straight from the \n     state where the tax credit lapse is having the most impact--\n     the nation's top biodiesel state,'' Albin said. ``It really \n     was a miracle to be in that right spot at the right moment to \n     be able to get the biodiesel message straight to the \n     President of the United States of America.''\n       The Iowa Renewable Fuels Association was formed in 2002 to \n     represent the state's ethanol and biodiesel producers. The \n     trade group fosters the development and growth of the \n     renewable fuels industry in Iowa through education, \n     promotion, legislation and infrastructure development.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment that \nI have just filed. But before I begin, I would like to thank Chairman \nDodd for his exemplary work on this Wall Street reform bill. It is the \nresult of months of tireless work and many hours of negotiation by \nChairman Dodd and his staff.\n  This Wall Street reform bill will vastly improve the regulatory \nstructure currently on the books. It creates a strong consumer watchdog \nwithin the Fed--a bureau that will put consumers first, ahead of Wall \nStreet profits. This bill also brings derivatives out of the shadows \nand onto exchanges so that Wall Street's bets upon bets never again \nthreaten to bring down our entire economy. This bill accomplishes many \nthings and brings us a long way toward robust reform.\n  But there is one area we need to make stronger. We need to go further \nin addressing the rampant problems plaguing the credit rating industry. \nThat is why I intend to introduce an amendment to change the way the \ninitial credit ratings are assigned and encourage competition within \nthe credit rating industry.\n  Currently, Wall Street firms that issue complex securities request \nand purchase ratings from nationally recognized statistical rating \norganizations--or NRSROs. I am sure all of you are familiar with them--\nMoody's, Standard & Poor's, and Fitch. What you may not know is that \nthere are actually a handful of other credit rating agencies doing the \nsame work. But the big three agencies have effectively shut all others \nout of the market. It is easy to see how.\n  In the current system, the issuer of the bond pays the credit rating \nagency. So there is an incentive to rate every product that comes \nacross your desk as AAA. If you give a risky product a low rating, the \nissuer can just go to one of the other agencies and shop around for a \nbetter rating. Guess which agency that issuer is going to go back to \nthe next time? Of course, the agency that gave them the higher rating. \nDoes anyone see a problem? I do.\n  Well, the problem is that the entire credit rating structure is \nbasically one enormous conflict of interest. Issuers want high ratings, \nand raters want business. The market offers incentives for inflated \nratings not accurate ratings. These perverse incentives have driven the \nbehavior of all participants. Any rating agency looking to enter the \nmarket with better methods or any rating agency that refuses to inflate \nits ratings will never be able to compete.\n  My friend and colleague, Senator Levin, held a hearing not long ago \nin the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. His PSI investigative \nteam unearthed some very unsavory e-mail exchanges between issuers and \nraters--e-mails which implied that an issuer could obtain a higher \nrating if he paid more money. And money--money--is what drove this \nindustry not performance. As an example, the New York Times reported \nSunday that 93 percent of AAA-rated subprime mortgage-backed securities \nissued in 2006 have since been downgraded to junk status.\n  This might be easy to dismiss if these junk bonds simply cost some \nWall Street speculators a few bucks here and there. But, in fact, these \njunk securities permeated the entire market. These junk securities were \nin older workers' pension funds and working peoples' retirement funds. \nThese junk bonds contributed to the loss of $3.4 trillion in retirement \nsavings during this crisis.\n  To me, it is obvious we need an entirely different model. My \namendment, which I am introducing with Senators Schumer and Nelson, \nwould finally encourage competition and--get this--accuracy, in an \nindustry that has little of either. Specifically, my amendment creates \na credit rating agency board--a self-regulatory organization--tasked \nwith developing a system in which the board assigns a rating agency to \nprovide a product's initial rating. Requiring an initial rating by an \nagency not of the issuer's choosing will put a check on the accuracy of \nratings. Simple.\n  My amendment leaves flexibility to the board to determine assignment \nprocess. But the board will be inclined to make the process one that \nincentivizes accuracy because the representatives of the investor \ncommunity will make up a majority of the board--for example, pension \nfund managers and endowment directors; folks who have a vested interest \nin the AAA bonds they have selected actually performing as AAA bonds. \nThe board gets to design the assignment process it sees fit. It can be \nrandom, it can be based on a formula, just as long as the issuer \ndoesn't get to choose the rating agency.\n  The board will select a subset of qualified credit rating agencies to \nbe\n\n[[Page S3083]]\n\neligible for the assignment pool. The board will be required to monitor \nthe performance of the agencies in the pool. If the board so chooses, \nit can reward good performance with more rating assignments. It can \nrecognize poor performance with fewer rating assignments. If the rater \nis bad enough, that might even be zero assignments.\n  My amendment gives the SEC a year and a half to carefully implement \nthis new system with input from the board members. The result will be \nincreased competition among the credit raters, generally, and \nincentives to produce accurate ratings, not inflated ratings. The \namendment does not prohibit an issuer from then seeking a second or a \nthird or a fourth rating from an agency of its choice.\n  But rating agencies will be disinclined to give inflated ratings to a \nproduct if the initial rating reflects its true value. Some smaller \ncredit rating agencies, which haven't taken part in the inflated \nratings game, would finally have a chance to compete. An assignment \nmechanism for initial ratings will break up today's credit rating \noligopoly, promote real competition, and produce more accurate ratings. \nMore accurate ratings will decrease risk and create more stability in \nour financial system. And that is what this is all about.\n  Now, Wall Street lobbyists may claim this issue is too complex for \nCongress to address, but imagine that your child came home from school \none day saying their chemistry teacher was offering an A to anyone who \nwanted to skip the final exam and instead pay $100.\n  You don't need to know anything about chemistry to understand that \nthis system of rewards is harmful. Not only is the teacher making easy \nmoney, but nobody is holding the student accountable for doing good \nwork.\n  Now I don't know any teachers that corrupt. But the credit rating \nagencies have demonstrated that they have blindly followed the perverse \nincentives of the current market. Congress should not sit idly by and \nlet the credit rating industry continue to expose our economy to great \nrisk just because Wall Street insists the problem doesn't have an easy \nsolution. Now, my amendment may not fix the entire system, but it will \nprovide checks, encourage accuracy, and increase competition.\n  And there is no need to take my word for it--the idea in my amendment \nwas actually first proposed by several well-respected academics. \nMatthew Richardson, a leading expert and professor of applied financial \neconomics at NYU's Stern School of Business, supports this proposal, \nand has been integral in the development of my amendment, and I would \nlike to thank him for his assistance.\n  Economist Paul Krugman has suggested this model as a step toward \nimprovement. And so has economist Dean Baker. Americans for Financial \nReform, which includes the Nation's most prominent consumer groups, \nsupports it.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues, Senator Schumer and Senator \nNelson, for their leadership on this issue and for their expertise in \nhelping me craft this amendment. I also thank my colleagues, Senators \nBrown, Whitehouse, and Murray for joining us in cosponsoring it.\n  Going forward, I hope that more of my colleagues will join with us in \ntaking action to restore integrity to the credit rating industry.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, if there is one thing that we should all \nbe able to agree on, it is that the American taxpayer should never \nagain have to bail out a Wall Street firm. We need to be fighting for \nMain Street, not Wall Street, and the Boxer amendment is a step in the \nright direction on that path.\n  This amendment sends a clear message to Wall Street firms that they \ncan no longer take risks with our financial security and then expect \nthe taxpayers to be there to prop them up. Wall Street must be held \naccountable. It is time to end to taxpayer bailouts once and for all.\n  When I talk to people in Maryland, I hear their frustration and I \nfeel their anger. They want to know, why should AIG receive a bailout, \nwhen nobody is bailing out them from this economic crisis? They wonder, \nwho is on their side? Who is going to bail out their stagnant wages? \nWho is going to bail them out when they are trying to pay their \nutilities and put gas in the car? And, seniors wonder who will bail \nthem out as they try to make sure they do not lose their income.\n  This amendment shows that we heard their concerns and we are on their \nside. It sends a message to Wall Street that their time of running \naround acting like masters of the universe--with irresponsible lending \npractices and risky investments--has come to an end. And, it sends a \nmessage to American families and small businesses that their government \nis looking out for them. We are here fighting for them--fighting so \nthat consumers can be sure that their deposits are safe; fighting so \nthat small businesses have access to the credit they need to create and \nretain jobs; and fighting to make sure that taxpayers' money is \nprotected.\n  We teach our kids at a young age that they will be held responsible \nfor their own actions. When they make a mess, they must take \nresponsibility and clean it up. We must pass this amendment so that \ncorporate America can see that the same lesson applies to them, and to \nshow the taxpayers that we are serious about being stewards of their \nmoney. This amendment makes sure that if a Wall Street firm gets in \ntrouble, they will be required by law to clean up their own mess. If a \ncompany gets in trouble from this point forward, the responsibility \nwill be placed where it belongs--on the financial sector. No longer \nwill taxpayers be standing by.\n  I support the Boxer amendment because I believe it is time to put an \nend to all taxpayer bailouts.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have filed an amendment to the Wall Street reform \nbill before us that would remove one barrier between the unemployed and \na job.\n  Forty-seven percent of employers use credit reports to screen at \nleast some potential hires, according to the Society for Human Resource \nManagement. Thirteen percent of employers checked the credit history of \nall hires.\n  Unfortunately, many of our country's 15 million unemployed are facing \nmore challenges than ever. For instance, some have seen their credit \ndrop precipitously as a result of the economic downturn. In some cases, \ntheir credit history is affecting their ability to find employment.\n  My amendment would prohibit employers from using a consumer credit \nreport as a condition of employment. It would impact potential hires \nand current workers.\n  Put simply, an employer would not be able to hire or fire someone \nbased upon their credit history.\n  I certainly understand that some jobs require workers to display a \npattern of financial responsibility. To that end, my amendment would \nexempt those applying for the following:\n  Positions at financial institutions, including banks and credit \nunions, that require substantive work with customer accounts and funds; \njobs that require a national security or Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation clearance; State or local government jobs that otherwise \nrequire a credit report; and, positions otherwise requiring credit \nchecks by law.\n  This amendment is similar to a bill introduced in the House of \nRepresentatives by Representative Steve Cohen known as the Equal \nEmployment for All Act, H.R. 3149.\n  Why is this legislation needed? As of March 2010, 15 million \nAmericans continue to struggle with unemployment, and over 2.3 million \nof them live in my State alone.\n  It is critical that obstacles to employment be removed for these \nvictims of the economic downturn.\n  During these difficult times, many unemployed Americans have seen \ntheir credit scores reduced precipitously for events largely outside of \ntheir control. These events include bankruptcy, foreclosure, and credit \ncard debt.\n  Millions of American homeowners have also experienced foreclosure \nover the past 3 years. Through the first 3 months of this year alone, \n216,000 have been filed in California. Last year, more than 1 million \nforeclosures were filed in my State.\n  Foreclosures can have a devastating impact on one's credit history. \nMoreover, responsible alternatives to foreclosure, such as a short sale \nor loan modification can also affect a homeowner's credit.\n  A short sale can reduce a homeowner's credit score between 200 to 300 \npoints, according to the Third Way.\n\n[[Page S3084]]\n\n  And in a report prepared by First American CoreLogic, in February \n2010, 35 percent of California homeowners were underwater, or owed more \non their mortgage than the value of their home. This means that short \nsales, in which a homeowner sells a home for less than they owe, will \nlikely continue as an alternative to foreclosure.\n  According to the National Bankruptcy Research Center, more than 1.4 \nmillion individuals and businesses filed for bankruptcy in 2009. This \nis a 32-percent increase over the prior year 2008.\n  Federal Reserve statistics show that average credit card debt in the \nU.S. per household is over $16,000.\n  These are disturbing trends, and display a pattern of difficult \nfinancial situations facing many Americans.\n  Unfortunately, if you have lost your job in this economy, these \ncircumstances are often out of your control. But, they should not \nimpede your ability to find another job.\n  I have received many heartbreaking letters from Californians facing \nthese situations. They can't pay off debt because their debt is \nlimiting their ability to find work.\n  For example, a chemist from San Diego wrote to me about her student \nloans, which have ballooned from $60,000 to $110,000. At the time she \nwrote, she had been unemployed for 15 months.\n  But, she feels she cannot find a job in the field she trained for due \nto her poor credit score.\n  A former job recruiter from Corona wrote to share her firsthand \nexperience with this practice, which prevented her from hiring well-\nqualified, experienced candidates. This constituent, herself now \nunemployed and late on her mortgage payment, is worried that her credit \nwill now prevent her from finding a new job in the recruiting field.\n  These are just two examples of how credit history is posing an \nunnecessary obstacle for the long-term unemployed.\n  An April 9, 2010, article in the New York Times highlighted the issue \nthat my amendment seeks to address.\n  It cited testimony provided by an executive of the credit bureau \nTransUnion before the Oregon legislature. He stated that he was not \naware of research linking job performance to the contents of a worker's \ncredit report.\n  Research by Professor Jerry K. Palmer of Eastern Kentucky University \nhas also found no correlation between worker performance and the \nstrength of their credit report.\n  While credit bureaus argue that credit background checks are a \nhelpful tool in preventing employee theft and workplace violence, \nlittle evidence supports that conclusion.\n  To be clear, I recognize that in some cases, a credit history is \nimportant. Mortgage brokers or bank employees working with deposits \nshould be able to demonstrate a responsible credit history.\n  That is why my bill would exempt these industries from the \nprohibition in my amendment.\n  The unemployment situation in California is untenable. It is my goal \nto develop fiscally responsible solutions to help those in need.\n  My amendment does just that.\n  Workers should not be prevented from a job they are well-qualified \nfor, on account of reasons beyond their control.\n  If my colleagues have concerns about this legislation, I am happy to \nwork with them to improve it.\n  I hope this amendment will be adopted and provide assurance to \nworkers that their credit will not keep them out of work.\n  Mr. President, I have also filed an amendment to the Wall Street \nReform legislation that would require the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau to undertake a study on the availability of credit to the \nunemployed.\n  An article in the Los Angeles Times in March 2010 highlighted a \ndisturbing new trend in the payday lending industry targeting the \nunemployed. Specifically, payday lenders are providing cash advances to \nindividuals using unemployment checks as collateral.\n  This is a troubling practice, especially for those surviving solely \non their unemployment benefits.\n  In California, payday loans can carry interest rates of up to 459 \npercent.\n  In light of this, I believe more must be done to ensure reasonable \nand fair credit terms are available to the unemployed.\n  This Wall Street Reform bill creates a research unit within the \nBureau of Consumer Financial Protection housed at the Federal Reserve.\n  My amendment would require this unit to conduct a study on the \nfollowing:\n  The effects of payday lending on the unemployed; the potential \nimpacts, both positive and negative, of providing payday loans to \nindividuals using their unemployment checks as collateral; alternative \ncredit options for the unemployed, including the accessibility and \ncosts associated with them; and policy recommendations that the Bureau \nof Consumer Financial Protection could implement to prevent \nunscrupulous lending practices.\n  This report would be completed within 1-year of the bill's enactment \nand be made available to the public.\n  To be clear, my amendment would not provide the Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection with any new authorities, nor require it to carry \nout the study's recommendations. It is intended as a guide for the \nBureau as it works on rules to protect consumers, notably the \nunemployed, from deceptive and predatory lending practices.\n  In California, those individuals who turn to cash advances from \npayday lenders can expect to pay roughly $15 in fees for every $100 \nthey borrow.\n  This interest rate, when expressed in terms of an annual percentage \nrate, amounts to 459 percent. While this is the maximum rate that may \nbe charged for a payday loan in California, some States, such as \nDelaware and Wisconsin, have no interest rate limit at all.\n  The maximum payday loan that can be extended to a borrower at any one \ntime in California is $300.\n  So in practical terms, a borrower wishing to take out the maximum \n$300 payday loan will pay $45 in fees just to borrow $255.\n  Often, borrowers must take out additional payday loans in order to \npay off their current debts. In 2006, approximately 450,000 borrowers \nin California made more than six back-to-back payday loans.\n  Such reliance on this form of credit can lead some working families \nto fall into a harmful spiral of debt.\n  Over 2.3 million people in California are out work and roughly \n100,000 of them have reached the 99-week maximum for receiving \nunemployment benefits.\n  The average unemployed Californian receives roughly $300 a week in \nbenefits, which is also the State's limit for a payday loan.\n  Typically, payday loans are offered as advances on paychecks and \nshould be used in cases of emergency. Such cases include falling short \non bills or rent during a difficult month.\n  However, unemployment, especially in this economy, can be long-term. \nPayday loans may not offer a sustainable solution.\n  Unemployment is one of the underlying factors contributing to the \nrise in foreclosures throughout our country. In California alone, over \n215,000 foreclosures were filed in just the first 3 months of this \nyear. In tough months, those facing the dual threat of unemployment and \nforeclosure need to access credit more than ever.\n  And now, payday lenders have made it easier for the unemployed to \nfall into a cycle of debt.\n  By offering cash advances on their primary source of income, Federal \nor State unemployment benefit checks, payday lenders are specifically \ntargeting this vulnerable group of borrowers.\n  Now is not the time to be doing this.\n  Such high loan fees are a burden for those surviving solely on their \nunemployment benefits.\n  So why is this study important?\n  Studies and reports on the effects of payday lending are already \navailable, some of which consider its benefits and others its burden to \nborrowers. But the study required by my amendment should offer much \nmore than just the pros and cons of payday lending.\n  I hope this study will determine if payday lending practices, \nincluding cash advances on unemployment checks, are useful credit \noptions for the unemployed.\n  If they provide a benefit, I hope the study's recommendations will \nmake these loans more fair and reasonable to borrowers.\n  If not, the study should review and recommend alternative credit \noptions for the unemployed.\n\n[[Page S3085]]\n\n  As I mentioned, we all agree this is not the time to be exploiting \nthe unemployed. Many of the unemployed are experiencing some desperate \nfinancial straits right now.\n  I believe policymakers should be provided with clear options to help \nimprove the financial situation for them.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, along with Senator Grassley, I am \nintroducing as an amendment to the financial reform bill, S. 3217, our \nbipartisan resolution to amend Senate rules to eliminate secret holds.\n  The legislation now before the Senate is intended to bring greater \nopenness and accountability to Wall Street and other financial \ninstitutions. At the same time the Senate is reforming how financial \nmarkets do business, there is no better time for the Senate to reform \nthe process for how the Senate conducts its own business.\n  Under current Senate rules, it is still possible for Senators to use \nsecret holds to block legislation or nominations from coming to the \nfloor without having to give any reason. There is no openness or \naccountability to anyone when a Senator places a secret hold.\n  The Senate should not have a double standard that requires greater \nopenness and accountability on Wall Street while tolerating a practice \nthat keeps both the public and colleagues in the dark with no \naccountability to anyone.\n  That is why Senator Grassley and I are offering our bipartisan \nproposal to end the practice of secret Senate holds as an amendment to \nthe financial reform bill. Because our amendment would eliminate secret \nholds by amending Senate rules, I hereby give notice of our intent to \namend the Senate rules by filing the Wyden-Grassley amendment to S. \n3217.\n  I urge colleagues to support this bipartisan reform of Senate rules.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n\n\n                    IN PRAISE OF KENNETH CONCEPCION\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to recognize the \nservice of one of America's Great Federal Employees.\n  So many of our outstanding Federal employees spend their careers in \nour uniformed services, standing at the ready to guard our liberties \nand protect lives. One of these services has a unique mission that \ncombines coastal defense, maritime search and rescue, and environmental \nprotection.\n  I am speaking about the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  The 42,000 men and women who serve in the Coast Guard embody the \nhighest principles of our nation. Their dual responsibilities in both \ncivil and military matters require Guardians to demonstrate \nflexibility, patience, and resolve.\n  This year is 95th anniversary of the Coast Guard's creation from the \nold Revenue Cutter Service. That earlier service evolved from our \nnation's first maritime force in the infant years of our republic.\n  The Federal employee I have selected to honor this week served as \nChief of U.S. Flag Deepdraft Vessels and Plan Review for the Coast \nGuard at the time of the September 11 attacks.\n  Kenneth Concepcion was based on Staten Island, within view of the \ntwin towers of the World Trade Center. On that fateful morning, Kenneth \nwas the first Coast Guard employee on the scene, arriving at New York's \nPier Eleven just 20 minutes after the collapse of the second tower.\n  What he found there was disorder and masses of frightened people with \nno way to get home. Kenneth took charge and recruited NYPD officers and \nTransportation Department officials to help him organize the crowds \ninto lines based on intended destination. He assumed control of all the \nvessels at the pier and prioritized the safe evacuation of first-\nresponders who had been injured in the attacks.\n  Thanks to Kenneth's leadership and steady hand, the Coast Guard was \nable to evacuate 70,000 people from Lower Manhattan that morning to \npoints across the Hudson River. In addition, he made sure that \ncommercial ships continued to have safe passage in and out of New York \nHarbor, keeping some of America's vital ports open for business.\n  But Kenneth's heroism doesn't end there. Two months after the \nattacks, American Airlines flight 587 crashed tragically near JFK \nairport in Queens. Kenneth served as the on-scene coordinator for the \nmaritime recovery of debris. Under his leadership, and as a result of \nhis ability to get different agencies to work well together, all \nsignificant debris from the crash was recovered in less than 2 days.\n  Our Coast Guard members, like Kenneth Concepcion, stand ever at the \nready to keep our maritime interests safe and to serve as our Nation's \nfirst line of search and rescue when disaster strikes. We rely on them \nto protect us, and I hope my colleagues will join me in thanking \nKenneth and all members of the Coast Guard for their service to our \nNation.\n  They are all truly great Federal employees.\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING KENNETH EDWARD CARFINE\n\n  Before I yield the floor, I want to note with sadness the passing of \none of my previous honorees.\n  On October 19 of last year, I stood at this desk and spoke about an \noutstanding employee from the Department of the Treasury, Kenneth \nEdward Carfine.\n  He served in the Treasury Department since 1973 and worked over the \nlast 37 years in banking, cash management, payments, check claims, and \ngovernment-wide accounting.\n  Recently, he had served under the Fiscal Assistant Secretary as an \nadviser to senior department officials. Ken's intellect and diligence \nhad been critical to the Treasury's economic recovery efforts. He \nhelped shape how the Treasury deals with debt financing, cash \nmanagement, trust fund administration, and a range of services.\n  One of his lasting legacies will be the ability to use a national \ndebit card to receive Social Security benefits--a program he helped \nimplement.\n  Kenneth Edward Carfine lost his battle to cancer last week. He is \nsurvived by his wife of over 40 years, Deborah, as well as by his two \nsons, Ken Jr. and Greg, their families, and his two granddaughters.\n  Ken worked at the Treasury Department for 37 years, and I know there \nliterally must be hundreds of Treasury employees, past and present, who \nare grieving deeply today for this incredibly fine person and dedicated \npublic servant. His passing is a great loss for all of them, the \nDepartment and for the nation he served so ably.\n  My thoughts are with his family, friends and colleagues at the \nTreasury Department, and I hope my Senate colleagues will join me in \noffering our condolences.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, with all of the trauma that is going on \nright now with the oilspill and all of the other problems that are out \nthere and, of course, the bill under consideration, I ask unanimous \nconsent that I be recognized as in morning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          EPA Lead Paint Rules\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. On April 22, a new EPA lead-based paint rule went into \neffect that has caused all kinds of serious problems, not just in my \nState of Oklahoma but throughout the country. My office has received an \nincredible number of calls and e-mails from constituents, from \nhomeowners, from contractors, to landlords, to plumbers, all trying to \nget information about a rule that, in most cases, they had never heard \nof until last week. I think everyone in this Chamber stands strongly \nbehind the intent of the rule, which is to protect women who might be \npregnant, children, and others from harmful effects of lead. With over \n20 kids and grandkids, I understand that. I appreciate the importance \nof the rule and the potential it has to future decrease lead exposure. \nBut, as even the Obama administration admits, implementation of the \nrule has been painfully slow and seriously flawed.\n  Specifically, the rule requires that renovations to homes built \nbefore 1978 that disturb more than 6 square feet of surface area have \nto be supervised by a certified renovator and conducted by a certified \nrenovation firm. In order to be certified, contractors have to submit \nan application with a fee to the\n\n[[Page S3086]]\n\nEPA and complete a training course for instruction on lead-safe \nworkplaces. Now, that sounds simple enough. There is one serious \nproblem; that is, there aren't any instructors around to certify these \npeople.\n  What is worse than that, those who violate the rule; that is, they go \nand they try to do something to their own home, if it was a home that \nwas built prior to 1978, if they violate this, they can be fined up to \n$37,500 a day. Just imagine how hysterical people are, not just in \nOklahoma but throughout the country.\n  There are not nearly enough contractors who have been certified, and \nthat is because there are far too few people certified to teach the \nclasses.\n  That is why today, with 23 cosponsors, I am introducing legislation, \nS. 3296, to remedy this implementation travesty. This bill provides \nadditional time for contractors and others to get certified so they can \nbecome qualified to go ahead and do these things and not be subjected \nto fines. It actually extends the time for a period of 1 year or until \nthe EPA can have enough people to certify people around the country so \nthat this can be done.\n  The need for the bill is on display in Oklahoma, where, until \nyesterday, no one was teaching classes publicly. Keep in mind, no one \nis teaching these classes. Yet, if they try to do any renovation, they \ncan be fined up to $37,500 a day.\n  I am pleased to hear that Metro Tech of Oklahoma City has finally \nreceived its certification from the EPA and will begin teaching classes \non May 13. I should note that because the demand is so high, they \nanticipate having full classes until July.\n  Because access to courses is so limited, renovators and contractors \ncannot be trained and they cannot pass along the benefits of their \nlead-safe work practices to homeowners and help protect pregnant women \nand children from further lead exposure. Without enough certified \nrenovators, we will simply not get the benefits this rule can provide.\n  Let me give you a couple of statistics to help illustrate the \nproblem. As of April 22--that was implementation day--the EPA had only \naccredited 204 training providers. Those providers have conducted more \nthan 6,900 courses. They trained an estimated 160,000 people in the \nconstruction and remodeling industries to use lead-safe work practices. \nThis is far too few people to ensure everyone who works on a pre-1978 \nhome, including roofers, plumbers, painters, general contractors, or \njust individual homeowners, can have access to training to get \ncertification they have to have.\n  Let me share with you a few examples from Oklahoma.\n  Paul Kane, executive vice president and CEO of the Home Builders \nAssociation of Greater Tulsa, was in my office with a number of \nOklahoma homebuilders the day before the rule was implemented. That \nwould have been April 21. During our meeting, I was pleased that Cass \nSunstein, head of the Obama administration's Office of Information and \nRegulatory Affairs, was available to hear from my constituents about \ntheir concerns with the rule.\n  As the Tulsa World reported:\n\n       Kane explained the difficulty local contractors are having \n     in getting certified, adding that only one trainer in the \n     entire State of Oklahoma has been certified, and that that \n     person has been certified only a few weeks. Moreover, he told \n     Sunstein, that person is not offering training to the public \n     but is limiting his classes to his own organization.\n\n  So we have one guy who can teach these classes in the State of \nOklahoma. Yet there are literally thousands out there who are out of \nwork until such time as they can go back and start working again.\n  I really appreciate the fact that Mr. Sunstein was listening to the \nconcerns of my Oklahoma constituents. He told us he recognized that the \nimplementation of the rule was causing economic hardship. He raised the \npossibility of providing a 60-day delay to help sort out of some of the \nimplementation problems. In the end, however, this option was not \nworkable, and we simply ran out of options to stop the rule from going \ninto effect. Now, that was the day before the rule became finalized. \nBut we certainly appreciate his attention, looking into it, and we are \ngoing to try to work with his staff.\n  My staff also spoke with a property owner who rents homes to low-\nincome residents in Tulsa. He has been unable to get contractors out to \nhis properties to replace carpet or even paint because they do not have \nEPA certification, which means they can get fined by the agency if they \nwork without it. So it is no surprise that my constituent is concerned \nthat his housing units could fall into disrepair and that people would \nlose their access to affordable housing--not not only losing access to \naffordable housing but exposing people to lead paint.\n\n  Additionally, we heard from a painter in Oklahoma City who has \nexperienced delays in getting trained for the simple reason that his \ntrainer has not yet been certified by the EPA. This issue reaches far \nbeyond Oklahoma. There are a number of Senators, Republicans and \nDemocrats, who have expressed concerns about the implementation of the \nrule. Several Members weighed in before the rule went into effect. \nSenators Byron Dorgan and Kent Conrad of North Dakota and a bipartisan \ngroup of Members of the House of Representatives sent a letter \noutlining these concerns to the EPA.\n  During a recent EPW subcommittee hearing, Senator Amy Klobuchar urged \nthe EPA to come up with a solution that will ensure contractors have \nthe opportunity to come into compliance with this rule. We are talking \nabout everybody, Members of the House, the Senate, Democrats, \nRepublicans. They are all affected the same.\n  The issue has also been raised before the Senate Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. In testimony before the committee on March 11, Bob \nHanbury, speaking on behalf of the National Association of Home \nBuilders, raised concerns about potential conflicts between Homestar \nand the lead rule. Members may recall that Homestar is one of President \nObama's signature issues. It is a program that helps homeowners \nincrease the energy efficiency of their homes. But Mr. Hanbury believes \nthe lead rule won't allow the Star program to move forward.\n  As we can see, there were plenty of concerns raised about the lead \nrule implementation before it went into effect. Nevertheless, EPA \nrepeatedly said, in the 2-year period leading up to the rule, that it \ncould meet these implementation challenges. As the ranking member of \nthe committee with jurisdiction over the EPA, I wrote to the EPA two \ntimes that I believed EPA appeared to be far from prepared. In both \ncases, EPA said they were ready. In a June 3, 2009 letter responding to \nmy concerns, the EPA wrote:\n\n       I agree that both EPA and the regulated community have a \n     great deal of preparation in front of us as we approach next \n     April's deadline. I am confident, however, that the ten \n     months between now and April of 2010 will allow us to meet \n     these deadlines.\n\n  That was a year ago. Of course, it didn't happen.\n  In a letter dated December 1, 2009, EPA wrote me explaining:\n\n       We are confident there will be enough training providers to \n     meet the demand. EPA does not plan to revise the April 2010 \n     effective date [for the] rule.\n\n  The EPA also stated in the letter:\n\n       Currently, the capacity for training is in excess of the \n     demand as several training courses have been canceled for \n     lack of attendance.\n\n  What they are saying is they have been providing all these people, \nbut it is just flat not true. In light of this situation, what can \nlawmakers do to help provide guidance for constituents back home?\n  First and foremost, we have to get out the word. I have raised the \nissue both in my travel around Oklahoma and on Oklahoma radio. Last \nweek I sent out a ``Dear Colleague'' letter to all Senators with \ninformation to help them navigate the confusion associated with the \nrule's implementation. Included are Web links to EPA's Web site which \ntake constituents to important information about the lead rule as well \nas the rule itself. It also provides a link to the EPA and the Ad \nCouncil's new Web site, www. Leadfreekids.org, which is a consumer \nfriendly Web page with information on protecting yourself from lead. I \nwish also to commend the coverage of the rule by the Tulsa World. The \npaper's reporting has informed the public and even resulted in more \nclasses being taught throughout Oklahoma.\n  Further, along with Senator Coburn and some 23 of my fellow Senators, \nI\n\n[[Page S3087]]\n\nhave introduced S. 3296 to delay the implementation of the rule by \nseveral months, giving contractors, trainers, and the EPA breathing \nroom to get more people through classes. The EPA has said the people \nhave had a year to get ready for this rule. However, the first training \nclass wasn't even held until June 16, 2009. Renovation firms could not \napply for certification until October of last year. Our bill would \ndelay the implementation and give people time to comply with this.\n  This is in a way bureaucracy at its worst. We say we are going to \ndemand that no one is going to be able to do something to their very \nown home if it disturbs as much as 6 square feet. And if they do, they \ncould be fined $37,500 a day. Imagine how frightening that is. Yet they \ndon't have enough instructors to teach people to be certificated. This \nis one we have to address.\n  I think the only thing we can do right now is to get an extension. \nThat is what I am doing with this Senate bill. I certainly call on my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans. The problem I am pointing out in \nOklahoma is not just in Oklahoma; it is in all States. We will have to \naddress this thing, get something done, or we have a lot of risk out \nthere. We have children and pregnant women who could be at risk of \nexposure to lead and lead paint. Of course, one of the things that is \nalmost as bad is the fact that we have literally, only in Oklahoma, \nthousands of people out of work because they cannot do renovation. Most \nof the homes they deal with are pre-1978. It is something that will \nhave to be dealt with. I certainly encourage others to join the cause \nto relieve us of this problem. The rule will affect more than 70 \nmillion homes. The implementation of this rule to date has been a \ndisaster. Congress will have to ensure that enough people are trained \nand certified. That way, the rule can do what it is supposed to do--\nprotect the health of young people and pregnant women.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am forever amazed at my friends on the \nother side of the aisle. They have clearly established themselves as \nthe party of no. America knows that. But what they have done on this \nbill dealing with Wall Street reform is hard to comprehend. We started \non this bill a week before last. We filed cloture on it. On Monday, we \nhad a cloture vote last week; Tuesday, a cloture vote last week; \nWednesday, a cloture vote last week. Finally, they said: OK, we don't \nneed any more cloture votes. Let's start legislating on the bill.\n  Tomorrow is Wednesday. It has been a week. Nothing has happened. Why? \nBecause the party of no says no to everything we try. Listen to this \none. This is something. They will not let us vote on amendments the \nRepublicans have offered and amendments we have agreed to they would \nnot let us vote on.\n\n  I came to the floor of the Senate today to let everyone know the \nfrustration the American people must feel and the frustration many \npeople feel in the Senate as a result of the party of no continually \ndoing what they are doing. I want to make sure everyone understands the \nfacts in more detail than what I have given.\n  On Thursday, April 15, Wall Street reform legislation was introduced \nand placed on the Legislative Calendar. Thursday, April 22, I sought \nconsent to proceed to that bill. The Republicans objected, and I was \nforced to file cloture. I don't want to get into a lot of the \nprocedural problems we have, but remember, the Republicans have caused \nus to file cloture almost 100 times this Congress. So everyone \nunderstands, it is more than just a word--``filibustering.'' That is \nwhat they have done almost 100 times.\n  I moved to the bill. They would not let me--I had taken it off the \ncalendar and tried to bring it to the floor. They said no. I had to \nfile a motion signed by 17 or 18 Senators. It took 2 days for that to \nripen before we could vote on it. Once we voted on it and we got \ncloture, they got another 30 hours. So in this instance, they had a new \ngame.\n  They said: Go ahead and move to the bill. We are not going to use the \n30 hours. We are going to use a week. We have done nothing for a week \nwaiting for this phantom amendment they think is floating around here \nsomeplace, this so-called Shelby amendment.\n  Monday, April 26, when my cloture motion had ripened, we failed to \nget cloture 57 to 41. We did some other things--moved to reconsider, \nsome parliamentary maneuvers so we could get this bill moving along. \nTuesday, April 27, cloture failed, 57 to 41, the same vote as the day \nbefore. Wednesday, April 28, cloture vote failed, 56 to 42. One of \ntheir Members, I guess, was gone or maybe somebody switched a vote. I \nreally don't know. Remember, each time I voted on the prevailing side. \nI had to change my vote so I could move to reconsider.\n  So on April 28, after the cloture vote failed, they said: OK, we give \nup. You can start legislating for the American people. But that wasn't \nbeing fair and square with the American people. They had no intention \nof doing that. They are stalling on everything we do. We know they have \nsaid publicly they want health care to be Obama's Waterloo.\n  So just to be very clear, we were ready to start debate on this last \nMonday--actually, frankly, the Thursday before that. Even though we \nwere able to overcome the objections to begin this debate, we now find \nmany of the same parties are preventing us from making any progress on \nthis important legislation.\n  One Senator I saw quoted in the newspaper last week said I had \nstopped--I had told that person I was going to move to a certain bill--\na Republican Senator--and that Senator said: He hasn't done that. I \nwrote that person a letter today going over the long list of \nfilibusters to prevent us from moving to that and many other pieces of \nlegislation.\n  We haven't had a single vote on this legislation, not a single vote. \nPeople are waiting around on both sides, I am told, to offer \namendments. We can't get votes on even the amendments we have agreed to \nand one Senator Snowe has offered.\n  We have to finish this legislation. We have provisions that are \nexpiring at the end of this month that are extremely important. A jobs \nbill--the expiring provisions and all the stuff we have put in that \nbill that we passed once before are extremely important to our country \nand will create lots and lots of jobs. But we can't get to that because \nof what is going on here. Food safety--we can't get to that. Why? \nBecause the Republicans are stopping us from moving to anything.\n  I had a conference call just from the sparsely populated State of \nNevada with a few of the people who have suffered terrible injuries as \na result of eating contaminated food.\n  One little girl has missed a year of school. Her growth is stunted. \nPeople have spent--one woman I talked to--or I talked to her husband \nbecause they were getting first aid. They went home. She had been in \nthe hospital for months and months from eating contaminated food. We \nare trying to do something about that. We can't do that. It is a \nbipartisan bill. It is nothing the Democrats are trying to jam down the \nthroats of the Republicans. They won't let us move to anything.\n  Scores of nominations. The House has passed more than 300 measures \nthat are stuck over here because the Republicans won't let us move to \nthem, measures in years passed that would pass by unanimous consent.\n  I hope everyone understands. I know my caucus understands what is \ngoing on, but I hope the Republicans will accept reality and understand \nwhy we are not going to have all of the amendments they want to offer \nbe able to be offered. We are not going to be on the bill that long. We \ncan't be. We are trying to do something with this legislation that will \nchange America forever for the better. What has happened as a result of \nWall Street doing business not in the shadows but in the dark of night, \nthe blackest dark you could ever see is where they have been doing \ntheir work, causing people in Colorado, in Nevada, and all over this \ncountry to suffer irreparable damage. People have lost their homes, \ntheir jobs as a result of what went on in Wall Street, the shady deals \nthat are worse than any illegal\n\n[[Page S3088]]\n\ngambling game that was ever conducted in America. That is what they \nwere doing up there: betting our money--our money. If they win, they \nkeep our money. If they lose, they want more of our money. We are \ntrying to stop that. That is what this legislation is all about. This \nis a good bill.\n  Obviously, from the shenanigans the Republicans have performed on \nthis legislation, they don't want us to do anything about Wall Street \nreform; otherwise, they wouldn't have done all of these efforts to stop \nus from moving to the bill. We want to hold Wall Street accountable. We \nwant to end taxpayer bailouts. We want to guarantee the taxpayers will \nnever again be forced to bail out reckless Wall Street. We want to end \ntoo big to fail, restrict new capital and leverage requirements to \nprevent firms from becoming too big to fail.\n  As I said before, and I say again: We want to bring sunlight and \ntransparency to these shadowy markets where Wall Street executives make \ngambles that threaten our entire economy, the same laws that are in \neffect basically today that were in effect when Wall Street crashed and \ncaused us all this harm. We are trying to change that so it can't \nhappen again. We want to rein in these big shots who have unlimited \ncontrol of money and get these huge bonuses--not bonuses of $50,000, \nwhich is huge in most people's lives, but they get bonuses in the \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  We want to protect consumers. We want to put a new cop on the beat, a \nconsumer protection entity that will look at all of these different \nfinancial shenanigans that are going on. We want to make sure people \nwho get something in the mail from--however they get it. They take them \nout and they look at it, they can't understand it. We want it in plain, \nsimple English so the American people can understand what they are \nbeing asked to sign. We want to protect consumers from these hidden \nfees, abusive terms, and deceptive practices that are running rampant \nin America.\n  So despite the party of no saying no again and again, we are going to \nbe patient and do our best to work through this. Chairman Dodd is \nworking with, it seems, this never-ending amendment the ranking member \nwants. It has been weeks and weeks. Remember, there have been \nnegotiations going on in this matter for months--not weeks, not days--\nmonths. I guess the Republicans are saying, until that amendment comes, \nthere is not going to be anything else happening on this bill. That is \nthe decision they have made. They won't even let us set amendments \naside and move to amendments that are agreed upon.\n  There is only so much I can do--we can do--in the face of determined \nobstructionism that is so clearly the brand the Republicans have now.\n  I yield the floor, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor the memories of St. \nVincent DePaul and St. Louise de Marillac and to note their legacy on \nDePaul University in Chicago. This year DePaul is marking the 350th \nanniversary of the deaths of St. Vincent and St. Louise.\n  Providing access to social services such as health care and \neducation, St. Vincent and St. Louise attended to the needs of those \nafflicted by poverty, illness, and injustice in the 17th century. St. \nVincent DePaul and St. Louise de Marillac dedicated their lives to \nserving the underprivileged. It was by their example that the \nVincentians founded DePaul University in Chicago, Illinois in 1898.\n  DePaul University was established with a fundamental mission centered \non service and civic engagement, ensuring academic excellence, \nproviding access to affordable education, and promoting respect for the \ndignity of all persons. The spirit of St. Vincent and St. Louise lives \nadmirably in the University's traditions. Since its founding, DePaul \nhas been a home for students struggling to attain their dreams for \nhigher education. Historically, DePaul has educated many students who \nwould have otherwise seen the door to college closed for them. DePaul \nwas one of the first universities to admit female students in a coed \nsetting. The university also has a long and distinguished history of \nproviding an education to first-generation college students and \nchildren of immigrants.\n  Today, DePaul is one of the largest and most diverse private \ninstitutions in the Nation. The student body of over 25,000 represents \na wide variety of religious, geographical, ethnic, and economic \nbackgrounds that honor the memory of St. Vincent and St. Louise. And \nDePaul passes the noble tradition of serving others on to its students. \nStudents at DePaul live the legacy of St. Vincent and St. Louise when \nthey participate in community service through a variety of university-\nwide programs, including the annual Vincentian Service Day.\n  The year 2010 marks the 350th anniversary of the deaths of St. \nVincent and St. Louise. Today, a commitment to service and a \ncelebration of diversity is more important than ever before in our \nNation. DePaul embodies these goals. The University continues to \npromote socially responsible leadership in its students and upholds its \nVincentian mission to make education accessible for all students \nregardless of family background or financial means.\n  Mr. President, I commend DePaul's celebration of the 350th \nanniversary of St. Vincent and St. Louise and praise their continuing \npursuit of excellence in higher education.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3088-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3088-S3089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MEDICARE DIABETES SELF-MANAGEMENT TRAINING ACT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Medicare \nDiabetes Self-Management Training Act, a bill I have recently \nintroduced along with Senators Stabenow, Hagan, Franken and Landrieu. \nThis bill will improve the lives of Medicare beneficiaries with \ndiabetes by improving their access to high quality information and care \nfrom certified diabetes educators.\n  Diabetes affects many individuals and families in New Hampshire and \nacross the country. My own family was touched by the disease in 2007 \nwhen my eldest granddaughter Elle was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. \nWe have experienced firsthand the challenges that diabetics and their \nfamilies confront in having to continuously monitor and manage blood \nsugar levels, administer daily injections, and face a lifetime of \nworrying about the possibility of serious complications arising from \nthe disease. Diabetes can be managed effectively but it requires a \nsustained coordinated team effort among patients and their health care \nproviders. Certified diabetes educators, as defined by the American \nAssociation of Diabetes Educators, ``are licensed healthcare \nprofessionals who specialize in educating people with diabetes about \ntheir condition. The training, counseling and support that diabetes \neducators provide to patients is known as diabetes education or \ndiabetes self-management training.'' This education teaches patients \nhow to stay healthy, and the diabetes educator is an important part of \nthe health care team.\n  Take for example a case from Raymond, NH. The patient, Rachel, is 45 \nyears old and has type 2 diabetes. For years she struggled, trying to \nunderstand how her eating habits and lack of physical activity \nnegatively impacted her diabetes and general health. Her medical \nprovider followed all the appropriate American Diabetes Association \nguidelines, tried several oral medications and insulin, but in spite of \nthis, Rachel's diabetes remained poorly controlled. In fact, not only \nwere her blood sugar levels elevated, but she was already starting to \nsuffer from complications related to diabetes.\n  However, once Rachel began working with a certified diabetes \neducator, CDE, things started turning around. The CDE was able to \nassess and accommodate Rachel's individual learning style and barriers \nto change. Through ongoing support and positive reinforcement, Rachel \nbegan to recognize her ability to control her diabetes with a few \nlifestyle changes. Successful, long-\n\n[[Page S3089]]\n\nterm behavior change is difficult to achieve in the best of \ncircumstances. One only has to look at the current obesity epidemic in \nthe U.S. to appreciate the difficulty in learning how to eat healthily. \nRachel's success in eating less and healthier and walking daily was due \nin large part to the relationship that developed between her and her \ndiabetes educator. Rachel now understood the lifestyle changes \nnecessary to achieve success and was able to bring her blood sugar into \na safe range. She reported having more energy and was able to cut her \ninsulin dose in half.\n  Over the years Congress has made strong efforts to improve the care \nof individuals with diabetes. This includes authorizing the diabetes \nself-management training, DSMT, as a Medicare benefit in 1997, with the \ngoal of providing a more comprehensive level of support to educate \nbeneficiaries about diabetes and self-management techniques, reduce the \nknown risks and complications of diabetes, and improve overall health \noutcomes.\n  However, there is a significant gap in the 1997 DSMT benefit that \nholds it back from achieving its full potential. Under the DSMT, \nMedicare covers the critical types of health care services necessary \nfor diabetes control, but does not recognize the health care \nprofessionals who deliver those services. Certified diabetes educators \nare the primary group of health care professionals who work most \nclosely with the patient to provide essential training and education in \ndiabetes self-management. My legislation is designed to address this \ngap by ensuring that certified diabetes educators are designated \nproviders under Medicare for these vitally important services.\n  Under the Medicare Diabetes Self-Management Training Act, a certified \ndiabetes educator would be a covered provider of Medicare DSMT \nservices. This health care professional, who is State licensed or \nregistered, is most typically a nurse, dietician, or pharmacist, who \nspecializes in teaching people with diabetes how to stay healthy and \nwho maintains rigorous certification and continuing education \ncredentials. This bill also increases education and outreach to primary \ncare physicians about the importance of DSMT for their patients with \ndiabetes. I am proud to have introduced this bill along with my \ncolleagues Senators Stabenow, Franken, Hagan and Landrieu.\n  Diabetes is an incredibly costly disease. It is among the chief \ncontributing causes of adult blindness, lower extremity amputations, \nheart disease, periodontal disease, kidney disease, vascular disease \nand infections. There is no cure yet but with the proper tools it can \nbe well managed and complications can be prevented. I believe this bill \nis an important step along that path. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important cause.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3089-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3089]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Sergeant Michael K. Ingram\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto honor the life and heroic service of Sergeant Michael K. Ingram, Jr. \nSergeant Ingram, a member of the 1st Battalion, 12th Infantry Regiment, \n4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, CO, died on April 17, 2010. \nSergeant Ingram was serving in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in \nKandahar, Afghanistan. He was killed by injuries sustained when an \nimprovised explosive device detonated while he was on patrol. He was 23 \nyears old.\n  A native of Monroe, MI, Sergeant Ingram moved to Fort Carson when he \nwas assigned to the 4th Infantry Division. Sergeant Ingram joined the \nArmy in February 2006, and he was deployed to Afghanistan in May 2009.\n  During over 4 years of service, Sergeant Ingram distinguished himself \nthrough his courage, dedication to duty, and willingness to take on any \nchallenge--no matter how dangerous. Commanders recognized his \nextraordinary bravery and talent, bestowing on Sergeant Ingram numerous \nawards and medals, including the Army Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Bronze \nService Star, the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, the Army \nService Ribbon, and the Overseas Service Ribbon.\n  Sergeant Ingram worked on the front lines of battle, patrolling the \nmost dangerous areas of Kandahar. He is remembered by those who knew \nhim as a consummate professional with an unending commitment to \nexcellence. Family and friends remember him for his smile and his \ncommitment to service. After sustaining a mild injury, Sergeant Ingram \nwas recently offered a chance to come home for surgery. He chose to \nstay with his unit and finish out his service. He planned on pursuing a \ncareer in law enforcement after his time in the Army.\n  Mark Twain once said, ``The fear of death follows from the fear of \nlife. A man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time.'' Sergeant \nIngram's service was in keeping with this sentiment--by selflessly \nputting country first, he lived life to the fullest. He lived with a \nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n  At substantial personal risk, he braved the chaos of combat zones \nthroughout Afghanistan. And though his fate on the battlefield was \nuncertain, he pushed forward, protecting America's citizens, her \nsafety, and the freedoms we hold dear. For his service and the lives he \ntouched, Sergeant Ingram will forever be remembered as one of our \ncountry's bravest.\n  To Sergeant Ingram's mother Patricia, his father Michael, and all his \nfriends and family I cannot imagine the sorrow you must be feeling. I \nhope that, in time, the pain of your loss will be eased by your pride \nin Michael's service and by your knowledge that his country will never \nforget him. We are humbled by his service and his sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3089-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3089-S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         NATIONAL TEACHERS DAY\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as I am sure many of my colleagues are \naware, today is National Teachers Day, and this week is Teacher \nAppreciation week--an opportunity to recognize and celebrate the \nenormous contributions made by America's educators at every level.\n  The work they do--and the impact they have--can hardly be overstated.\n  Teachers are charged with helping to shape young minds, and providing \nour students with the tools and inspiration that will lead them to \nsuccess at every level of our global society.\n  This work could not be more important. Our educators truly impact \neternity.\n  But, as I address this Chamber today, they face a climate that is \nincreasingly inhospitable to their work, and their goals.\n  Studies show that today's teachers are more experienced and more \neducated than ever.\n  Almost half of all public school teachers hold at least a master's \ndegree, and more than 75 percent regularly participate in professional \ndevelopment programs.\n  Yet every single year we ask these dedicated professionals to work \nlonger hours for less pay.\n  And in some cases we even expect them to spend their own hard-earned \nmoney to provide school supplies for their students.\n  This is unacceptable. We can--and we must--do better.\n  At every stage in my career, I have raised my voice on behalf of \nAmerica's students and educators.\n  Today, on National Teachers Day, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nthis call to action.\n  We need to step up our investment in America's future, and provide \nour educators with the support they need.\n  We need to meet competence and dedication with gratitude, fair pay, \nand adequate classroom resources.\n  And we need to do so without delay.\n  Because, if we fail to keep these commitments, if we fail to provide \nthe support our educators need, we will lose quality educators and the \ninvaluable services they provide.\n  In my home State of Illinois, roughly 9,000 public school teachers \nhave received layoff notices this year.\n  And as many as 300,000 will lose their jobs nationwide.\n  This will result in more crowded classrooms, less individual \nattention for students who need it, reduced access to extracurricular \nprograms, and a school faculty and staff that is increasingly stretched \nthin.\n  I invite my colleagues to consider the impact these massive layoffs \nwill have on our students.\n  I invite them to think of the consequences for America's future.\n\n[[Page S3090]]\n\n  We cannot let this stand.\n  That is why I am proud to be an original cosponsor of S. 3206--the \nKeep Our Educators Working Act, which I have introduced with my good \nfriend Senator Harkin.\n  This legislation would create a $23 billion Education Jobs Fund, \nwhich would help provide resources to states and local districts that \nare finding it hard to make ends meet.\n  This money would be used to retain current educators, hire new ones, \nand provide important on-the-job training activities to those in \neducation-related careers.\n  It would keep good teachers where they belong: in the classroom--and \nwould help to close the budget gap that currently threatens to leave \nmany school districts high and dry.\n  So I urge my colleagues in this Chamber to support this bill, and \nmake education a priority again.\n  Let us give teachers and students the support they need--so we can \nrecruit the best teachers, fund afterschool programs, and keep more \nschools open.\n  I applaud President Obama for his unwavering commitment to our \neducation system. And today, I call upon him to follow through on that \ncommitment.\n  To work with my colleagues and I, on both sides of the aisle, to pass \nthe Education Jobs Fund Act, reinvest in our schools, and make sure \nthat America's future is secure.\n  And I would ask that they join with me in celebrating the dedication \nand hard work of our teachers--without whom none of us would be where \nwe are today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3090-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING RABBI GEDALIAH ANEMER\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to take this \nopportunity to honor Rabbi Gedaliah Anemer, a beloved Orthodox Jewish \nleader and scholar who passed away at age 78 on April 15, 2010.\n  For more than 50 years, Rabbi Anemer served as a religious guide, \ncompassionate counselor, and an authority on Jewish practices and laws \nto his Silver Spring congregation. His leadership and spiritualism \nhelped to nurture a strong, vibrant Orthodox Jewish community in the \nGreater Washington area and strengthened his congregants' love of \nJudaism and connection to Israel. He also founded the Yeshiva of \nGreater Washington in Silver Spring, helping to educate a future \ngeneration of Jewish spiritual leaders.\n  Rabbi Anemer was born in Akron, OH, in 1932 and studied as a boy at \nthe Tiferes Yerushalayim in New York. In 1952, he was ordained from the \nTelshe Yeshiva. For the 5 years following his ordination, Rabbi Anemer \nwas the head of the Yeshiva of the Boston Rabbinical Seminary. In 1957, \nhe became spiritual leader of a small congregation in Washington, DC, \nShomrei Emunah. In 1961, the synagogue was renamed Young Israel Shomrei \nEmunah of Greater Washington, YISE, and later moved to Silver Spring, \nbecoming the first Orthodox synagogue in Montgomery County.\n  In Silver Spring, Rabbi Anemer and YISE became a ``cornerstone'' of \nthe Kemp Mill Orthodox community. Rabbi Anemer's energy and enthusiasm \nfor his congregants, for his neighbors, and for the Jewish people could \nbe observed in his daily endeavors: Holding minyon in his basement, \nleading services for his congregation, presiding as the head of the \nRabbinical Council of Greater Washington's beit din, or religious \ncourt, and acting as a mentor and confidant to his community.\n  Under his leadership, YISE flourished. The shul originally started by \nholding services in private homes. As it grew, YISE moved to a number \nof different locations--a clubhouse, the basement of an apartment \nbuilding, a condemned house awaiting demolition, and a Masonic \nbuilding--before settling into its own, newly constructed building. \nServices were held in Hebrew and English because the majority of the \ncongregation's participants were scientists and engineers who did not \nhave a Yeshiva education. Rabbi Anemer also sponsored a number of \nJewish learning activities including children's services, Talmud night, \nand regular adult education classes. He became the spiritual leader of \na congregation that grew from 30 families in 1963 to more than 500 \nfamilies today.\n  Rabbi Anemer wore many hats in his career and in his personal life. \nHe was a loving husband, a devoted father to four children, a caring \nbrother, and a fiercely compassionate friend. I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in remembering the many accomplishments of Rabbi Gedaliah \nAnemer and in recognizing him as a pioneer and friend to the Jewish \nOrthodox community of the Greater Washington area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3090-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO KEVIN MANNING\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I pay special tribute to the \noutstanding accomplishments of Kevin J. Manning, Ph.D., president of \nStevenson University. May 21, 2010, is Commencement Day at Stevenson \nUniversity, a day when student accomplishments are rewarded and \nrecognized. This year's Commencement Day also marks the end of Kevin J. \nManning's 10th year as president of Stevenson University.\n  During Dr. Manning's 10 years as president, the university has \ntransitioned itself from a liberal arts college to a university that \nemphasizes a core liberal arts curriculum and has a unique focus on \ncareer preparation. Stevenson University students are well prepared and \nhave a strong record of excelling in academics, community service, and \npostgraduate work.\n  With Dr. Manning's guidance, Stevenson University has seen tremendous \nsuccess and growth. In recent years, the university has had seen record \nlevels of enrollment, the opening of a second campus in Owings Mills, \nand the opening of a new School of Business and Leadership in 2008.\n  Dr. Manning has provided critical guidance to the development of the \nuniversity's Career Architecture Program, for which he received the \nMaryland Innovator of the Year Award from the Daily Record in September \n2003. The Career Architecture Program provides career guidance and \ncounseling to undergraduate students at Stevenson University.\n  Dr. Manning also has been committed to the community surrounding \nStevenson University. He sits on the board of directors of numerous \ncommunity and professional organizations, including the United Way of \nCentral Maryland, the Independent College Fund of Maryland, the Greater \nBaltimore Committee, the Maryland Chamber of Commerce, and the Maryland \nBusiness Roundtable for Education.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in applauding Kevin J. Manning for his \noutstanding accomplishments at Stevenson University and for his \ndedication to his students and colleagues, to higher education, and to \nthe larger community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3090-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3090-S3091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO JOHN TAYLOR\n\n Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, last week, at an event of the \nDelaware Chapter of Common Cause, I had the pleasure of introducing the \nrecipient of their prestigious Open Government Award, John Taylor.\n  It is hard to believe that it has been 40 years since I saw John \nTaylor on TV and signed up as an original member of Common Cause. It \nhas been a great ride for Common Cause and especially for its Delaware \nchapter.\n  My home State's chapter of Common Cause is known for its efforts to \nhold the government accountable and make sure that it is as ethical and \ntransparent as possible. Admittedly, I am biased, but I know that the \ngroup is doing a great job. From tackling campaign finance reform to \nelection reform, the members are working on the tough but important \nissues.\n  From the beginning they have had excellent people on board who know \nhow to get the job done. I am not the only one who thinks this. In a \nFebruary 2010 article in the News Journal, their group was termed the \n``Who's Who of academia, business and government.'' John Taylor truly \nbelongs on the ``Who's Who'' list for Delaware, and Common Cause's \nselection of him for its Open Government Award could not have been more \nappropriate.\n  Most Delawareans know John from his 22-year stint as editorial page \neditor at the News Journal. It was obligatory in Delaware to see what \nJohn Taylor had to say each week--and he did it in 700 words or fewer.\n  John is a traditional journalist in many ways, starting his career as \na\n\n[[Page S3091]]\n\nfreshman reporter in 1966. He fought to get to the bottom of the story, \npaid close attention to the details, and possessed that sixth sense to \nknow where the real stories lie. But he also took time away from the \nnewsroom to pursue his other passion of education.\n  From the late 1960s to the early 1970s, he served as assistant to the \nsuperintendent of the Wilmington Public Schools. Before joining the \nnewspaper business, he taught English and history at St. Mary's \nSecondary School in Tilbury, England.\n  His awards and honors are too many to name here, but he has received \nthe Helen Wise Friend of Education Award from the Delaware State \nEducation Association and four Mark Twain Awards for column writing \nfrom the Associated Press. He was also the 1999 recipient of the \nChairman's Award from the United Way of Delaware.\n  After a triumphant and successful career in the news business, John \nfound another calling in the realm of public policy and government. \nToday, he is a senior vice president of the Delaware State Chamber of \nCommerce and executive director of the Delaware Public Policy \nInstitute. He is the driving force behind Vision 2015, and the children \nof Delaware will have increased opportunities because of his efforts.\n  It only makes sense that, after decades of writing and following \npolitics, he would pick up a thing or two. I am pleased to see that his \nskills are being well used at a center that promotes the discussion of \npolicies, programs, and issues affecting the State of Delaware.\n  The entire Delaware community has profited from John's efforts. From \nhis serving on the Delaware Community Foundation Board of Directors and \nthe Christiana Care Board of Trustees, to the boards of environmental, \nhealth, community, and educational groups, John has been an advocate \nfor some of the most important issues of our day. He did not just write \nabout what was or wasn't happening, although that is important: he has \nalso pitched in to create positive headlines on his own terms.\n  John Taylor undoubtedly deserves his most recent honor of the Open \nGovernment Award. In his long and distinguished career, he has written \nabout those in government, held their feet to the fire, and followed up \nto make sure that they were held accountable. He has taught tomorrow's \nleaders, interviewed the movers and shakers of yesterday, and now \ninforms the policy makers in our day.\n  I extend my congratulations to the national Common Cause organization \non the occasion of its 40th anniversary and to John Taylor for his \nachievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/04/senate-section/article/S3091-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 3:27 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 3714.

    \n\n[Pages S3093-S3099]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Isakson, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3297. A bill to update United States policy and authorities to \nhelp advance a genuine transition to democracy and to promote recovery \nin Zimbabwe; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nZimbabwe Transition to Democracy and Economic Recovery Act with Senator \nIsakson and Senator Kerry. This legislation aims to update U.S. policy \nand to provide the necessary direction and flexibility for the United \nStates to proactively push for democracy and economic recovery in \nZimbabwe. In September 2008, the parties in Zimbabwe signed the Global \nPolitical Agreement, the GPA, and committed to work together to chart a \nnew political direction for the country. Unfortunately, that commitment \nhas not yet been fulfilled and political and human rights abuses \ncontinue at a disturbing rate. Nonetheless, the GPA and the formation \nof the transitional government have created new political realities and \nrealignment in Zimbabwe, and subsequently, new opportunities to push \nfor a genuine transition to democracy and for economic recovery. The \nUnited States and other international stakeholders can seize those \nopportunities by supporting reformers, while renewing and ramping up \npressure on those who obstruct implementation of the GPA. Our bill aims \nto promote such a dynamic approach.\n  We are all familiar with the tragic story of Zimbabwe's descent. \nZimbabwe was one of Africa's most prosperous countries, a major food \nproducer and home to the continent's best education system. Its leader \nRobert Mugabe was considered one of the great liberation leaders of \nsouthern Africa. Yet over time, Mugabe and his regime moved to tighten \ntheir grip on power, using increasingly violent tactics to stop the \npolitical opposition, stifle independent media, and take over private \nproperty. The results, particularly in the last decade, have been \ndisastrous. Mugabe has presided over the collapse of Zimbabwe's economy \nand a dramatic decline in the living conditions of his people. At the \nend of 2008, Zimbabwe's economy reached a low point with world-record \ninflation, millions of people at risk of starvation, and unemployment \nover 90 percent. Meanwhile, Mugabe and his party have had to resort to \nincreasing violence to repress the will of the people. Most recently, \nfollowing the March 2008 election, the Mugabe regime and its cronies \nlaunched a brutal campaign of violence against members and supporters \nof the opposition MDC after Morgan Tsvangirai won the first round of \nvoting.\n  I have closely followed the situation in Zimbabwe since 1999 when I \ntraveled to Harare and witnessed then the early stages of this \npolitical crisis. During that trip, I also met some incredibly dynamic, \ncommitted and inspiring civil society leaders. Upon returning, I said \non the Senate floor that we must not abandon these leaders; that the \ninternational community should move to arrest Zimbabwe's descent before \nit became more complex. I teamed up then with Senator Bill Frist to \nauthor legislation on U.S. policy toward Zimbabwe.\n\n[[Page S3094]]\n\nAnd in 2001, President Bush signed that legislation, the Zimbabwe \nDemocracy and Economic Recovery Act, into law. ZDERA, as that bill is \nknown, placed restrictions on U.S. support for any new international \nloan, credit or debt reduction for Zimbabwe until the President \ncertifies that a number of political conditions have been met, namely \nan end to abuses and the restoration of rule of law. The bill also \ncalled for targeted sanctions against individuals responsible for \npolitically motivated violence.\n  At the same time, ZDERA also spelled out the United States' \ncommitment to the Zimbabwean people in their struggle to effect \npeaceful and democratic change. And it stated our commitment to be a \nstrong partner in helping the Zimbabwean people to rebuild their \ncountry when that change was achieved. I have not given up on that \ncommitment, despite the Mugabe regime's relentless and violent efforts \nto hold onto power. In 2002, I tried to return to the country, but my \nvisa was revoked and the government blocked my entry into the country. \nIn 2003, I traveled to South Africa and Botswana, in part to discuss \nthe crisis in Zimbabwe and the regional consequences. Most recently, in \n2008 and 2009, in my capacity as the Chairman of the Africa \nSubcommittee, I have held hearings specifically on Zimbabwe and U.S. \npolicy options.\n  With the signing of the GPA, I was skeptical that Robert Mugabe and \nhis allies had any real intention to share power and respect the \nagreement. I remain skeptical as at almost every turn, hardliners in \nthe transitional government have resisted any moves that would \nundermine their historic patronage system and power structures. Mugabe \nhas refused to implement several parts of the agreement, continuing to \nuse Western sanctions as a scapegoat. Meanwhile, state security forces \nremain largely under the control of ZANU-PF and continue to harass \ncivil society activists and participate in illegal, often violent, \nseizures of private land and property. In this sense, little has \nchanged in Zimbabwe.\n  Yet at the same time, for many Zimbabweans, the establishment of a \ntransitional government that includes former opposition leaders who \nwere imprisoned and tortured as part of Zimbabwe's democratic struggle \nhas brought forth a sense of possibility that has not existed for \nyears. It has brought their struggle for democracy into the halls of \ngovernment. And over the last year, some progress has been made toward \nenacting reforms. Most notably, the Finance Ministry has managed to \nhalt Zimbabwe's economic decline and put an end to some of the \ndisastrous fiscal activities of the previous regime. That said, \nprogress has been slow and limited mostly to the economic sector. We \ncannot deceive ourselves into thinking that the return of food and \nother goods to stores is an indication that true democracy has taken \nroot. Reformist elements in the government continue to lack the \nleverage as well as the qualified personnel and resources to overcome \nthe resistance of hardliners and to break their hold on the security \nsector. They need greater support if they are going to win this \nstruggle and achieve a genuine transition to democracy and economic \nrecovery.\n  I respect those who are cautious about changing the international \nposture toward Zimbabwe until there is greater progress and a clear \ntransition underway. I too am cautious, as there is good reason to be \nso. But at the same time, I also believe we must support the Zimbabwean \npeople in their ongoing struggle for peaceful, democratic change and we \ncan best do that by reconsidering some of the strict polices of years \nprior. We must realize that the dynamics of that struggle have \nchanged--not as much as we would like them to go, not even close but \nthere has been change. Adhering to a strict wait-and-see approach \nallows Mugabe and his allies to continue to marginalize reformers in \nthe transitional government and manipulate the political environment, \nwhile relying on their usual anti-Western propaganda to win local and \nregional support. Alternatively, through proactive and targeted \nengagement, there may be ways that we can better support reformers in \ngovernment, create incentives for others in the government to embrace \nsuch reform, and isolate the hardliners. If we are to see institutional \nchange in Zimbabwe, it is in our interest to pursue those \npossibilities.\n  The United States has a key role to play in this regard. We continue \nto be very active in Zimbabwe, providing humanitarian assistance and \nsupport for civil society. In Fiscal Year 2009, the United States \nprovided nearly $300 million to Zimbabwe, over half of which was food \nassistance. Over the last year, some within the administration have \nbegun to explore ways we can better target our assistance to help \nreformers in order to consolidate democratic reforms and lay the \ngroundwork for economic recovery. We have already provided some \ntechnical assistance to help certain ministries in the government. This \nis the right approach and we should continue to look for ways to \nproceed, both symbolically and substantively. At the same time, we \nshould continue to update and increase targeted pressure on those \nindividuals and institutions that are actively obstructing reform. We \nshould also look for innovative ways to address illegal activities that \nare in violation of the GPA.\n  The Zimbabwe Transition to Democracy and Economic Recovery Act of \n2010 seeks to encourage and provide the authority and flexibility for \nthe Obama administration to pursue such a dynamic approach toward \nZimbabwe. Our bill authorizes continued and expanded technical \nassistance to reformist ministries of the transitional government as \nwell as to the Parliament as it seeks to repeal or amend repressive \nlaws. It also amends the funding restrictions on Zimbabwe in the fiscal \nyear 2010 State and Foreign Operations appropriations bill to allow for \ngreater engagement in the areas of health and education. Furthermore, \nit encourages the United States to promote agricultural development as \nmuch as possible within our food assistance efforts, while we actively \npress the government to reestablish security of tenure for all \nlandowners.\n  In addition, our bill would amend ZDERA to allow the United States \ngreater flexibility and leverage when engaging with the International \nFinancial Institutions on Zimbabwe. The law from 2001 restricts U.S. \nsupport for any international loan, credit or debt reduction to \nZimbabwe until the President certifies that certain political \nconditions have been achieved in the country. This restriction \ncurrently has no discernible impact as Zimbabwe can only be eligible \nfor such international support when it deals with its arrears, which \nnow total billions of dollars. Nonetheless, this restriction has become \na powerful symbol and it functionally ties the hands of the State and \nTreasury Departments to actively engage with the IMF, African \nDevelopment Bank and other institutions to develop plans for supporting \nZimbabwe's longer-term recovery when there is a genuine transition. Our \nbill would amend ZDERA to allow for such engagement, making U.S. \nsupport conditional on the proposed assistance itself, specifically \nwhether there are sufficient controls for transparency and oversight, \nand whether funds will be administered by ministries that have \ndemonstrated a commitment to reform.\n  Amending ZDERA will help to provide flexibility and leverage for the \nU.S. government, but also to undercut Mugabe's propaganda. Over the \nyears, Mugabe and his allies have conveniently portrayed ZDERA as a \nsymbol of Western hostility and blanket sanctions on Zimbabwe. While \nthose allegations are clearly false, the changes made by our bill will \ngo a long way towards ensuring they have a much harder time spinning \nthis lie and deflecting responsibility from their own disastrous \npolicies.\n  ZDERA, of course, is not to be conflated with our targeted sanctions \nagainst specific individuals and financial institutions that are \ndirectly involved in the breakdown of the rule of law and abuses of \npower. Our bill calls for the continuation of that program as I see no \nreason to terminate this sanctions program until we see an end to \nwidespread abuses. Instead, our bill calls for the continued review and \nupdating of those sanctions. It also encourages new action to address \nillegal activities involving diamonds in Zimbabwe that are reportedly \nfueling abuses and undermining democratic progress. Specifically, it \nurges the\n\n[[Page S3095]]\n\nObama administration to consider new sanctions on individuals \noverseeing these activities and to press for Zimbabwe's suspension from \nthe Kimberley Process. Zimbabwe's continued participation in the \nKimberley Process undermines the integrity and important work of that \nprocess.\n  Finally, whenever it happens, Zimbabwe's next election will be a \ncritical step toward any genuine transition to democratic rule and a \nsustainable economic recovery. The past elections have been flashpoints \nfor increased violence and the breakdown of the rule of law. This \ncannot be the case this next time around if Zimbabwe is to move \nforward. The international community needs to prepare a coordinated \nstrategy to help reduce the risk of violence and other abuses around \nsuch elections. Our bill directs the Obama administration to begin \nengaging with international partners now toward developing such a \nstrategy.\n  International actions alone will not determine whether real and \nlasting democratic change is achieved in Zimbabwe; that will ultimately \nbe determined by the Zimbabwean people themselves. But I do believe \nthat we can help Zimbabweans pursue a genuine transition toward \ndemocracy and economic recovery. To do this, we need an approach that \nis flexible and responsive to evolving conditions and challenges on the \nground. I believe this bill helps move us toward such an approach.\n  Nearly a decade ago, in passing ZDERA, the U.S. Congress committed to \nsupport the people of Zimbabwe in their struggle to effect peaceful, \ndemocratic change, achieve economic growth and restore the rule of law. \nToday, we can reaffirm that commitment by passing the Zimbabwe \nTransition to Democracy and Economic Recovery Act. I hope my colleagues \nwill join us in doing so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Carper, Ms. Cantwell, \n        Mr. Merkley, and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n  S. 3299. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to allow \nall eligible voters to vote by mail in Federal elections; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a package of three \nbills to improve the administration of U.S. elections. These bills \nwould empower voters--giving them a greater ability to control how and \nwhen they participate in the electoral process. Just as technological \ndevelopments have changed the way people manage everything from their \nbank accounts to their communication with friends and family, they can \nalso give voters more power to control their involvement in the \nelectoral process. By empowering individual voters, my bills would \nincrease turnout and lower administrative costs, while improving the \nsecurity and integrity of elections.\n  As my colleagues know, I am an ardent believer in bipartisanship. One \nthing both parties agree on is that the states are great laboratories \nfor policy innovation. The bills I am introducing today are prime \nexamples of progress that was pioneered at the state level. It's now \ntime to take that proven success to the national level.\n  An increasing number of voters across the country now Vote by Mail. \nIn fact, in the 2008 presidential election, one-fifth of ballots \nnationwide were cast by mail. I am proud to say that the State that \nblazed the trail for Vote by Mail is my home State of Oregon. There \nwere many steps along this path, but the turning point came in 1996. \nThat year, Oregon conducted its first State-wide primary and general \nelection for a Federal race exclusively by mail. That election, of \ncourse, sent me to the U.S. Senate. But that election was not just a \nsuccess for my campaign, it was a win for the voters of Oregon.\n  Through the success of Vote by Mail for that special election, folks \nin Oregon saw that elections could be conducted without long lines, \nmalfunctioning equipment, and the risks of fraud inherent at polling \nplaces. The resounding success of that first Vote by Mail, State-wide, \nFederal election led directly to the passage of a referendum in Oregon \non Vote by Mail two years later. In 1998, an overwhelming majority--70 \npercent--of Oregonians voted to adopt Vote by Mail for all elections. \nThe Vote by Mail system was fully in place for the next election cycle, \nmeaning that since 2000, all Oregon voters have voted exclusively by \nmail.\n  The three bills I am introducing today draw upon the success that \nOregon has experienced with Vote by Mail and more recently with online \nvoter registration. The first is the Universal Right to Vote by Mail \nAct. This bill would put into law the fact that every citizen has the \nright to vote by mail. Under this bill, any voter who requests an \nabsentee ballot would receive one. No longer would arbitrary \nrequirements block voters from choosing to Vote by Mail.\n  The second bill is the Vote by Mail Act. It would provide grants to \nstates, or smaller jurisdictions, that wish to make the transition to \nVote by Mail.\n  Finally, the Online Voter Registration Act would provide grants to \nstates that wish to implement an online system that would allow voters \nto register to vote, update voter information, and request an absentee \nballot using the internet. In Oregon, Washington, and Arizona, online \nsystems are already working to reduce administrative costs and make it \neasier for voters to participate in elections.\n  Ten years of proven results with Oregon's Vote by Mail system has \nshown that this policy experiment has been a resounding success. Voters \nin Oregon strongly support Vote by Mail. An academic study conducted in \n2005 found that over 80 percent of Oregonians prefer Vote by Mail to \nconventional polling place elections. Vote by Mail is also a more cost-\neffective way to run elections. In Oregon, the Elections Division \nestimated that costs were reduced by 30 percent when Vote by Mail \nreplaced polling place elections.\n  One of the greatest results that Vote by Mail has had on Oregon's \nelection is that it has increased voter turnout and that's an outcome \nthat every state should want. In the three Presidential elections in \nOregon since Vote by Mail was adopted, turnout has been 84 percent--an \nincrease of 6 percent over the three prior Presidential elections. Vote \nby Mail has an even stronger beneficial impact on turnout for lower-\nprofile elections, such as off-year, municipal, or referenda elections.\n  Vote by Mail also reduces election fraud. This may sound counter-\nintuitive to skeptics who believe voting by mail is less secure than \nvoting at a polling place. However, a Vote by Mail system offers many \nsafeguards that are not available in conventional elections. There is a \npaper trail for each and every vote, and the processing is conducted at \na central, secure location that can be viewed by the public. By \nexpanding the voting period--rather than compressing it into one day--\nVote by Mail affords election officials the time to identify problems, \nfix errors, and investigate any questionable ballots. If the goal of \nour country's elections is to make sure the voice of every voter is \nheard clearly and securely, there is no greater tool than Vote by Mail.\n  Oregon's experience has shown that in a Vote by Mail system fraud is \nalmost non-existent. Every ballot envelope is scrutinized before it is \nopened, and the voter's signature on it is reviewed to make sure it \nmatches the one on file for the voter. With the longer time period \ninvolved--typically about two and a half weeks--in a Vote by Mail \nelection, there is ample opportunity to determine whether a ballot is \nvalid before it is counted and to investigate any allegations of fraud. \nIf a ballot is fraudulent, it never gets counted. That could never \nhappen in a polling place election where, by the time fraud is found, \nthe vote has already been counted and can't be retrieved. Since Oregon \nconverted to exclusive Vote by Mail elections, over 15 million ballots \nhave been cast. During this time, thousands of ballots have been \nchallenged and investigated for allegations of fraud. Thorough \ninvestigation of every allegation, however, has revealed only nine \ninstances of vote fraud. There has been absolutely no evidence of any \nlarge-scale, systemic vote fraud that some predicted when Vote by Mail \nwas first adopted in Oregon.\n  Vote by Mail offers additional advantages that may not be readily \napparent. For example, on Election Day in 2006, Tillamook County, \nOregon, experienced a deluge of 13 inches of rain. Roads were closed, \nparts of the county\n\n[[Page S3096]]\n\nbecame unreachable, and a State of emergency was declared. Even so, 70 \npercent of the voters in Tillamook County cast their ballots. Vote by \nMail ensured that lack of access to polling places because of a natural \ndisaster on Election Day was no impediment to voting.\n  It is not only bad weather that can be overcome with Vote by Mail--an \nillness, caring for a loved one, pregnancy, work, travel, or religious \nobligations can all keep citizens from exercising their right to vote \nat a polling place on a one-day election. Vote by Mail trumps all of \nthese obstacles. Such barriers are not an issue in Oregon, but they may \nprevent voters in 28 states and territories from voting. In those \nstates and territories, voters must meet arbitrary requirements to get \nan absentee ballot. I believe the decision to obtain an absentee ballot \nshould be made by the voter. I can see no justification for allowing \narbitrary, bureaucratic rules to disenfranchise any voter anywhere in \nAmerica.\n  I would also note that excuse requirements for obtaining an absentee \nballot constitute an unwarranted invasion of voter privacy. All \ninformation submitted on an absentee ballot request form becomes part \nof the public record. There is no reason why voters should be forced to \nreveal sensitive personal information simply to have the opportunity to \nvote. I believe all voters should enjoy equal access to mail ballots \nwhile having their privacy ensured.\n  That is why I am introducing the Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act. \nThis bill is, fundamentally, about access and fairness. No citizen \nshould have to miss an election because they have to work, are ill, are \ncaring for a loved one, traveling, or have a religious obligation. When \nvoting for President, Oregonians shouldn't have an advantage over New \nYorkers or Virginians. The Universal Right to Vote by Mail Act doesn't \nforce anyone to Vote by Mail, nor does it require states to implement \nany new voting systems. All States are already required to have an \nabsentee ballot system. This bill merely says all voters should have \nequal protection in choosing how to participate in elections.\n  I am also introducing today the Vote by Mail Act of 2010, which would \ncreate a three-year, $18 million grant program to help states, or \nsmaller jurisdictions, transition to Vote by Mail systems like the one \nin Oregon. This bill would not mandate that any state adopt Vote by \nMail. However, the bill would provide funding for state or local \njurisdictions that choose to take advantage of the benefits that Vote \nby Mail offers. The bill would provide grants of $2 million dollars to \nstates, or grants of $1 million to smaller jurisdictions, to help pay \nfor the costs of implementing a Vote by Mail system. I believe Vote by \nMail can improve elections in any state that adopts it. But rather than \nsimply assume that Vote by Mail delivers benefits, I offer a solution \nthat would provide proof that it does. My bill would instruct the \nGovernment Accountability Office to evaluate Vote by Mail and produce a \nstudy comparing traditional voting methods with Vote by Mail.\n  Finally, I am introducing the Online Voter Registration Act to help \ngive voters the ability to register, update voter information, and \nrequest absentee ballots using the internet. This bill would empower \nvoters and would reduce administrative costs. In 2008, three quarters \nof folks in our country reported using the internet, and 87 percent of \nyoung adults did so. These are the very people who will be registering \nto vote for the first time, and they expect the government to \naccommodate the way they live their lives. But this bill isn't just \nabout making things easier for young adults. The internet is well-\nsuited to this work and can save time, protect voters' privacy, reduce \npaper, and lower costs. Many States already allow citizens to renew \ntheir driver's licenses or register their cars online. Expanding the \nlist of those government services offered online to Voter Registration \nsimply makes sense.\n  Oregon, Washington, and Arizona have already established online voter \nregistration systems. In the initial election cycle of implementation \nfor Washington's system, the State reported saving over $87,000 in less \nthan a year. Expanding access to online voter registration makes sense, \nbut designing and implementing such systems requires considerable \nstart-up expenses. That's why the Online Voter Registration Act would \nprovide grants of $150,000 to States to help cover the implementation \ncosts.\n  I would like to thank those who have supported Vote by Mail, \nincluding the original cosponsors of the two bills: Senators Kerry, \nCarper, Cantwell, Merkley, and Gillibrand. I would also like to thank \nthe many organizations that support Vote by Mail, including the \nNational Association of Letter Carriers, National Association of \nPostmasters, National Association of Postal Supervisors, American \nPostal Workers Union, National Postal Mail Handlers Union, National \nRural Letter Carriers' Association, and other labor organizations \nincluding the AFL-CIO and SEIU. Vote by Mail also has the support of \nmany civil rights and elections organizations, including Common Cause, \nthe NAACP, the ACLU, and The League of Rural Voters.\n  I urge my colleagues to give voters more choice and greater \nopportunity to participate in elections by supporting these important \nbills. It's time to move the nation's elections systems into the 21st \ncentury and answer the needs of today's voters. These bills are an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3299\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Universal Right to Vote by \n     Mail Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An inequity of voting rights exists in the United \n     States because voters in some States have the universal right \n     to vote by mail while voters in other States do not.\n       (2) Many voters often have work, family, or other \n     commitments that make getting to polls on the date of an \n     election difficult or impossible. Under current State laws, \n     many of these voters are not permitted to vote by mail.\n       (3) 28 States currently allow universal absentee voting \n     (also known as ``no-excuse'' absentee voting), which permits \n     any voter to request a mail-in ballot without providing a \n     reason for the request, and no State which has implemented \n     no-excuse absentee voting has repealed it.\n       (4) Voting by mail gives voters more time to consider their \n     choices, which is especially important as many ballots \n     contain greater numbers of questions about complex issues \n     than in the past due to the expanded use of the initiative \n     and referendum process in many States.\n       (5) Voting by mail is cost effective. After the State of \n     Oregon adopted vote by mail for all voters, the cost to \n     administer an election in the State dropped by nearly 30 \n     percent over the next few elections, from $3.07 per voter to \n     $2.21 per voter.\n       (6) Allowing all voters the option to vote by mail can \n     reduce waiting times for those voters who choose to vote at \n     the polls.\n       (7) Voting by mail is preferable to many voters as an \n     alternative to going to the polls. Voting by mail has become \n     increasingly popular with voters who want to be certain that \n     they are able to vote no matter what comes up on Election \n     Day.\n       (8) No evidence exists suggesting the potential for fraud \n     in absentee balloting is greater than the potential for fraud \n     by any other method of voting.\n       (9) Many of the reasons which voters in many States are \n     required to provide in order to vote by mail require the \n     revelation of personal information about health, travel \n     plans, or religious activities, which violate voters' privacy \n     while doing nothing to prevent voter fraud.\n       (10) State laws which require voters to obtain a notary \n     signature to vote by mail only add cost and inconvenience to \n     voters without increasing security.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROMOTING ABILITY OF VOTERS TO VOTE BY MAIL IN \n                   FEDERAL ELECTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subtitle A of title III of the Help \n     America Vote Act of 2002 (42 U.S.C. 15481 et seq.) is amended \n     by inserting after section 303 the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 303A. PROMOTING ABILITY OF VOTERS TO VOTE BY MAIL.\n\n       ``(a) In General.--If an individual in a State is eligible \n     to cast a vote in an election for Federal office, the State \n     may not impose any additional conditions or requirements on \n     the eligibility of the individual to cast the vote in such \n     election by mail, except to the extent that the State imposes \n     a deadline for requesting the ballot and related voting \n     materials from the appropriate State or local election \n     official and for returning the ballot to the appropriate \n     State or local election official.\n\n[[Page S3097]]\n\n       ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) \n     shall be construed to affect the authority of States to \n     conduct elections for Federal office through the use of \n     polling places at which individuals cast ballots on the date \n     of the election.\n       ``(c) Effective Date.--A State shall be required to comply \n     with the requirements of subsection (a) with respect to \n     elections for Federal office held in years beginning with \n     2012.''.\n       (b) Conforming Amendment Relating to Enforcement.--Section \n     401 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 15511) is amended by striking \n     ``and 303'' and inserting ``303, and 303A''.\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of contents for such Act \n     is amended by inserting after the item relating to section \n     303 the following new item:\n\n``Sec. 303A.

A bill to establish a Vote by Mail grant program; to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3300\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Vote by Mail Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Supreme Court declared in Reynolds v. Sims that \n     ``[i]t has been repeatedly recognized that all qualified \n     voters have a constitutionally protected right to vote . . . \n     and to have their votes counted.''\n       (2) In recent presidential elections, voting technology \n     failures, procedural irregularities, and long lines for \n     polling places deprived some Americans of their fundamental \n     right to vote.\n       (3) Under the Oregon Vote by Mail system, election \n     officials mail ballots to all registered voters at least 2 \n     weeks before election day. Voters mark their ballots, seal \n     the ballots in both unmarked secrecy envelopes and signed \n     return envelopes, and return the ballots by mail or to secure \n     drop boxes. Once a ballot is received, election officials \n     scan the bar code on the ballot envelope, which brings up the \n     voter's signature on a computer screen. The election official \n     compares the signature on the screen and the signature on the \n     ballot envelope. Only if the signature on the ballot envelope \n     is determined to be authentic is the ballot forwarded on to \n     be counted.\n       (4) Oregon's Vote by Mail system has deterred voter fraud \n     because the system includes numerous security measures such \n     as the signature authentication system. Potential misconduct \n     is also discouraged by the power of the State to punish those \n     who engage in voter fraud with up to 5 years in prison, \n     $100,000 in fines, and the loss of their vote.\n       (5) Oregon's Vote by Mail system promotes uniformity and \n     strict compliance with Federal and State voting laws because \n     ballot processing is centralized in county clerks' offices, \n     rather than at numerous polling places.\n       (6) Vote by Mail is 1 factor making voter turnout in Oregon \n     consistently higher than the average national voter turnout. \n     In the 2004 presidential election, for example, Oregon had a \n     turnout rate of 86.48 percent of registered voters, compared \n     to 69.96 percent turnout of registered voters nationally.\n       (7) Women, younger voters, and homemakers also report that \n     they vote more often using Vote by Mail.\n       (8) Vote by Mail reduces election costs by eliminating the \n     need to transport equipment to polling stations and to hire \n     and train poll workers. Oregon reduced its costs to \n     administer elections by nearly 30 percent after implementing \n     Vote by Mail. In Oregon's last polling place election in \n     1998, the cost per voter was $3.07. By 2004, the cost per \n     voter in Oregon had dropped to $2.21.\n       (9) Vote by Mail allows voters to educate themselves \n     because they receive ballots well before election day, which \n     provides them with ample time to research issues, study \n     ballots, and deliberate in a way that is not possible at a \n     polling place.\n       (10) Vote by Mail is accurate--at least 2 studies comparing \n     voting technologies show that absentee voting methods, \n     including Vote by Mail systems, result in a more accurate \n     vote count.\n       (11) Vote by Mail results in more up-to-date voter rolls, \n     since election officials use forwarding information from the \n     post office to update voter registration.\n       (12) Vote by Mail allows voters to visually verify that \n     their votes were cast correctly and produces a paper trail \n     for election recounts.\n       (13) In a survey taken 5 years after Oregon implemented the \n     Vote by Mail system, more than 8 in 10 Oregon voters said \n     they preferred voting by mail to traditional voting.\n       (14) Voters in other States are moving toward Vote by Mail \n     as well.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objeciton, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3301\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Online Voter Registration \n     Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Americans have become increasingly comfortable with \n     using the Internet for a wide range of purposes, including \n     gathering information, purchasing items, performing financial \n     transactions, and obtaining information and services from the \n     Government.\n       (2) In 2008, 74 percent of adults in the United States \n     reported using the Internet, according to the Pew Internet \n     and American Life Project. Of those adults, 89 percent \n     reported using the Internet to find information, 71 percent \n     made purchases over the Internet, 70 percent read news \n     online, 56 percent looked up campaign or political \n     information, 55 percent utilized online banking, and 59 \n     percent visited Government Internet websites.\n       (3) The Internet is well-suited to allow individuals to \n     provide and update personal information. Completing such \n     tasks online saves time, reduces paper, increases efficiency, \n     and lowers costs.\n       (4) Many States already allow citizens to access Government \n     services online, including renewing driver's licenses and \n     registering cars.\n       (5) Two States, Arizona and Washington, have already \n     implemented online voter registration systems, and a number \n     of other States are in the process of adopting online voter \n     registration systems.\n       (6) Although 2008 was the first election cycle that the \n     online voter registration system was in place in Washington \n     State, in the month prior to the general election, voter use \n     of the online voter registration system exceeded that of \n     mail-in registration cards by more than 20 percent.\n       (7) Younger adults who are registering to vote for the \n     first time are the most adept Internet users and expect to be \n     able to accomplish most tasks online. In 2008, 87 percent of \n     adults age 18 to 29 used the Internet. In Washington State, \n     voters age 18 to 24 had the highest rate of use of its online \n     voter registration system.\n       (8) During the 2008 election cycle, Washington State \n     processed about 130,000 online voter registration \n     transactions.\n       (9) Implementing an online voter registration requires an \n     initial investment to purchase the needed technology and to \n     input existing voter information into the registration \n     database. Washington State, for example, spent $278,000 to \n     establish its online voter registration system.\n       (10) Once in place, online voter registration systems allow \n     the processing of new voter registrations, changes of address \n     or party, and requests for absentee ballots.\n       (11) Washington State reports that it costs approximately \n     25 cents to process paper voter registration cards and 43 \n     cents to process those submitted via the department of motor \n     vehicles in compliance with the National Voter Registration \n     Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. 1973gg et seq.). Voters must also pay \n     postage costs for registration cards sent through the mail. \n     Once in place, the online voter registration system requires \n     no processing by staff in order to complete a transaction, \n     and therefore has no per transaction cost. For the 2008 \n     general election, the online voter registration system saved \n     Washington State $32,500, and saved consumers $54,600 in \n     postage costs, which resulted in total savings to the State \n     and consumers of over $87,000.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Election.--The term ``election'' means any general, \n     special, primary, or runoff election.\n       (2) Participating state.--The term ``participating State'' \n     means a State receiving a grant under the Online Voter \n     Registration grant program under section 4.\n       (3) State.--The term ``State'' means a State of the United \n     States, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto \n     Rico, or a territory or possession of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 4.

At such time, all such companies shall \n     be transitioned to regulation under paragraph (1).\n       (4) International cooperation.--The Council shall work \n     promptly and urgently with all appropriate countries and \n     international authorities to establish a binding, effective, \n     and comprehensive international resolution mechanism, and \n     shall report to Congress not less than once every 6 months on \n     all activities taken in connection with such effort, \n     including actions taken or not taken by other countries and \n     international organizations.

Collector Car Appreciation Day.\n  While people out there are looking for jobs, trying to save their \nhomes, we are doing what the Republicans let us do: Collector Car \nAppreciation Day. That is the extent of our work because the \nRepublicans have objected to everything we have tried to do on trying \nto reform Wall Street--for obvious reasons.\n  We all read the press saying the lobbyists are here lined up with \ntheir Gucci shoes and their new suits and a lot of new ties because we \nare told they are spending millions of dollars a week on these people \nto stop us from reforming Wall Street.\n\n[[Page S3117]]\n\n  We are going to reform Wall Street.
