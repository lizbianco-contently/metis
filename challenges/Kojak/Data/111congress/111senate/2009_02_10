Madam President, over the past several months, a \nseries of frightening economic events have left many Americans without \nwork and many more wondering when the bad news will end. A problem that \nbegan in the housing sector spread to the financial sector, triggering \neven more problems in industries that rely on credit. Major U.S. \ncompanies that many Americans never thought were vulnerable have laid \noff thousands of workers, some for the first time ever. Last month \nalone, 600,000 Americans lost jobs.\n  This was the situation when President Obama took office late last \nmonth. And, to his credit, our new President has committed himself to \nworking with Congress to fix the economy, a top priority for both \nparties. A month before Inauguration Day, the President told us that \nbold legislative action would be needed. He also said repeatedly that \nhe would be careful in spending the taxpayers' money.\n  The American people were ready to support an economic plan that would \nwork and that wouldn't spend money we don't have on things we don't \nneed. So were Republicans in Congress.\n  What many of us did not expect, however, was that President Obama \nwouldn't be the author of that plan. In an odd turn of events, the bold \neconomic plan that President Obama called for ended up being written by \nsome of the longest-serving Democrats in the House of Representatives--\nand it showed. Tasked with writing a stimulus bill that was timely, \ntargeted, and temporary, Democrats in the House produced an enormous \nspending bill that was none of the above.\n  Criticism of the House bill was fierce, so many of us expected that \nDemocrats in the Senate would draft a much better bill. Unfortunately, \nthose hopes turned out to be unfounded. Not only was the Senate bill \nmore expensive than the House bill, it repeated the same mistakes: \nhundreds of billions in permanent Government expansion, wasteful \nprojects that would have\n\n[[Page S2038]]\n\nminimal or no impact on job creation, and a staggering $1.2 trillion \npricetag when interest costs are added.\n  As the Senate version was taking shape, a number of Senators \nexpressed serious concerns. One Senator said he was, ``very committed \nto making sure that we get it scrubbed clean of many of these \nprograms.'' Another said that, ``If there's wasteful or silly spending, \nor spending that does not, you know, create, jobs, that sort of stuff \nneeds to be pruned out.'' Another Senator said, ``We are seeking not to \nlet this thing get loaded up with all these other pet projects and pet \nprograms.'' Another said, ``. . . it needs some work. It needs some \nsurgery.'' And those were just the Democrats.\n  Concerns were so widespread that President Obama called a meeting at \nthe White House with congressional leaders. After the meeting, many of \nus thought Senate Democrats would rethink their plan. They didn't. They \ndug in deeper. Republicans tried repeatedly to cut out the waste and \nbring down the total cost of the bill, and to refocus on the central \nproblem of the housing market. Democrats resisted. They rejected an \namendment that would have cut more than $25 billion in wasteful \nspending from the bill. They rejected an amendment that would have \nturned off spending on newly created programs--rather than let them \nlive in perpetuity. They rejected an amendment that would have turned \noff spending once the economy recovers.\n  In the end, Senate Democrats produced a bill that fell so far short \nthat a compromise emerged. But the compromise itself wasn't much better \nthan the original House or Senate bills. Much of the spending was \neither permanent or unfocused. And many of the wasteful or \nnonstimulative projects that raised concerns in the earlier versions \nremained: hundreds of millions for Government cars and Government golf \ncarts; $200 million to consolidate the Department of Homeland Security \noffices in Washington; $100 million for grants to small shipyards; \nnearly $1 billion to spruce up parks.\n  In every version of the stimulus we have seen, wasteful spending has \nattracted the most attention. But even more worrisome to many is the \npermanent expansion of Government programs. One estimate puts the cost \nof this expansion at nearly $1 trillion over the next decade.\n  Even the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which counts \nObama economic adviser Paul Volcker and former Clinton Budget Director \nAlice Rivlin as directors, has been highly critical of this aspect of \nthe bill. Last week, CRFB president Maya MacGuineas pointed out that \nmany of the bill's spending projects squander resources. But even more \ntroubling, she said, are the programs that aim to permanently expand \nGovernment. As MacGuineas put it, ``extending our borrowing beyond the \neconomic downturn will make our already-dismal fiscal picture far, far \nworse.''\n  Still, some Democrats continue to defend the bill. Asked about its \napparent lack of focus, one veteran Democratic Congressman said, ``So \nwhat.'' One Senate Democrat called $16.4 billion in the bill ``a \ntrifle.'' Another Democrat Senator said that by inserting a $3 billion \nproject of his own, he was just ``fiddling at the edges.'' Another said \nthat $50 billion was ``not going to make the difference to the \neconomy.'' Most people cringe at a 50-cent increase in the cost of \nbread. Senate Democrats shrug at taking $16 billion from the taxpayers \nfor a project they can't even assure us will work. In an economic \ndownturn, we should care more about how we spend their tax dollars--not \nless.\n  America is in the midst of a serious economic crisis. At some point, \nhowever, we will all have to face an even larger crisis: We have a $1.2 \ntrillion deficit. The national debt is approaching $11 trillion. Soon \nwe will be voting on an omnibus appropriations bill that will cost \nanother $400 billion. This week, Secretary Geithner is expected to \npropose another round of bank bailouts that could cost up to $2 \ntrillion. Including interest, the bill before us will cost $1.2 \ntrillion.\n  Americans are asking themselves ``Where does it end?'' They want to \nknow how we're going to pay for all this. They are worried. And they \nshould be worried about a bill so big that it is equivalent to spending \nmore than $1 million a day for more than 3,000 years. This is an \nenormous amount of money.\n  The President was right to call for a stimulus, but this bill misses \nthe mark. It is full of waste. We have no assurance it will create jobs \nor revive the economy. The only thing we know for sure is that it \nincreases our debt and locks in bigger and bigger interest payments \nevery year. In short, we are taking an enormous risk with other \npeople's money. On behalf of taxpayers, I will not take that risk.\n   The administration is clearly worried about the risks of spending \nthis much money. Over the weekend, the Treasury Secretary decided to \npostpone an announcement on the use of the remaining TARP money and an \nentity that would absorb toxic assets from troubled banks.\n  Yesterday, the Democrat majority in the House postponed a leftover \nappropriations bill from last year that would bring 2009 spending to \nmore than $1 trillion for the first time ever. It may seem overwhelming \nto do all of this at the same time. But, in my view, we need to lay all \nof this spending on the table at once, rather than trickle it out in an \neffort to hide the true costs.\n  We need to be straight with the American people.\n  Last year, the national debt was about $10 trillion. The interest \npayments on that debt totaled about $450 billion. At the same rate of \ninterest, the debt we're about to take on from this stimulus, the bad \nbank legislation, and the appropriations bill could cost an additional \n$250 billion per year in interest payments.\n  That's about $700 billion next year in interest payments on the debt \nalone--more than we spent last year on defense, military construction, \nVeterans hospitals, and Homeland Security combined--$700 billion with \nnothing to show for it, $700 billion just to keep the creditors from \nknocking on our door. The interest costs on the stimulus bill alone \nwill cost us $95 million a day, every day, for the next 10 years. Most \npeople know what it is to charge a little more on the credit card than \nyou should. They should know that their Government is about to charge a \nlot more on the Nation's credit than it can afford--and that it is \ncounting on the taxpayers to cover the cost.\n  This is serious money, all of it borrowed, and all of it spent on the \nhope that it will help lift the economy.\n  All of us want to strengthen the economy and create and save jobs. \nRepublicans believe the best way to do it is to first fix the problem, \nwhich is housing. Then we need to let people keep more of what they \nearn. Throughout this process, Republicans have been guided by the \nbelief that the desire to ``just do something'' shouldn't be an excuse \nto waste tax dollars. That is why we proposed a plan that was more \nfocused on the problem and which didn't waste money--in short, a plan \nthat was timely, targeted, and temporary. Sadly the bill before us is \nnone of these things, despite the good intent of the President. \nObviously, I will be voting against it, and I urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/10/senate-section/article/S2038-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2038-S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BOY SCOUTS OF AMERICA\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, this week marks the 99th anniversary \nof an organization that has assisted in the moral and civic formation \nof millions of American boys.\n  By training young men in the skills of self-reliance, and inculcating \nin them the virtues of patriotism, volunteerism, and the importance of \nmoral character, the Boy Scouts of America has strengthened our \nfamilies, our communities, and our Nation beyond measure.\n  Eleven of the twelve men who have walked on the Moon were Scouts. \nMore than one-third of all West Point cadets are Scouts. Several U.S. \nPresidents dating back to Teddy Roosevelt have been Scouts or Scout \nvolunteers. And at least four of my Senate Republican colleagues are \nEagle Scouts.\n  This week we recognize the valuable contributions of this fine \norganization, and we celebrate its traditions.\n  Looking at the challenges we face today, it is clear that men of \ncharacter are needed as much today as they were when the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica was incorporated in the U.S. in 1910. And as long as young boys \nput on the Scout uniform, we can expect those challenges to be met.\n\n[[Page S2039]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/10/senate-section/article/S2039-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2039]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 12 p.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the \nleaders or their designees, with the final 10 minutes for the two \nleaders.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, in each of the last 3 months, more than \nhalf a million mothers and fathers came home to tell their families \nthat they had lost their jobs.\n  In each of the last 3 months, more than half a million breadwinners \ncame to terms with the news that they were no longer gainfully \nemployed.\n  In each of the last 3 months, more than half a million Americans \nsuddenly had to make do with much less.\n  Bad as that news is, the year ahead looks no better. Job losses have \naccelerated to a rate not seen in nearly three decades. And economists \nwarn that other shoes are bound to drop.\n  These are times that frighten even seasoned managers. These are \ncircumstances that concern even bullish economists.\n  The history of the 1920s and 1930s teaches us that we must act. The \nhistory of the Great Depression teaches us the costs of delay.\n  We must act to replace some of the trillions of dollars in demand \nthat the private sector lacks. We must act to support those who, \nthrough no fault of their own, have been thrown onto the rolls of the \nunemployed. We must act to prevent the economy from spiraling deeper \ninto recession.\n  The road before us is clear. We must pass the economic recovery and \nreinvestment legislation before us today. We must speedily resolve our \ndifferences with the House of Representatives. And we must get this \nbill to the President for signature without delay.\n  The bill before us would create or save 3 to 4 million jobs. The fate \nof millions of mothers and fathers, sisters and brothers, wives and \nhusbands depends on what we do here today.\n  Every generation must face its own challenge. Responding to this \neconomic emergency is ours. Let us not be found wanting.\n  Let us pass this bill and ensure that millions more mothers and \nfathers will not have to come home to tell their families that they \nhave lost their jobs.\n  Let us pass this bill to ensure that millions more breadwinners will \nnot have to come to terms with unemployment.\n  And let us pass this bill and rise to the economic challenge of our \ngeneration.\n  I don't know who the manager is on the other side, but I assume the \nSenator from Texas has more than enough authority to speak. I suggest \nshe seek recognition and ask for whatever time she desires.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, is there time allocated to each \nside?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time until noon is equally \ndivided.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise with hope that my colleagues \nwill not waive the Budget Act point of order on this bill and to speak \nagainst passage of the legislation.\n  Sometimes one has to talk about process when dealing with something \nas important and as large as the bill before us. A fair process would \nhave allowed input from both Republicans and Democrats, and would have \nwritten the bill in committee rather than trying to write the bill on \nthe Senate floor. I am still concerned about a $1 trillion expenditure. \nWhen we have an 800-page bill, we are spending about $1 billion per \npage. Yet I don't believe we have a consensus about the right way to be \nspending $1 trillion; $1 billion per page in this bill.\n  The important thing we must do for the future is to look at all of \nthe expenditures we are making. It is important for us to look at the \ntrillion dollars we spent on stimulation last year which did nothing to \nhelp the economy. Now we have another trillion dollars coming down the \npike to shore up financial institutions. We have $1 trillion in \nspending before us. We already have a $10.6 trillion debt. It is time \nto step back and say: a trillion dollars here and a trillion dollars \nthere, we are talking about real money. The great Everett Dirksen \ntalked about the ``real money'' of a billion dollars, and now we are at \na trillion.\n  It is time to pause and say to the American people: We are going to \nlook at what needs to be done before we spend another dollar, much less \n$1 trillion.\n  I believe 100 of us would say we need a stimulus package. It is how \nwe spend the money that is in disagreement. Right now the bill before \nus is one-third tax cuts and two-thirds spending. Even the tax cuts are \nnot going to help create jobs or keep people in their homes, which \nshould be our major focus. The tax cuts are similar to the ones we did \nlast year, which every economist agrees did not work because we didn't \nsee a stimulus. We didn't see an increase in buying. Instead, the \neconomy continued to go steadily downhill. The payroll tax that is \ndribbled out at $20 or $30 per paycheck is not going to make people \nfeel confident to spend money which, in turn, creates the jobs.\n  I believe we should have tax cuts that are targeted to making people \nspend their money. We have had the converter box coupons that will go \nto offset the cost of the digital transition. You get a coupon in the \nmail. You take it into a dealer that is selling the boxes. It offsets \nthe cost immediately. How about a tax cut that is in the form of a \ncoupon that can only be redeemed if you spend money in certain areas, \nsuch as home improvement, weatherization, where you buy things that \ncreate a market so we won't see retailers or manufacturers having to \nlay people off, as we have seen in the last few weeks? Why not a coupon \nfor expenditures that will ensure that the money is spent for job-\ncreating activities? Why not a tax cut to employers for hiring people? \nThat would be direct. That would say: If you will hire people, we will \ngive you a tax credit. Employers would understand that. That is an \nincentive. Five hundred dollars in payroll taxes dribbled out will not \ngive that confidence. We have the history of last year to show it.\n  Let's talk about the spending. I think we can spend wisely to create \njobs. The Republicans are not against spending. We just want to \nseparate spending that is going to create jobs versus spending that \npeople might like that might be good programs but are not going to \ncreate jobs. That is the division we have now.\n  The spending in this new amendment is better than the original bill. \nThey said they cut about $100 billion, but when you add in the \namendments already in the bill, it is about $50 billion. And some of \nwhat they cut out was the right amount they should have cut out. It was \nthe right types of projects to cut out. I will give them that. I think \nif we had had a more collaborative process from the beginning, we could \ncut out about $200 billion that would not be creating jobs, and we \ncould put it into a stimulus that would.\n  The kind of stimulus we should be targeting is money that we are \ngoing to have to spend anyway, say, over the next 5 years. Let me take, \nfor example, military construction. In military construction, the \nDepartment of Defense\n\n[[Page S2040]]\n\nhas a 5-year plan. We know what the 5-year plan is. In normal times, we \nwould take 1 year at a time. The Department of Defense will put its \nhighest priorities in the first year and then the second year will be \nnext and then the third and fourth and fifth. But if we had a \nstimulative package, we would take that 5-year plan, and we would put \nit into 3 years so the spending would be upfront, and I have an \namendment that will do that.\n  It would create jobs in America, and it would be spending we know we \nare going to do anyway. That spending would create jobs from money we \nare going to spend anyway. So in the last 2 years, we can start going \nback to normal, if the economy has picked up and people are spending \nand we have a lower unemployment rate. We would be able to say: Well, \nwe have already done our military construction spending. We do not need \nto spend that money in those last 2 years and we can start trying to \ncome toward a balanced budget again.\n  We have to start whittling down that $10.6 trillion debt. But, \ninstead, we are going in the opposite direction, adding to that $10.6 \ntrillion debt already on the books.\n  So I think there are some things we could agree to do. But this bill \nhas not gone through the processes that would allow that input. My \namendment has been pending since last week. It has been filed. But no \naction has been taken on it because we are not allowed to have the \naction, and we did not have the action in committee that would have \nallowed amendments.\n  I believe we could have made some headway on military construction. \nThe same for highways. I agree with the highway spending in the bill. I \nthink we should have more in that direction because it is money we are \ngoing to have to spend eventually; move it up to the front. They are \nAmerican jobs. That meets the test.\n  I am very concerned that some of the spending in this bill--in the \nhundreds of millions and billions of dollars--is the kind of spending \nthat is going to increase. It is going to increase payments the people \nare then going to come to expect, and we are not going to be able to \ncome back to normalization, even when we have normalization, and we are \ngoing to keep adding to this debt.\n  I hope my colleagues will pause and realize that for $1 trillion, we \nought to do better for the future generations of our country because if \nour foreign investors in U.S. start beginning to think it is a risk to \ninvest in the United States because we have no means to pay them back, \ntwo things can happen, and both of them are bad. One is they stop \nbuying the debt. Then what are we going to do? The second is, they buy \nthe debt but at what rate? They start raising the interest rates \nbecause the risk is greater. That will increase the economic woes we \nare now experiencing. Neither of those scenarios is a good one.\n  I hope our colleagues will see we are on a road that in the long term \nis not the right road for our country. I respect that everyone is \ntrying to do what is right.\n  I know my colleagues on the Democratic side are trying to do what \nthey think is right. I know the President is. I know the Republicans \nare too. We are in disagreement because we have not had the ability to \nfully come together in a way that will allow give and take, not just to \nhave a bill that is laid before us where we are trying to amend here, \namend there, without any cohesion in what we want to be the final \nresult that would be a collaborative process. But what we have done is \nnot, and at $1 trillion I think we need to do it right.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nMaryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, is there a time limit on the speaking \ntime at this time?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has been yielded 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, thank you very much. Then I will get \nright to it. I have a lot to say in support of this bill.\n  Let me start off by saying we have inherited a terrible mess, but the \nSenate is taking a major step forward to turn the country around by \npassing the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n  By standing with President Obama, we stand for America, to create \njobs for people who have lost them and to help those who have jobs keep \nthem.\n  This bill is about jobs, jobs, jobs. Through the rough and tumble of \nthe legislative process, I do believe the Senate has found a sensible \ncenter. I compliment all of both sides of the aisle who chose to work \nwith each other to accomplish this.\n  This bill balances spending on the public investments and targeted \ntax credits that create jobs without exacerbating the Federal deficit.\n  There is much to commend us about the spending bill. The focus on \nphysical infrastructure is absolutely crucial to my own State of \nMaryland. If one takes something that is not very jazzy to talk about, \nsuch as sewers and water grants, I can only bring to the Senate's \nattention that this stimulus would bring $123 million to Maryland for \nthese projects. But if Governor O'Malley were here, he would say: Thank \nGod. If the people of Montgomery County, Prince Georges County, and \nBaltimore city were here, they would say: Cheers.\n  Over the weekend, we had a terrible water main break in Maryland, in \nBaltimore. It went through Madison Street, near one of our most famous \nCatholic Churches. That church runs a school by the Jesuits, which \nfocuses on giving a Jesuit prep school education practically free to \npoor boys, helping them to find their way. It closed not because of a \nlack of funds but because of a water break.\n  Iggy's, one of our most delicious pizza parlors, was flooded with \nwater not with business because of the water main break.\n  Most recently, a big water main break occurred on River Road in \nMontgomery County. There was a dashing rescue by the brave people, \nfirst responders, of the Montgomery County rescue team, snatching \npeople from waters that cascaded through like it was a Maryland \n``Niagara Falls.'' We have the money and the will to pay for the daring \nrescue, but we want to fix essentially what was a tsunami, a local \ntsunami in Montgomery County. Every time we do this, you have to have \njobs for the people who will actually build the water and sewer \nprograms.\n  I could take you on a tour throughout Maryland. But what we are doing \nis creating jobs, improving the environment and public safety and \npublic health. I could go item after item on these spending issues. \nEducation would be one of the others which is very important.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act creates jobs by investing \nin our infrastructure. It fixes aging physical infrastructure, like \nroads, bridges, and water systems.\n  Water mains are aging. Roadways are turning into rivers. Small \nbusinesses have to shut their doors. Hospitals can't take care of the \nsick.\n  A recent water main break in Baltimore closed St. Ignatius, a school \nthat provides a Jesuit education for poor kids. It closed Iggy's pizza \nparlor, a local Baltimore landmark. It was shut down after the water \nmain break. The owner is not sure when he can reopen his doors.\n  The stimulus provides $123 million for Maryland water and sewer \nprojects. The formula funding to the States is to make low-interest \nloans to localities and utilities. This means local governments won't \nhave to raise rates or cut services.\n  But not all jobs require a shovel to be ready to go. Some need \nmicroscopes and telescopes. High-tech jobs like maritime charting help \nkeep Maryland's economy afloat.\n  There is $80 million to update nautical charts. There is a backlog of \n20,000 square miles. Some nautical charts for the bay have not been \nupdated in decades. The channels have changed naturally. So have the \nboats that go down the channels. Ships are bigger and weigh more.\n  We need accurate charts to make sure boats don't run aground, halting \nthe flow of goods in Baltimore Harbor. It could cause an environmental \nmess and costly clean-up. Maryland can't afford a maritime accident.\n  It makes major investments in education so families and local school \ndistricts can help special needs children.\n\n[[Page S2041]]\n\n  By giving money to the Governor to fill budget gaps in State aid, \nPrince George's County won't have to consolidate 12 schools, increase \nclass size, or cut 900 positions in central administration.\n  By providing funding for Early Head Start, officials in Baltimore \nCity can start serving the 95 percent--7,600--of low-income infants who \nare eligible but do not receive nutritional, health, and education \nservices due to a lack of funding.\n  By providing a surge in title I dollars, Carroll County won't have to \ncut 33 teaching positions that otherwise would be slashed because of \ntight budgets.\n  It provides a social safety net that helps distressed families. It \nhelps with food stamps and nutrition for seniors. It supports Meals on \nWheels so seniors stay in their communities and age in place. Last \nyear, Meals on Wheels of Maryland delivered 780,000 meals to almost \n3,000 seniors.\n  Putting food in people's mouths, about 317,000 Marylanders rely on \nfood stamps each month.\n  It expands Medicaid so States can continue to cover those already on \nMedicaid and expand the program to cover new individuals. About 854,000 \nchildren and adults rely on Medicaid in Maryland. For families of three \nwho make about $52,000 this means elderly won't get dropped from \nnursing homes and children will have health care.\n  It invests in the techno infrastructure, like broadband to expand \nsmall businesses. Rural Maryland will be able to sell agricultural \nproducts or crafts and antiques on e-Bay, running e-based businesses \nout of their homes. Or if they lose a job, they can look for a new job \nonline. And telecommuting is an option, so they may not have to move to \na city to be near a good job.\n  And it has targeted tax breaks to help families and small businesses, \nlike expanding the child tax credit, helping at least 100,000 poor \nchildren in Maryland. It eases the ability to qualify for the \nrefundable child tax credit, and provides up to an additional $2,000 \nfor a family with two children making less than $30,000.\n  Last week we learned that 598,000 people lost their jobs in January. \nThis bill is a victory for America. This bill stimulates the economy \ntoday and lays the groundwork for a stronger economy tomorrow.\n  In addition to what was done the other night and what will pass in \nthis stimulus--and I intend to vote for this stimulus--I am so \nheartened my automobile amendment is included in this bill. It makes \ninterest payments on car loans and State sales or excise car tax \ndeductible for new cars that would be purchased this year.\n  What does it do? It actually gets people in the showroom. It does \nwhat Senator Hutchison talked about. I got 71 votes: 41 Democrats and \n30 Republicans. What does it do? It saves jobs because it gets people \nin the showroom to buy a car; and that means for the people who sell \nthe car, for the auto mechanic who fixes it, for the manufacturer who \nmakes it, and, most of all, for the consumers. They get a chance to buy \na car that will be far more fuel efficient and also lower carbon. Now, \nthat is what both sides of the aisle have talked about.\n  My amendment makes interest payments on car loans and State sales/\nexcise car tax deductible for new cars purchased from November 12, 2008 \nto December 31, 2009.\n  How does this amendment help our economy? It saves jobs. If the \ndomestic auto industry goes bankrupt, the U.S. would lose 3 million \njobs, in manufacturing, repairs and service, car dealerships, and \nscience and engineering. It helps consumers. A family would save about \n$1,553 on a $25,000 car, such as a Dodge minivan. Cars are most \nfamilies' biggest purchases after their homes. It supports States and \nlocal governments. States rely on car excise taxes for their \ninfrastructure projects. More car sales means more revenue for \nstruggling State and local governments.\n  It is urgently needed. To reach viability, the Big Three need U.S. \nnew car sales to be at 13 million a year at a minimum. Sales in \nDecember were more than 20 percent below that minimum--10.3 million a \nyear. This is the only proposal that will stimulate demand up the \nsupply chain so that the Big Three's restructuring plans will work.\n  Who would qualify for this tax deduction? Families who make less than \n$250,000; $125,000 for individuals. The deduction is ``above-the-\nline''--meaning it can be taken advantage of by itemizers and \nnonitemizers. It only applies on cars that are less than $49,500.\n  I have a statement from someone whom I never thought I would be in \nalignment with, the economist Martin Feldstein. He is on the \nconservative side, and everybody knows you kind of cover me blue. He \nsays what we should focus on is providing incentives to households and \nbusinesses to increase current spending. Why not a tax credit to \nhouseholds to purchase cars or other consumer durables?\n  I will quote from his article, dated Thursday, January 29, 2009, in \nthe Washington Post:\n\n       As a conservative economist, I might be expected to oppose \n     a stimulus plan. In fact, on this page in October, I declared \n     my support for a stimulus. But the fiscal package now before \n     Congress needs to be thoroughly revised. In its current form, \n     it does too little to raise national spending and employment. \n     It would be better for the Senate to delay legislation for a \n     month, or even two, if that's what it takes to produce a much \n     better bill. We cannot afford an $800 billion mistake.\n       Start with the tax side. The plan is to give a tax cut of \n     $500 a year for two years to each employed person. That's not \n     a good way to increase consumer spending. Experience shows \n     that the money from such temporary, lump-sum tax cuts is \n     largely saved or used to pay down debt. Only about 15 percent \n     of last year's tax rebates led to additional spending.\n       The proposed business tax cuts are also likely to do little \n     to increase business investment and employment. The extended \n     loss ``carrybacks'' are primarily lump-sum payments to \n     selected companies. The bonus depreciation plan would do \n     little to raise capital spending in the current environment \n     of weak demand because the tax benefits in the early years \n     would be recaptured later.\n       Instead, the tax changes should focus on providing \n     incentives to households and businesses to increase current \n     spending. Why not a temporary refundable tax credit to \n     households that purchase cars or other major consumer \n     durables, analogous to the investment tax credit for \n     businesses? Or a temporary tax credit for home improvements? \n     In that way, the same total tax reduction could produce much \n     more spending and employment.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. My time has expired. Madam President, I ask for 2 \nminutes to conclude.\n  All I say is this: I thank the Chair for allowing me to offer the \namendment. But if you want a car at your house, call the White House or \ncall the House of Representatives. The problem now is not the idea but \nit is the politics. Let's get the White House on our side. Let's get \nthe House of Representatives on this side. Flood not the streets but \nflood them with the phone calls. Call these numbers. Let's get America \nrolling again.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nNew York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank my colleague from Maryland, who is doing a great job on the \ncar amendment, and my colleague from Montana, the chair, who has led us \nextremely well on this legislation.\n  We are trying to deal with an economic crisis that grows worse day by \nday, similar to an economic 9/11 that ought to be bringing us together. \nThe economy is hurtling southward. People are laid off every second and \nevery minute. You get on the phone and talk to someone you know--I \nspoke to a friend of mine. Her sister had been laid off. I went to a \nlocal Italian restaurant. The waiter's wife had been laid off. The \nwoman who cuts my hair, her husband has been laid off.\n  We are hemorrhaging jobs. The middle class is losing dollars. The \ncountry could edge over into a recessionary spiral downward that \nactually turns into deflation, which could, God forbid, turn into a \ndepression. Yet while President Obama shows leadership, the other side \nis still adamantly sticking to policies that do not work. They are \narguing for marginal rate cuts and choosing to ignore that the very \npurpose of a stimulus package is to spend money, to help fill the void \nleft by a dramatic reduction in consumer and business spending.\n  This package certainly does not have everything I want or any single \nMember wants. But for the sake of this\n\n[[Page S2042]]\n\ncountry, we all must give and come together and get it passed--not only \npassing on the floor today but getting this passed in conference \nquickly because every day we wait more are laid off.\n  In my judgment, this package should be more heavily tilted toward \nspending, jobs, putting money in the pocket of the middle class. This \nis a position supported by the vast majority of mainstream economists.\n  The President and Senate Democrats have bent over backward to \naccommodate views we do not feel accurately portray what needs to be \ndone. People are criticizing President Obama for being partisan last \nnight. But let me tell you, he and we have reached out and done our \nbest to bring Republicans along. But as the President said last night, \ndrawing the line at continuing the very policies that got us into this \nposition in the first place is the proper place to draw that line. To \npass a bill with 80 votes that would do nothing to help the average \nperson would be a far greater failure than passing a bill with 61 votes \nthat starts our economy moving again.\n  There are three criteria for this bill, simply put: jobs, tax cuts \nfor the middle class, and rebuilding our infrastructure. Let me repeat \nthat: jobs, tax cuts for the middle class, and rebuilding our \ninfrastructure. Most every provision in this bill does one of those \nthree things now. Lots of little porky things have been taken out.\n  So while some of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want \nto cure the Bush recession with the Bush economic plan, the President \nwas right to say no. As for bipartisanship, we have been trying; Lord, \nwe have been trying. The two largest amendments added to this bill--a \ntotal of $106 billion of the $840 billion in the bill--were added by \nRepublicans. This isn't just allowing people to debate; this isn't just \nsaying we will listen to you and not do what you want. Again, let me \nrepeat: The two biggest amendments added to the recovery package were \nRepublican amendments, Senator Isakson's at $36 billion and Senator \nGrassley's at $70 billion, and they didn't vote for the bill. What do \nyou want out of us? This is not a small little bauble of $10 million in \ntax cuts or in spending. This is close to one-eighth of the entire \nbill, and it doesn't bring us a single vote. How can you say we are not \nbeing bipartisan when we have allowed major changes to be made to this \nbill, despite the President's wishes?\n\n  What has happened here is very simple. Our Republican colleagues want \nthe right to add amendments but never will vote for the bill, except \nfor three courageous Senators--two from Maine, one from Pennsylvania. \nWhat more can we do? There were 472 amendments filed, 48 considered, 27 \noffered by Republicans, a good bunch of those accepted. Many of us \nvoted for them. What more bipartisanship do you want?\n  Here is the sad fact. The sad fact is this: Unless the bill is all \ntax cuts mostly for the wealthy and has virtually no spending, a large \nnumber on the other side will never vote for it. Never. So all the talk \nof bipartisanship is that: mere talk. We are walking the walk. We are \nadding Republican amendments. We are giving people a chance to offer \namendments. We are not so-called ``filling the tree'' and blocking \ndebate. We have to scrounge, beg, and plead, for three votes. Again, I \nsalute those three who did it. They made changes in the package that I \ndidn't want. I would rather see more money in education. I would rather \nsee ours similar to the House bill, which has 34 percent tax cuts and \n66 percent creating jobs and helping people keep jobs, but again we \nwent from 34 percent tax cuts to 44 percent.\n  I wish to make one other point before I conclude. Many on the other \nside point to one little provision or another. They say, Well, there is \nmoney for STD; there is money for the Mall. Well, we took those out, \nbut make no mistake about it, if we took them out, they still weren't \ngoing to vote for the bill. They were excuses. Let me say this to all \nof the chattering class that so much focuses on those little tiny, yes, \nporky amendments. The American people don't care. The American people \ncare far more that there is a proposal in the bill--this one I pushed--\nthat gives a $2,500 credit to families who pay tuition to put their \nkids through college. Great relief. They care far more about that than \nabout some small provision in the bill that shouldn't be there, because \nthe tax relief from tuition costs they are going to get means far more \nto them. They care more about a provision that keeps the teachers in \ntheir schools. They care far more about the provisions that will build \nroads and bridges and employ people in their communities. So to all of \nus, particularly on my side, let's not fall for the bait. Let's not \nmake this a bill that is mostly things such as refurbishing the Mall or \nsexually transmitted diseases which should be out of the bill. It is a \nbill about jobs. It is a bill about tax cuts to the middle class. It is \na bill about infrastructure. The American people know that. They know \nthey are hurting. They know we have reached out, and they know we have \nto act.\n  So we will not be diverted. We will do our best to bring more \nRepublicans over to our side, and I hope that happens this week. We \nwill be open to new suggestions just as we were to $106 billion in \nsuggestions that were added to the bill. But we will not sacrifice the \nfocus of this bill: jobs, tax cuts for the middle class, and \ninfrastructure for anything, because America demands that we get \nourselves out of this mess.\n  I salute our President. He put together a great package. My \ncolleagues in the House improved on it. We in the Senate reluctantly \nhad to pull back on certain portions of the House bill to get the 60 \nvotes necessary, and we did it for the good of the country, even though \neach of us would have written it differently. Now we must move forward. \nI urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider, to \nacknowledge that we have been very bipartisan, to acknowledge that our \ncountry has a crisis, to acknowledge that they actually lost the \nelection and can't write the whole bill, even though they will have \nsome suggestions; and I urge that we all come together the way we did \nafter 9/11 when there was another crisis and move this country forward.\n  I yield my remaining time to my friend from Montana and yield the \nfloor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I am deeply troubled by the enormous \ndebt this legislation is creating for future generations. Under almost \nany other circumstance I would vote against this bill for that very \nreason. But our economy is in desperate shape, and we are facing the \nworst economic crisis since World War II.\n  Since the recession began a little over a year ago, 3.6 million jobs \nhave been lost, with nearly half of those coming just in the last 3 \nmonths. The unemployment rate is 7.6 percent and rising, and the number \nof unemployed is approaching 5 million.\n  The deeply flawed financial regulatory policies of the last two \ndecades paved the way for this economic collapse, and the budget \npolicies of the last 8 years have left us ill-equipped to address it \nwithout running up hundreds of billions in debt.\n  There are no good options, but doing nothing is simply unacceptable.\n  The bill on which we will vote today is far from perfect. On that \nthere is nearly unanimous agreement. The question before us, then, is \nwhether to vote against this bill and hope we can produce legislation \nthat will be more effective, or to support this bill and begin to do \nsomething, however imperfect, to stop the economy from plunging \nfurther.\n  Given the current makeup of the Senate, it is extremely unlikely that \nthe Senate will produce a better bill. We could work on it for another \ncouple of weeks, but the changes would be small. It is far more \nimportant that we act to prime the economic pump, and that we do so \nsoon. And for that reason, I will support this far from perfect \nmeasure, and hope that it will be improved in conference.\n  But this bill should not set a new precedent for budget policies. \nOnce we stop the economic plunge, we absolutely must return to a \nsustainable budget policy, one that will reduce the mountain of debt we \nhave left to our children and grandchildren.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I support the Economic Recovery and \nReinvestment Act.\n  This legislation will create jobs by encouraging innovation for the \ndevelopment of clean energy and strengthening our Nation's \ninfrastructure. This\n\n[[Page S2043]]\n\nvital bill will assist States so that they can continue to provide \nvital services. States need help in meeting the social service and \nhealth care needs of their communities. As economic activity has \ndeclined, State revenues have also decreased. Supporting States so that \nthey can continue to provide health care coverage and essential social \nservices will help our constituents in this great time of need. States \nmust be good stewards of these resources and utilize them for their \nintended purposes. This recovery bill will also provide relief to \nworkers and families hardest hit by the economic recession.\n  I am proud to support provisions in the Economic Recovery and \nReinvestment Act which will bring financial relief to our Nation's \nstruggling public schools, colleges and universities. Our Nation's \nfuture depends upon our ability to provide our keiki with the \neducational opportunities they need today so they can compete in \ntomorrow's global economy. The Senate bill includes $39 billion in much \nneeded funding to assist our local school districts as well as public \ncolleges and universities. It also includes funding for teacher quality \npartnership grants to improve the quality of new teachers and encourage \nindividuals to enter the teaching field. In addition, the Senate-passed \nversion also provides $12.4 billion in title I grants to Local \nEducation Agencies to help our Nation's most disadvantaged students. \nThe Senate bill also helps students and their families achieve the \ndream of a higher education by increasing the Pell Grant maximum award \nby $281 for award year 2009-2010 and then by $400 for 2010-2011.\n  I am pleased that the legislation includes significant funding that \nwill benefit the Department of Veterans Affairs and the veterans it \nserves. I have been working, along with other members of the Veterans' \nAffairs Committee, to advocate for the needs of veterans in the context \nof this recovery and reinvestment bill. I am very grateful to the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Hawaii's senior Senator, Mr. \nInouye, for hearing our message and providing tangible results.\n  The money in this package that is appropriated for VA will help \nadvance a number of projects that have been languishing for too long. \nFor example, VA has a $10 billion backlog in major health care \nfacilities construction. This stimulus package includes $3.7 billion \nfor health care and services, the vast majority of it for facility \nconstruction.\n  Included in that sum is $1.1 billion for major facility construction \nthat can be used to build new hospitals for veterans who have \ninsufficient access to health care, or have lost use of their hospital \ndue to damage or disrepair. Another $1.37 billion is targeted on \ncrucial nonrecurring maintenance to facilities that need upgrades or \nrepairs. There is also nearly $940 million appropriated for minor \nconstruction, which will be used to build new community based \noutpatient clinics, among other purposes.\n  The legislation also includes $50 million to improve benefits for \nveterans.\n  I am pleased with the almost $65 million intended for VA's National \nCemetery Administration. Of this amount, $60 million will be used to \nprovide much needed cemetery infrastructure support and repair and \ninvestment in VA's National Shrine initiative. I believe the funding \nwill go a long way toward meeting our obligation to provide final \nresting places for veterans and honor their service on our behalf.\n  As helpful as this infusion of funding will be, I remind all of my \ncolleagues that this only addresses existing, unmet needs. When it is \ntime to begin work on the new budget, we cannot subtract any money from \nthe VA appropriation, as all of those funds will be needed to meet the \nnew fiscal year's costs.\n  I am pleased that Veterans' Affairs Committee staff was able to work \nwith the Finance Committee to ensure that certain VA beneficiaries \nreceive economic recovery payments. I appreciate the willingness of the \nFinance Committee to make certain that VA beneficiaries, who might not \notherwise receive a payment, get one in this time of economic \nuncertainty.\n  I also commend my colleague, Senator Inouye, for his ongoing advocacy \non behalf of the Filipino veterans of World War II. This legislation \ncontains an authorization for a lump sum payment for funds that were \nappropriated last session for these veterans.\n  I look forward to swift enactment of this essential legislation \nintended to help working families, create jobs, improve infrastructure, \nand assist veterans.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, for the past week, the Senate has been \ndebating an economic recovery plan introduced by Senators Inouye and \nBaucus. I support this plan because the American people and their \ncommunities need it to create jobs, help stabilize the economy, and \nprotect those who have been most hurt by the current global economic \nand financial crises.\n  We are confronting the most severe economic problems this country has \nexperienced in generations. The U.S. economy has been in recession \nsince December 2007. America's GDP declined 3.8 percent in the fourth \nquarter of 2008, the steepest drop since 1982. The United States lost \n2.6 million jobs last year, the most since 1945. And last week we \nlearned that the U.S. economy shed 598,000 jobs in January, putting the \nunemployment rate at 7.6 percent.\n  In my home State of Vermont, not only has the amount of credit \navailable to small businesses shrunk significantly, but our \nunemployment rate jumped to 6.4 percent in December--the highest \nmeasurement in more than 15 years. With many more firms announcing \nlayoffs in January and so far in February, the economic numbers are \nshaping up as even bleaker news for America's working families, and \nalso for America's now out-of-work families.\n  Of course, Vermont is not alone in this struggle. Workers, \nbusinesses, and State and local governments all across the country face \nmounting debt, slumping orders, and sagging budgets.\n  To respond to this extraordinary crisis, I agree with President Obama \nand a vast majority of Americans that we must act quickly and \nresponsibly to pass an economic recovery and job creation plan as bold \nas the challenges we face. By acting now to strengthen our economy and \ninvest in America's future, we can create good-paying jobs, cut taxes \nfor working families, and make responsible investments in our future.\n  Our No. 1 priority should be to put America back to work. This \neconomic recovery plan we are debating today will help create or save \nmillion of jobs, including an entire generation of green jobs that will \nmake public and private investments in renewable energy and make \nAmerica more energy efficient.\n  Investing in our country's infrastructure and education will do more \nthan create jobs today--it also will put the country back on a long-\nterm path toward prosperity. Rebuilding our roads and bridges; \nexpanding broadband access to rural communities; making our energy grid \nsmart and more efficient; constructing state-of-the-art classrooms, \nlabs and libraries; and investing in job training that Americans will \nneed to succeed in the 21st century economy will give us tangible \nassets that we can use for years to come to foster additional economic \ngrowth.\n  But it has been interesting over the past week to listen to the \nimpassioned speeches of some members of the minority party in relation \nto this economic recovery bill. Despite all of the pain being felt in \nAmerica today, it is as if their tax-cutting policies, in effect for \nthe past 8 years, were a resounding success and built a strong economy, \nrather than left the American people with a trillion-dollar deficit and \nthe highest unemployment rates in recent history. It is as if they have \nsomehow convinced themselves that we should go right on supporting the \nBush administration's policies that the voters soundly rejected last \nNovember.\n  For instance, I have heard criticism about the increased Federal \nfunding for State and local law enforcement in this bill. Some have \ncalled this a ``pet project'' which will do little to stimulate the \neconomy. Nothing could be further from the truth. Tough economic times \ncreate conditions that can too easily lead to a spike in crime. Just 2 \nweeks ago, USA Today reported a study by the Police Executive Research \nForum finding that nearly half of the 233 police agencies surveyed had \nseen significant increases in crime since the economic crisis began. \nMaintaining effective State and local law enforcement during a time of \nbudget cutting\n\n[[Page S2044]]\n\nat the State and local levels is key to our efforts to combat the \nscourge of drugs and crime.\n  The funding the Senate has included in the recovery package for State \nand local law enforcement will not only help to address vital crime \nprevention needs, but will also have an immediate and positive impact \non the economy, as police chiefs and experts from across the country \ntold the Senate Judiciary Committee in our first hearing of the year, \nwhich I chaired last month. Hiring new police officers will stimulate \nthe economy as fast as, or faster than, other spending. For \nconstruction jobs, only 30 to 40 percent of the funds go to salaries, \nbut in police hiring, nearly 100 percent of the money goes to creating \njobs.\n  We also need to remember that crime and drugs are not just big city \nissues. I held Judiciary Committee hearings in Rutland and St. Albans, \nVT, last year to seek solutions to the growing problem of drug crime in \nrural areas. Rural areas, which lack the crime prevention and law \nenforcement resources often available in larger communities, have in \nmany cases been hit particularly hard by the economic crisis. The \nSenate bill's inclusion of such assistance is important and should \nremain.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate has chosen to include in its \nrecovery package funding for programs protecting women who are victims \nof violence through the Violence Against Women Act, as well as for \nvictims of crime--addressing those who are most vulnerable to the \nlikely increases in crime in a down economy. Law enforcement officials \nand victims' advocates have made clear to the Judiciary Committee that \nin the current economic crisis there are more victims than ever in need \nof more help than before, but funding sources for victim services are \nscarce. Those already victimized by crime should not also be victims of \nour struggling economy.\n  I have also long held the view that American innovation can and \nshould play a vital role in revitalizing our economy and in improving \nour Nation's health care system. I commend the lead sponsors of the \neconomic recovery legislation for making sure that this bill includes \nan investment in health information technology that takes meaningful \nsteps to protect the privacy of American consumers. The privacy \nprotections for electronic health records in the economic recovery \npackage are essential to a successful national health IT system. Among \nother things, these privacy safeguards give each individual the right \nto access his or her own electronic health records and the right to \ntimely notice of data breaches involving their health information, and \nthe safeguards place critical restrictions on the sale of sensitive \nhealth data.\n  Also crucial are funds for fraud enforcement, which is necessary for \nprotecting the integrity and efficiency not only of the financial \nsystem, but also of the spending in this bill--the very concern that \ncritics of the bill keep harping on. The economic crisis has revealed \nan epidemic of fraud related to the mortgage fraud crisis and the \nresulting corporate collapses. The FBI and other Federal agencies will \nsoon be overwhelmed with new cases. In the past year, the FBI has \nreceived more than 60,000 Suspicious Activity Reports from banks, a \nnumber which has doubled in 3 years, but currently there are fewer than \n200 agents assigned to investigate these criminal allegations. The \nsignificant funding included in the Senate recovery and reinvestment \nbill would help the FBI hold accountable those responsible for \ncontributing to our economic crisis.\n  Nobody thinks this bill is perfect. Like most bills, there are things \nin it that I like and other things that I disagree with. We are part of \na global economic recession involving forces that extend far beyond our \nborders, and nobody thinks this bill will eliminate unemployment \ncompletely or solve all our fiscal problems. It took years to get us \ninto this mess, and it will take years to get us out. There is no quick \nfix--not this bill, not any bill.\n  But America is hurting, and Americans urgently need our help. They \nwant action and solutions. I strongly support this economic recovery \npackage because I believe it would provide a direct infusion of \nemergency aid to create new jobs, help save existing jobs, make \nsignificant infrastructure investments, provide relief for massive \nState budget deficits, and relieve the tax burden on struggling \nfamilies. We have had a long, tough debate here in the Senate, but \nAmerica deserves nothing less than our best effort.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this economic stimulus bill contains \n$87.7 billion to bail out State Medicaid programs and more than $21 \nbillion to have the Government control the adoption rate of health \ninformation technology (health IT) through Medicare and Medicaid.\n  We are in the middle of an economic crisis today. Yet the health IT \nspending through Medicare and Medicaid will not start until 2011. \nInterestingly enough, the Congressional Budget Office, CBO, has stated \nit ``anticipates near-universal adoption of health IT over the next \nquarter century even without legislative action. As a result, the 0.3 \npercent reduction in health care costs estimated to result in the near \nterm from enactment of this bill would diminish in later years, when \nthe use of health IT will be more pervasive in any event.'' So this \nstimulus bill spends money more than 2 years after the economic crisis \nhas started on an issue that the market would have addressed on its \nown.\n  This is just one of the many examples that illustrate that the \nstimulus is, as recently noted by the Wall Street Journal's editorial \npage, ``90 percent social policy and 10 percent economic policy.'' I \nbelieve that this ``social policy'' will be counterproductive to the \ngoals of universal adoption of health IT because it will mire the \nhealth care system in new bureaucratic red tape.\n  Another example of the stimulus's social policies is its inclusion of \n$1.1 billion for research on medical treatment comparative \neffectiveness. This is to be used to ``accelerate the development and \ndissemination of research assessing the comparative clinical \neffectiveness of health care treatments and strategies, including \nthrough efforts that: (1) conduct, support, or synthesize research that \ncompares the clinical outcomes, effectiveness, and appropriateness of \nitems, services, and procedures that are used to prevent, diagnose, or \ntreat diseases, disorders, and other health conditions and (2) \nencourage the development and use of clinical registries, clinical data \nnetworks, and other forms of electronic health data that can be used to \ngenerate or obtain outcomes data.''\n  Included in this $1.1 billion spending is a $400 million ``slush \nfund'' given to the Secretary of Health and Human Services, HHS, that \ncould be construed to allow the Secretary to use however he or she \nwishes. Let me be clear, none of the comparative effectiveness research \nfunding under the stimulus may be used for anything but research on \ncomparative clinical effectiveness.\n  While I recognize and appreciate that the comparative effectiveness \nprovisions of this bill only permit comparative clinical effectiveness, \nI am concerned that this lays the groundwork for comparative cost \neffectiveness with bills that the Obama administration will push and \nCongress will consider in the future. Why else would they be pushing to \nspend $1.1 billion on comparative clinical effectiveness, if the \nintention was not to one day tie the answers from that research to cost \nand coverage decisions?\n  To quote one of President Obama's top White House health advisers, \nJeanne Lambrew, ``There is a bipartisan--I should be careful about the \nbipartisan, working the bipartisanship in the Senate. The House isn't \nquite as bipartisan as we would like but there has been support for \ninvesting about $1.1 billion in this economic recovery act for over two \nyears for ARC and partly for NIH and partly for under agency activities \nto begin to try to say how do we get at the relative costs, excuse me, \nthe relative effectiveness of the different services.'' That statement \ncould be characterized as a Freudian slip.\n  While Congress has limited comparative effectiveness research funding \nin the stimulus to clinical effectiveness questions, I am concerned \nthat the sponsors of this bill and the Obama administration have plans \nto force on the American public coverage decisions based on comparative \ncost effectiveness. Make no mistake: I will vigorously fight those \nefforts in the future.\n  In addition to the comparative clinical effectiveness research \nspending, the stimulus bill creates a structure\n\n[[Page S2045]]\n\nsimilar to the Federal Health Board described in the book ``Critical'' \nby former Senator Tom Daschle. President Obama endorsed this book and \nhas relied on Senator Daschle's advice in crafting his health care \nagenda. A new, bureaucratic Federal Coordinating Council for \nComparative Clinical Effectiveness Research would be established under \nsection 802 of the stimulus. The council will advise the President and \nCongress on No. 1. strategies with respect to the infrastructure needs \nof comparative clinical effectiveness research within the Federal \nGovernment; No. 2. appropriate organizational expenditures for \ncomparative clinical effectiveness research by relevant Federal \ndepartments and agencies; and No. 3. opportunities to assure optimum \ncoordination of comparative clinical effectiveness and related health \nservices research conducted or supported by relevant Federal \ndepartments and agencies, with the goal of reducing duplicative efforts \nand encouraging coordinated and complementary use of resources.\n  The council would be composed of 15 members, all of whom are senior \nFederal officers or employees with responsibility for health-related \nprograms. It concerns me that no attempt is made with this language to \nensure council membership includes private, nongovernment experts. The \nAmerican people know that medical experts at places like Harvard, Johns \nHopkins, and Yale have more expertise on medical issues than \nbureaucrats at the Department of Health and Human Services. In the \nfuture, I will work to ensure that this council--and the American \npeople--benefit from the expertise that resides in the minds of our \ncountry's premier medical experts.\n  The council would report annually on Federal activities in this area \nand recommendations for further research. While I recognize and \nappreciate that the comparative clinical effectiveness research and the \ncouncil in the stimulus do not go as far as the board outlined in \nSenator Daschle's book, I am gravely concerned that it is simply the \nprecursor to a full-fledged Federal Health Board. In Senator Daschle's \nown words, a Federal Health Board may alter the traditional doctor-\npatient relationship by giving the Federal Health Board new powers to \nmake coverage decisions about medical technologies, treatments, drugs, \nand procedures, ``Doctors and patients might resent any encroachment on \ntheir ability to choose certain treatments . . .''\n  The model proposed by Senator Daschle and endorsed by President \nObama--and which I am concerned the stimulus lays the groundwork for--\nwould be disastrous for American patients. This exact model is a failed \npolicy of the past in Great Britain's health care system. Great \nBritain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellent, NICE, \nevaluates new medical drugs and treatments for coverage decisions for \nall British citizens.\n  An approach like NICE neglects the basic fact that medical decisions \nvary by individual patient and disease processes. Medicine is not \nsimply a cold science; it is also an art that reflects each individual \npatient's condition.\n  An approach like NICE will ultimately attach price tags to patients' \nlives and result in treatment rationing. To quote my friend Dr. Scott \nGottlieb in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion editorial, ``[NICE] \nhas concluded that $45,000 is the most worth paying for products that \nextend a person's life by one `quality-adjusted' year. (By their \ncalculus, a year combating cancer is worth less than a year in perfect \nhealth.) . . . In Britain, there's vocal dissent against NICE \nconstraints, especially among the cancer patients who are denied many \neffective new drugs that, for now, are widely prescribed in the U.S. \nThe rich, of course, are able to opt out of the British controls. But \nthe rest of the country has to appeal to politicians--rather than their \ndoctors--to gain access to restricted medicines.''\n  Rather than top-down Government solutions that control costs by one-\nsize-fits-all coverage mandates, I believe that a health care market \nthat plays by fair rules is a far more powerful force to control costs \nand improve quality. The American people know it works because that \ncompetition and entrepreneurship has worked in every other American \nindustry. I support creating a health care system where patients and \ndoctors are able to make decisions based on individual patient \nconditions and needs.\n  The American people know that bureaucrats and politicians cannot be \ntrusted as the ultimate arbiters of medical decisions. I will \nvigorously oppose any efforts to take choice and individualized care \naway from patients and their doctors.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, this is a truly historic moment. We are \ntaking a bold step to meet the greatest challenge to our Nation's \ncontinued prosperity in a generation. Thanks to visionary leadership \nfrom our new President and from our leaders here in Congress, we can \noffer new hope for working families throughout the Nation.\n  America is mired in a crisis unlike any we have seen since the Great \nDepression. Trillions of dollars of hard-earned wealth have been wiped \nout. Families are losing their homes, their jobs, their health care, \ntheir life savings, and their hopes for the future.\n  At the heart of this economic turmoil is the collapse of the jobs \nmarket. We lost 2.6 million jobs last year. Over 11 million Americans \nare unemployed--that is more than four unemployed workers for every job \nopening in the country. We recently learned that there were 626,000 new \njobless claims in the past week and that 4.8 million Americans are \ncollecting unemployment compensation--the highest number on record. The \nmonthly job numbers released last Friday show that the national \nunemployment rate has reached 7.6 percent. In many States, unemployment \nhas already reached 8, 9, or even 10 percent.\n  Getting laid off can start a devastating downward spiral. It often \nmeans the loss of health insurance, leaving families with exorbitant \nmedical bills when they can least afford them. It means more parents \ncan no longer afford to send their children to college or even put food \non the table or heat their homes.\n  We need to turn our economy around, and we need to do it now. \nEconomists agree that only ambitious and aggressive job creation \npolicies--and strong government investment in our nation's future can \nspark a revival of our economy.\n  In November, Americans voted overwhelmingly for change--for action \nover gridlock, for practical solutions over ideology, and for a \ngovernment that has a role to play in advancing our common prosperity. \nPresident Obama has called on us to pass a bold economic recovery bill \nthat embraces these priorities and the bill before us will do that.\n  First and foremost, this legislation would create good new jobs by \nrepairing and replacing aging infrastructure. The funding included for \nwater infrastructure--both for wastewater and for drinking water--is \nlong overdue. In New England, we have some of the oldest sewer \ninfrastructure in the Nation. Much of it was built in bygone years when \nexcess sewage was dumped into public waterways. These funds are a good \nstart, but much more must be done to replace these so-called combined \nsewer systems.\n  Similarly, the bill's investments in roads, bridges, and transit are \nabsolutely essential to putting people back to work, and to avoiding \nsome of the catastrophes we have seen, such as the I-35 bridge collapse \nin Minnesota. I commend the bill's managers for recognizing how \nessential these projects are for the Nation's future.\n  In all, the Congressional Budget Office reports that economic \nrecovery legislation could save or create up to 2.4 million new jobs \nthis year, up to 3.9 million jobs in 2010, and up to 1.9 million jobs \nin 2011. These jobs will make a tremendous difference in revitalizing \nour economy.\n  But in the meantime, millions of Americans still need help to weather \nthe storm. That is why this bill extends and temporarily increases \nunemployment insurance benefits. These extra dollars will give a strong \nboost to economic growth, while putting more money in the pockets of \nmillions of Americans facing the worst job market in a quarter century.\n  Unfortunately, there are millions of hard-working Americans who have \ncontributed to this vital program, but who don't benefit from it. Only \n37 percent of unemployed workers receive benefits. These rules are \nparticularly unfair to the most vulnerable Americans--including low-\nwage workers and the\n\n[[Page S2046]]\n\nmany women who juggle work and childcare responsibilities.\n  There is no better time to strengthen this vital safety net and \nextend it to Americans who have funded it with their hard-earned \ndollars. That is why I am pleased that this legislation includes \nprovisions from the Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act, a \nbipartisan bill which I have worked on with Senators Baucus, Snowe, \nStabenow, Rockefeller, and many others. These provisions will \nimmediately improve coverage for more than 500,000 workers unable to \nqualify for these benefits now. It will also provide needed funds to \nStates to keep their unemployment offices open and running smoothly, \neven under the overwhelming flood of applications from workers who have \nlost their jobs.\n  The recovery package also strengthens the safety net by making other \nimportant investments in the health and wellbeing of children and low-\nincome families. It provides major increases for the School Lunch \nProgram, food stamps, Meals on Wheels, food bank aid, and low-income \nweatherization assistance. These programs are particularly vital today, \nwhen family budgets are being stripped to the bone.\n  I am especially pleased by the increase in food stamp aid. More than \nhalf a million residents in Massachusetts rely on food stamps to buy \nfood each month. Nearly 70 percent of the assistance goes to households \nwith children, and 20 percent goes to households with an elderly \nperson.\n  These investments are essential to meet the needs of our most \nvulnerable citizens. In fact, increased spending on food stamps is \namong the most effective ways to stimulate the economy, and I commend \nthe leadership for bringing forward a bill that makes this kind of wise \nand compassionate investment.\n  The legislation will also immediately help Americans to stay healthy, \nthus making them more productive and successful. It provides job \nsupport in medical research. It promotes a primary care workforce. It \nhelps unemployed workers protect their health while looking for new \njobs and opportunities.\n  To create a healthier America, we need greater emphasis on \nprevention. Citizens need access to primary care providers and \npreventive screenings, communities need vigorous prevention \ninitiatives, and the nation needs a strong national public health \ninfrastructure and workforce. In our ongoing discussions and work on \nhealth reform, it is vital for us to address how best to support \nprevention and wellness and revitalize our public health system.\n  Funds provided in the bill are also an important first step in \nincreasing the nation's ability to conduct comparative effectiveness \nresearch and achieve the important goal of helping Americans obtain the \nright care, in the right place, at the right time, every time.\n  It makes no sense to hamstring such research by placing unnecessary \nrestrictions on what may and may not be studied. Limiting studies only \nto the clinical practice of medicine could inadvertently prohibit \nresearch comparing reforms in health services. One of the best examples \nof comparative effectiveness research is a study of patients with \npneumonia, which has helped us understand who should be hospitalized \nand who can be cared for at home. That is important science, and we \nneed to encourage it.\n  Obviously, this stimulus funding is by no means the end of the \ncomparative effectiveness research movement. It is just the beginning. \nThe debate over what research should be conducted, how it should be \ngoverned, and how it should be used should be reserved for the ongoing \npolicy discussion.\n  The legislation also includes important investments in health \ninformation technology. Use of electronic medical records will enable \nour health care system to provide the highest possible quality of care, \nand also benefit from the improved efficiency that other industries \nhave already achieved through IT. This investment will help develop a \nhigh-tech infrastructure for our health care system, and it will also \ncreate high paying jobs today. IT industry experts estimate that every \n$10 billion spent on health information will create more than 200,000 \njobs in manufacturing, software development and information technology \nservices.\n  Finally, the recovery package before us also takes important steps to \nstrengthen education as a key strategy to revitalize the economy and \nmove America forward. It includes important investments at every point \nin the education pipeline. It will help to prevent harmful teacher \nlayoffs and cuts in school budgets, expand access to child care and \npreschool programs, and strengthen Pell grants to provide a lifeline of \nassistance to needy college students.\n  American education is severely affected by the economic downturn. \nThis package responds directly to that challenge by beginning to revive \nAmerica's preschool classrooms, its elementary, middle, and high \nschools, and colleges.\n  Resources devoted to education and to the future of America's youth \nare among the most important investments proposed in this legislation, \nand this assistance couldn't come at a better time. According to the \nCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, 34 States have implemented or \nproposed cuts in K-12 education. It is part of the economic crunch of \nrising unemployment, declining consumer spending, and home \nforeclosures. Per pupil spending has been reduced, school breakfast \nprograms have been eliminated, training for teachers and principals has \nbeen cut off, and in some cases schools have been forced to reduce \nhours in the school day or shorten the school year.\n  Across the Nation, school superintendents have implemented or plan to \nimplement staff reductions. Many school districts facing shrinking \nbudgets are planning cuts in math and science classes, in new teacher \nprogramming, and in teacher mentoring--and they are also increasing \nclass sizes. We must not force America's students to bear these high \ncosts of our economic crisis.\n  I am especially pleased, therefore, that this legislation includes \n$39 billion in emergency basic aid to states to prevent harsh cutbacks \nand reduce budget shortfalls in early childhood education, K-12 \neducation, and higher education. Such aid is a lifeline of support for \nAmerica's preschools, classrooms, and college campuses.\n  The bill also makes a significant commitment toward meeting the needs \nof low-income children, by providing $12.4 billion under title I of the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, and provides an unprecedented \n$13.5 billion to assist schools in meeting their commitment to students \nwith special needs under the Individuals with Disabilities Education \nAct.\n  The increase in funding for title I immediately demonstrates our \ncommitment to prevent harmful cuts and deliver the support and \nsolutions needed for schools to close achievement gaps and meet the \ngoals of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  The investment in IDEA is a down payment towards finally meeting the \nFederal Government's 33-year old promise to fund 40 percent of the \naverage per-pupil expenditure for every child in special education. The \nFederal Government now funds less than half of this commitment, because \nof the economic shortfall at the local level that is being exacerbated \nby the current crisis.\n  I am also pleased that this legislation makes a key investment in \nupgrading schools for the 21st century by investing in the education \ntechnology program under the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  For low-income college students across the country, the bill \nincreases the maximum Pell grant by $281 for the next school year, and \nby $400 for the year after that. College costs have risen by more than \n400 percent over the past 20 years, but the size of the Pell grant has \nfallen far behind. The College Cost Reduction and Access Act we passed \nin the last Congress was a downpayment on this challenge, and this bill \nis another step in the right direction.\n  In the current economic climate, this support is more important than \never. As in recessions past, Americans are entering or returning to \ncollege in record numbers. Over 6 million citizens have applied for \nPell grants this year, an increase of over 10 percent compared to last \nyear. With more and more low-income families and fewer and fewer jobs \nto go around, opening the doors of college to more students is a \nsensible response to this economic challenge. It will help us weather \nthe crisis and better prepare our Nation to compete in the future.\n\n[[Page S2047]]\n\n  Our recovery won't be fair unless it also includes our Nation's \nyoungest and most vulnerable children. This bill delivers over $1 \nbillion for the Head Start and Early Head Start programs, which will \nallow about 50,000 more children to participate in these programs. The \nsize of Early Head Start will be increased by half, creating almost \n30,000 jobs.\n  Investments in high-quality early learning programs like Head Start \nproduce excellent returns for later economic growth and job \ndevelopment. Currently, Head Start serves only half of eligible \npreschoolers, and Early Head Start serves less than 3 percent of \neligible infants and toddlers. These programs have been struggling, \nbecause operating costs associated with providing high-quality early \nchildhood education are soaring, yet staff, program hours, \ntransportation, and other services have been declining in order to deal \nwith a 13-percent decrease in funds. The funding in this recovery \npackage will help Head Start Centers across the country get back on \ntheir feet and back on track serving our youngest children.\n  The legislation also invests in essential child care assistance for \nchildren and parents. It provides an increase of $2 billion in the \nchild care development block grant, so that States can serve an \nadditional 480,000 needy children, and paid work opportunities are \ncreated for 190,000 caregivers.\n  Quality child care produces long-term benefits in children's learning \nand development. It also allows parents to continue working \nproductively. The licensed child care sector enables parents to earn \nmore than $100 billion annually, generating nearly $580 billion in \ndirect and indirect labor income and more than 15 million jobs.\n  We know that child care is one of the largest expenses for low-income \nfamilies. Between 2006 and 2007, the average cost of full-time infant \nchild care rose by 6.5 percent, and child care costs for four-year olds \nrose by 5.3 percent. Yet funding for the child care development block \ngrant has been nearly flat since 2002. As a result, nearly 140,000 \nfewer children are receiving Federal assistance under this program than \nin 2002. Only one out of every seven children eligible for assistance \nunder this program now receives it.\n  There is no question that the challenges we face as a nation are \ndaunting. But they are challenges we must face together. Following the \nPresident's lead, we must ask more Americans to be part of the \nsolution. This legislation makes that possible by including $200 \nmillion for national service programs and infrastructure, an important \ninvestment for these difficult times.\n  With the crisis hitting community after community, the demand for \nservices and assistance is sharply increasing. In response, more \nAmericans, young and old, are answering the President's call to serve. \nThey are looking for ways to help. Applications to service \norganizations are up. AmeriCorps members across the country are already \nperforming this needed role, from mentoring youth whose families are \nstruggling, to ensuring low-income individuals have a place to go home \nto. The increased funding for national service opportunities in this \nbill will enable more Americans to help those in need, and will also \nprovide support and assistance for nonprofit organizations doing some \nof the most important work in our neediest communities. Much more can \nbe done to expand these opportunities and encourage more Americans to \nput their skills and ingenuity to work for others in their hard-hit \ncommunities. This legislation is a significant step toward this goal.\n  This package makes many critical investments in our infrastructure \nand in our future. Never has action been more urgently needed to \njumpstart our economy. This recovery legislation is an indispensible \nand long-overdue step toward putting our economy back to work for \nAmerican families. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport these strong measures and to save and create jobs. Together, we \ncan turn our economy around and begin a new era of prosperity for all \nour Nation's families.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the American people are counting on us to \nact to stabilize and revitalize the economy, and the Economic Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act that the Senate is considering is an essential \npart of that effort. It will create jobs and make investments to \nbolster our economy in both the short and long term.\n  The situation is dire. The Nation is in a deep recession. Michigan's \nunemployment rate is the highest in the country. Michigan has lost over \nhalf a million jobs since January 2001, and more than 300,000 of those \nwere manufacturing jobs. In this January alone, the Nation lost 598,000 \njobs, including 207,000 manufacturing jobs, and the number of first-\ntime jobless claims was higher than any time in the past quarter \ncentury. The economy is in very bad shape, and it is getting worse.\n  Job creation must be our No. 1 priority as we work to turn the \neconomy around, and jobs are the focus of this recovery plan. The \nprovisions in this bill are designed to create jobs, including funding \nfor infrastructure, tax cuts, and investments in critical technology. \nThe Obama administration estimates that this plan will create or save \nover 3 million jobs nationwide--well over 100,000 jobs in Michigan \nalone--over the next 2 years, including jobs in health care, clean \nenergy and construction.\n  The recovery plan includes funding for investments in technology and \nmodernization efforts that can help us compete in the global economy.\n  The bill includes $2 billion in funding for the Department of Energy \nfor grants to manufacturers of advanced batteries and battery systems, \nwhich will help provide American manufacturers the resources and the \nsupport they need to manufacture these batteries in U.S. facilities. \nThe recovery package also includes $100 million in Defense Production \nAct funding, which will go toward the support of manufacturers of \ntechnologies for the next generation of vehicles used by the military. \nThis funding is critical because battery manufacturers and other \nmanufacturers are deciding now where to locate their production \nfacilities, and we cannot afford to lose those facilities and the jobs \nlocated there to other countries that are willing to offer greater \nfinancial incentives than we are.\n  The package also includes significant measures to expand the American \nmarket for advanced technology vehicles. It increases from 250,000 to \n500,000 the number of plug-in hybrid vehicles eligible for the consumer \ntax credit for these vehicles. And it includes funding for Federal \nagencies to aggressively lease alternative energy vehicles--such as \nhybrid vehicles--to support a wide variety of agency missions. \nGovernment leasing of these vehicles will help stimulate production of \nthese vehicles. We cannot just preach about the need to produce these \nvehicles. We must lead the way in purchasing them, even though their \nup-front cost is greater.\n  Shovel-ready infrastructure projects are the most immediate way to \ncreate jobs and get the economy moving quickly. The recovery plan \nincludes over $45 billion in funding for ready-to-go road, bridge, rail \nand other projects to immediately and directly create jobs. I supported \nan amendment that would have added further funding for such projects, \nwhich unfortunately did not pass. Michigan has over $3 billion in \ntransportation projects that can be commenced within 180 days. Even \nwithout the additional funding, the legislation we are considering will \nprovide Michigan with nearly $900 million in highway formula funds and \n$165 million in transit formula funds, allowing for significant repairs \nto roads and bridges and purchases of buses for our public transit \nauthorities. There is additional funding which will hopefully result in \ninvestments in the midwest high-speed rail corridor, and improvements \nto Amtrak that can help bring commuter rail to Michigan. I am \nespecially pleased that the Senate stimulus bill distributes the \nhighway infrastructure funds using the Surface Transportation Program, \nSTP, authorized under the current highway law. The STP formula treats \nMichigan and other donor States in a much fairer manner than other \nhighway funding allocation formulas.\n  The legislation also provides $2 billion for the Army Corps to \naddress river and harbor, flood and ecosystem restoration projects \nacross our Nation. I am hopeful that a significant portion of these \nfunds will be directed to the Great Lakes navigational system, one of \nour Nation's most important maritime highways, which faces a backlog\n\n[[Page S2048]]\n\nin many much-needed maintenance projects that are ready to go.\n  Additionally, the legislation includes $6 billion for water \ninfrastructure investments that will immediately employ people, protect \npublic health, improve the environment, and create a stronger economic \nclimate. This bill will provide Michigan with over $150 million for \njob-creating projects to address crucial wastewater needs, and about \n$70 million to improve water mains, leaking pipes, water treatment \nplants, pumping stations, and similar projects. It also includes $200 \nmillion for environmental infrastructure projects that can create jobs \nwhile helping to mitigate the impact of combined sewer overflows, which \ndump harmful pollutants into the Great Lakes every year.\n  There are also nearly $200 million worth of projects identified in \nconjunction with the Great Lakes Legacy Act, which was reauthorized in \n2008 in order for the EPA to clean up contaminated sediments in the \nGreat Lakes, which are shovel ready and could be done in a few months. \nLast year, the Brookings Institution released a report that concluded \nthat a Federal investment would yield economic benefits of 2\\1/2\\ to 1. \nI will continue to push for these projects to be funded promptly from \nthe appropriations in this bill.\n  The recovery package also includes $100 million in competitive grants \nfor the cleanup of brownfield sites where redevelopment is complicated \nbecause of real or potential environmental contamination. Last year, \nMichigan was awarded $8 million for 22 such projects, and I am hopeful \nthat a good portion of these grants will be awarded to Michigan \ncommunities. Because most of Michigan's grants were awarded for site \nassessments, rather than actual cleanup projects, I joined my \ncolleagues Senators Cardin and Voinovich in sponsoring an amendment \nthat would allow the grants to be awarded for both assessments and \ncleanup projects. Both of these uses would quickly put people to work \nand make these sites attractive for investment and reuse, creating \nadditional new jobs, generating additional tax revenues, and improving \ncommunities' overall quality of life.\n  Finally, on the infrastructure front, the bill includes about $750 \nmillion for the National Park Service to address the lengthy backlog of \nmaintenance projects and other important needs. I am hopeful that a \nsignificant portion of these funds will be used at Michigan's four \nnational park units and the North Country National Scenic Trail. \nMichigan's park and trail funding needs are great, and numerous \nprojects have been deferred for several years. It is estimated that \nMichigan's parks and trails could use upwards of $35 million in funding \nfor infrastructure investments that could be started within the next 18 \nmonths. I was concerned that the $23 million set aside for deferred \nmaintenance of trails might exclude, for technical reasons, developing \nscenic trails, like the North Country Trail, which has 1,150 miles that \nrun through Michigan. I obtained assurances on the record from Senator \nFeinstein, the sponsor of the trail funding language that such trails \nwould in fact be eligible for the trail funding, and I am hopeful that \nmany trail maintenance projects will begin soon, creating jobs and \nboosting the economy.\n  The recovery bill will provide funds investing in health information \ntechnology, computerizing health records to reduce medical errors and \nsave billions of dollars in health care costs.\n  The tax provisions in this legislation will create a refundable tax \ncredit of $500 for working individuals and $1,000 for working families, \ncovering 95 percent of working families. Taxpayers can receive this \nbenefit through a reduction in the amount of tax that is withheld from \ntheir paychecks, or through claiming the credit on their tax returns. \nThis will mean direct and immediate relief for nearly 4 million \nMichigan workers. For many struggling families, this will help them \nmake ends meet in these tough times. By putting extra money in \nfamilies' pockets, these targeted tax cuts will offer an immediate \nboost to the economy.\n  This recovery plan includes important measures that will modernize \nthe current unemployment benefits system which includes administrative \ndollars and funds to incentivize States to modernize their unemployment \ninsurance programs. This would mean more than $90 million for the State \nof Michigan right off the bat. This plan will also provide a further \nextension of unemployment benefits which will help the approximately \n162,000 unemployed workers in Michigan who are unable to find a job in \nthese hard economic times and whose unemployment benefit will expire. \nAdditionally, it will provide an additional $100 per month in \nunemployment benefits, pumping money directly into depressed economic \nareas. Further, the bill temporarily exempts the first $2,400 \nunemployment benefits from income tax, meaning more of these funds can \ngo to recipients and help grow the economy. Providing job training in \nnew and expanding fields will help to lower the unemployment rate and \nhelp today's workers better compete against foreign competition. The \nbill provides $3.4 billion for job training including State formula \ngrants for adult, dislocated worker, and youth programs, including $1.2 \nbillion to create up to one million summer jobs for youth. The training \nand employment needs of workers also will be met through dislocated \nworker national emergency grants, new competitive grants for worker \ntraining in high growth and emerging industry sectors, with priority \nconsideration to ``green'' jobs and health care, and increased funds \nfor the Job Corps and YouthBuild programs. Green jobs training will \ninclude preparing workers for activities supported by other economic \nrecovery funds, such as retrofitting of buildings, green construction, \nand the production of renewable electric power. It also provides $500 \nmillion for State formula funds for vocational rehabilitation State \ngrants to help individuals with disabilities prepare for and sustain \ngainful employment; and $400 million for employment services grants to \nmatch unemployed individuals to job openings through State employment \nservice agencies and allow States to provide customized reemployment \nservices.\n  The bill includes funding to enhance and expand education initiatives \naimed at ensuring that our next generation of Americans is able to meet \nthe challenges of a global economy. It includes a $39 billion State \nfiscal stabilization fund for local school districts and public \ncolleges and universities, distributed through existing State and \nFederal formulas, and $7.5 billion to States as incentive grants as a \nreward for meeting key education performance measures. It also \naddresses the needs of educationally disadvantaged students served \nthrough the Title I program, including $12.4 billion to help close the \nachievement gap and enable these students to reach their potential. \nFurther, the bill includes $13 billion to improve educational outcomes \nfor children served under the Individuals with Disabilities in \nEducation Act. This level of funding will increase the Federal share of \nspecial education services to its highest level ever. Finally, the bill \nadds $13.9 billion to increase the Pell grant maximum award and pay for \nincreases in program costs resulting from increased eligibility and \nhigher Pell grant awards. The bill supports an increased Pell Grant \nmaximum award of $281 in the 2009-2010 academic year and $400 in the \n2010-2011 academic year, which will help 7 million students pursue \npostsecondary education.\n  A provision was also included to encourage use of the low-income \nhousing tax credit, an important tool for the development of affordable \nrental housing.\n  Together, the provisions in this bill offer significant hope for our \nNation's economic future. Still, a comprehensive economic recovery \neffort is balanced on a three legged stool consisting of creating jobs, \nunfreezing credit markets, and addressing the housing crisis, including \nreduction in the flood of foreclosures.\n  I am assured that the Obama administration is moving towards prompt \naction on the other fronts. President Obama will soon be putting \nforward a significant housing measure focused on reducing foreclosures \nand stabilizing home values. The Treasury Department is working to \nreconfigure the so-called TARP funds, of which $350 billion remains, to \nunfreeze our Nation's credit markets. The Treasury is also establishing \nsensible conditions for financial institutions who receive loans\n\n[[Page S2049]]\n\nfrom the government so we can monitor what they do with the funds and \nget them to resume the flow of credit.\n  This recovery plan represents an essential step toward stabilizing \nour economy. The infrastructure projects will create Michigan jobs, the \ntax provisions will help Michigan families and the investments in \ntechnology and modernization will pay dividends for years to come. \nWhile I am mindful of the further challenges we must address in order \nto end this recession, I support the Economic Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct with a sense of real urgency.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I commend the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee for including $7 billion in the Reinvestment and Recovery Act \nfor the Department of Commerce to improve broadband access in our \ncountry. This new program should bring broadband to unserved and \nunderserved areas in Vermont and other rural parts of our country. That \naccess is crucial to the vitality of rural communities which are in \ndanger of being left off the technology highway.\n  During deliberation of the reinvestment and recovery bill over the \npast week, I offered amendment No. 332 to set aside $100 million within \nthe available $7 billion to provide loan guarantees for broadband \nconstruction. The program established in the underlying bill currently \nwill fund only grants. These grants will be an important pillar of any \nfinancing for a national build out of broadband. However, loan \nguarantees are another important financing option to construct \nbroadband networks. That is why I am offering this amendment to set \naside less than 2 percent of the $9 billion for grants to establish a \nloan guarantee program.\n  Creating a loan guarantee program alongside the grant program has the \nbenefit of leveraging billions of additional dollars in broadband \ninvestment. The $100 million that my amendment would have set aside \nwould have leveraged up to $2 billion in additional broadband \ninitiatives. And perhaps more importantly, a loan guarantee program \nwould have the potential of advancing broadband projects that were \nprepared to move forward with bonds only to be halted due to the \neconomic downturn and crisis in the credit markets.\n  In Vermont, I have been closely following the East Central Fiber, \nECF, project. A group of 22 towns in the upper Connecticut and White \nRiver valleys of our State have formed a joint venture to bring fiber-\noptic broadband communications services to their region. The area is \ncurrently underserved or un-served with the type of modern \ncommunications infrastructure which is so critical to their long term \neconomic survival. The East Central Fiber group was prepared to build \ntheir fiber to the home project through municipal financing until the \ncredit markets collapsed during the economic downturn. A federal loan \nguarantee program could be the difference in financing this $100 \nmillion initiative.\n  It makes sense to establish a loan guarantee program for broadband in \nconjunction with the new grant program this bill funds. The small \npercentage of funds my amendment would have set aside has the potential \nto leverage billions more in broadband investments for rural \ncommunities.\n  This amendment was cleared by the relevant committees. Unfortunately \nSenators who oppose the reinvestment and recovery bill will raise \nobjections to adopting any amendments by unanimous consent. Thus my \namendment No. 332, as modified, along with several other amendments \nwere denied being included in the final legislation that will pass the \nSenate today.\n  I will continue to work with my colleagues to establish at Broadband \nLoan Guarantee program at the Department of Commerce. Such guarantees \nare an important part of any national strategy to bring broadband, \nincluding fiber to every home, to rural communities.\n  Mr. BYRD. Madam President, these are perilous economic times.\n  The national economy is shedding jobs at an alarming rate. Nearly 2 \nmillion jobs have been lost nationwide in the last 3 months, with 3.6 \nmillion jobs lost since December 2007. In West Virginia, our workforce \nhas been buffered to some degree by the mining industry, but we, too, \nare now feeling the painful global recession. In December--in just 1 \nmonth--West Virginia lost 4,100 jobs. We are hearing more frequently \nabout layoff and job loss announcements: Dow Chemical in Kanawha \nCounty, Century Aluminum and Alcan in Jackson County, Bayer Material \nScience in Marshall County, Patriot Coal in Boone and Kanawha Counties, \nMountaineer Racetrack & Casino in Hancock County, Simonton Windows in \nRitchie County, AGC Flat Glass in Harrison County, American National \nRubber in Wayne County, Georgia-Pacific in Fayette County, Greenbrier \nResort Hotel in Greenbrier County, Kingwood Mining in Preston County, \nand Goodies Clothing and Circuit City stores throughout the State.\n  The Federal Reserve has reduced its interest rate target to near \nzero, and continues to experiment with unprecedented programs to \nbolster lending, injecting about $1 trillion into the banking system. \nAdding to the unease, the Congress has authorized the Treasury \nDepartment to purchase up to $700 billion of toxic debt from financial \ninstitutions. This is an authority that has been used, so far, to \nrecapitalize the banking system, seemingly with few, if any, strings \nattached on the institutions receiving the funding. Meanwhile, national \ndeficits and debt are increasing to what still seem like improbable \nlevels.\n  If the stimulus package before the Congress today seems \nextraordinary, it is because the economic and fiscal challenge before \nus is extraordinary.\n  Not only has the recession created a $3.6 trillion economic gap over \nthe next 5 years, but the fiscal programs of the previous \nadministration have left this Nation with a $2.2 trillion deficit in \ninfrastructure investments. Highway and mass transit systems, airport \nand rail construction, energy and water projects, schools and public \nfacilities were starved under the previous administration. As State and \nlocal budgets shrink, these infrastructure deficits will continue to \nincrease. In West Virginia, I have seen how inadequate infrastructure \ncan limit access to jobs, to health care, and to schools. It can \nstrangle and suffocate local economies.\n  It may seem incredible to some, but with a $2.2 trillion \ninfrastructure deficit, and a $3.6 trillion contraction in the economy, \nan $838 billion stimulus is not enough. Rather than cutting back the \nstimulus package as some have suggested, we should be adding funds to \ninfrastructure projects, which is why I cosponsored an amendment to the \nstimulus bill that would have further increased investments in \ntransportation infrastructure. I agree with others who have said that \nthe risk here is not that we may do too much. The real risk is that we \nmay not do enough, fast enough, soon enough, and that jobs will \ncontinue to evaporate.\n  I have tried to focus this stimulus where I think it can do the most \ngood for the working people of this Nation, including the people of \nWest Virginia. During the debate, I supported several amendments to \nlimit costs, and to target spending and tax cuts toward working \nfamilies and their communities. I fought to make sure the bill would \ncreate jobs quickly. Seventy eight percent of the stimulative effect \nwill take place in the next 18 months--a big improvement compared to \nthe House bill. I also sought to ensure that there is some oversight of \nhow these funds are spent at the state and local level. I have \nsupported the creation of a Recovery and Transparency Board comprised \nof inspector generals across the Federal Government, to bring to light \nwasteful and corrupt spending. Likewise, I am hopeful that this Board \nwill monitor State and local management of these funds, to ensure that \nexcessive or political strings are not attached, delaying this critical \nfunding.\n  I am sorry to see this stimulus package derisively referred to as \nwasteful, pork-barrel spending. I suspect many of these naysayers are \nnot looking to create jobs, so much as they are looking to create a \nsound bite. I do not consider moneys for our Nation's roads and \nbridges, for our schools and communities, and for a safety net for the \nunemployed and uninsured to be handouts. I do not consider funding \nwasteful if it helps to ensure that state and local officials do not \nhave to layoff police officers, school teachers, and fire fighters.\n  This stimulus is exactly what we need to be doing. I have been \nfighting for this infrastructure funding for many years. The bill may \nnot win any popularity contests, but it is still the best idea for \nhelping to mitigate this\n\n[[Page S2050]]\n\neconomic downturn. It achieves the principle goals of creating jobs, of \nhelping to prevent painful and dangerous budget cuts at the State and \nlocal level, and of investing in the long-term growth of the U.S. \neconomy. I unhesitatingly cast my vote in support of this measure.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I want to speak about the trade \nadjustment assistance amendment that Senator Baucus and I have \nintroduced.\n  It is amendment No. 404, and it is called the Trade and Globalization \nAdjustment Assistance Act of 2009.\n  My colleagues are used to hearing me talk about the importance of \ntrade.\n  Trade creates good, well paying jobs for American workers, farmers, \nand service suppliers. Those jobs are more important than ever in this \ntime of economic difficulty.\n  So we need to keep working hard to open new markets for U.S. goods \nand services.\n  But if we are going to engage in international trade, we need to make \nsure we are looking out for U.S. workers who are affected by foreign \ncompetition.\n  Our trade adjustment assistance program is the primary program the \nFederal Government has for helping those workers. Unfortunately, the \nprogram is out of date. It isn't doing enough to help the workers who \nneed it. And that is why I have joined with Senator Baucus to update \nit.\n  Today's amendment is the culmination of months of hard work on the \npart of Senator Baucus and myself. And this work reflects years of \noversight and careful thought. It is also the product of close \ncollaboration and intensive negotiations with our counterparts on the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee, Chairman Rangel and Congressman Camp. I \nwant to thank my colleagues for their cooperation and good will.\n  This amendment truly is a bipartisan, bicameral product. The \namendment would update the trade adjustment assistance program in \nimportant ways, so it better serves the needs of our workers in the \nglobalized economy of the 21st century. I will mention some of those \nchanges now, and I anticipate that Senator Baucus and I will introduce \nreport language into the Record to reflect the legislative intent \nbehind the provisions we have included in our amendment.\n  One of the most important changes that the amendment makes is to open \nthe trade adjustment assistance program to workers in the services \nsector. Those workers aren't currently eligible for trade adjustment \nassistance.\n  So, if you are a customer service representative, and your job is \noutsourced to India, you are out of luck.\n  That limitation makes no sense to me. Services make up almost 80 \npercent of our economy, so it makes sense that service workers should \nbe eligible for adjustment assistance if they are adversely impacted by \ntrade. But that last point is critically important. Trade adjustment \nassistance should be made available to service workers, but only if \nthey can demonstrate a causal nexus between trade and the loss of jobs.\n  The amendment I introduced with Senator Baucus requires an express \ndetermination of such a causal nexus before service workers can be \ncertified for trade adjustment assistance. I wouldn't be here \nsupporting this compromise if it didn't. The same goes for \nmanufacturing workers. Trade adjustment assistance is premised upon an \nadverse trade impact, and this amendment preserves that nexus. Our \namendment fills the hole in existing law so that software developers, \ncustomer service reps, and other service workers will be able to seek \nthe same benefits that are currently available to workers in the \nmanufacturing sector, and on the same terms. That is only fair.\n  We also increase the availability of training funds so that States \ncan handle this expansion in eligibility and provide better training \nopportunities for displaced workers, to help them train for new \ncareers. Our amendment expands the trade adjustment assistance for \nfirms program to help individual firms better respond to foreign \ncompetition and avoid having to cut jobs to begin with. It improves the \ntrade adjustment assistance for farmers program to provide targeted \ntraining and to help agricultural producers develop new skills and \nbusiness plans. It creates a trade adjustment assistance for \ncommunities program to help entire communities respond to the pressures \nof globalization, and to help community colleges and other educational \ninstitutions develop new and more targeted courses to assist trade-\nimpacted workers. And it helps States fund caseworker time spent with \nTAA clients, so that laid-off workers will have someone to help them \nexamine their options and plan next steps.\n  Our amendment introduces a great deal more flexibility into the \nprogram, so that workers can choose between full-time and part-time \ntraining, or full-time work with limited wage insurance. Trade-impacted \nworkers can even take advantage of training and case management \nservices before they lose their jobs. Our amendment also improves the \naccountability and internal oversight of the program, at the State and \nFederal level, to provide additional assurance that taxpayer monies \nwill be well-spent.\n  I have already noted that this amendment is a bipartisan effort that \nreflects the work of four offices. It is a compromise in many respects. \nThere are portions of the amendment that I might have done differently \nif it were solely up to me. But that is the nature of compromise. And \nthe overall policy embodied in this amendment is a good one that will \ndo a lot of good for a lot of Americans--in Iowa and across the United \nStates. Equally important, if we enact this amendment into law, it will \nhelp unlock the trade agenda so we can progress with other important \npriorities. Chief among those is implementation of the Colombia trade \nagreement, which is my top trade priority. And then we need to turn to \nour other trade agreements with Panama and South Korea as well. We need \nto level the playing field so that our exporters, service suppliers, \nand farmers can increase their sales to foreign countries. It is more \nimportant than ever.\n  We have had a social compact on trade for over 45 years.\n  One side of that compact is to address the needs of trade-displaced \nworkers, and we are doing that with the Baucus-Grassley amendment.\n  The other side is to open up new markets for U.S. exports.\n  That was a driving principle when President Kennedy established the \ntrade adjustment assistance program. President Obama should hold true \nto that principle by doing everything he can to create new export \nopportunities, starting with implementation of our pending trade \nagreements. A pro-growth trade agenda should be integral to our \neconomic recovery strategy.\n  Now let me turn to the provisions in this amendment dealing with the \nhealth coverage tax credit. The health coverage tax credit was the \ncreation of a bipartisan effort in 2002. It was designed to help those \nwho were losing their jobs and their health coverage due to trade-\nrelated restructuring. The health coverage tax credit represented the \nfirst time that the Federal Government offered assistance in the form \nof a tax credit to purchase health coverage. It was a new way of doing \nthings. Instead of the government offering government-run coverage, the \ngovernment was offering a tax credit to purchase private coverage. That \nis a good thing.\n  As a new program, it had start-up challenges. And the program has \nspecial challenges that we don't see in the regular insurance market. \nYou see, the trade adjustment assistance program is for a limited \nnumber of people. And it is offered just while people who have lost \ntheir jobs are going through retraining and finding another job. Health \ninsurers do their best when they are insuring a larger group of people \nfor a longer period of time. That is how insurance normally works. But \nthe TAA program is the opposite.\n  So this program has some special challenges to manage. And for a new \nprogram, I think it has managed those challenges pretty well. But there \nis always room for improvement. That is especially true for a new \nprogram like this one. The Government Accountability Office and the \nInternal Revenue Service have studied the health coverage tax credit \nprogram and offered their recommendations. The health plans have also \noffered suggestions for how to make the program work better.\n  The amendment that Senator Baucus and I have worked out would make a \nnumber of improvements to the program. These are improvements needed\n\n[[Page S2051]]\n\nto make it work better for eligible workers. First, we need to make \ncoverage more affordable. That is something I hope we can address in \nmore comprehensive health reform. But in the meantime, this amendment \nwill make coverage affordable by increasing the tax credit to 80 \npercent of the cost of coverage. By providing more assistance, we can \nmake private insurance options more affordable. Let's not forget that \nif we don't preserve access in the private market, many of these \nunemployed workers and their families will be forced into Medicaid. \nThis amendment also makes important changes that will raise awareness \nabout the program. One of the biggest barriers to enrollment is that \npeople just don't know about the program. We are also going to help \npeople with up-front costs during enrollment, and improve coverage for \nfamily members.\n  As I said before, this is not a perfect program and today's changes \nare not going to make it perfect. I hope as this process moves forward, \nwe can still look for ways to expand the number of coverage options for \npeople that want to use the credit. We should make sure they have a \nvariety of choices in the individual market. But even though today's \nchanges don't do everything we would like, they represent another step \nin making this program work better for unemployed workers and their \nfamilies.\n  And I compliment Senator Baucus for his hard work and commitment to \nmoving forward on these important reforms. With that, I invite my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting amendment 404, the Trade and \nGlobalization Adjustment Assistance Act of 2009. The reforms in this \namendment will provide immediate benefits to workers impacted by trade \nin Iowa and across the country. Over the long term, these reforms will \nhelp to strengthen the global competitiveness of our workforce. And \nthat translates into maintaining good-paying jobs right here in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, a baker once told Studs Terkel, the \ngreat chronicler of the American people:\n  ``Work is an essential part of being alive. Your work is your \nidentity. It tells you who you are . . . There's such a joy in doing \nwork well.''\n  This body is considering legislation about economic growth and \nrecovery. It is about energy, and it is about healthcare.\n  But we must never forget that we are also considering what is \nessential to Americans' lives. In our hands is a part of Americans' \nidentities, and the joy and pride they get from a day's work well done.\n  And when we consider jobs lost in America, we must never forget that, \nin our hands, is also the pain of lost identity, lost pride, and lost \nmeaning in Americans' lives.\n  Last week, Senator Grassley and I--along with Chairman Rangel and Mr. \nCamp--completed negotiations on provisions to renew and expand our \ntrade adjustment assistance programs.\n  Our provisions promise American workers who have lost their jobs the \nchance to get back on their feet. And with that opportunity, it offers \nAmericans another shot at the dignity and joy they get from an honest \nday's work.\n  Trade adjustment assistance--or ``TAA''--has been my highest trade \npriority. For over two years, I have worked with Senator Grassley and \nChairman Rangel to realize this priority. It was a long process, and it \nwas not easy.\n  But I am proud to say that with their help, along with the invaluable \nsupport of Congressman Camp, and Senators Snowe, Bingaman, Cantwell, \nStabenow, Rockefeller, and others, we have achieved it.\n  When President Kennedy created trade adjustment assistance in 1962, \nhe crafted it to reflect the needs and conditions of the American \neconomy of his time.\n  Our new TAA provisions will reform and expand TAA to reflect the \nneeds and conditions of our economy as we know it today. This renewal \nand expansion is historic. It is the most significant expansion of the \nprogram since President Kennedy created it.\n  And, most importantly, it will help TAA reach more Americans than \never before with the smart and effective services they need, when they \nneed them.\n  The opportunities of international trade and job-creating exports \nhave never been greater. For much of the past two years, growing \nAmerican exports were a rare bright spot in our economy.\n  Yet with these opportunities also come risks. A sudden shift in \nglobal trade flows can send an industry reeling, taking its workers \nwith it. In rural communities dependent on a single employer, the \neffect is even more sharply felt.\n  In my home State of Montana, the global recession has already hit our \nmines and our lumber industry. Workers in our aluminum and paper \nproducts companies also suffer in this crisis.\n  Trade adjustment assistance gives American workers caught in the \ncrosscurrents of international trade a chance to get back on their feet \nwith retraining, a healthcare tax credit, and strategic support for \nfirms.\n  But as important as TAA is to our workers, it has not kept up with \nour evolving economy. It remains limited in scope, limited in \nresources, and limited in its ability to deliver effective services.\n  That is why the TAA expansion that Senator Grassley and I negotiated \nis so important. It addresses these limitations and makes trade \nadjustment assistance work better for far more workers.\n  First, and perhaps most significantly, our new TAA provisions extend \nTAA to services workers. America remains a manufacturing powerhouse, \nbut our economy has also evolved to create a vibrant and globally-\nintegrated services industry. Services are now nearly 80 percent of our \neconomy, yet TAA's benefits are out of reach for all services workers.\n  This legislation brings TAA in line with today's economy, extending \nTAA benefits to America's services industry workers, whether they are \ntransportation workers, software designers, computer programmers, or \nairline maintenance technicians.\n  Second, our provisions extend TAA's offshoring provisions to all \nworkers regardless of the country to which that job shifts.\n  Under current law, workers whose jobs shift abroad may only qualify \nfor TAA if that shift is to countries with which we have a free trade \nagreement or certain other trade arrangements. But it does not cover \neight of our top ten partners, including China, Japan, and Korea.\n  This legislation does away with that geographic limitation and \nexpands TAA's benefits to cover all trade with all of our partner \ncountries.\n  Third, our new TAA package increases training funds available to \nstates by 160 percent--from $220 million to $570 million per year.\n  Job retraining programs are at the heart of TAA, and have proven the \nquickest and most effective way to give workers the skills they need to \nget back on the job. Take just two recent examples from Montana.\n  Wilfred Johnson lost his job after four decades in the lumber \nindustry. He was 58 years old and had never before been unemployed. Mr. \nJohnson turned to local TAA administrators and with the help of TAA \nretraining funds, soon learned to operate heavy machinery. He earned \nhis commercial driver's license, and started a new job with the Forest \nService last spring.\n  Daryl Blasing also lost his job at a lumber mill. With the help of \nTAA, he retrained to learn information technology skills at a community \ncollege. Today, Mr. Blasing monitors election software for the State of \nMontana, a job he does so well that he earned the Governor's Award for \nExcellence in Performance.\n  Despite these and many similar successes around the country, workers' \nretraining needs often outpace TAA retraining resources. States \nincluding Iowa, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and North Carolina regularly \nexhaust their annual allotment of retraining funds before the year is \nout. Our new provisions remedy that funding shortfall and will make TAA \ntraining as effective as it could be.\n  Fourth, this reform also strengthens programs that offer American \ncompanies and farmers strategic assistance to keep them competitive and \nto keep their workers on the job.\n  Struggling farmers will be eligible for targeted and intensive \ntechnical assistance under the TAA for Farmers\n\n[[Page S2052]]\n\nprogram, leading to a better business plan and the seed money to get \nthat plan off the ground.\n  We also more than triple the resources to back the successful TAA for \nFirms program, which partners small businesses with industry experts to \nimprove their efficiency and competitiveness.\n  Fifth, I have worked with Senators Snowe, Cantwell, Bingaman, and \nGrassley to devise a program to help communities struggling with the \nconsequences of international trade.\n  When a large employer shuts down, entire communities feel the shock. \nThis amendment recognizes the community-wide effects of trade and \noffers community-wide solutions.\n  Under the new TAA for Communities program, grants to technical \ncolleges and public-private partnerships will help identify and invest \nin new viable and competitive industries. These small investments will \nhelp entire communities grow.\n  Sixth, our new TAA provisions take steps to ensure trade displaced \nworkers have access to health care through a workable health coverage \ntax credit program.\n  Under current law, TAA-eligible workers can receive a 65 percent tax \ncredit to buy certain health insurance. Our legislation will improve \nthe affordability of health coverage for trade displaced workers by \nincreasing the tax credit subsidy to 80 percent.\n  It will also provide workers retroactive reimbursement for premium \ncosts that are paid while waiting to get enrolled in the health \nprogram.\n  Our legislation also improves coverage for spouses and dependents and \nestablishes new rules to protect workers from being denied coverage \nbased on pre-existing health conditions.\n  Our proposal also increases transparency around the costs and \navailability of health benefits and puts stronger mechanisms in placing \nfor ensuring workers have accurate and timely information about their \nhealth coverage options.\n  There are many other aspects to our TAA package. I am introducing \ninto the record a detailed description of our provisions. Senator \nGrassley and I prepared this document with Ways and Means Committee \nChairman Rangel and Ranking Minority Member Camp.\n  This document is meant to serve as the legislative history of these \nmany provisions, as well as to provide the rationale for the amendments \nwe propose to current law.\n  Madam President, during this debate my colleagues have talked a lot \nabout the promise of our economy and hope for the future.\n  I too am hopeful. I am hopeful because I know that with this \nlegislation, we are trying to do what is best for America.\n  I am also hopeful because I believe, as Studs Terkel wrote, ``Hope \nhas never trickled down. It has always sprung up.''\n  It will again spring up from the Americans who work to stay \ncompetitive in their current jobs. And hope will spring from those \ncourageous and innovative workers who retrain for new jobs.\n  Our provisions to renew and expand Trade Adjustment Assistance will \nhelp them do that. I urge my colleagues to give it their support.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the report language printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         I. LEGISLATIVE HISTORY\n\n       The Trade and Globalization Adjustment Assistance Act of \n     2009 (``Act'') amends the Trade Act of 1974 (``the Trade \n     Act'') to reauthorize trade adjustment assistance (``TAA''), \n     to extend trade adjustment assistance to service workers, \n     communities, firms, and farmers, and for other purposes. This \n     document reflects the shared views of Chairman Baucus, \n     Senator Grassley, Chairman Rangel, and Congressman Camp \n     (``the Members'') on the trade-related aspects of the Act. \n     This document does not address the health coverage tax credit \n     aspects of the Act.\n\n                      II. EXPLANATION OF THE BILL\n\n           A. Part I--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Workers\n\n  1. Subpart A--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Service Sector Workers\n\n     Extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance to Service Sector \n         and Public Agency Workers; Shifts in Production (Section \n         1701 (amending Sections 221, 222, 231, 244, and 247 of \n         the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Section 222 of the Trade Act provides trade adjustment \n     assistance to workers in a firm or an appropriate subdivision \n     of a firm if (1) a significant number or proportion of the \n     workers in the firm or subdivision have become (or are \n     threatened to become) totally or partially separated; (2) the \n     firm produces an article; and (3) the separation or threat of \n     same is due to trade with foreign countries.\n       There are three ways to demonstrate the connection between \n     job separation and trade. The Secretary of Labor (``the \n     Secretary'') must determine either (1) that increased imports \n     of articles ``like or directly competitive'' with articles \n     produced by the firm have contributed importantly to the \n     separation and to an absolute decrease in the firm's sales or \n     production, or both; (2) that the workers' firm has shifted \n     its production of articles ``like or directly competitive'' \n     with articles produced by the firm to a trade agreement \n     partner of the United States or a beneficiary country under \n     the Andean Trade Preference Act, the African Growth and \n     Opportunity Act, or the Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery \n     Act; or (3) that the firm has shifted production of such \n     articles to another country and there has been or is likely \n     to be an increase in imports of like or directly competitive \n     articles.\n       Section 222 of the Trade Act also provides TAA to adversely \n     affected secondary workers. Eligible secondary workers \n     include (1) secondary workers that supply directly to another \n     firm component parts for articles that were the basis for a \n     certification of eligibility for TAA benefits; and (2) \n     downstream workers that were affected by trade with Mexico or \n     Canada.\n       When the Department investigates workers' petitions, it \n     requires firms and customers to certify the questionnaires \n     that the workers' firm and the firm's customers submit. \n     Present law also authorizes the Secretary to use subpoenas to \n     obtain information in the course of its investigation of a \n     petition. The law provides for the imposition of criminal and \n     civil penalties for providing false information and failing \n     to disclose material information, but the penalties apply \n     only to petitioners.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision would amend section 222 of the Trade Act to \n     expand the availability of TAA to include workers in firms in \n     the services sector. Like workers in firms that produce \n     articles, workers in firms that supply services would be \n     eligible for TAA if a significant number or proportion of the \n     workers have become (or are threatened to become) totally or \n     partially separated, and if increased imports of services \n     ``contributed importantly'' to the workers' separation or \n     threat of separation.\n       As with articles, there would be three ways for service \n     sector workers to demonstrate that they are eligible for TAA. \n     First, TAA would be available if increased imports of \n     services like or directly competitive with services supplied \n     by the firm have contributed importantly to the separation \n     and to an absolute decrease in the firm's sales or \n     production, or both. Second, TAA would be available in \n     ``shift in supply'' (``service relocation'') scenarios, if \n     the workers' firm or subdivision established a facility in a \n     foreign country to supply services like or directly \n     competitive with the services supplied by the trade-impacted \n     workers. Third, TAA would be available in ``foreign \n     contracting'' scenarios, if the workers' firm or subdivision \n     acquired from a service supplier in a foreign country \n     services like or directly competitive with the services that \n     the trade-impacted workers had supplied. In each scenario, \n     the relevant activity would need to have contributed \n     importantly to the workers' separation or threat of \n     separation.\n       The provision also expands the ``shift in production'' \n     prong of present law by eliminating the requirement in \n     section 222 that the shift be to a trade agreement partner of \n     the United States or a country that benefits from a \n     unilateral preference program. Under the modified provision, \n     if workers are separated because their firm shifts production \n     from a domestic facility to any foreign country, the \n     separated workers would potentially be eligible for TAA. \n     Additionally, there would be no requirement to demonstrate \n     separately that the shift was accompanied by an increase of \n     imports of products like or directly competitive with those \n     produced by the workers' firm or subdivision.\n       The provision also amends section 222 to make workers at \n     public agencies eligible for TAA. Under the modified \n     provision, if a public agency acquires services from a \n     foreign country that are like or directly competitive with \n     the services that the public agency supplies, and if the \n     acquisition contributed importantly to the workers' \n     separation or threat thereof, the workers would be able to \n     seek TAA benefits.\n       The provision also amends section 222 to expand the \n     universe of adversely affected secondary workers that could \n     be eligible for TAA. First, the provision adds firms that \n     supply testing, packaging, maintenance, and transportation \n     services to the list of downstream producers whose workers \n     potentially are eligible for TAA. Second, workers at firms \n     that supply services used in the production of articles or in \n     the supply of services would also become potentially eligible \n     for benefits. Third, the provision permits downstream \n     producers to be eligible for TAA if the primary firm's \n     certification is linked to trade with any country, not just \n     Canada or Mexico.\n\n[[Page S2053]]\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary to obtain information \n     that the Secretary determines necessary to make \n     certifications from workers' firms or customers of workers' \n     firms through questionnaires and in such other manner as the \n     Secretary considers appropriate. The provision also permits \n     the Secretary to seek additional information from other \n     sources, including (1) officials or employees of the workers' \n     firm; (2) officials of customers of the firm; (3) officials \n     of unions or other duly recognized representatives of the \n     petitioning workers; and (4) one-stop operators. The \n     provision states that the Secretary shall require a firm or \n     customer to certify all information obtained through \n     questionnaires, as well as other information that the \n     Secretary relies upon in making a determination under section \n     223, unless the Secretary has a reasonable basis for \n     determining that the information is accurate and complete.\n       The provision states that the Secretary shall require a \n     worker's firm or a customer of a worker's firm to provide \n     information by subpoena if the firm or customer fails to \n     provide the information within 20 days, unless the firm or \n     customer demonstrates to the Secretary's satisfaction that \n     the firm or customer will provide the information in a \n     reasonable period of time. The Secretary retains the \n     discretion to issue a subpoena sooner than 20 days if \n     necessary. The provision also establishes standards for the \n     protection of confidential business information submitted in \n     response to a request made by the Secretary.\n       The provision amends the penalties provision in section 244 \n     of the Trade Act to cover individuals, including individuals \n     who are employed by firms and customers, who provide \n     information during an investigation of a worker's petition.\n       Finally, the provision amends section 247 of the Trade Act \n     to add definitions for certain key terms and makes various \n     conforming changes to sections 221 and 222.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Most service sector workers presently are ineligible for \n     TAA benefits because of a statutory requirement that the \n     workers must have been employed by a firm that produces an \n     ``article.'' Of the 800 TAA petitions denied in FY2006, \n     almost half were denied for this reason. Most of the denied \n     service-related petitions came from two service industries: \n     business services (primarily computer-related) and airport-\n     related services (e.g., aircraft maintenance). In April 2006, \n     the Department of Labor issued a regulation expanding TAA \n     eligibility to software workers that partially, but not \n     fully, addresses the service worker coverage issue. See GAO \n     Report 07-702. The provision fully addresses the issue by \n     making service sector workers eligible for TAA on equivalent \n     terms to workers at firms that produce articles.\n       The provision expands the ``shift in production'' prong of \n     present law for similar reasons. Under present law, a worker \n     whose firm relocates to China is not necessarily eligible for \n     TAA; such worker must also show that the relocation to China \n     will result in increased imports into the United States. In \n     contrast, a worker whose firm relocates to a country with \n     which the United States has a trade agreement (e.g., Mexico, \n     Israel, Chile) does not need to show increased imports. The \n     provision eliminates this disparate treatment by making TAA \n     benefits available in both scenarios on the same terms.\n       Present law also fails to cover foreign contracting \n     scenarios, where a company closes a domestic operation and \n     contracts with a company in a foreign country for the goods \n     or services that had been produced in the United States. For \n     example, if a U.S. airline lays off a number of its U.S.-\n     based maintenance personnel and contracts with an independent \n     aircraft maintenance company in a foreign country, the laid \n     off personnel are not covered under present law, even if they \n     lost their jobs because of foreign competition. The \n     proponents believe such workers should be potentially \n     eligible for TAA benefits.\n       Similarly, the proponents believe that workers who supply \n     services at public agencies should be treated the same as \n     their private-sector counterparts: if such workers are laid \n     off because their employer contracts with a supplier in a \n     foreign country for the services that the workers had \n     supplied, the workers should be able to seek TAA benefits.\n       The provision provides that in cases involving production \n     or service relocation or foreign contracting, a group of \n     workers (including workers in a public agency) may be \n     certified as eligible for adjustment assistance if the shift \n     ``contributed importantly'' to such workers' separation or \n     threat of separation. This requirement is identical to the \n     existing causal link requirement in section \n     222(a)(2)(A)(iii), which establishes the criteria for \n     certifying workers on the basis of ``increased imports.''\n       The proponents understand that the Department of Labor has \n     interpreted the ``contributed importantly'' requirement in \n     section 222(a)(2)(A)(iii) to mean that imports must have been \n     a factor in the layoffs or threat thereof. Or, in other \n     words, under present law the Secretary of Labor will certify \n     a group of workers as eligible for assistance if the facts \n     demonstrate a causal nexus between increased imports and the \n     workers' separation or threat thereof. The proponents approve \n     of the Department's interpretation of the ``contributed \n     importantly'' requirement and expect that the Department will \n     continue to apply it in future cases involving increased \n     imports.\n       Similarly, the proponents also understand that the existing \n     language in section 222(a)(2)(B) addressing production \n     relocation contains an implicit causation requirement. Thus, \n     the Department has required production relocation under \n     section 222(a)(2)(B) to be a factor in the workers' \n     separation or threat thereof. The provision makes the \n     requirement explicit.\n       The proponents emphasize that by making the ``contributed \n     importantly'' requirement in section 222(a)(2)(B) explicit, \n     no change in the Department's administration of cases \n     involving production relocation is intended. The proponents \n     expect that this change in section 222 would not affect the \n     outcomes that the Department has been reaching under present \n     law in such cases, and will not alter outcomes in future \n     cases. Thus, as has been the case, if the Department finds \n     that production relocation was a factor in the layoff (or \n     threat thereof) of a group of workers in the United States, \n     the proponents expect that the Secretary will certify such \n     workers as eligible for adjustment assistance.\n       Finally, with respect to certifications involving \n     production or service relocations or foreign contracting, the \n     proponents recognize that there may be delays in time between \n     when the domestic layoffs (or threat of layoffs) occur, and \n     when the production or service relocation or foreign \n     contracting occurs. The proponents intend that the Department \n     of Labor certify petitions where there is credible evidence \n     that production or service relocation or foreign contracting \n     will occur, and when the other requirements of the statute \n     are met. Such evidence could include the conclusion of a \n     contract relating to foreign production of the article, \n     supply of services, or acquisition of the article or service \n     at issue; the construction, purchase, or renting of foreign \n     facilities for the production of the article, supply of the \n     service, or acquisition of the article or service at issue; \n     or certified statements by a duly authorized representative \n     at the workers' firm that the firm intends to engage in \n     production or service relocation or foreign contracting.\n       The proponents are aware of concerns that the Secretary may \n     rely on inaccurate information in making its determinations, \n     including when denying certification of petitions. The \n     provision addresses these concerns by requiring the Secretary \n     to obtain certifications of all information obtained from a \n     firm or customer through questionnaires as well as other \n     information from a firm or customer that the Secretary relies \n     upon in making a determination under section 223, unless the \n     Secretary has a reasonable basis for determining that the \n     information is accurate and complete.\n       The proponents are also aware of concerns that some firms \n     and customers fail to respond to the Secretary's requests for \n     information or provide inaccurate or incomplete information. \n     The subpoena, confidentiality of information, and penalty \n     language included in this provision are designed to address \n     these problems.\n       The provision would also apply if the Secretary needs to \n     obtain information from a customer's customer, such as in an \n     investigation involving component part suppliers.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Group Eligibility--Component Parts (Section 1701 (amending \n         Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, U.S. suppliers of inputs (i.e., \n     component parts) may be certified for TAA benefits only \n     pursuant to the secondary workers provision of section \n     222(b), which requires that the downstream producer have \n     employed a group of workers that received TAA certification. \n     Thus, for example, domestic producers of taconite have been \n     unable to obtain certification for TAA benefits when \n     downstream producers of steel slab have not obtained \n     certification.\n       Additionally, U.S. suppliers of inputs have been unable to \n     obtain certification for TAA benefits in situations in which \n     there is a shift in imports from articles incorporating their \n     inputs to articles incorporating inputs produced outside the \n     United States.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision allows for the certification of workers in a \n     firm when imports of the finished article incorporating \n     inputs produced outside the United States that are like or \n     directly competitive with imports of the finished article \n     produced using U.S. inputs have increased and the firm has \n     met the other criteria for certification, including a \n     significant number of workers being totally or partially \n     separated, a decrease in sales or production, and the \n     increase in imports has contributed importantly to the \n     workers' separation.\n       For example, under the new provision, workers in a U.S. \n     fabric plant may be certified if the U.S. firm sold fabric to \n     a Honduran apparel manufacturer for production of apparel \n     subsequently imported into the United States and (1) the \n     Honduran apparel manufacturer ceased purchasing, or decreased \n     its purchasing, of fabric from the U.S. producer and, \n     instead, used fabric from another country; or (2) imports of \n     apparel from another country using non-U.S. fabric that are \n     like or directly competitive with imports of Honduran apparel \n     using U.S. fabric have increased.\n\n[[Page S2054]]\n\n       Prior to certification, the Department of Labor would also \n     have to determine that the firm met the other statutory \n     requirements for certification, including that a significant \n     number of workers had been totally or partially separated, or \n     are threatened to become totally or partially separated, the \n     sales or production of the petitioning fabric firm had \n     decreased, and the increased imports of apparel using non-\n     U.S. fabric had contributed importantly to that decrease and \n     to the workers' separation or threat thereof.\n       Likewise, workers in a U.S. picture tube manufacturing \n     plant that sells picture tubes to a Mexican television \n     manufacturer for production of televisions subsequently \n     imported into the United States would be certified under \n     section 222 if the U.S. manufacturer's sales or production of \n     picture tubes decreased and (1) the manufacturer of \n     televisions located in Mexico switched to picture tubes \n     produced in another country; or (2) imports of televisions \n     from another country using non-U.S. picture tubes that are \n     like or directly competitive with imports of Mexican \n     televisions using U.S. picture tubes have increased.\n       As in the apparel example above, prior to certification, \n     the Department of Labor would also have to determine that the \n     picture tube firm met the other statutory requirements for \n     certification, including that a significant number of workers \n     had been totally or partially separated, or are threatened to \n     become totally or partially separated, the sales or \n     production of the petitioning picture tube firm had \n     decreased, and the increased imports of televisions using \n     non-U.S. picture tubes had contributed importantly to that \n     decrease and to the workers' separation or threat thereof.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Section 222(a) is being amended to provide improved TAA \n     coverage for U.S. suppliers of inputs, and to address \n     situations where suppliers of component parts have been \n     unable to obtain certification for TAA benefits because of \n     gaps in coverage under present law.\n       The amended language is broad enough to encompass both the \n     situation in which the input producer's customer switches to \n     inputs produced outside the United States, and the situation \n     in which the input producer's customer is displaced by a \n     third country producer, because both situations may equally \n     impact the sales or production of the domestic input \n     producer.\n       Additionally, for purposes of section \n     222(a)(2)(A)(ii)(III), as in other instances, when company-\n     specific data is unavailable, the Secretary may reasonably \n     rely on such aggregate data or such other information as the \n     Secretary deems appropriate.\n       As reflected in the examples above, the proponents intend \n     that the Secretary of Labor should interpret the term \n     component parts, as used in section 222(a)(2)(A)(ii)(III), \n     flexibly. For example, the proponents intend that uncut \n     fabric would be considered to be a component part of apparel \n     for purposes of this provision, even though, for purposes of \n     other trade laws, U.S. Customs and Border Protection might \n     not consider such fabric to be a component part.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Separate Basis for Certification (Section 1702 (amending \n         Section 222 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no provision in present law.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision amends section 222(c) of the Trade Act by \n     providing that a petition filed under section 221 of the \n     Trade Act on behalf of a group of workers in a firm, or \n     appropriate subdivision of a firm, meets the requirements of \n     subsection 222(a) of the Trade Act if the firm is publicly \n     identified by name by the U.S. International Trade Commission \n     (``ITC'') as a member of a domestic industry in (1) an \n     affirmative determination of serious injury or threat thereof \n     in a global safeguard investigation under section 202(b)(1) \n     of the Trade Act; (2) an affirmative determination of market \n     disruption or threat thereof in a China safeguard \n     investigation under section 421(b)(1) of the Trade Act; or \n     (3) an affirmative final determination of material injury or \n     threat thereof in an antidumping or countervailing duty \n     investigation under section 705(b)(1)(A) or 735(b)(1)(A) of \n     the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1671d(b)(1)(A) and \n     1673d(b)(1)(A)), but only if the petition is filed within 1 \n     year of the date that notice of the affirmative ITC \n     determination is published in the Federal Register (or, in \n     the case of a global safeguard investigation under section \n     202(b)(1), a summary of the report submitted to the President \n     by the ITC under section 202(f)(1) is published in the \n     Federal Register under section 202(f)(3)) and the workers on \n     whose behalf such petition was filed have become totally or \n     partially separated from such workers' firm within either \n     that 1-year period or the 1-year period preceding the date of \n     such publication.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents note that the provision allows workers in \n     firms publicly identified by name in certain ITC \n     investigations to be eligible for adjustment assistance on \n     the basis of an affirmative injury determination by the ITC \n     under certain circumstances, and without an additional \n     determination by the Secretary of Labor that either increased \n     imports of a like or directly competitive article contributed \n     importantly to such workers' separation or threat of \n     separation (and to an absolute decline in the sales or \n     production, or both, of such workers' firm or subdivision), \n     or that a shift in production of articles contributed \n     importantly to such workers' separation or threat of \n     separation.\n       In order for workers to avail themselves of this provision, \n     the petition must be filed with the Secretary (and with the \n     Governor of the State in which such workers' firm or \n     subdivision is located) within 1 year of the date of \n     publication in the Federal Register of the applicable notice \n     from the ITC and the workers on whose behalf such petition \n     was filed must have become totally or partially separated \n     from such workers' firm within either that 1-year period or \n     the 1-year period preceding such date of publication.\n       If a petition is filed on behalf of such workers more than \n     1 year after the date that the applicable notice from the ITC \n     is published in the Federal Register, it will remain \n     necessary for the Secretary of Labor to investigate the \n     petition and determine that the statutory criteria for \n     certifying such workers in section 222 are satisfied.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Determinations by the Secretary of Labor (Section 1703 \n         (amending Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Secretary is required to investigate petitions filed by \n     workers and determine whether such workers are eligible for \n     TAA benefits. A summary of such group eligibility \n     determination, together with the Secretary's reasons for \n     making the determination, must be promptly published in the \n     Federal Register. Similarly, a termination of a \n     certification, together with the Secretary's reasons for the \n     termination, must be promptly published in the Federal \n     Register.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This section requires the Secretary to publish (1) a \n     summary of a group eligibility determination, together with \n     the Secretary's reasons for the determination; and (2) a \n     certification termination, together with the Secretary's \n     reasons for the termination, promptly on the Department's \n     website (as well as in the Federal Register). The section \n     also requires the Secretary to establish standards for \n     investigating petitions, and criteria for making \n     determinations. Moreover, the Secretary is required to \n     consult with the Senate Committee on Finance (``Senate \n     Finance Committee'') and the Committee on Ways and Means of \n     the House of Representatives (``House Committee on Ways and \n     Means'') 90 days prior to issuing a final rule on the \n     standards.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       To improve accountability, transparency, and public access \n     to this information, the Secretary should be required to post \n     (1) a summary of a group eligibility determination, together \n     with the Secretary's reasons for the determination; and (2) a \n     certification termination, together with the Secretary's \n     reasons for the termination, promptly on the Department's \n     website (as well as in the Federal Register). The Secretary \n     also should have objective and transparent standards for \n     investigating petitions, and criteria for the basis on which \n     an eligibility determination is made. The Secretary should \n     consult with Senate Finance and House Ways and Means to \n     ensure the intent of Congress is accurately reflected in such \n     standards.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Monitoring and Reporting Relating to Service Sector (Section \n         1704 (amending Section 282 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law requires the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor \n     to establish and maintain a program to monitor imports of \n     articles into the United States, including (1) information \n     concerning changes in import volume; (2) impacts on domestic \n     production; and (3) impacts on domestic employment in \n     industries producing like or competitive products. Summaries \n     must be provided to the Adjustment Assistance Coordinating \n     Committee, the ITC, and Congress.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision is renamed ``Trade Monitoring and Data \n     Collection.'' The provision requires the Secretaries of \n     Commerce and Labor to monitor imports of services (in \n     addition to articles). To address data limitations, the \n     provision requires the Secretary of Labor, not later than 90 \n     days after enactment, to collect data on impacted service \n     workers (by State, industry, and cause). Finally, it requires \n     the Secretary of Commerce, in consultation with the Secretary \n     of Labor, to report to Congress, not later than one year \n     after enactment, on ways to improve the timeliness and \n     coverage of data regarding trade in services.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Existing data on trade in services are sparse. Because of \n     the increases in trade in services, the proponents believe \n     that it is critical that the government collect data on \n     imports of services and the impact of these imports on U.S. \n     workers. Such information\n\n[[Page S2055]]\n\n     will be useful when considering any further refinement of TAA \n     that Congress may contemplate. More generally, the additional \n     data will give U.S. businesses and workers insight into trade \n     in services, helping them better compete in the global \n     marketplace.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n  2. Subpart B--Industry Notifications Following Certain Affirmative \n                             Determinations\n\n     Notifications following certain affirmative determinations \n         (Section 1711 (amending Section 224 of the Trade Act of \n         1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law includes a provision requiring the ITC to \n     notify the Secretary of Labor when it begins a section 201 \n     global safeguard investigation. The Secretary must then begin \n     an investigation of (1) the number of workers in the relevant \n     domestic industry; and (2) whether TAA will help such workers \n     adjust to import competition. The Secretary of Labor must \n     submit a report to the President within 15 days of the ITC's \n     section 201 determination. The Secretary's report must be \n     made public and a summary printed in the Federal Register.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision expands the notification requirement to \n     instruct the ITC to notify the Secretary of Labor and the \n     Secretary of Commerce, or the Secretary of Agriculture when \n     dealing with agricultural commodities, when it issues an \n     affirmative determination of injury or threat thereof under \n     sections 202 or 421 of the Trade Act, an affirmative \n     safeguard determination under a U.S. trade agreement, or an \n     affirmative determination in a countervailing duty or dumping \n     investigation under sections 705 or 735 of the Tariff Act of \n     1930. Additionally, the provision requires the President to \n     notify the Secretaries of Labor and Commerce upon making an \n     affirmative determination in a safeguard investigation \n     relating to textile and apparel articles. Whenever an injury \n     determination is made, the Secretary of Labor must notify \n     employers, workers, and unions of firms covered by the \n     determination of the workers' potential eligibility for TAA \n     benefits and provide them with assistance in filing \n     petitions. Similarly, the Secretary of Commerce must notify \n     firms covered by the determination of their potential \n     eligibility for TAA for Firms and provide them with \n     assistance in filing petitions, and the Secretary of \n     Agriculture must do the same for investigations involving \n     agricultural commodities.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       A significant hurdle to ensuring that workers and firms \n     avail themselves of TAA benefits is the lack of awareness \n     about the program. In situations like these, where the ITC \n     has made a determination that a domestic industry has been \n     injured as a result of trade, giving notice to the workers \n     and firms in that industry of TAA's potential benefits is \n     warranted.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Notification to Secretary of Commerce (Section 1712 (amending \n         Section 225 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, the Secretary of Labor must provide \n     workers with information about TAA and provide whatever \n     assistance is necessary to help petitioners apply for TAA. \n     The Secretary must also reach out to State Vocational \n     Education Boards and their equivalent agencies, as well as \n     other public and private institutions, about affirmative \n     group certification determinations and projections of \n     training needs.\n       The Secretary must also notify each worker who the State \n     has reason to believe is covered by a group certification in \n     writing via U.S. Mail of the benefits available under TAA. If \n     the worker lost his job before group certification, then the \n     notice occurs at the time of certification. If the worker \n     lost her job after group certification, then the notice \n     occurs at the time the worker loses her job. The Secretary \n     must also publish notice in the newspapers circulating in the \n     area where the workers reside.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary of Labor, upon issuing \n     a certification, to notify the Secretary of Commerce of the \n     identity of the firms covered by a certification.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Firms employing workers certified as eligible for TAA \n     benefits may not be aware that they may be eligible for \n     assistance under the TAA for Firms program. Requiring the \n     Secretary of Labor to notify the Secretary of Commerce when \n     workers at a firm are certified as TAA eligible will help put \n     these firms on notice of their potential TAA for Firms \n     eligibility.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n\n                     3. Subpart C--Program Benefits\n\n     Qualifying requirements for workers (Section 1721 (amending \n         Section 231 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law authorizes a worker to receive TAA income \n     support (known as ``Trade Readjustment Allowance'' or \n     ``TRA'') for weeks of unemployment that begin 60 days after \n     the date of filing the petition on which certification was \n     granted.\n       To qualify for TAA benefits, a worker must have (1) lost \n     his job on or after the trade impact date identified in the \n     certification, and within two years of the date of the \n     certification determination; (2) been employed by the TAA \n     certified firm for at least 26 of the 52 weeks preceding the \n     layoff; and (3) earned at least $30 or more a week in that \n     employment.\n       A worker must qualify for, and exhaust, his State \n     unemployment compensation (``UC'') benefits before receiving \n     a weekly TRA.\n       Further, to receive TRA, a worker must be enrolled in an \n     approved training program by the later of 8 weeks after the \n     TAA petition was certified, or 16 weeks after job loss (the \n     ``8/16'' deadline). The 8/16 deadline can be extended in \n     certain limited circumstances. Workers may also receive \n     limited waivers of the 8/16 training enrollment deadline.\n       Present law provides for waivers in the following \n     circumstances: (1) the worker has been or will be recalled by \n     the firm; (2) the worker possesses marketable skills; (3) the \n     worker is within 2 years of retirement; (4) the worker cannot \n     participate in training because of health reasons; (5) \n     training enrollment is unavailable; or (6) training is not \n     reasonably available to the worker (nothing suitable, no \n     reasonable cost, no training funds).\n       Waivers last 6 months, unless the Secretary determines \n     otherwise, and will be revoked if the basis for the waiver no \n     longer exists. States have the authority to issue waivers. By \n     regulation, State and local agencies must ``review'' the \n     waivers every thirty days.\n       If a worker fails to begin training or has stopped \n     participating in training without justifiable cause or if the \n     worker's waiver is revoked, the worker will receive no income \n     support until the worker begins or resumes training.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision amends existing law to change the date on \n     which a worker can receive TAA income support from 60 days \n     from the date of the petition to the date of certification.\n       The provision strikes the 8/16 rule and extends the \n     deadline for trade-impacted workers. If a worker lost his job \n     before the certification, then the worker has 26 weeks from \n     the date of certification to enroll in training. If the \n     worker lost his job after certification, he has 26 weeks from \n     the date he lost his job to enroll in training.\n       The provision also gives the Secretary the authority to \n     waive the new 26 week training enrollment deadline if a \n     worker was not given timely notice of the deadline.\n       The provision clarifies that the ``marketable skills'' \n     training waiver may apply to workers who have post-graduate \n     degrees from accredited institutions of higher education.\n       The provision requires the State to review training waivers \n     3 months after such waiver is issued, and every month \n     thereafter.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the 60-day rule makes little \n     sense and leads to the following scenario: a worker laid off \n     well before certification could exhaust his unemployment \n     insurance and yet have to wait to receive the trade \n     readjustment assistance to which the worker was otherwise \n     entitled.\n       The Government Accountability Office, the Department of \n     Labor, the states, and workers' advocacy groups have \n     criticized the 8/16 deadline as being too short. First, these \n     deadlines often occur while the worker is still on \n     traditional UI (most workers receive up to 26 weeks of State \n     UI compensation). During those 26 weeks, most workers are \n     actively engaged in a job search and are not focused on \n     retraining. Forcing workers to enroll in training at such an \n     early stage can discourage active job search. Second, \n     typically, a worker decides to consider training only after \n     an extended period of unsuccessful job searching. Under \n     present law, workers are only beginning to consider training \n     options close to the 8/16 deadline, and often make hurried \n     decisions about training merely to preserve their TAA \n     eligibility. Third, when large numbers of certified workers \n     are laid off all at once, it can be difficult for TAA \n     administrators to perform adequate training assessments and \n     meet the 8/16 deadline. See GAO Report 04-1012. Therefore, \n     extending the enrollment deadlines to the later of 26 weeks \n     after layoff or certification would provide a reasonable \n     period for a worker to search for employment and consider \n     training options, as well as for the State to assess workers \n     and meet the enrollment deadlines.\n       While recognizing the necessity of waivers in certain \n     circumstances, states have identified the monthly review of \n     waivers to be burdensome. Many states have complained that \n     processing the sheer volume of waivers requires significant \n     administrative time and cost. For example, according to GAO, \n     59,375 waivers were issued in 2005 (and 60,948 in 2004). The \n     new requirement that waivers be reviewed initially three \n     months rather than one month after they are issued reduces \n     the administrative burden while continuing to provide for \n     appropriate review, thus allowing the State to ensure the \n     worker continues to\n\n[[Page S2056]]\n\n     qualify for the waiver. The provision does not require a \n     review of waivers issued on the basis that an adversely \n     affected worker is within two years of being eligible for \n     Social Security benefits or a private pension. The status of \n     such workers is unlikely to change and thus, automatic review \n     of their waivers is a waste of resources. States still retain \n     the discretion to review such waivers if circumstances \n     warrant.\n       When a worker has failed to meet the training enrollment \n     deadline through no fault of his own, the proponents believe \n     that there should be redress. Under present law, there is \n     none. The Department of Labor has acknowledged that this is a \n     problem.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Weekly amounts (Section 1722 (amending Section 232 of the \n         Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       TRA is the income support that workers receive weekly. It \n     is equal to the worker's weekly UI benefit. TRA is divided \n     into two main periods: ``Basic TRA'' and ``Additional TRA.''\n       Under present law, because of the operation of State UI \n     laws, workers who are in training and working part-time run \n     the risk of resetting their UI benefits (and their TRA \n     benefit) at the lower part-time level which would leave them \n     with insufficient income support to continue with training.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision amends existing law to (1) disregard, for \n     purposes of determining a worker's weekly TRA amount, \n     earnings from a week of work equal to or less than the \n     worker's most recent unemployment insurance benefits where \n     the worker is working part-time and participating in full-\n     time training; and (2) ensure that workers will retain the \n     amount of income support provided initially under TRA even if \n     a new UI benefit period (with a lower weekly amount) is \n     established due to the worker obtaining part-time or short-\n     term full-time employment.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the disincentive to combining \n     full-time training and part-time work needs to be removed so \n     that workers who might not otherwise be in training, but for \n     the additional income they earn working part-time, are not \n     excluded from the program.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Limitations on Trade Readjustment Allowances; Allowances for \n         Extended Training and Breaks in Training (Section 1723 \n         (amending Section 233(a) of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Basic TRA is available for 52 weeks minus the number of \n     weeks of unemployment insurance for which the worker was \n     eligible (usually 26 weeks). Basic TRA must be used within \n     104 weeks after the worker lost his job (130 weeks for \n     workers requiring remedial training). Any Basic TRA not used \n     in that period is foregone.\n       Additional TRA is available for up to 52 more weeks if the \n     worker is enrolled in and participating in training. The \n     worker receives Additional TRA only for weeks in training. A \n     worker on an approved break in training of 30 days or less is \n     considered to be participating in training and therefore \n     eligible for TRA during that period. Additional TRA must \n     otherwise be used over a consecutive period (e.g., 52 \n     consecutive weeks).\n       Participation in remedial training makes a worker eligible \n     for up to 26 more weeks of TRA.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision increases the number of weeks for which a \n     worker can receive Additional TRA from 52 to 78 and expands \n     the time within which a worker can receive such Additional \n     TRA from 52 weeks to 91 weeks.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the program must provide \n     incentives for eligible workers to participate in long term \n     training, such as a two-year Associate's degree, a nursing \n     certification, or completion of a four-year degree (if that \n     four-year degree was previously initiated or if the worker \n     will complete it using non-TAA funds).\n       Typically, workers cannot participate in a training program \n     without TAA income support. Thus, because many workers \n     exhaust at least some of their basic TRA while they seek \n     another job instead of beginning training, they are limited \n     to shorter-term training options, both practically and \n     because training approvals are usually tied to the period of \n     TRA eligibility. The purpose of the additional 26 weeks of \n     income support, for a total of 78 weeks of additional TRA, is \n     to provide an opportunity for workers to engage in long term \n     training that might not have otherwise been a viable option.\n       The proponents note that the Department of Labor's practice \n     is to approve, before training begins, a training program \n     consisting of a course or related group of courses designed \n     for an individual to meet a specific occupational goal. 20 \n     CFR 617.22(f)(3)(i). Nothing in this section is intended to \n     change current Department of Labor practice. The additional \n     26 weeks of income support are intended to provide more \n     options for long term training at the time when this \n     individual training program is designed and approved.\n       In short, the new, additional income support is available \n     only for workers in long term training.\n       The proponents note that, at the same time, it is not their \n     intent to limit the Secretary's ability, in certain, limited \n     circumstances, to modify a worker's training program where \n     the Secretary determines that the current training program is \n     no longer appropriate for the individual.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Special Rules for Calculation of Eligibility Period (Section \n         1724 (amending Section 233 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no provision in present law.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision states that periods during which an \n     administrative or judicial appeal of a negative determination \n     is pending will not be counted when calculating a worker's \n     eligibility for TRA. Moreover, the provision also grants \n     justifiable cause authority to the Secretary to extend \n     certain applicable deadlines concerning receipt of Basic and \n     Additional TRA. Further, the provision allows workers called \n     up for active duty military or full-time National Guard \n     service to restart the TAA enrollment process after \n     completion of such service.\n       The provision also strikes the 210 day rule, which mandates \n     that a worker is not eligible for additional TRA payments if \n     the worker has not applied for training 210 days from \n     certification or job loss, whichever is later.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that tolling of deadlines is \n     necessary; otherwise judicial relief obtained from a \n     successful court challenge would be meaningless, as the \n     decision of the court will inevitably take place after the \n     TAA program eligibility deadlines have passed. The Department \n     of Labor provides for similar tolling in its present and \n     proposed regulations.\n       Similarly, the proponents believe that affording the \n     Secretary flexibility in instances where a worker is \n     ineligible through no fault of her own is consistent with the \n     spirit of the program and will help ensure that workers get \n     the retraining they need. The amendment permits the Secretary \n     to extend the periods during which trade readjustment \n     allowances may be paid to an individual if there is \n     justifiable cause. The provision does not increase the amount \n     of such allowances that are payable. The proponents intend \n     that the justifiable cause extension should allow the \n     Secretary equitable authority to address unforeseen \n     circumstances, such as a health emergency.\n       The 210 day deadline is superseded by the 8/16 deadline in \n     current law, the new 26/26 enrollment deadlines under these \n     amendments, and the requirement that a worker be in training \n     to receive additional TRA.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Application of State Laws and Regulations on Good Cause for \n         Waiver of Time Limits or Late Filing of Claims (Section \n         1725 (amending Section 234 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A State's unemployment insurance laws apply to a worker's \n     claims for TRA.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision makes a State's ``good cause'' law, \n     regulations, policies, and practices applicable when the \n     State is making determinations concerning a worker's claim \n     for TRA or other adjustment assistance.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Most States have ``good cause'' laws allowing the waiver of \n     a statutory deadline when the deadline was missed because of \n     agency error or for other reasons where the claimant was not \n     at fault. These good cause laws apply to administration of \n     State UI laws. The Department of Labor, by regulation, has \n     precluded application of State good cause laws to TAA. This \n     prohibition unjustifiably penalizes workers who miss a \n     deadline through no fault of their own.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Employment and Case Management Services; Administrative \n         Expenses and Employment and Case Management Services \n         (Sections 1726 and 1727 (amending Section 235 of the \n         Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law requires the Secretary of Labor to make ``every \n     reasonable effort'' to secure services for affected workers \n     covered by a certification including ``counseling, testing, \n     and placement services'' and ``[s]upportive and other \n     services provided for under any other Federal law,'' \n     including WIA one-stop services. Typically, the Secretary \n     provides these services through agreements with the States.\n\n[[Page S2057]]\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provisions require the Secretary and the States to, \n     among other things (1) perform comprehensive and specialized \n     assessments of enrollees' skill levels and needs; (2) develop \n     individual employment plans for each impacted worker; and (3) \n     provide enrollees with (a) information on available training \n     and how to apply for such training, (b) information on how to \n     apply for financial aid, (c) information on how to apply for \n     such training, (d) short-term prevocational services, (e) \n     individual career counseling, (f) employment statistics \n     information, and (g) information on the availability of \n     supportive services.\n       The provision requires the Secretary, either directly or \n     through the States (through cooperating agreements), to make \n     the employment and case management services described in \n     section 235 available to TAA eligible workers. TAA eligible \n     workers are not required to accept or participate in such \n     services, however, if they choose not to do so.\n       These provisions provide for each State to receive funds \n     equal to 15 percent of its training funding allocation on top \n     of its training fund allocation. Not more than two-thirds of \n     these additional funds may be used to cover administrative \n     expenses, and not less than one-third of such funds may be \n     used for the purpose of providing employment and case \n     management services, as defined under section 235. Finally, \n     the section provides for an additional $350,000 to be \n     provided to each State annually for the purpose of providing \n     employment and case management services. With respect to \n     these latter funds, States may decline or otherwise return \n     such funds to the Secretary.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       States incur costs to administer the TAA program, including \n     for processing applications and providing employment and case \n     management services. While appropriators customarily provide \n     the Department of Labor with administrative funds equal to 15 \n     percent of the total training funds for disbursement to the \n     States, the proponents believe that this practice should be \n     codified, with the changes discussed above.\n       The proponents believe that the employment services and \n     case management funding provided for in this section should \n     be in addition to, and not offset, any funds that the State \n     would otherwise receive under WIA or any other program.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Training Funding (Section 1728 (amending Section 236 of the \n         Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The total amount of annual training funding provided for \n     under present law is $220,000,000. During the year, if the \n     Secretary determines that there is inadequate funding to meet \n     the demand for training, the Secretary has the authority to \n     decide how to apportion the remaining funds to the States.\n       Based on internal department policy, at the beginning of \n     each fiscal year, the Department of Labor allocates 75 \n     percent of the training funds to States based on each State's \n     training expenditures and the average number of training \n     participants over the previous 2\\1/2\\ years. The previous \n     year's allocation serves as a floor. The Department of Labor \n     also has a ``hold harmless'' policy that ensures that each \n     State's initial allocation can be no less than 85 percent of \n     its initial allocation in the previous year. The Department \n     of Labor holds the remaining 25 percent in reserve to \n     distribute to States throughout the year according to need; \n     most of the remaining funds are disbursed at the end of the \n     fiscal year. States have 3 years to spend their federal \n     funds. If the funds are not spent, the money reverts back to \n     the General Treasury.\n       Under present law, the Secretary shall approve training if \n     (1) there is no suitable employment; (2) the worker would \n     benefit from appropriate training; (3) there is a reasonable \n     expectation of employment following training (although not \n     necessarily immediately available employment); (4) the \n     approved training is reasonably available to the worker; (5) \n     the worker is qualified for the training; and (6) training is \n     suitable and available at a reasonable cost. ``Insofar as \n     possible,'' the Secretary is supposed to ensure the provision \n     of training on the job. Training will be paid for directly by \n     the Secretary or using vouchers.\n       One of the statutory criteria for approval of training is \n     that the worker be qualified to undertake and complete such \n     training. The statute doesn't specifically address how the \n     income support available to a worker is to be considered in \n     determining the length of training the worker is qualified to \n     undertake. Another of the statutory training approval \n     criteria is that the training is available at a reasonable \n     cost. The statute doesn't specifically address if funds other \n     than those available under TAA may be considered in making \n     this determination.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision strikes the obsolete requirement that the \n     Secretary of Labor shall ``assure the provision'' of training \n     on the job.\n       This provision increases the training cap from $220,000,000 \n     to $575,000,000 in FY2009 and FY2010, prorated for the period \n     beginning October 1, 2010 and ending December 31, 2010.\n       The provision requires the Secretary to make an initial \n     distribution of training funds to the States as soon as \n     practicable after the beginning of the fiscal year based on \n     the following criteria: (1) the trend in numbers of certified \n     workers; (2) the trend in numbers of workers participating in \n     training; (3) the number of workers enrolled in training; (4) \n     the estimated amount of funding needed to provide approved \n     training; and (5) other factors the Secretary determines are \n     appropriate. The provision specifies that initial \n     distribution of training funds to a State may not be less \n     than 25 percent of the initial distribution to that State in \n     the previous fiscal year.\n       The provision requires the Secretary to establish \n     procedures for the distribution of the funds held in reserve, \n     which may include the distribution of such funds in response \n     to requests made by States in need of additional training \n     funds. The provision also requires the Secretary to \n     distribute 65 percent of the training funds in the initial \n     distribution, and to distribute at least 90 percent of \n     training funds for a particular fiscal year by July 15 of \n     that fiscal year.\n       The provision directs the Secretary to decide how to \n     distribute funds if training costs will exceed available \n     funds.\n       The provision would specify that in determining if a worker \n     is qualified to undertake and complete training, the training \n     may be approved for a period that is longer than the period \n     for which TRA is available if the worker demonstrates the \n     financial ability to complete the training after TRA is \n     exhausted. It is intended that financial ability means the \n     ability to pay living expenses while in TAA-funded training \n     after the period of TRA eligibility.\n       The provision would specify that in determining whether the \n     costs of training are reasonable, the Secretary may consider \n     whether other public or private funds are available to the \n     worker, but may not require the worker to obtain such funds \n     as a condition for approval of training. This means, for \n     example, that if a training program would be determined not \n     to have a reasonable cost if only the use of TAA training \n     funds were considered, the Secretary may consider the \n     availability of other public and private funds to the worker. \n     If the worker voluntarily commits to using such funds to \n     supplement the TAA training funds to pay for the training \n     program, the training program may be approved. However, the \n     Secretary may not require the worker to use the other public \n     or private funds where the costs of the training program \n     would be reasonable using only TAA training funds.\n       Finally, the provision requires the Secretary to issue \n     regulations in consultation with the Senate Finance Committee \n     and the House Committee on Ways and Means.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the training cap needs to be \n     increased for two reasons. First, more funding is needed to \n     cover the expanded group of TAA eligible workers because of \n     changes made elsewhere in the bill (e.g., coverage of service \n     workers, expanded coverage of manufacturing workers). Second, \n     during high periods of TAA usage, the existing training \n     funding has proved to be insufficient. Some states have run \n     out of training funds, resulting in some States freezing \n     enrollment of eligible workers in training. See GAO-04-1012.\n       As the GAO has documented, there are significant problems \n     with the Department's method of allocating training funds. \n     The primary problem is that the Department of Labor's method \n     of allocation appears to result in insufficient funds for \n     some States. This appears to be occurring because of the \n     Department's reliance on historical usage and a ``hold \n     harmless'' policy. In particular, States that were \n     experiencing heavy layoffs at the time the initial allocation \n     formula was implemented may no longer be experiencing layoffs \n     at the same rate, but still receive significant allocations \n     from the Department. In contrast, a State experiencing \n     relatively few layoffs several years ago may now have far \n     greater numbers of layoffs, but still receives a limited \n     amount in its distribution. In short, the allocation that \n     States receive at the beginning of the fiscal year may not \n     reflect their present demand for training services. The \n     provision addresses these problems by lowering the ``hold \n     harmless'' provision to 25 percent, requiring initial and \n     subsequent distributions to be based on need, and by \n     requiring that 90 percent of the funds be allocated by July \n     15 of each fiscal year. Additionally, the proponents expect \n     the Secretary to distribute the remaining funds as soon as \n     possible after that date.\n       In order to facilitate the approval of longer-term \n     training, the proponents intend to ensure that the period of \n     approved training is not necessarily limited to the duration \n     of TRA. Where the worker demonstrates the ability to pay \n     living expenses while in TAA funded training after TRA is \n     exhausted, such training should be approved if the other \n     training approval criteria are also met.\n       The proponents intend to ensure that training programs that \n     would otherwise not be approved under TAA due to costs may be \n     approved if a worker voluntarily commits to using \n     supplemental public or private funds to pay a portion of the \n     costs.\n       It is also the intent that, together, these amendments to \n     the training approval criteria allow training to be approved \n     for a period that is longer than the period for which TRA and \n     TAA-funded training is available if the worker demonstrates \n     the financial ability to pay living expenses and pay for the \n     additional training costs using other funds\n\n[[Page S2058]]\n\n     after TRA and the TAA-funded training are exhausted.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision increasing the training cap goes into effect \n     upon the date of enactment of this Act. The provisions \n     relating to training fund distribution procedures go into \n     effect October 1, 2009. The other provisions in this section \n     go into effect upon expiration of the 90-day period beginning \n     on the date of enactment of this Act, and apply to petitions \n     filed on or after that date.\n     Prerequisite Education, Approved Training Programs (Section \n         1729 (amending Section 236 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Under present law, approvable training includes employer-\n     based training (on-the-job training/customized training), \n     training approved under the Workforce Investment Act of 1998, \n     training approved by a private industry council, any remedial \n     education program, any training program whose costs are paid \n     by another federal or State program, and any other program \n     approved by the Secretary. Additionally, remedial training is \n     approvable and participation in such training makes a worker \n     eligible for up to 26 more weeks of TAA-related income \n     support.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision clarifies that existing law allows training \n     funds to be used to pay for apprenticeship programs, any \n     prerequisite education required to enroll in training, and \n     training at an accredited institution of higher education \n     (such as those covered by 102 of the Higher Education Act), \n     including training to obtain or complete a degree or \n     certification program (where completion of the degree or \n     certification can be reasonably expected to result in \n     employment). The provision also prohibits the Secretary from \n     limiting training approval to programs provided pursuant to \n     the Workforce Investment Act of 1998.\n       The provision offers up to an additional 26 weeks of income \n     support while workers take prerequisite training or remedial \n     training necessary to enter a training program. A worker may \n     enroll in remedial training or prerequisite training, or \n     both, but may not receive more than 26 weeks of additional \n     income support.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Present law does not explicitly state whether TAA training \n     funds may be used to obtain a college or advanced degree. \n     Some States have interpreted this silence to preclude \n     enrollment in a two-year community college or four-year \n     college or university as a training option, even where a TAA \n     participant was working towards completion of a degree prior \n     to being laid off. The proponents believe that States should \n     be encouraged to approve the use of training funds by TAA \n     enrollees to obtain training or a college or advanced degree, \n     including degrees offered at two-year community colleges and \n     four-year colleges or universities.\n       While a worker can obtain additional income support while \n     participating in remedial training, there is no corollary \n     support for workers participating in prerequisite training \n     (e.g., individuals enrolling in nursing usually need basic \n     science prerequisites, which are not considered qualifying \n     remedial training). States have requested additional income \n     support for workers who participate in prerequisite training.\n       The proponents believe that while WIA-approved training is \n     an approvable TAA training option, it should not be the only \n     one that TAA enrollees are authorized to pursue. The \n     proponents are concerned that some States have restricted \n     training opportunities to those approved under WIA. According \n     to the Congressional Research Service, many community \n     colleges, for instance, do not get WIA certification because \n     of its costly reporting requirements. To limit TAA training \n     opportunities in this way unacceptably curbs the scope of \n     training that TAA enrollees might elect to participate in and \n     potentially impairs their ability to get retrained and \n     reemployed.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Pre-Layoff and Part-Time Training (Section 1730 (amending \n         Section 236 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law does not permit pre-layoff or part-time \n     training,\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This provision specifies that the Secretary may approve \n     training for a worker who (1) is a member of a group of \n     workers that has been certified as eligible to apply for TAA \n     benefits; (2) has not been totally or partially separated \n     from employment; and (3) is determined to be individually \n     threatened with total or partial separation. Such training \n     may not include on-the-job training, or customized training \n     unless such customized training is for a position other than \n     the workers' current position.\n       Additionally, the provision permits the Secretary to \n     approve part-time training, but clarifies that a worker \n     enrolled in part-time training is not eligible for a TRA.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       This provision explicitly establishes Congress' intent that \n     workers be eligible to receive pre-layoff and part-time \n     training.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     On-the-Job Training (Section 1731 (amending Section 236 of \n         the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Current law provides that the Secretary may approve on-the-\n     job training (``OJT''), but does not govern the content of \n     acceptable OJT.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This provision permits the Secretary to approve OJT for any \n     adversely affected worker if the worker meets the training \n     requirements, and the Secretary determines the OJT (1) can \n     reasonably lead to employment with the OJT employer; (2) is \n     compatible with the worker's skills; (3) will allow the \n     worker to become proficient in the job for which the worker \n     is being trained; and (4) the State determines the OJT meets \n     necessary requirements. The Secretary may not enter into \n     contracts with OJT employers that exhibit a pattern of \n     failing to provide workers with continued long-term \n     employment and adequate wages, benefits, and working \n     conditions as regular employees.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The provision incorporates requirements to ensure OJT is \n     effective. Specifically, OJT must be (1) reasonably expected \n     to lead to suitable employment; (2)compatible with the \n     workers' skills; and (2) include a State-approved benchmark-\n     based curriculum. Moreover, the provision is intended to \n     prevent employers from treating workers participating in OJT \n     differently in terms of wages, benefits, and working \n     conditions from regular employees who have worked a similar \n     period of time and are doing the same type of work.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Eligibility for Unemployment Insurance and Program Benefits \n         While in Training (Section 1732 (amending Section 236 of \n         the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Current law states that a worker may not be deemed \n     ineligible for UI (and thus, TAA) if they are in training or \n     leave unsuitable work to enter training.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision states that a worker will not be ineligible \n     for UI or TAA if the worker (1) is in training, even if the \n     worker does not meet the requirements of availability for \n     work, active work search, or refusal to accept work under \n     Federal and State UI law; (2) leaves work to participate in \n     training, including temporary work during a break in \n     training; or (3) leaves OJT that did not meet the \n     requirements of this Act within 30 days of commencing such \n     training.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents are concerned that confusion in present UI \n     law surrounding a worker's decision to quit work to enter \n     training and the ramifications of that decision from a UI \n     eligibility perspective may preclude a worker from being able \n     to participate in TAA training. The provision is meant to \n     eliminate that confusion.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Job Search and Relocation Allowances (Section 1733 (amending \n         Section 237 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Secretary may grant an application for a job search \n     allowance where (1) the allowance will help the totally \n     separated worker find a job in the United States; (2) \n     suitable employment is not available in the local area; and \n     (3) the application is filed by the later of (a) 1 year from \n     separation, (b) 1 year from certification, or (c) 6 months \n     after completing training (unless the worker received a \n     waiver, in which case the worker must file by the later of \n     one year after separation or certification). A worker may be \n     reimbursed for 90 percent of his job search costs, up to \n     $1,250.\n       The Secretary may grant an application for a relocation \n     allowance where: (1) the allowance will assist a totally \n     separated worker relocate within the United States; (2) \n     suitable employment is not available in the local area; (3) \n     the affected worker has no job at the time of relocation; (4) \n     the worker has found suitable employment that may reasonably \n     be expected to be of long-term duration; (5) the worker has a \n     bona fide offer of employment; and (6) the worker filed the \n     application the later of (a) 425 days from separation, (b) \n     425 days from certification, or (c) 6 months after completing \n     training (unless the worker received a waiver, in which case \n     the worker must file by the later of 425 days after \n     separation or certification). A worker may be reimbursed for \n     90 percent of his relocation costs plus a lump sump payment \n     of three times the worker's weekly wage up to $1,250.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision reimburses 100 percent of a worker's job \n     search expenses, up to $1,500,\n\n[[Page S2059]]\n\n     and 100 percent of a worker's relocation expenses, and \n     increases the additional lump sum payment for relocation to a \n     maximum of $1,500. It also strikes the provision in existing \n     law under which a worker who has completed training but who \n     received a prior training waiver has a shorter period to \n     apply for a job search allowance and relocation allowance \n     than other workers who have completed training.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the job search and relocation \n     allowances need to be increased to reflect the cost of \n     inflation and the cost and difficulty a worker faces when \n     looking for work and taking a job outside the worker's local \n     community.\n       The proponents believe that workers completing training \n     should have the same periods after training to apply for job \n     search and relocation allowances irrespective of whether a \n     worker received a waiver from the enrollment in training \n     requirements prior to undertaking and completing the \n     training. This period allows workers a reasonable opportunity \n     to obtain the same assistance as other workers needed to find \n     and relocate to a new job after being trained.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n\n     4. Subpart D--Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance Program\n\n     Reemployment Trade Adjustment Assistance Program (Section \n         1741 (amending Section 246 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Trade Act of 2002 created a demonstration project for \n     alternative trade adjustment assistance for older workers \n     (ATAA or ``wage insurance''). Through this program, some \n     workers who are eligible for TAA and reemployed at lower \n     wages may receive a partial wage subsidy. Under the program, \n     States use Federal funds provided under the Trade Act to pay \n     eligible workers up to 50 percent of the difference between \n     reemployment wages and wages at the time of separation. \n     Eligible workers may not earn more than $50,000 in \n     reemployment wages, and total payments to a worker may not \n     exceed $10,000 during a maximum period of two years.\n       In addition to having been certified for TAA, such workers \n     must be at least 50 years of age, obtain full-time \n     reemployment with a new firm within 26 weeks of separation \n     from employment, and have been separated from a firm that is \n     specifically certified for ATAA. When considering \n     certification of a firm for ATAA, the Secretary of Labor \n     considers whether a significant number of workers in the firm \n     are 50 years of age or older and possess skills that are not \n     easily transferable. ATAA beneficiaries may not receive TAA \n     benefits other than the Health Coverage Tax Credit (HCTC).\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision renames ATAA ``reemployment TAA.'' The \n     provision eliminates the requirement that a group of workers \n     (in addition to individuals) be specifically certified for \n     wage insurance in addition to TAA certification. The \n     provision eliminates the current-law requirement that a \n     worker must find employment within 26 weeks of being laid off \n     to be eligible for the wage insurance benefit, and replaces \n     it with a requirement that the clock on the two-year duration \n     of the benefit begin at the sooner of exhaustion of regular \n     unemployment benefits or reemployment, allowing initial \n     receipt of the wage insurance benefit at any point during \n     that two-year period.\n       The provision allows workers to shift from receiving a TRA, \n     while training, to receiving reemployment TAA, while \n     employed, at any point during the two-year period.\n       The provision increases the limit on wages in eligible \n     reemployment from $50,000 a year to $55,000 a year. \n     Similarly, it increases the maximum wage insurance benefit \n     (over two years) from up to $10,000 to up to $12,000.\n       The provision lifts the restriction on wage insurance \n     recipients' participation in TAA-funded training. It also \n     permits workers reemployed less than full-time, but at least \n     20 hours a week, and in approved training, to receive the \n     wage insurance benefit (which would be prorated if the worker \n     is reemployed for fewer hours compared to previous \n     employment).\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the reemployment TAA, or wage \n     insurance, program is a potentially beneficial option for \n     many older workers, but it includes unnecessary barriers to \n     participation. The proponents believe that changes to section \n     246 of the Trade Act will make the wage insurance program a \n     more viable option for many more potentially interested \n     workers. Inflation has lessened the maximum value of the \n     available benefit, and increasing personal, nominal, median \n     income has lowered the share of workers eligible to \n     participate in the program. Several other requirements make \n     the program inaccessible and unattractive.\n       Findings from the Government Accountability Office (GAO) \n     highlight the need to reform specific aspects of the program. \n     First, the 26-week reemployment deadline was cited by the GAO \n     as one of ``two key factors [that] limit participation.'' The \n     GAO went on to note that ``[o]fficials in States [the GAO] \n     visited said that one of the greatest obstacles to \n     participation was the requirement for workers to find a new \n     job within 26 weeks after being laid off. For example, \n     according to officials in one State, 80 percent of \n     participants who were seeking wage insurance but were unable \n     to obtain it failed because they could not find a job within \n     the 26-week period. The challenges of finding a job within \n     this timeframe may be compounded by the fact that workers may \n     actually have less than 26 weeks to secure a job if they are \n     laid off prior to becoming certified for TAA. For example, a \n     local caseworker in one State [the GAO] visited said that the \n     26 weeks had passed completely before a worker was certified \n     for the benefit.''\n       Additionally, the GAO found that automatically certifying \n     workers for the wage insurance benefit would cut the \n     Department of Labor's workload and promote program \n     participation.\n       Currently, workers opting for wage insurance must also \n     surrender eligibility for TAA-funded training and be \n     reemployed full-time. The provision eliminates these \n     restrictions.\n       The proponents believe that eliminating the 26-week \n     deadline for reemployment, eliminating the need for firms to \n     be certified for wage insurance, eliminating the prohibition \n     on wage insurance beneficiaries receiving TAA-funded \n     training, and allowing part-time workers and former TRA \n     recipients access to the wage insurance benefit should make \n     the wage insurance program more accessible and attractive.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n\n                      5.

The Deputy Assistant \n     Secretary shall report directly to the Assistant Secretary \n     for Employment and Training Administration.\n       Under the provision, the administrator will be responsible \n     for overseeing and implementing the TAA for Workers program \n     and carrying out functions delegated to the Secretary of \n     Labor, including: making group certification determinations; \n     providing TAA information and assisting workers and others \n     assisting such workers prepare petitions or applications for \n     program benefits (including health care benefits); ensuring \n     covered workers receive Section 235 employment and case \n     management services; ensuring States comply with the terms of \n     their Section 239 agreements; advocating for workers applying \n     for assistance; and operating a hotline that workers and \n     employers may call with questions about TAA benefits, \n     eligibility requirements, and application procedures.\n       The provision requires the administrator to designate an \n     employee of the Department with appropriate experience and \n     expertise to receive complaints and requests for assistance, \n     resolve such complaints and requests, compile basic \n     information concerning the same, and carry out other tasks \n     that the Secretary specifies.\n       The Deputy Assistant Secretary will oversee the operation \n     of the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance and carry out \n     other duties that the Secretary assigns.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       It is the view of the proponents that creating an Office of \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance in the Department of Labor with \n     primary accountability for the management and performance of \n     the TAA for Workers program will improve the program's \n     operation. By requiring that the individual running that \n     office report to a Deputy Assistant Secretary confirmed by \n     the Senate, accountability and oversight of the program as a \n     whole will be enhanced.\n       The creation of the Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance \n     should not interfere with the coordination of services \n     provided by TAA, the National Emergency Grant program, and \n     Department of Labor Rapid Response services.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.\n     Accountability of State Agencies; Collection and Publication \n         of Program Data; Agreements with States (Section 1752 \n         (amending Section 239 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law gives the Secretary of Labor the authority to \n     delegate to the States through agreements many aspects of TAA \n     implementation, including responsibilities to (1) receive \n     applications for TAA and provide payments; (2) make \n     arrangements to provide certain employment services through \n     other Federal programs; and (3) issue waivers. It also \n     mandates that any agreement entered into shall include \n     sections requiring that the provision of TAA\n\n[[Page S2060]]\n\n     services and training be coordinated with the provision of \n     Workforce Investment Act (WIA) services and training. In \n     carrying out its responsibilities, each State must notify \n     workers who apply for UI about TAA, facilitate early filing \n     for TAA benefits, advise workers to apply for training when \n     they apply for TRA, and interview affected workers as soon as \n     possible for purposes of getting them into training. States \n     must also submit to the Department of Labor information like \n     that provided under a WIA State plan.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision requires the Secretary, either directly or \n     through the States (through cooperating agreements), to make \n     the employment and case management services described in the \n     amended section 235 available to TAA eligible workers. TAA \n     eligible workers are not required to accept or participate in \n     such services, however, if they choose not to do so.\n       The provision requires States and cooperating State \n     agencies to implement effective control measures and to \n     effectively oversee the operation and administration of the \n     TAA program, including by monitoring the operation of control \n     measures to improve the accuracy and timeliness of reported \n     data.\n       The provision also requires States and cooperating State \n     agencies to report comprehensive performance accountability \n     data to the Secretary, on a quarterly basis.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       To ensure that the employment and case management services \n     described in the amended section 235 are made available to \n     TAA enrollees as required under that section, the proponents \n     believe that it is necessary to incorporate those obligations \n     into the agreements that the Department of Labor enters into \n     with each of the States concerning the administration of TAA.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Verification of Eligibility for Program Benefits (Section \n         1753 (amending Section 239 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no provision in present law.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Section 1753 requires a State to re-verify the immigration \n     status of a worker receiving TAA benefits using the \n     Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) Program \n     (42 U.S.C. 1320b-7(d)) if the documentation provided during \n     the worker's initial verification for the purposes of \n     establishing the worker's eligibility for unemployment \n     compensation would expire during the period in which that \n     worker is potentially eligible to receive TAA benefits.\n       The section also requires the Secretary to establish \n     procedures to ensure that the re-verification process is \n     implemented properly and uniformly from State to State.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       This provision is intended to ensure that workers maintain \n     a satisfactory immigration status while receiving benefits. \n     This section was included for the purposes of the TAA program \n     only and should not be extended to other programs.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Collection of Data and Reports; Information to Workers \n         (Section 1754 (amending Subchapter C of chapter 2 of \n         title II of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Present law does not contain statutory language requiring \n     the collection of data or performance goals and the TAA \n     program has suffered a history of problems with its \n     performance data that has undermined the data's credibility \n     and limited their usefulness. Most of the outcome data \n     reported in a given program year actually reflects \n     participants who left the program up to 5 calendar quarters \n     earlier. In addition, as of FY 2006, the Department of Labor \n     does not consistently report TAA data by State or industry or \n     by services or benefits received.\n       While the Department of Labor has take some steps aimed at \n     improving performance data, the data remain suspect and fail \n     to capture outcomes for some of the program's participants, \n     and many participants are not included in the final outcomes \n     at all.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision would require the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement a system for collecting data on all workers who \n     apply for or receive TAA. The system must include the \n     following data classified by State, industry, and nationwide \n     totals: number of petitions; number of workers covered; \n     average processing time for petitions; a breakdown of \n     certified petitions by the cause of job loss (increased \n     imports etc.); the number of workers receiving benefits under \n     any aspect of TAA (broken down by type of benefit); the \n     average time during which workers receive each type of \n     benefit; the number of workers enrolled in training, \n     classified by type of training; the average duration of \n     training; the number and type of training waiver granted; the \n     number of workers who complete and do not complete training; \n     data on outcomes, including the sectors in which workers are \n     employed after receiving benefits; and data on rapid response \n     activities.\n       The provision would also require, by December 15 of each \n     year, the Secretary to provide to the Senate Finance \n     Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means a report \n     that includes a summary of the information above, information \n     on distributions of training funds under section 236(a)(2), \n     and any recommendations on whether changes to eligibility \n     requirements, benefits, or training funding should be made \n     based on the data collected. Those data must be made \n     available to the public on the Department of Labor's website \n     in a searchable format and must be updated quarterly.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that valuable information on TAA and \n     its impact is neither being collected nor being made publicly \n     available. This, in turn, inhibits the ability of Congress to \n     perform its oversight responsibilities and, if necessary, to \n     refine and improve the program, its performance, and worker \n     outcomes. Additionally, the proponents believe that all of \n     the data that the Department of Labor gathers should be made \n     available and posted on its website in a searchable format. \n     This will enhance the accountability of the TAA program and \n     the Department of Labor, not just to Congress, but to the \n     American people as well.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Fraud and recovery of overpayments (Section 1755 (amending \n         Section 243(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       An overpayment of TAA benefits may be waived if, in \n     accordance with the Secretary's guidelines, the payment was \n     made without fault on the part of such individual, and \n     requiring such repayment would be contrary to ``equity and \n     good conscience.''\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision states that the Secretary shall waive \n     repayment if the overpayment was made without fault on the \n     part of such individual and if repayment ``would cause a \n     financial hardship for the individual (or the individual's \n     household, if applicable) when taking into consideration the \n     income and resources reasonably available to the individual \n     or household and other ordinary living expenses of the \n     individual or household.''\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the Department of Labor has \n     adopted a very strict standard for issuing overpayment \n     waivers. In particular, 20 CFR 617.55(a)(2)(ii)(C) defines \n     equity and good conscience to require ``extraordinary and \n     lasting financial hardship'' that would ``result directly'' \n     in the ``loss of or inability to obtain minimal necessities \n     of food, medicine, and shelter for a substantial period of \n     time'' and ``may be expected to endure for the foreseeable \n     future.''\n       The proponents understand that no worker has met this \n     strict waiver standard. In including standard statutory \n     waiver language in TAA, there is no indication that Congress \n     intended to make waivers impossible to secure. To the \n     contrary, the proponents believe that Congress intended that \n     overpaid individuals who are without fault and unable to \n     repay their TAA overpayments should have a reasonable \n     opportunity for waivers of the requirement to return those \n     overpayments. The provision clarifies this intent.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Sense of Congress on Application of Trade Adjustment \n         Assistance (Section 1756 (amending Section Chapter 5 of \n         title II of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       There is no provision in present law.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision expresses the Sense of Congress that the \n     Secretaries of Labor, Commerce, and Agriculture should apply \n     the provisions of their respective trade adjustment \n     assistance programs with the utmost regard for the interests \n     of workers, firms, communities, and farmers petitioning for \n     benefits.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Courts reviewing determinations by the Department of Labor \n     regarding certification for trade adjustment assistance have \n     stated that the Department is obliged to conduct its \n     investigations with ``utmost regard for the interests of the \n     petitioning workers.'' See, e.g., Former Employees of Komatsu \n     Dresser v. United States Secretary of Labor, 16 C.I.T. 300, \n     303 (1992) (citations omitted). The courts have explained \n     that such statements flow from the ex parte nature of the \n     Department's certification process (as opposed to a judicial \n     or quasi-judicial proceeding) and the remedial purpose of the \n     trade adjustment assistance program. This section reflects \n     such statements and extends them to the firms, farmers, and \n     communities programs.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the\n\n[[Page S2061]]\n\n     date of enactment of this Act, and applies to petitions filed \n     on or after that date.\n     Consultations in Promulgation of Regulations (Section 1757 \n         (amending Section 248 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The Secretary is required to prescribe necessary \n     regulations.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This provision requires the Secretary to consult with the \n     Senate Finance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and \n     Means 90 days prior to the issuance of a final rule or \n     regulation.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Requiring that the Secretary consult with the relevant \n     committees 90 days prior to the issuance of a final rule or \n     regulations will help ensure that such rules and regulations \n     reflect Congress' intent.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n\n           B. Part II--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms\n\n     Trade Adjustment Assistance for Firms (Section 1761-1767 \n         (amending Sections 251, 254, 255, 256, 257, and 258 of \n         the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A firm may file a petition for certification with the \n     Secretary of Commerce. Upon receipt of the petition, the \n     Secretary shall publish a notice in the Federal Register that \n     the petition has been received and is being investigated. The \n     petitioner, or anyone else with a substantial interest, may \n     request a public hearing concerning the petition.\n       To be certified to receive TAA benefits, a firm must show \n     (1) a ``significant'' number of workers became or are \n     threatened to become totally or partially separated; (2) \n     sales or production of an article, or both, decreased \n     absolutely, or sales or production, or both, of an article \n     that accounted for not less than 25 percent of the total \n     production or sales of the firm during the 12-month period \n     preceding the most recent 12-month period for which data are \n     available have decreased absolutely; and (3) increased \n     imports of competing articles ``contributed importantly'' to \n     the decline in sales, production, and/or workforce.\n       A firm certified under section 251 has two years in which \n     to file an adjustment assistance application, which must \n     include an economic adjustment proposal.\n       In deciding whether to approve an application, the \n     Secretary of Commerce must determine that the proposal (1) is \n     reasonably calculated ``to materially contribute'' to the \n     economic adjustment of the firm; (2) gives adequate \n     consideration to the interests of the firm's workers; and (3) \n     demonstrates that the firm will use its own resources for \n     adjustment.\n       Criminal and civil penalties are applicable for, among \n     other things, making false statements or failing to disclose \n     material facts. However, the penalties do not cover the acts \n     and omissions of customers or others responding to queries \n     made in the course of an investigation of a firm's petition.\n       The Secretary must make its decisions within 60 days.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision makes service sector firms potentially \n     eligible for benefits under the TAA for Firms program. It \n     also expands the look back so that all firms can use the \n     average of one, two, or three years of sales or production \n     data, as opposed to one year, to show that the firm's sales, \n     production, or both, have decreased absolutely or that the \n     firm's sales, production, or both of an article or service \n     that accounts for at least 25 percent of its total \n     production, or sales have decreased absolutely.\n       In determining eligibility, the provision makes clear that \n     the Secretary may use data from the preceding 36 months to \n     determine an increase in imports, and may determine that \n     increased imports exist if customers accounting for a \n     significant percentage of the decline in a firm's sales or \n     production certify that their purchases of imported articles \n     or services have increased absolutely or relative to the \n     acquisition of such articles or services from suppliers in \n     the United States.\n       The provision requires the Secretary of Commerce, upon \n     receiving information from the Secretary of Labor that the \n     workers of a firm are TAA-covered, to notify the firm of its \n     potential TAA eligibility.\n       The provision requires the Secretary of Commerce to provide \n     grants to intermediary organizations to deliver TAA benefits. \n     The provision requires the Secretary to endeavor to align the \n     contracting schedules for all such grants by 2010, and to \n     provide annual grants to the intermediary organizations \n     thereafter. The provision requires the Secretary to develop a \n     methodology to ensure prompt initial distribution of a \n     portion of the funds to each of the intermediary \n     organizations, and to determine how the remaining funds will \n     be allocated and distributed to them. The Secretary must \n     develop the methodology in consultation with the Senate \n     Finance Committee and the House Committee on Ways and Means.\n       The provision amends the penalties provision in section 259 \n     to cover entities, including customers, providing information \n     during an investigation of a firm's petition.\n       Additionally, the provision requires the Secretary of \n     Commerce to submit an annual report demonstrating the \n     operation, effectiveness, and outcomes of the TAA for Firms \n     program to the Senate Finance Committee and the House \n     Committee on Ways and Means, and to make the report available \n     to the public. The methodology for the distribution of funds \n     to the intermediary organizations shall include criteria \n     based on the data in the report. The provision creates rules \n     relating to the disclosure of confidential business \n     information included in this annual report.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       Most service sector firms are currently ineligible for the \n     TAA for Firms program because of a statutory requirement that \n     the workers must have been employed by a firm that produces \n     an ``article.'' In an era when 80 percent of U.S. workers are \n     employed in the service sector, the proponents believe \n     service sector firms should be eligible for TAA.\n       The proponents also note that firms currently have a \n     limited ``look back'' under existing law, which unfairly \n     restricts their ability to show that increased imports are \n     hurting their businesses.\n       Because data is not always readily available to demonstrate \n     an increase in imports of articles or services, or to show \n     how such increased imports compete with the articles or \n     services of a particular firm, the proponents believe that \n     the Secretary should be able to utilize information from the \n     customers of a firm that account for a significant percentage \n     of sales or production that would verify these customers are \n     increasing their purchases of imports relative to their \n     purchases from domestic suppliers.\n       Since a firm may not know that it could be eligible for TAA \n     benefits, despite the fact that workers at the firm have \n     qualified for the TAA for workers program, the proponents \n     believe it is important to give these firms notice of their \n     potential eligibility for TAA benefits.\n       The proponents are concerned that at present, the Economic \n     Development Administration (EDA) is entering into contracts \n     with intermediary organizations that vary in length.\n       Thus, the contracts begin and end at different times during \n     the year. To improve transparency, accountability and \n     oversight, the proponents have included a provision requiring \n     EDA to endeavor to align these contracts by October 2010 and \n     enter into 12 month contracts thereafter. The proponents will \n     leave it to the discretion of the Secretary to determine the \n     appropriate 12 month contract cycle.\n       The proponents also believe that the methodology for \n     distributing funds to intermediary organizations should be \n     based in part on their performance, the number of firms they \n     serve, and the outcomes of firms completing the program. The \n     Secretary of Commerce should consult Congress before \n     finalizing such methodology.\n       The proponents understand that some customers provide \n     inaccurate or incomplete information in response to \n     questionnaires posed by the Secretary. The penalty language \n     included in this provision is designed to address this \n     problem.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n     Extension of Authorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance for \n         Firms (Section 1764)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       The authorization of the TAA for Firms program expired on \n     December 31, 2007. The program is currently authorized at $16 \n     million per year.\n\n\n                        explanation of provision\n\n       The provision reauthorizes the program through December 31, \n     2010, and increases its funding to $50 million per year for \n     fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and prorates such funding for the \n     period beginning October 1, 2010 and ending December 31, \n     2010. Of that amount, $350,000 is set aside each year to fund \n     full-time TAA for Firms positions at the Department of \n     Commerce, including a director of the TAA for Firms program.\n\n\n                           reasons for change\n\n       The proponents believe that the TAA for Firms program has \n     been underfunded, as at least $15 million in approved \n     projects lack funding. Additionally, the Firms team at the \n     Department of Commerce lacks adequate full-time staff to \n     administer the program.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n\n        C. Part III--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities\n\n     Trade Adjustment Assistance for Communities (Section 1771-\n         1773)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       There is no provision in present law.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision creates a Trade Adjustment Assistance for \n     Communities program that will allow a community to apply for \n     designation as a community affected by trade. A community may \n     receive such designation from the Secretary of Commerce if \n     the community demonstrates that (1) the Secretary of Labor \n     has certified a group of workers in the community as eligible \n     for TAA for Workers benefits, the Secretary of Commerce has\n\n[[Page S2062]]\n\n     certified a firm in the community as eligible for TAA for \n     Firms benefits, or a group of agricultural producers in the \n     community has been certified to receive benefits under the \n     TAA for Farmers and Fishermen program; and (2) the Secretary \n     determines that the community is significantly affected by \n     the threat to, or the loss of, jobs associated with that \n     certification. The Secretary of Commerce must notify the \n     community and the Governor of the State in which the \n     community is located upon making an affirmative determination \n     that the community is affected by trade.\n       The Secretary of Commerce shall provide technical \n     assistance to a community affected by trade to assist the \n     community to (1) diversify and strengthen its economy; (2) \n     identify impediments to economic development that result from \n     the impact of trade; and (3) develop a community strategic \n     plan to address economic adjustment and workforce dislocation \n     in the community. The Secretary of Commerce shall also \n     identify Federal, State and local resources available to \n     assist the community, and ensure that Federal assistance is \n     delivered in a targeted, integrated manner. The Secretary \n     shall establish an Interagency Community Assistance Working \n     Group to assist in coordinating the Federal response.\n       A community affected by trade may develop a strategic plan \n     for the community's economic adjustment and submit the plan \n     to the Secretary. The plan should be developed, to the extent \n     possible, with participation from local, county, and State \n     governments, local firms, local workforce investment boards, \n     labor organizations, and educational institutions. The plan \n     should include an analysis of the economic development \n     challenges facing the community and the community's capacity \n     to achieve economic adjustment to these challenges; an \n     assessment of the community's long-term commitment to the \n     plan and the participation of community members; a \n     description of projects to be undertaken by the community; a \n     description of educational opportunities and future \n     employment needs in the community; and an assessment of the \n     funding required to implement the strategic plan.\n       Of the funds appropriated, the Secretary of Commerce may \n     award up to $25 million in grants to assist the community in \n     developing a strategic plan.\n       The provision authorizes $150 million in discretionary \n     grants to be awarded by the Secretary of Commerce. An \n     eligible community may apply for a grant from the Secretary \n     to implement a project or program included in the community's \n     strategic plan. Grants may not exceed $5 million. The Federal \n     share of the grant may not exceed 95 percent of the cost of \n     the project and the community's share is an amount not less \n     than 5 percent. Priority shall be given to grant applications \n     submitted by small and medium-sized communities.\n       Educational institutions may also apply for Community \n     College and Career Training grants from the Secretary of \n     Labor. Grant proposals must include information regarding (1) \n     the manner in which the grant will be used to develop or \n     improve an education or training program suited to workers \n     eligible for the TAA for Workers program; (2) the extent to \n     which the program will meet the needs of the workers in the \n     community; (3) the extent to which the proposal fits into a \n     community's strategic plan or relates to a Sector Partnership \n     Grant received by the community; and (4) any previous \n     experience of the institution in providing programs to \n     workers eligible for TAA. Educational institutions applying \n     for a grant must also reach out to employers in the community \n     to assess current deficiencies in training and the future \n     employment opportunities in the community.\n       The provision authorizes $40 million in discretionary \n     grants to be awarded by the Secretary of Labor for the \n     Community College and Career Training Grant program. Priority \n     shall be given to grant applications submitted by eligible \n     institutions that serve communities that the Secretary of \n     Commerce has certified under section 273.\n       The provision also establishes a Sector Partnership Grant \n     program that allows the Secretary of Labor to award industry \n     or sector partnership grants to facilitate efforts of the \n     partnership to strengthen and revitalize industries. The \n     partnerships shall consist of representatives of an industry \n     sector; local county, or State government; multiple firms in \n     the industry sector; local workforce investment boards \n     established under section 117 of the Workforce Investment Act \n     of 1998 (29 U.S.C. 2832); local labor organizations, \n     including State labor federations and labor-management \n     initiatives, representing workers in the community; and \n     educational institutions.\n       The provision authorizes $40 million in discretionary \n     grants to be awarded by the Secretary of Labor for the Sector \n     Partnership Grant program. The Sector Partnership Grants may \n     be used to help the partnerships identify the skill needs of \n     the targeted industry or sector and any gaps in the available \n     supply of skilled workers in the community impacted by trade; \n     develop strategies for filling the gaps; assist firms, \n     especially small- and medium-sized firms, in the targeted \n     industry or sector increase their productivity and the \n     productivity of their workers; and assist such firms to \n     retain incumbent workers.\n\n\n                           reasons for change\n\n       The TAA for Workers program provides assistance to \n     individual workers who lose their jobs because of trade with \n     foreign countries. The program does not, however, provide \n     broader assistance when the closure or downsizing of a key \n     industry, company, or plant creates severe economic \n     challenges for an entire community impacted by trade. The \n     proponents believe there is a need for additional programs \n     and incentives to assist such communities. Accordingly, the \n     provision creates a TAA for Communities program to provide a \n     coordinated Federal response to eligible communities by \n     identifying Federal, State and local resources and helping \n     such communities to access available Federal assistance.\n       The provision does not establish precise criteria for \n     determining when a particular community is impacted by trade. \n     In the view of the proponents, this determination is better \n     left to the discretion of the Secretary of Commerce, who can \n     evaluate specific facts in specific cases. As a general \n     matter, the proponents believe the Secretary should review \n     the underlying certification(s) that provide a basis for a \n     community's application and evaluate the potential impact of \n     the job losses (or threat thereof) associated with such \n     certification(s) on the broader community, given the \n     community's overall economic situation. The proponents intend \n     for the Secretary to focus grants on communities facing the \n     most difficult hardships, to the extent practicable.\n       The proponents believe small- and medium-sized communities, \n     and in particular, those in rural areas where the \n     manufacturing sector has historically been a significant \n     employer, would benefit from the technical assistance and \n     grants available through this program. Such communities have \n     been disproportionately impacted by the adverse effects of \n     trade, where some lumber mills, factories and call centers, \n     for instance, have scaled back operations or closed entirely \n     in response to increased trade and globalization.\n       The proponents do not intend for the preference for such \n     communities to result in all grants, or the majority of \n     grants, going to such communities to the exclusion of other \n     impacted communities.\n\n\n                             effective date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act.\n     Authorization of Appropriations for Trade Adjustment \n         Assistance for Communities (Section 1772)\n\n\n                              present law\n\n       There is no provision in present law.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision authorizes $150,000,000 to the Secretary of \n     Commerce for each of fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and \n     $37,500,000 for the period beginning October 1, 2010 through \n     December 31, 2010 to carry out the TAA for Communities \n     program.\n       The provision authorizes $40,000,000 to the Secretary of \n     Labor for each of fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and $10,000,000 \n     for the period beginning October 1, 2010 through December 31, \n     2010 to carry out the Community College and Career Training \n     Grant Program.\n       The provision authorizes $40,000,000 to the Secretary of \n     Labor for each of fiscal years 2009 and 2010, and $10,000,000 \n     for the period beginning October 1, 2010 through December 31, \n     2010 to carry out the Sector Partnership Grant Program.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n          D. Part IV--Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers\n\n     Trade Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (Section 1781-1786 \n         (amending sections 291, 292, 293, 296 and 297 of the \n         Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       A group of agricultural producers or their representative \n     may file a petition for certification with the Secretary of \n     Agriculture. Upon receipt of the petition, the Secretary \n     shall publish a notice in the Federal Register that the \n     petition has been received and is being investigated. The \n     petitioner, or anyone else with a substantial interest, may \n     request a public hearing concerning the petition.\n       To be certified to receive TAA benefits under this chapter, \n     the group of producers must show (1) that the national \n     average price of the agricultural commodity in the most \n     recent marketing year is less than 80 percent of the national \n     average price for the commodity for the 5 previous marketing \n     years, and (2) that increased imports of articles like or \n     directly competitive with the commodity contributed \n     importantly to the decline in price.\n       A group of producers certified under Section 291 has one \n     year to receive TAA benefits, but may apply to be re-\n     certified for a second year of benefits if the group can show \n     a further 20 percent price decline in the national average \n     price of the commodity, and that imports continued to \n     contribute importantly to that decline.\n       To qualify to receive benefits, individual agricultural \n     producers that are covered by a certified petition must show \n     (1) that the individual producer produced the qualified \n     commodity; and (2) the net income of the producer has \n     decreased. Producers meeting these criteria are eligible to \n     participate in an initial technical assistance course, and to \n     receive cash benefits, not to exceed $10,000, based on their \n     production and the decline in price for the commodity. Where \n     available,\n\n[[Page S2063]]\n\n     the producer may also attend more intensive technical \n     assistance.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision defines an agricultural commodity producer, \n     for the purpose of the TAA for Farmers program, to include \n     fishermen, as well as farmers.\n       The provision allows a group of producers to petition the \n     Secretary based on a 15 percent decline in price, value of \n     production, quantity of production, or cash receipts for the \n     commodity, rather than a 20 percent decline in price. The \n     provision shortens the look back period from an average of 5 \n     years to an average of the national average price for the \n     previous three year period. Petitioning producers must also \n     show that imports contributed importantly to the decline in \n     price, production, value of production, or cash receipts.\n       Once the Secretary certifies a group of commodity producers \n     for TAA, individual producers can qualify for benefits if the \n     producer shows (1) that they are producers of the commodity; \n     and (2) that the price received, quantity of production, or \n     value of production for the commodity has decreased.\n       Producers deemed eligible to receive benefits by the \n     Secretary are eligible to receive initial technical \n     assistance, and may opt to receive intensive technical \n     assistance, which consists of a series of courses designed \n     for producers of the certified commodity. Upon completion of \n     the series of courses, the producer develops an initial \n     business plan which (1) reflects the skills gained by the \n     producer during the courses; and (2) demonstrates how the \n     producer intends to apply these skills to the producer's \n     farming or fishing operation. Upon approval by the Secretary \n     of the business plan described above, the producer is \n     entitled to receive up to $4,000 to implement the business \n     plan or to assist in the development of a long-term business \n     plan.\n       Producers who complete an initial business plan may choose \n     to receive assistance to develop a long-term business \n     adjustment plan. The Secretary must review the plan to ensure \n     that it (1) will contribute to the economic adjustment of the \n     producer; (2) considers the interests of the producer's \n     employees, if any; and (3) demonstrates that the producer has \n     sufficient resources to implement the plan. If the Secretary \n     approves the plan, the producer is eligible to receive up to \n     $8,000 to implement the long-term business plan.\n       Once a petition is certified for the group of producers, \n     qualifying producers are eligible for benefits for a 36-month \n     period. A producer may not receive more than $12,000 in any \n     36-month period to develop and implement business plans under \n     the program.\n       The provision allows fishermen and aquaculture producers \n     who are otherwise eligible to receive TAA benefits to \n     demonstrate increased imports based on imports of farm-raised \n     or wild-caught fish or seafood, or both.\n\n\n                           Reasons for Change\n\n       The proponents believe that the 20 percent price decline \n     currently required for a group of producers to be certified \n     under the TAA for Farmers program is too high, and creates an \n     unnecessary barrier for producers to qualify for TAA \n     benefits. Further, producers and the Department of \n     Agriculture were concerned that the current five-year look \n     back period was too long and burdensome for producers.\n       Additionally, since net farm income is a function of many \n     factors, it has proven very difficult for producers to show \n     the required decline in net income, even when the price for \n     specific commodities had declined significantly. Several \n     disputes regarding whether producers met the net income test \n     were taken to the U.S. Court of International Trade, \n     resulting in significant administrative expense for both the \n     producers and the Department of Agriculture.\n       The proponents believe that demonstrating a decline in the \n     production or price of the commodity facing import \n     competition is a better measure of the impact of trade on the \n     individual producer, rather than net income. The provision \n     would allow farmers to demonstrate that either their \n     production decisions or price received for the qualified \n     commodity were affected.\n       The proponents also believe that the focus of the TAA for \n     Farmers program should be adjustment assistance, rather than \n     cash benefits. Under the current program, most producers \n     received only initial technical assistance, with little \n     opportunity for additional curricula. The proponents believe \n     that all producers eligible for TAA benefits should receive \n     more thorough technical assistance and the opportunity for \n     individualized business planning, with financial assistance \n     provided to help the producer implement the business plans.\n       Further, technical assistance should be provided by the \n     Department of Agriculture through the National Institute on \n     Food and Agriculture (``NIFA''), which may choose to make \n     grants to land grant universities and other outside \n     organizations to assist in the development and delivery of \n     technical assistance. NIFA (formerly the Cooperative State \n     Research, Education, and Extension Service) delivers \n     technical assistance under the current Farmers program, and \n     had successfully developed curricula to respond to producers' \n     adjustment needs.\n       The proponents believe that the current one-year limit to \n     obtain TAA benefits unnecessarily limits producers' ability \n     to access technical assistance, particularly when farmers and \n     fishermen must spend significant portions of each year in the \n     fields or at sea. Extending the eligibility period to 36 \n     months will allow producers to take advantage of all the \n     benefits offered, and will eliminate the need for the current \n     burdensome recertification process.\n       The proponents believe that fishermen and aquaculture \n     producers who are otherwise eligible for TAA should be able \n     to demonstrate an increase in imports of like or directly \n     competitive products without regard to whether those imported \n     products were wild-caught or farm-raised. Current law allows \n     these producers to apply for benefits based on imports of \n     farm raised fish and seafood only.\n       The proponents expect that the Department of Agriculture \n     will fully fund and operate the TAA for Farmers and Fishermen \n     program for the full duration of each fiscal year for which \n     it is authorized.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect upon expiration of the 90-\n     day period beginning on the date of enactment of this Act, \n     and applies to petitions filed on or after that date.\n       Extension of Authorization and Appropriation for Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance for Farmers (Section 1787 (amending \n     Section 298 of the Trade Act of 1974))\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The authorization and appropriation for the TAA for Farmers \n     program expired on December 31, 2007. The program is \n     currently authorized at $90 million per year.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       This provision reauthorizes the program through December \n     30, 2010, and maintains its funding at $90 million per year \n     for fiscal years 2009 and 2010. The provision further \n     provides funding on a prorated basis for the period beginning \n     October 1, 2010, and ending December 31, 2010.\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision goes into effect on the date of enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n                      E.

Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee, Senator Inouye of Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to restate my strong support for \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. This measure will \ncreate more than 3.5 million jobs. It will provide billions of dollars \nto support our State and local governments. It will prevent tens of \nthousands of teachers, firemen, policemen, and other providers of \nessential services from being laid off at the worst possible time. It \nwill provide tax cuts for working families. It will invest in the \nfuture of this Nation by rebuilding our roads, our sewers, mass \ntransportation systems, and other essential infrastructure.\n  We must pass this bill immediately. According to the Labor \nDepartment, the United States has lost 3.6 million jobs since the \nrecession began in December of 2007. Roughly half of those losses have \noccurred in the past 3 months. Our job losses are accelerating, and if \nthe Federal Government does not take bold action immediately, these \nlosses will only continue to worsen.\n  That is why this measure before us is focused first and foremost on \ncreating jobs. Every job we create by investing in infrastructure, \nevery job we save by providing extra funds to State and local \ngovernments, is one more American who will know their Government has \ndone everything it can to help its citizens recover from this terrible \neconomic crisis.\n  The total appropriations in the amended bill are $290 billion. Some \nhave suggested that we in the Senate have paid too high a price in our \nefforts to reach a bipartisan solution. As the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, I am keenly aware of the adjustments that \nhave been made to this legislation in order to secure the 60\n\n[[Page S2064]]\n\nvotes we need. Nonetheless, I know that $290 billion is far superior to \nnothing, which is what we would have if we do not garner 60 votes. This \nremains a very strong bill that will make a difference in the lives of \nmillions of Americans.\n  As I stated before, nothing is more important than the more than 3.5 \nmillion jobs that will be created or preserved through this measure. \nOur goal is to find ways to stimulate the private sector through the \npublic sector spending. We have no interest in expanding or growing the \nFederal bureaucracy. In fact, this bill will create fewer than 5,000 \nnew Federal jobs. That is three-tenths of 1 percent--hardly a vast \ngrowth in our Government.\n  We are focused on jump-starting necessary projects that will get this \neconomy back on track as quickly as possible. In fact, preliminary CBO \nand Joint Tax scoring shows that for the bill as a whole, including \nspending and tax cuts, 78 percent of the funds will be spent in fiscal \nyears 2009 and 2010.\n  Some of the opponents of this measure have complained that it has too \nmuch wasteful spending. Helping States deal with long-term investments \nsuch as health, education, and science is not wasteful spending. These \nare programs that will directly touch millions of Americans and will \nimprove the quality of their lives. Let me say again that there are no \nearmarks in this bill.\n  As for some of the other charges leveled by opponents of the bill, I \ncan only say that the facts speak for themselves. Despite claims that \nthis recovery package contains $150 million for honeybee insurance, \nthere is not and there never has been, any language with regard to \nhoneybees contained in this legislation.\n  There is no funding for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, \nnor for smoking cessation programs, nor for resodding the National \nMall. As I have already stated, this bill will create fewer than 5,000 \nnew Federal jobs, which is well short of the 600,000 new Federal jobs \nthat some have suggested and predicted.\n  The facts speak for themselves. We face a grave economic crisis. We \nhave a nation that stood up 3 months ago and voted for change, not for \nmore of the same policies that got us into the crisis in the first \nplace.\n  This legislation is not perfect, but it absolutely represents the \nchange that millions of Americans voted for on November 4 last year, \nand I hope my colleagues will join me in giving our citizens the change \nthey demanded and vote yes on the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nconsumed during the quorum calls this morning be charged equally \nagainst both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish now to talk about a package of \namendments that hasn't been added to the legislation but has merit. I \nwant to put my colleagues on notice that I will be asking unanimous \nconsent that this package be added to the legislation.\n  On a piece of legislation this large, it is difficult to process \nevery amendment that is filed. In fact, over 600 amendments have been \nfiled to this bill. We have processed 30 of these, but that leaves \nabout 500 not yet voted on.\n  The same was true in the Finance Committee, before we took up the \nbill and before it came to the floor. In the committee we had over 200 \namendments filed and we couldn't vote on every one of those. On a \nnumber of them, I asked Senators to withhold from offering them. For \nsome, we were not sure how much they would cost, and for others we \nneeded more time to analyze the proposal because they came to us pretty \nquickly and we didn't know what it meant. I asked Senators to hold off \nfor a while to figure out what it means, and maybe we can work it out, \nbut it would be best to take it to the floor. Many Senators did that. I \npledged to the Senators I would work with them on the floor.\n  We were able to work out many of the amendments. Senator Grassley and \nI reached an agreement on a number of tax and health amendments, and \nthey are reflected in an amendment that has been filed. As our staffs \nlooked at these amendments, we worked out an agreement on a lot of \nthese amendments and they are contained in the managers' amendment I am \ntalking about. Some were technical in nature. We have several, for \nexample, health-related provisions that clarify the legislative \nlanguage to make sure it reflects what the Finance Committee voted to \nreport to the Senate.\n  Other provisions are modifications of provisions in the underlying \nbill. For example, one of the provisions makes sure military personnel \ncan receive the Making Work Pay credit even if their spouse is not a \nU.S. citizen. Another provision expands on a proposal included in the \nFinance Committee to help companies deleverage and buy back some of \ntheir debt.\n  Other provisions are new, but they are good ideas and simply didn't \nget a vote. Ms. Snowe, for example, has proposed reducing the estimated \ntaxes that small businesses have to pay quarterly, since most of them \nwill have fewer or no profits this year. That provision is also \nincluded in the managers' package.\n  While I believe adding these proposals will improve the bill, it is \nmy understanding there is likely to be an objection to my request. We \ncould not include every amendment in the package. We have done the best \nwe can. I think it would improve upon the bill if this package were \nadopted.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to call up \nmy amendment No. 572, the so-called managers' amendment; that the \namendment be adopted, and that the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I must object. Before I do so, I will \nmake this little statement. Obviously, the chairman, in keeping his \nword to me, has gone on to deliver on that word by working out \narrangements on some amendments I wanted. It might look confusing to \nthe public at large as to why on this side we are objecting. As we do \nthings in the Senate on unanimous consent, any one person can object.\n  We have asked a lot of Members on our side what they thought about \nthis particular UC request because we knew about it ahead of time. On \nbehalf of a number of Members on our side of the aisle, acting for \nthem, I must and do reluctantly object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, if I may have the floor, I wish to make \nsome remarks about the stimulus bill generally and about an upcoming \nvote we have in the Senate that we call waiving the Budget Act.\n  Today, the Senate will consider whether we should apply budget \ndiscipline to this bill before us. Yesterday, there was a lot of \nrevision, or perhaps editing, of recent budget history, and I come to \nthe floor to speak about it in an intellectually honest way. Even our \nPresident alluded to it. I agree with the President that there is a lot \nof revisionism in the debate. The revisionist history basically boils \ndown to two conclusions:\n  One, that all of the ``good'' fiscal history of the 1990s was derived \nfrom a partisan tax increase of 1993; and, two, that all of the ``bad'' \nfiscal history of this decade we are in now is attributable to the \nbipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003, and maybe some lesser tax \nbills.\n  Not surprisingly, nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generally \noppose tax relief, and somehow always seem to support tax increases. \nThe same crew generally supports spending increases and, not oddly, \nopposes spending cuts.\n  In the debate so far on this bill, called the stimulus package, many \non this side have pointed out some key undeniable facts. The bill \nbefore us, with interest included, increases the deficit by over $1 \ntrillion. The bill before us is a heavy stew of spending increases and \nrefundable tax credits, seasoned with small pieces of tax relief.\n\n[[Page S2065]]\n\nThe bill before us has new temporary spending that, if made permanent, \nwill burden future budget deficits by over $1 trillion.\n  That antirecessionary spending, together with lower tax receipts, \nplus the TARP activities, has set a fiscal table of a deficit of $1.2 \ntrillion. That is the highest deficit, as a percentage of the economy, \nin post-World War II history.\n  It is not a pretty fiscal picture, and it is going to get a lot \nuglier as a result of this bill. So for the folks who see this bill as \nan opportunity to recover America, with Government taking a larger \nshare of the economy over the long term, I say congratulations. That is \nwhere the revisionist history comes from. It is a strategy to divert, \nthrough a twisted blame game, from the facts before us.\n  How is history revisionist? I want to take each conclusion, one by \none.\n  The first conclusion is that all of the good fiscal history was \nderived from that 1993 tax increase. To knock down this canard, all you \nhave to do is look at this chart I put up.\n  This chart was not produced by a bunch of Republicans. This chart was \nproduced by the Clinton administration. We can see down in the right \ncorner, the ``Office of Management and Budget.''\n  The much ballyhooed 1993 partisan tax increase accounts for 13 \npercent of deficit reduction in the 1990s. We can see in green the 1993 \ntax increase that has been ballyhooed about the floor of this body \nseveral times did not have as much to do with deficit reduction as we \nare led to believe.\n  What is more, fiscal revisionist historians in this body tend to \nforget who the players were. They are correct that there was a \nDemocratic President in the White House, but they conveniently forget \nthat Republicans controlled the Congress for the period where the \ndeficit came down and actually turned into a surplus. They tend to \nforget that they fought the principle of a balanced budget that was the \ncenterpiece of my party's fiscal policy.\n  Remember the Government shutdown of 1995? I want the people on the \nother side of the aisle to remember that, remember what it was all \nabout. It was about a plan to balance the budget. Republicans paid a \npolitical price for forcing the issue. But in 1997, President Clinton \nagreed.\n  Recall as well all through the 1990s what the yearend battles were \nabout. On one side, congressional Democrats and the Clinton \nadministration pushed for more spending. On the other side, \ncongressional Republicans were pushing for tax relief. In the end, both \nsides compromised. That is what our Government and Constitution forces, \nand a lot of that is done because in the Senate we have rules that do \nnot allow one party to push something through.\n  That is the real fiscal history of the 1990s.\n  Now let's turn to the other conclusion of the revisionist fiscal \nhistorians. That conclusion is that in this decade, since the year \n2000, all fiscal problems are attributable to the widespread tax relief \nenacted in 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2006.\n  In 2001, President Bush came into office. Just last night, we heard \non television about all of the problems today are the result of the \nlast 8 years. Let's take a look at that.\n  President Bush inherited an economy that was careening downhill. \nInvestments started to go flat in 2000. Do you know NASDAQ lost 50 \npercent of its value in the year 2000, not in the year 2001 and beyond? \nThen came the economic shocks of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. I might \nadd, we had 40 or more months of downturn in the manufacturing index \nthat started in February 2000, also before President Bush became \nPresident. And then we add in the corporate scandals to that economic \nenvironment. We had the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  It is true, as the fiscal year 2001 came to a close, the projected \nsurplus turned into a deficit. I have a chart that shows the start of \nthis decade's fiscal history right here. As we can see, in just the \nright time, the 2001 tax relief plan started to kick in. The deficit \ngrew smaller. This pattern continued through 2007.\n  I have another chart that compares the tax receipts for the 4 years \nafter the much ballyhooed 1993 tax increase and the 4-year period after \nthe 2003 tax cuts. If we go to the tax increase, the blue line, we can \nsee there was some uptick, but it stayed flat. Look at tax relief \ncoming, the red line, what that has done for income into the Federal \nTreasury.\n  On a year-after-year basis, this chart compares the change in \nrevenues as a percentage of GDP. In 1993, the Clinton tax increase \nbrought in more revenue as compared to the 2003 tax cut. But that trend \nreversed as both policies moved along. We can see how the extra revenue \nwent up over time relative to the flat line of the 1993 tax increase.\n  So let's get the fiscal history right. The progrowth tax-and-trade \npolicies of the 1990s, along with a peace dividend, had a lot more to \ndo with the deficit reduction in the 1990s than the 1993 tax increase \ndid. In this decade, deficits went down after tax relief plans were put \ninto full effect.\n  That is the past. We need to make sure we understand it. But what is \nmost important is the future. All I can say is that my President, \nPresident Obama, talked about the future all during the campaign. Why \nMembers of his party have been talking about the last 8 years and not \nabout the future, I don't know. We need to talk about the future. \nPeople in our States send us here to deal with the future. They do not \nsend us here to flog one another like partisan cartoon cutout \ncharacters and to do it over past policy. They do not send us here to \nendlessly point fingers of blame around.\n  Now let's focus on the fiscal consequences of the bill in front of \nus. That is what the vote in less than an hour is all about.\n  President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence \nduring that campaign, as I have already referred to. But I would like \nto be more specific and paraphrase a quote from the President's \nnomination acceptance speech: We need a President who can face the \nthreats of the future, not grasping at the ideas of the past.\n  My President was right. We need a President--and I would like to add \nCongressmen and Senators--who spends all the time facing the threats of \nthe future. This bill, as currently written, poses considerable threats \nto our fiscal future. Senator McCain's spending trigger amendment \nshowed us the way. We can rewrite this bill to retain its stimulative \neffect but turn off the spending when the recovery occurs.\n  Grasping at ideas of the past or playing the partisan blame game will \nnot deal with the threats to our fiscal future. With a vote to sustain \nthe budget point of order against this bill, I say to my fellow \nSenators, we can start to deal with threats to the fiscal future in the \nway Senator McCain would or the way other people might bring good ideas \nforth.\n  According to the Senate Finance Republican tax staff analysis of the \nJoint Committee on Taxation's revenue estimate of the Nelson-Collins \nsubstitute amendment, less than $6 billion is provided in that \namendment in tax relief for small businesses. Let me be clear, small \nbusiness tax relief makes up less than 1 percent of the bill. I think \nthat is truly outrageous. Small businesses create approximately three-\nfourths of the new jobs in our economy. So if this bill is all about \njobs, certainly more tax relief would have been provided to small \nbusinesses because they are the job-creating engines of our economy.\n  Less than 1 percent of the bill going to small business tax relief is \na puny amount. For example, according to Senator Nelson's Web site \nsummary of this bill, here are just some of the provisions that the \nSenate Democratic leadership has spent more money on than small \nbusiness tax relief.\n  The Senate Democratic leadership is putting your money where their \nmouth isn't and saying that these items are a higher priority to them \nthan small business tax relief is. Some of these items are: $7 billion \nfor Federal buildings fund, $6.4 billion for State and Tribal \nassistance EPA grants, and $13.9 billion for Pell grants. While some of \nthe provisions in the bill are worthy of being done in regular order, \ncertainly none should get higher funding than small business tax relief \nbecause this is supposedly a stimulus bill that is about creating jobs.\n  Mr. President, in remarks a few minutes ago, the senior Senator from \nNew York referred to my amendment on the current year's alternative \nminimum tax, AMT, hold-harmless or patch. He was correct that I pushed \nfor the patch very early in the stimulus discussions.\n\n[[Page S2066]]\n\nI mentioned it at before and after our bipartisan Finance Committee \nMembers' meeting. I filed it at the Finance Committee markup. To be \nfair, so did Senator Menendez. The committee adopted the AMT patch \namendment.\n  If I heard the Senator from New York correctly, he agreed with me on \nthe merits of adding the AMT pacth. His point seemed to be to say I, \nand others who oppose the bill in its present form, we are taking an \ninconsistent bill.\n  Let me repeat what we, on this side, have been saying about the need \nfor this bill. We agree there needs to be a stimulus. But we need to do \nit right. Including the AMT pacth improves what is an otherwise poorly \ndesigned bill.\n  The patch does not remedy the outyear spending problem. It does not \neliminate the rest of new broad entitlement spending.\n  I am hopeful that, in conference, the senior Senator from New York, \nand other members of the Democratic leadership, will fight for the \nSenate position on the AMT patch. There are 124,000 Iowa families who \ncould face an average tax increase of $2,300 per family if the AMT \npatch is not enacted. I am looking out for them. I hope the Democratic \nleadership is looking out for them too.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for budget discipline, sustaining the \npoint of order.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow Senators, I came today to make a \nfew remarks regarding the vote we are about to have, in about half an \nhour, on the so-called ``stimulus'' package. I think everyone who is a \nMember of this body agrees with the magnitude of the problem. I have \nheard my colleagues on the other side and my colleagues on this side \nspeak with great clarity and sometimes with great passion about the \nproblem. Clearly, the American economy is in dire straits. Everyone \nagrees with that. The amount of passion that one speaks with neither \nraises nor lowers that level.\n  I heard the President of the United States last night say there were \nsome people who thought there should be no action taken by our Federal \nGovernment. I am not aware of those people. I am sure there are some \naround, but I think most people agree the main responsibility of the \nGovernment of the United States is to protect its people, but closely \nbehind that is to regulate monetary policy and economic policy. Nations \nhave been doing both of those things for many years. My problem with \nthe discussion we have had over recent weeks has been with the focus of \nthe solution, and I believe the focus is misfocused.\n  The President agrees, we agree, and most economists agree that \neconomic recovery will require a three-path solution. The first is \nattention to the banking sector, and that comprises two different \nparts. No. 1 is continued viability of our bank system; and No. 2, and \nmost importantly, reestablishing credit flow, which is badly impaired \nat this time.\n  The second path is the housing sector. Most economists agree it was \nthe housing sector that led us into this difficulty and it is going to \nbe the housing sector that leads us out or, if it does not lead us out, \nat least it has to recover before we will see any decent movement in \nthe economy.\n  And third is the Government expenditure item. That particular item \nhas received all the ink, all the publicity, and all the discussion in \nrecent weeks. The focus should not be on Government spending. The focus \nof the solution should be on credit flow and on the housing market, and \nit is not. To that, I object.\n  When the President very kindly came to the Republican conference, we \nhad a spirited discussion on these matters. I was delighted to see that \nhe agreed it was going to take a three-path solution to get us out of \nthis. I was disappointed that his enthusiasm continued to be for the \nspending side, which of course is a very easy thing to do and something \nwhich this town is particularly adept at. Again, my problem is the \nfocus. Spending by the Government is not going to resolve this problem.\n  This proposal has some job creation--that is the so-called \n``stimulus'' package--and for that I am grateful. The best example of \nthat is roads and bridges. However, if you take a percentage of the \namount of money we are talking about, that is only about 3 percent of \nthe bill. There are lots of parts of this bill that do not do anything \nto stimulate the economy, and I am not going to spend time on that this \nmorning, because they have been well publicized, and I have no doubt \nwill be publicized more in the future.\n  The other difficulty with the bill, if you take the number of jobs \nthe President is attempting to create or to protect, the cost is in the \nhundreds of thousands of dollars per job. That, as much as anything, \nshows how difficult it is for the Government to get us out of this by \nspending. It is a futile effort. We have between 7 and 8 percent \nunemployment in this country, which means over 92 percent of Americans \nare employed. What happens if unemployment continues to accelerate? The \nFederal Government cannot borrow or print enough money to salvage all \nthose jobs at the cost of several hundred thousand dollars per job. The \nFederal Government simply can't do it.\n  Now, there is an entity that can do it. There is an entity that can \ncreate enough jobs and protect enough jobs. That entity is called the \nfree market system. It is entrepreneurs, it is risk takers, it is \ncapitalists. Those people and those entities created these jobs to \nbegin with. They can do it again. That entity, the free market system, \nhas created the most successful culture in the history of the world. \nFor the free market system to operate, there must be free-flowing \ncredit, and of course that does depend upon Government policy. That is \nwhy I come down on the side of needing to focus more on that particular \naspect of this problem.\n  I listened to the President last night, and he talked about the $800 \nbillion number. He said he did not reach up in the air and pull that \nnumber out of the air. I wish I knew where that number came from. I \nhave yet to see the formula that was devised, either by the President \nor, more likely, his advisers who came up with this $800 billion \nfigure. Indeed, that formula has a lot of value. If that formula could \nbe put on paper, every economy in the world, every country in the \nworld, would be very interested in that valuable commodity. Because if \nindeed you can simply take that formula and come up with a number and \nthen borrow enough money and spend that money to get the economy moving \nagain, this is very simple.\n  Here is the problem with all of this. That $800 billion number, or \nwhatever number it turns out to be--and of course when you add interest \nin, it will be well over a trillion dollars, or somewhere in the \nneighborhood of $1.2 trillion--that money has got to come from \nsomewhere. It is not free money. The way America is going to get that \nmoney is it is going to go out and borrow it. We all know what happens \nwhen America goes out and borrows money. Who provides us with that \nmoney? The major contributor of purchasing our debt is the Chinese \nGovernment and the Chinese people. There is no plan for repayment of \nthat debt. What business in America, what entity in America would think \nof borrowing any amount, let alone an amount this size, without a clear \nand cogent plan for repaying that money?\n  Keynesian economics teaches us we can spend our way out of a problem. \nKeynesian economics has been proven over and over again to be a great \ntheory, a wonderful theory, a source of hope, but it has been a total \nfailure. It didn't work for the Japanese in the 1990s, it didn't work \nfor this country back in the Great Depression, and it didn't even work \nlast year, when everyone was given $600. It didn't even put a blip on \nthe screen in trying to get us back to prosperity. Keynesian \neconomics--government spending--to get us back on track, has never \nworked before and it will not work again. If it does work, it will be \nthe first time in history, and it will defy uniform history that has \nshown us in the past that it won't work.\n  I hope when we go home during the recess time that this economy is \nmoving in a different direction. I truly\n\n[[Page S2067]]\n\nhope that is the case. And I hope we can be arguing on this floor \nwhether it was this enormous spending package that did it or whether it \nwas the vagaries of an undulating world economy, or whether it was \neconomic policy dealing with the banking sector and the housing sector \nthat turned it around.\n  I am encouraged by the fact the President has committed that he will \nturn his attention to the other two paths in this three-path system, \nthe banking sector and the housing sector, after this package is \npassed.\n  The title of this bill, the ``economic stimulus'' bill, is truly a \ngiant fraud on the American people. It is not a stimulus package. It is \na giant spending package. Admittedly, there are parts of it that one \ncould argue are stimulus, but it is so de minimis that one cannot call \nthis an economic stimulus package.\n  Like everyone on this floor, I am concerned about the future of our \nchildren and our grandchildren. Borrowing $800 billion-plus, mostly \nfrom the Chinese Government and the Chinese people, and indenturing our \nchildren, our grandchildren, and our great-grandchildren to work to \nrepay the Chinese Government and the Chinese people so we can spend \nthat money today I believe is fundamentally wrong. I don't believe we \nshould indenture future generations of Americans, and for that reason \nthis Senator will be casting his vote ``no'' on behalf of the people of \nthe great State of Idaho.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we had an opportunity to hear the \ninitial or, as we call it, the maiden speech of the new Senator from \nIdaho, and I wanted to be on the floor to listen to his words. This is \na great opportunity to welcome him to the Senate and to encourage all \nour colleagues to read what he had to say about this massive spending \nbill we have before us.\n  I think his views were right on target, and I congratulate him on his \nfirst speech.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I also congratulate the Senator from \nIdaho, my neighbor. It is a wonderful opportunity to hear the Senator \nfrom Idaho give his first speech, and it is also great that he is, as I \nsay, my neighbor. I deeply appreciate the shared values we have in our \npart of the country. I might say to my good friend that although I \ndon't agree with the conclusions he has reached, there will be many \nopportunities for us to work together on issues that affect our part of \nthe country.\n  I might also say that--and I think all economists agree with this \npoint--every dollar spent is stimulative--every dollar. Every single \ndollar in this bill is stimulative--every dollar. All economists would \nsay that--all economists.\n  Now, it is true that some dollars are more stimulative than other \ndollars. Basically, economists say that dollars spent on roads and \nbridges and infrastructure and so forth are more stimulative than \ndollars spent on tax reductions. They all agree on that. In fact, the \nJoint Committee on Taxation and the CBO sent a letter recently--\nactually, the Congressional Budget Office, the CBO, sent a letter to \nthis Senate recently--making that very point, and they categorized how \nstimulative each dollar spent is. The more it is taxes, the less \nstimulative it is. But it does stimulate the economy, no doubt about \nit. The more it is not taxes, the more it is bridges and roads and \ninfrastructure, the more it stimulates the economy. There is no doubt \nabout that. And then there is a middle category, which focuses on \nunemployment benefits, Medicaid, and food stamps. That is very \nstimulative, because those are the lower income people who spend the \nmoney. To say the dollars in this bill are not stimulative is flatly \nnot true. Every dollar spent is stimulative.\n\n  Second, analysis of CBO and Joint Tax, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, and the Joint Committee on Taxation, shows that 99 percent of \nall the dollars in the Finance Committee bill are spent in the first 2 \nyears. There is nothing permanent about this. I have heard Senators on \nthe other side say this is permanent. It is not permanent; 79 percent \nof all the dollars in this bill, according to the CBO and Joint \nCommittee on Tax, are spent in the first 2 years--about four-fifths, 80 \npercent, in the first 2 years. That is not permanent; that is spent in \nthe first 2 years.\n  No. 1, every dollar spent is stimulative. Some is more stimulative--\nroads and bridges more than taxes. No. 2, this is temporary; 79 percent \nof the whole bill is spent in the first 2 years. No. 3, again, this is \nnot permanent, but it is all going to be spent, four-fifths, 80 percent \nin the first 2 years.\n  I am a little surprised Senators say we should not spend money here. \nThat is exactly what the Government did back in the 1930s. That is the \nHoover approach. Don't spend money, don't borrow money because that is \ngoing to add to the deficit, add to the debt. That was what was said \nback then and look what happened. Every economist says that was a \nmistake, the Government should have gotten involved, we should have \ndone something, we should have spent the money. And that is what we are \ndoing.\n  Also, what is the alternative to not spending. What is the \nalternative to not passing this bill? The alternative is conditions are \nmuch worse. This bill is going to create or save 3.4 million jobs. No \nbill, 3 to 4 million jobs, more jobs lost than currently. This is a no-\nbrainer.\n  Some Senators try to get us sidetracked. Lawyers call it red \nherrings, one theory or another, which is not the heart of the problem. \nThe heart of the problem is people are losing jobs by massive numbers. \nWe have to do something, we have to do something big. I, frankly, think \nin this Congress not much of anything happens most of the time unless \none of two conditions occurs. One is a crisis. Then Congress acts and \ndoes something--Pearl Harbor, Sputnik, Depression. Another is if there \nis extraordinary political leadership.\n  I say we certainly have a crisis, and we certainly have an \nextraordinary President. Combined--the President wants this, this is a \ncrisis we have to deal with--let's stand and do what the American \npeople want us to do and not haggle, not bicker, not get partisan. This \nis pretty simple stuff. It is a big problem and requires a big \nsolution. This solution is a good solution. I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support it because it is the right thing to do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I think the Congressional Budget Office, \nour top adviser, advises us there will be some stimulus in the next 2 \nto 3 years. But over a 10-year period, our own budget office says the \ncrowding out of private people being able to borrow money because the \nGovernment has already borrowed it, and the substantial interest \npayment on the economy as a result of taking out this debt, will result \nin a net negative growth in GDP over 10 years. We are talking about a \nshort-term gain for a long-term negative and certainly in the next 10 \nyears the stimulus is long since gone then, and we will have that debt \nburden every year thereafter because there is no plan to pay it back.\n  Mr. Gary Becker, Nobel Prize winner in economics, the University of \nChicago, in the Wall Street Journal today raised this question:\n\n       How much will the stimulus package moving in the Congress \n     really stimulate the economy?\n\n  That is what he asked. The evaluations to date have been incomplete. \nThis is what he says his conclusion is:\n\n       So our conclusion is that the net stimulus to the short-\n     term GDP will not be zero--\n\n  Certainly $800-plus billion cannot be zero. He goes on to say--\n\n     and will be positive, but the stimulus is likely to be modest \n     in magnitude. Some economists have assumed that every $1 \n     billion spent by the government through the stimulus package \n     would raise short-term GDP by $1.5 billion. Or, in economics \n     jargon, that the multiplier is 1.5.\n       That seems too optimistic, given the nature of the spending \n     programs being proposed. We believe a multiplier well below \n     one seems much more likely.\n\n  He goes on to make some other points and raise questions about the \nnature of this package.\n  We have a budget process in this Congress. In the Senate, and the \nBudget Committee of which I am a Member--meeting right now, I just left \nthe committee--we set a spending limit for America each year. That \nlimit is supposed to be complied with unless we declare an emergency. \nWhen we declare\n\n[[Page S2068]]\n\nan emergency, then we can spend over the budget. I wish to say, first, \nwe are getting in too much of a habit of declaring emergencies, tacking \nall kinds of spending programs onto those emergency programs and, as a \nresult, we are collapsing the power and effectiveness of the budget \nprocess.\n  For example, we had over $100 billion on Katrina. A lot of that was \nneeded, but all kinds of things not related to Katrina were added \nbecause if you add it onto an emergency spending bill you don't have to \naccount for it. It does not have to compete with any other national \nspending priority. Otherwise, you have to go in through your committees \nand argue that this spending is justified.\n  I think when you look at other things such as the TARP spending last \nfall, $700 billion we authorized, and then authorized the second half \nof it earlier this year, that was outside the budget process. We are \ngoing to see that this stimulus, every penny of it, is on top of the \nlargest debt we have ever had in America. The Congressional Budget \nOffice scores the debt this year to be $1.2 trillion, without the \nstimulus. Last year, at $455 billion, we hit the highest deficit in the \nhistory of the country. So this is more than twice that added to it.\n  Then we are going to have another financial Wall Street bailout \npackage presumably presented to us soon. It will also be spending \noutside the budget.\n  I wish to repeat: Every penny of the $1.2 trillion of the stimulus \npackage will add to the U.S. Government debt. The debt burden is so \nhigh that CBO projects the gross domestic product 10 years from now \nwill be even lower as a result of the passage of this legislation than \nif we did not pass it, over a 10-year period.\n  I do not believe we can continue to spend such large sums of money \nwithout knowing that the money is well spent, without having the kind \nof oversight and hearings we need. We are rushing programs through in \ngreat numbers. Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee, \nour Democratic colleague, estimates there is $125 billion in what he \ncalls bow wave money that will increase the spending permanently out of \nthis bill; at least 125. Another one of our Senators says it will be \n$300 billion that will be continued and not be temporary. So there are \nseven budget points of order that will lie against this legislation. I \nexpect to offer that.\n  It would mean we would have to vote 60 votes and those 60 votes would \nsay we understand it violates the budget, but we want to spend it \nanyway. That is what the effort will be about.\n  Let me briefly point out the significance of the legislation. \nEverybody wants to do something. I understand that. We need to do some \nthings. But we have to ask ourselves responsibly what has happened.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Montana has 1 \nminute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct. The Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, since this recession began, 3.6 million \nmothers, fathers, sisters and brothers, wives and husbands have lost \ntheir jobs. On the Senate floor today, we have the power to keep 3 to 4 \nmillion more Americans from losing their jobs. We have crafted this \nbill to accomplish this end. Ninety-nine percent of the Finance \nCommittee's legislation will take effect in the first 2 years and 79 \npercent of the total bill's fiscal effects will take place in the first \n2 years.\n  The question is merely whether we will act. Our duty is clear. Let us \nreject half measures. Let us reject delay. Let us not be found on the \nwrong side of history. Let us rise to the economic challenge of our \ngeneration. Let us preserve millions of American jobs and let us pass \nthis bill today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in 1844, a man came to Washington \nrecognizing the country had been in a deep recession in 1837 and it \nspilled over a number of years. He came to Washington with an idea. He \ncame to Congress with an idea. What he wanted to do was build some \npower poles, put some wire on them, and he said if he did that, this \ninfrastructure--and he had money to do it--would revolutionize \ncommunications in America.\n  This man, Samuel Morse, convinced Congress to do that. They \nappropriated $40,000. In that day that was a huge amount of money. The \nFederal Government appropriated that money and a telegraph line was \nbuilt between Washington, DC, and Baltimore, MD. The rest is history. \nIt changed America. It changed the world. The first telegraph line \nrevolutionized communications. It was so significant.\n  Some opposed funding for the new invention that Morse was talking \nabout, but once the wires connecting the two cities were laid, our \ncountry's communication structure, as I mentioned, was changed forever. \nWhat started as a government investment became a major private sector \nenterprise, creating thousands of jobs and new opportunities to connect \npeople and ideas. If that sounds familiar, it is exactly what created \none of the greatest economic opportunities of our lifetime--not only of \nour lifetime but ever--the Internet.\n  Throughout our history the Federal Government has catalyzed good \nideas, invested in the ingenuity and entrepreneurship of the American \npeople, and let the private sector flourish--Samuel Morse, the \nInternet. Faced with an economic crisis today, we have an opportunity \nto make similar investments that will help our country prosper in the \nyears to come.\n  Last night, President Obama brought his case of economic recovery \ndirectly to the American people. He clearly explained that no new \nPresident relishes the thought of starting an administration with a \nmajor investment of public funds to clean up the economic mess left by \nthe previous administration. But he had no choice, as he explained so \nwell in Elkhart, IN, yesterday and last night to the American people.\n  Not one Member of Congress or one single American family relishes the \ndifficult choices left for us to make. But with a growing likelihood \nthat this crisis will grow into what the President has termed a \n``possible catastrophe,'' the worst decision would be indecision.\n  The President, as I mentioned, spoke in the city of Elkhart, IN, a \nplace where unemployment has risen in a short period of time from 4 \npercent to over 15 percent. But some say the unemployment in Elkhart is \ntruly over 20 percent.\n  In Nevada the latest figures have surpassed 9 percent unemployment, \nwith no sign of retreat in sight. The people of Elkhart understand our \neconomy will not turn around overnight. Reno and Carson City and Las \nVegas have patience for the tough choices in the hard days to come. The \nAmerican people understand that. But the American people have no \npatience for a Congress that points fingers, drags its feet or fails to \nact.\n  It is not common--in fact, try to think of the last time the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers--NAM, the United States Chamber of \nCommerce, and the AFL-CIO joined in support of legislation, any \nlegislation. But they have in this legislation before us. Each of these \norganizations understands how important it is for us to pass this bill \nand to get it to the President's desk.\n  Yesterday, the Senate took a major step toward doing so by voting 61 \nto 36 to lift a filibuster and move forward to a vote. Now we move to \nfinal passage of President Obama's economic recovery plan, but our work \ndoesn't end there. We must move swiftly with our colleagues in the \nHouse to complete work on the legislation and send it to the \nPresident's desk as soon as possible. The time for debate on this \nlegislation was productive but it is over.\n  With common sense as our compass, we must now answer the urgent call \nof the American people for action.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I believe we need to exceed the budget \nand to expend targeted, temporary money that can improve the economy \nand will make some positive steps. Gary Becker, a Nobel Prize winner, \ntoday said he does not believe this is an effective way to do so. \nOthers have said the same. I believe greater jobs can be created at \nsubstantially less funding.\n  I make a point of order that the pending amendment offered by the \nSenators from Nebraska and Maine,\n\n[[Page S2069]]\n\nMr. Nelson and Ms. Collins, would increase the on-budget deficit for \nthe sum of the years 2009 through 2013 and the sum of the years 2009 \nthrough 2018. Therefore, I raise a point of order against the amendment \npursuant to section 201(a) of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is my understanding the order before the \nSenate takes into consideration the move to waive that; is that true?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak for a moment about our hope \nthat in the so-called stimulus package that will be the subject of a \nconference committee between the Members of the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives, significant changes can be made, changes that will \npermit more people to support this package than only those who have \nsupported it in the past.\n  I want to begin by identifying the two key areas that most \nRepublicans have concerns with in this package and begin by noting that \nit is not a choice between doing nothing on the one hand and doing only \nthis bill on the other hand. I think it has been presented by some as a \nfalse choice.\n  The President, for example, last night said: Now, there are those who \nwould do nothing about this crisis. I don't know of anybody who wants \nto do\n\n[[Page S2070]]\n\nnothing. Certainly, all of my Republican colleagues have voted for \ndoing lots of things. This past week there were many amendments about \ndoing various things to address this problem, and Republicans voted for \na lot of them and Democrats voted for a lot of others. So it is not the \ncase that there are those who want to do nothing. That presents a false \nchoice. The fact is, there are those who want to do this particular \nbill, and there are those who would do things somewhat differently \nbecause they have legitimate and strong differences about what the \neffect of this bill will be. That is why I hope there could be changes \nmade in the conference committee when the bill is to some extent \nrewritten.\n  There are two key things that Republicans, as I said, have focused on \nthat we would like to change. The first is, we believe the bill spends \nfar too much money; second, that it doesn't do enough good, that is to \nsay it doesn't do enough to stimulate the economy--to create jobs, for \nexample.\n  On the spending too much money part, we have seen that the so-called \ndeal that was struck in the Senate now, according to the majority \nleader just a few moments ago, is up to $840 billion. CBO scored it at \na little under $839 billion. That is substantially above the House-\npassed bill.\n  The question is, Is the cost of this bill going to increase even more \nwhen the bill goes to conference committee, and is all of that spending \nnecessary? The President had spoken about stripping the earmarks from \nthe bill. Frankly, I had thought, because earmarks can be somewhat \nembarrassing and we can achieve the objectives without having \nindividual earmarks by individual Congressmen in the bill--the \nPresident had been rightly critical of that process as well--I had \nthought they would be stripped out by now.\n  It turns out there are pages of specific earmarks still in the \nlegislation. These are the kinds of things I hope the conference \ncommittee would strike. Let me just highlight a few.\n  Some of these earmarks could well create jobs. But I submit, if one \nSenator or one Congressman gets to have the special project in his \nState slipped into this bill, that maybe each of us could identify \nsomething in our own State that we were pretty sure would create jobs \nand we could put it in the bill. That is the problem with earmarks. All \nSenators are equal except some are more equal than others when it comes \nto slipping things in bills. So it could well be that some of the \nearmarks are job creators, but shouldn't they go through the regular \nprocess where these projects are vetted by the Appropriations \nCommittee? They set the priorities, some make it through, some do not \nmake it through, but at least they all fall within the budgeted amount.\n  Since all of the spending in this bill is emergency spending; that is \nto say, it is not paid for in tax revenues or offset by spending \nreductions, it is all borrowed money. I think we need to be careful \nabout how the money is spent.\n  Others of the earmarks are dubious in terms of job creation. These \nare projects that may well be worthwhile, but it is hard to imagine \nthey would create very many jobs, and it seems to me they clearly fall \ninto the category of bills that should be considered in the regular \nappropriations process.\n  Having run for election now several times and having looked at polls \nand tried to understand what my constituents think and what most \nAmericans think, I have reached some conclusions. Americans do not mind \npaying their fair share of taxes. They don't like it; they like to have \ntheir taxes cut, but they are willing to pay what they think is \nnecessary to support Government. And they believe a certain amount of \nGovernment spending is necessary. They all understand why Government \nneeds to spend money on certain things.\n  What drives them crazy is wasteful Washington spending, when their \nhard-earned money comes back and they think we do not spend it right. \nBy the way, they have an idea that a lot of what we do ends up being \nwasted, maybe even more than what we actually do, but because of their \nconcerns about that I would think we would be especially careful in a \nbill that spends over $1 trillion to be careful we don't waste money.\n  The Congressional Budget Office has said it is very difficult to \nspend the kind of money we are talking about in the relatively short \ntimeframe we are talking about without wasting a lot of it. It is a \nphenomenon we are all well aware of here. When you try to spend a lot \nof money in a short period of time, you are going to waste money. Our \nconstituents instinctively appreciate that. So it seems to people that \nin order for this legislation to have credibility, we can at least \nstart by excising those matters that may be good projects in and of \nthemselves, may actually in some cases create jobs, but are clearly \nearmarks or special interest projects that should go through the \nregular appropriations process.\n  I don't mean to pick on anybody or anything in particular, but let me \njust mention a few of these. There is a $2 billion earmark for a \npowerplant in Mattoon, IL. If this is actually the building of a \npowerplant, depending on how soon it could be built, that might create \njobs. If it is a typical powerplant, it is going to be a long time in \nconstruction, so it is probably not really stimulative right now. But \nthat is an earmark.\n  There is $200 million in the bill for workplace safety in the \nDepartment of Agriculture facilities. I have not been told how that is \ngoing to create jobs.\n  There is $200 million for public computer centers at community \ncolleges and libraries. It sounds like a good idea. I just don't \nunderstand how it is going to create a lot of jobs.\n  We have been critical of this all along. The transition to digital \ntelevision has taken longer than anticipated so the Government has come \nup with the bright idea that we will spend $650 million in giving \npeople coupons so they can transition from their existing television \nset to DTV. Maybe that is a good deal. I would rather that one go \nthrough the appropriations process. I am not sure I would vote for \nthat, but that is not a job creator.\n  Here is one I like, $10 million to fight Mexican gunrunners. I don't \nknow who is doing the fighting. Maybe we would have to hire them and \ncreate some jobs. It doesn't belong in a stimulus bill. There is $10 \nmillion for urban canals. It may be a good idea. Who knows? And $198 \nmillion to design and furnish the DHS headquarters--quite possibly they \nneed to spruce up the headquarters at DHS. Maybe some jobs would be \ncreated in the process, but we are not told in this bill. This is a \nvery specific earmarked item. There is $500 million for State and local \nfire offices, and I can tell you, and I know the Presiding Officer \nwould agree, everybody would like to have money to build a fire \nstation. There is always another fire station to be built, especially \nin my State where we have a lot of growth.\n\n  That is something normally we would pay for ourselves, and I am not \nsure why someone in Vermont should pay for a fire station in Arizona. \nIn any event it doesn't belong in this bill, it seems to me.\n  In terms of job creation, I find it interesting that we are going to \nspend $160 million for volunteers--these are not people who are paid, \nthese are volunteers--at the Corporation for National and Community \nService. As I said, there are many more we could talk about, and I do \nnot mean to pick anybody out and pick on anyone.\n  The bottom line is when you are spending $1 trillion and you are \nbound to waste a lot of it--at least that part which has been \nidentified as earmarks, you ought to be able to get that out, at least. \nThat is something that can be accomplished in this conference \ncommittee.\n  I also noted it is not just a matter of the amount of money and the \nfact that a lot of it is wasted, but the fact that we believe it will \nnot be efficient and effective at creating jobs. Why is that? Here is a \ngood statistic to keep in mind. We all know if the object is to create \njobs, we might want to start with those entities that create most of \nthe jobs in the country. Small businesses in the United States of \nAmerica create about 80 percent of the jobs. So you would think that \nnaturally there would be a lot of money in this stimulus package to \nhelp small businesses create jobs.\n  Right? No, actually, not right. Eight-tenths of 1 percent of the--it \nis a tax title of the bill that can actually go to small businesses to \nhelp them hire people, help them buy equipment and so\n\n[[Page S2071]]\n\non which would require them to hire more people--eight-tenths of 1 \npercent is dedicated to small businesses. So the very group of people \nwho are the quickest at creating jobs--big businesses are still laying \npeople off when small businesses, one by one around the country, are \nstarting to hire people. Small businesses cumulatively account for a \nfar greater percentage of employment than our big businesses do.\n  If you look at the businesses with under 500 employees, you find that \nobviously those, the small businesses--and most of them have less than \n200 employees--as I say, those are the businesses that could really \ncreate the jobs in this country. Republicans had an idea, a plan to \nreduce their tax rate just by 7 percentage points, similar to the way \nwe did it for manufacturing corporations a few years ago. We believed \nthat would help them hire more people. You would think that for the \ngroup that hires 80 percent of the workers, we could find a way to \nprovide a little bit more help to in the legislation. Sadly, that is \nnot the case.\n  If you take all businesses combined, less than 3 percent of the \nfunding in the legislation provides some kind of tax deduction or \ncredit or benefit which would enable them, then, to hire more people.\n  In terms of the legislation to create jobs, we do not think it is \napproaching the subject in the right way. One of my colleagues said $1 \ntrillion is a terrible thing to waste. That is kind of catchy, but he \nwent on to make an important point.\n  I think of this because this morning on television I heard several \npeople saying: Sure, this is a gamble. No one knows for sure whether it \nis going to work. Newscasters obviously asked proponents, can you \nguarantee this is going to work. No, nobody can guarantee it is going \nto work, and I don't hold anybody to that standard. Proponents don't \nhave to guarantee this is going to work. But if we were spending $2 or \n$300 million, I would say: If it is a gamble and you think you can roll \nthe dice and this might work, take a shot. But we are talking about \nover $1 trillion of borrowed money. When you are gambling that much, \nyou cannot afford to be wrong.\n  Let's assume that it is only half wrong. The effect of a $500 billion \nmistake is horrendous on the economy in the medium and longer term. \nCBO, in scoring the legislation, actually says there will be a short-\nterm stimulus. But they also say in the long-term, talking 10 years, \nthere will be a reduction in gross domestic product of between 1 and \n1.3 percent because of the crowdout effect of investment. There is so \nmuch Federal Government money being absorbed into the borrowing market, \nas a result of putting a trillion dollars in borrowed money out there, \nthat it crowds out private investment. That will have a negative impact \non GDP. We know in advance the amount of money we are talking about \nwill have a detrimental effect on GDP. If we are wrong about the \npositive benefits of the legislation, it could have a very detrimental \neffect.\n  That is not even to discuss the impact on the value of the dollar and \nthe value of U.S. debt that other countries have in the past been \nwilling to buy but in the future may well not be willing to buy. In \nthat event, this becomes a much more expensive proposition for the \ntaxpayer. It is for my children and my grandchildren and all the rest \nof the younger generation who will have to suffer the consequences of \nthat borrowing, either through a lower standard of living, a lower GDP \nor increased taxes or inflation that robs everybody of what they earn \nand is particularly tough on people who are retired and have relied on \nsavings for their livelihood.\n  The impacts of being wrong could be significant. It isn't the case \nthat just because we spend money, it is a good thing, that just because \nwe spend money, jobs will be created. Some will, no question. Some will \nbe saved. But is it the most efficient and effective way to do it when \nyou are talking about this much money? We should not be willing to just \nthrow the dice and hope that we don't make a mistake.\n  I urge my colleagues, those who will be participating in the \nconference committee, to recall the words of one of the people who was \ninvolved in the compromise legislation, who criticized the House bill \nas a Christmas tree upon which every Member had virtually his or her \nfavorite project. It was bloated, expensive, and ineffective. Those \nwere her words. She is correct. That was the House bill at $827 \nbillion. The Senate bill is now $839 billion, more than the House bill. \nThe earmarks are still in there. The inefficiencies are still there. \nThe wasteful spending is still there. At some point if this bill is \ngoing to be improved, all of that has to come out.\n  I challenge those who will be in the conference committee: Be brave, \nbe courageous. Don't feel you have to stick with what passed the House \nor Senate. Consider what the President said originally with respect to \nhow this legislation should be created and be willing to improve on it. \nYou will not only do something the American people will very much \nappreciate, you will be doing something good for the country and \ncertainly for future generations. I urge my colleagues to consider \nstrongly the Republican suggestions. Because at the end of the day, it \nis not a choice between doing nothing and only this bill. A billion \ndollars a page is spent in this bill. Surely, there are ways to improve \nit. For anyone who says this is a choice between those who want to do \nnothing and those who support this legislation, no, that is not true. \nIt is a choice between those of us who want to do this intelligently \nand those who have a challenge in front of them as to whether they want \nto improve the bill.\n  I hope they will join some of us in trying to see to it that this \nlegislation is less expensive, less wasteful, more efficient, and will \nactually stimulate the economy.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to add my voice to those who \nfeel the urgency of our economic crisis.\n  I don't need to repeat all of the arguments that have been made this \nweek and last. All Senators can see with their own eyes that this is \nthe greatest economic challenge we have faced since the Depression.\n  But we have the advantage of history. History shows us that in times \nof crisis, government must act decisively.\n  Where Herbert Hoover didn't, jobs and livelihoods crumbled. Where \nFranklin Roosevelt did, American families got a new chance at the \nsecurity and dignity of work.\n  Now, once more, we must act.\n  This economic crisis is enormously complicated, and no economist can \ntruthfully claim to know the full measure of our challenges. But, in a \nsense, it is simple.\n  Consumer spending makes up two-thirds of our economy.\n  With falling home prices, plummeting retirement accounts, and \nvanishing jobs, American consumers have less and less to spend. As the \nconsumer economy shrinks, workers are laid off and savings accounts \ndwindle, causing those consumers to spend even less.\n  Consumers have stopped spending, banks have stopped lending, \nbusinesses are laying off workers. The private sector is shrinking.\n  Only the Federal Government can fill the gap. Only the Federal \nGovernment has the ability to put enough money back into the economy to \nturn our economy around. Only the Federal Government is big enough.\n  This is no excuse for wasteful and careless spending, and that is why \nI have pushed for more accountability in how we spend this money.\n  I supported increasing funding for our inspectors general and \nconducting a review of how well they are doing their job.\n  I have worked to make State spending more accountable and to restore \nreason to compensation for executives whose companies the taxpayers \nhave kept afloat.\n  The American people have a right to know where all this money is \ngoing, and we in the Congress have a duty to do all we can to crack \ndown on fraud and abuse.\n  I also remind my colleagues that we need to act quickly.\n  The longer we delay, the more families lose their livelihoods, their \nhealth care, their sense of security. The\n\n[[Page S2072]]\n\nlonger we wait, the deeper this hole gets, and the harder it will be to \nget out of it.\n  As the President so eloquently reminded us last night, job losses are \naccelerating. In the last year, we have lost 3.6 million jobs--and half \nof those were in the last 3 months. In January, we lost 20,000 a day.\n  The longer we wait, the worse things will get. The longer we wait, \nthe more it will take to turn our economy around. We can't afford to \nwait any longer.\n  I support the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, because I \nbelieve we need to act soon. It will create 4 million jobs, and that is \nwhat this package should be about: jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  I believe that this is a good bill, but I wish to offer a couple of \nthoughts about how we could make it better.\n  As we go forward on conference negotiations with the House, I urge my \ncolleagues to restore the education and State stabilization funding \nthat was removed from the bill.\n  Because of the collapsing economy, my State of Delaware is facing a \nbudget shortfall of $600 million, 20 percent of the State budget. The \nnew Governor, Jack Markell, is staring at tremendous budget cuts if we \ndo not act, when fully a third of the State budget goes to education.\n  That is why I hope my colleagues will find a way to restore the \neducation funding and State stabilization funding that was removed. I \nhope they will help Governor Markell and the 49 other Governors. Both \nthe education funding and the State stabilization funding affect the \nability of states to keep teachers in the classroom and to repair, \nrenovate, and construct schools. These school construction projects not \nonly create--and save--jobs, but are also good long-term investments \nfor our children and grandchildren.\n  For too long, I have heard stories of children in crumbling schools, \nwith outdated textbooks and outdated computers, if they have any. To \ngive our children a fair chance, to compete with the rest of the world, \nto keep America's economic future bright, we must make a downpayment \nnow.\n  And in education, we have a downpayment that can create jobs now. In \nmy State of Delaware alone, $68 million of shovel-ready school \nconstruction projects are awaiting our help.\n  I will close, Mr. President, with this thought. Our children, if they \ncould speak with one voice, want only what all Americans want: a fair \nshot, a fighting chance, an equal opportunity.\n  The people I talk to in Delaware just want a chance. They are willing \nto work hard, and they have. They are willing to play by the rules, and \nthey have. They want to save for tomorrow. In return, all they ask is a \njob they can rely on, a home for their families, and a government that \nwill help them out when they need a hand.\n  The Senate bill focuses on keeping and restoring jobs. It will begin \nthe task of slowing and reversing our economic troubles, and I hope we \ncan get a final bill to the President soon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/10/senate-section/article/S2072-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECESS SUBJECT TO CALL OF THE CHAIR\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of SGT Ezra Dawson from Las Vegas, NV. Ezra was thirty-one years \nold when he lost his life on January 17, 2009, from injuries sustained \nfrom a helicopter crash in Konar Province, Afghanistan.\n  Today, I join Ezra's family and friends in mourning his death. Ezra \nwill forever be remembered as a loving brother, son, and friend to \nmany. Ezra is survived by his devoted wife Starlia Dorsey-Dawson of Las \nVegas, NV; his stepdaughter Diamond Dorsey, also of Las Vegas, NV; his \nmother Eva Davenport, of Indianapolis, IN; his sister Atarah Wright, of \nOklahoma City, OK; and a host of other friends and relatives.\n  Ezra joined the Battalion Reconnaissance Platoon, Headquarters and \nHeadquarters Company, 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment, of Fort \nHood, TX, in January 2008. He served as a junior scout and sniper team \nmember, and as a leader for a reconnaissance team in the Korengal \nValley.\n  For his valiant service, Ezra was awarded the Bronze Star, Purple \nHeart, Army Achievement Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, National \nDefense Service Medal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Global War on \nTerrorism Service Medal, Korea Defense Service Medal, NATO Medal, Army \nService Ribbon, Overseas Service Ribbon and Combat Infantry Badge.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Ezra set as both a soldier and a father. Today and \nalways, he will be remembered by family and friends as a true American \nhero, and we cherish the legacy of his service and his life.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Ezra Dawson in the official \nrecord of the United States Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray \nthat Ezra's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah \nwho said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \nwipe away tears from off all faces.''\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Ezra.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/10/senate-section/article/S2072-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2072-S2073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            MONEY LAUNDERING CONTROL ENHANCEMENT ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, yesterday I joined with Senator Graham in \nintroducing the Money Laundering Control Enhancement Act of 2009. This \nbill would clarify congressional intent and ensure that federal \nprosecutors are able to more effectively fight money laundering and \nterrorism financing.\n  In particular, this bill would overturn the Supreme Court's narrow \nand confusing decision in United States v. Santos and clarify that, as \nused in the Money Laundering Control Act, the term ``proceeds'' refers \nto the total receipts--not simply the profits--of an illegal activity. \nTo interpret this statute differently, as the Santos decision suggests \nwe should, would create needless problems of proof and unfairly burden \nprosecutors. In a world where criminals and terrorists are constantly \ndeveloping new and more sophisticated ways to hide and launder dirty \nmoney, it does not make sense to require prosecutors to prove that \nthese dangerous criminals generated a profit from their illegal \nactivities. Alternatively, interpreting the term ``proceeds'' in a way \nthat encompasses all of the funds received by these individuals would \nensure that federal law is consistent with the United Nations \nConvention Against Transnational Organized Crime, the Model Money \nLaundering Act, and money laundering statutes in the fourteen states \nthat use and define the word ``proceeds.''\n  At a time when both our economic and national security are being \nthreatened, it would be a grave mistake to underestimate the threat \nposed by money laundering. The most recent National Money Laundering \nStrategy, which was developed jointly by the Departments of Treasury, \nJustice, and Homeland Security, states that ``Money Laundering, in its \nown right, is a serious threat to our national and economic security. \nIntegrating illicit proceeds into the financial system, enables \norganized crime, fuels corruption, and erodes confidence in the rule of \nlaw.'' In the face of such a threat, we must provide our hard-working \nlaw enforcement officials with the tools they need to bring these \ncriminals to justice.\n  I have great respect for our Supreme Court. But sometimes, as in the \ncase\n\n[[Page S2073]]\n\nbefore us, they misinterpret congressional intent. In those situations, \nparticularly when important issues like money laundering are involved, \nit is incumbent upon Congress to take corrective action. I hope that my \ncolleagues will join me in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/10/senate-section/article/S2073-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, this year's Black History Month comes at \na remarkable time that will be marked in the history books for \ngenerations to come. The inauguration of our Nation's first African-\nAmerican President, Barack Obama, and confirmation of the first \nAfrican-American Attorney General, Eric Holder, demonstrate our \nNation's boundless capacity to change. All Americans have great cause \nto celebrate during this year's Black History Month our groundbreaking \nprogress.\n  As Civil rights icon Representative John Lewis observed, ``When he \n[President Obama] was born, people of color couldn't register to vote \nin many quarters of the deep South.'' Now, an African-American holds \nthe most distinguished elected position in our country--President of \nthe United States of America. This month is a time to reflect on the \ndistance we have traveled, and the civil rights we have successfully \nfought for, in just one generation.\n  But it is also not a time to become complacent. Americans still \nencounter injustices solely because of their background or the color of \ntheir skin. There still exist large and unacceptable disparities in the \nopportunities afforded many Americans for good education, health care, \nemployment, and more. Black History Month provides an opportunity for \nCongress to remember that addressing these injustices and disparities \nmust be an important goal for Congress in the years ahead.\n  So this month let us reflect on our past triumphs, take note of this \nsignificant historical moment for our Nation, and look forward to an \neven brighter future as we continue working to ensure equality for all \nAmericans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/10/senate-section/article/S2073-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2073-S2075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       In response to your request for personal experience with \n     the rising energy costs, I write not to whine, but to share \n     concern. I live in Caldwell and work in Boise, near the \n     airport, which quickly adds up to well over 400 driving miles \n     a week just in commuting and equates to one full tank of gas, \n     if I am lucky. I have done the research: public \n     transportation is not an option from Caldwell or Nampa into \n     Boise to our off-the-beaten-path work location. I work in \n     non-profit, assisting others in worse situations than myself, \n     which does keep rising energy costs ``in perspective,'' \n     however, concern is fast approaching.\n       Because I work in non-profit, I cannot afford to live any \n     nearer to work, though. I really do not make that little of \n     money--13.46/hr., which is, of course, much higher than the \n     minimum wage. The problem for me is realizing how much is \n     going out in taxes. My paycheck for 80 hours is $1,077, which \n     is quite doable for a single resident, but my gross wage is \n     $796. That is $562 every month; a lot of money that could \n     either go toward the rising food, utility or gas costs or \n     allow me to live closer to where I work.\n       People looking to the government for more handouts will \n     only continue to cripple the system. There are so many \n     agencies with waiting, open arms to assist people in need of \n     finding work or housing--like my agency. Cut taxes--help the \n     working, taxpaying citizens stay on their feet and out of \n     homeless shelters and local food pantries.\n     Jen, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for taking the time to hear my concerns regarding \n     the impacts of higher fuel and energy costs on me. As fuel \n     prices have risen, I have had to start thinking about where I \n     need to go and what my routine will be for the day before \n     getting in the truck. Gone are the days when I would drive 15 \n     miles to the next town to have lunch with someone. Nowadays, \n     I have started riding my bike to work, bought a motorcycle, \n     and even took a different job closer to my house; all in an \n     effort to reduce my fuel expenses. The motorcycle even gets \n     5x the MPG that my truck does. As a result of all of this, I \n     now drive my truck less than 10K miles per year and have lost \n     15 lbs just this spring/summer alone. I go to bed earlier, \n     watch less TV, wake up earlier, and generally am happier and \n     have more energy due to the added exercise that I am getting.\n       I feel horrible for not driving my truck everywhere, but I \n     just cannot afford it. I do hope that that does not make me \n     any less patriotic. I applaud your efforts at trying to get \n     Congress to understand that the only way back to cheap gas \n     (at least for 10 years or so) is to start drilling and \n     pumping crude in Alaska, Utah, Colorado, Montana, Idaho, and \n     any other state that might have some oil under the earth. We \n     need to get every last drop of oil we can from under our own \n     country. We should leave no patch of earth untapped. We must \n     get it all. We need it. It is the only way to protect my \n     right to $1.20/gallon gasoline prices and continue my God-\n     given way of life here in America.\n       Thanks again for doing a great job.\n     Greg.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you so much for taking an interest in our energy \n     problems. My husband and I spend $700-$800 per month in fuel \n     cost. In addition to that our home is heated by heating oil. \n     This winter our oil bill was about $250 per month. If prices \n     keep rising our heating costs this winter may soar to $350 \n     per month. My husband and I are doing our best to commute \n     when possible. However, our work schedule only allows for \n     this twice a week. I have a son with medical problems that \n     make it difficult for me to take the commuting van as I may \n     have to get home at odd times for him.\n       I am not educated enough on our fuel issues. However, I \n     feel that there must be answers and solutions. The fuel is \n     affecting the costs of everything. We are headed for a \n     recession unless something is done quickly. I believe that \n     drilling for oil within our own nation is a must. That will \n     not solve our immediate problems, but we need to be looking \n     long term, too. I think that the oil companies need to be \n     held to a level of profits when it comes to increasing \n     prices. I also feel that the Treasure Valley must have some \n     sort of public transportation system. This needs to be \n     started soon. Not only will this help with our energy costs, \n     but also with air quality. That would be a system I could use \n     as I would be able to access it any time. I realize that a \n     lot of these solutions require large amounts of money, but \n     the federal government needs to step in.\n       Thank you, again, for taking time for public comments. I \n     appreciate all you do for the citizens of Idaho.\n     Wendy.\n                                  ____\n\n       ``Gas prices are too high'' is a response not worthy of \n     your staff's time and energy. We already know that. The \n     question I have is, ``why''? I think several things are going \n     on here.\n       First, speculation/profit taking. People are trying to make \n     exorbitant profits at the expense of not just Americans, but \n     everyone whose fuel ticket is written by the cartels. The oil \n     companies are making record profits on top of record profits. \n     Where is the re-investment in refining capability, \n     exploration, and improved distribution? Americans are feeling \n     like these companies are thumbing their collective corporate \n     noses at us, the customer. All the while, prices on \n     everything affected by the cost of a barrel of oil keep \n     increasing.\n       Second, we are a society built on cheap energy. That is \n     clear. It is unreasonable to expect that to continue \n     indefinitely. At the same time the process of weaning us away \n     from these cartels' stranglehold is forced upon us. I think \n     that we are placing our very existence as Americans into \n     someone else's control.\n       We need to do what we can here to mitigate this immediate \n     and forced situation. We can become energy independent, but \n     that is going to take time. In the meantime, we need to \n     explore other avenues to keep us an independent nation, and \n     get us out from under the foot of countries whose only \n     concern for America is that we keep buying their oil so that \n     they can remain rich and expand their interests. Some of \n     these countries are, at the core, anti-American.\n       How did we get here? Greed. Across the board! Let us not \n     let the lobbies dictate what they think is best for this \n     nation, unless it is. And our governmental branches need to \n     get a handle on this, or this brink of crisis position we \n     find ourselves in is going to result in some very difficult \n     times for a long, long, time. For some families, it already \n     is dire right now. I would also like to say that predicating \n     our future actions on the basis of some ``environmental \n     catastrophe'' where there is not good science to back it \n     up, is, at the very least, foolhardy. Again, too few \n     people are making bad policy for this nation,\n\n[[Page S2074]]\n\n     and in many cases our elected leadership is listening to, \n     and falling for it. Enough.\n       Last, but certainly not least, we need to begin looking at \n     all of our sources of energy, and not ruling any out at this \n     point. An energy policy that is coherent, supportable, and \n     that makes sense for the short and long haul are absolutely \n     necessary. We can get to more environmentally sanctioned \n     energy sources, but this is a time of transition. It is not \n     the time for dawdling, and that option has long since passed. \n     Throwing money at this is not the answer either. This whole \n     situation is approaching critical proportions, and if we do \n     not start to do some forward-thinking, our economy, security \n     and future existence are potentially at risk. Let us not let \n     that happen. We are standing before the slippery slope. What \n     are we going to do? I am afraid that the executive branch for \n     the next few years is not going to help this situation \n     either. So it falls back to the people and those who \n     represent them. We have you there because we believe that you \n     are in a position to make the hard calls that will make the \n     United States a better nation in the long run, and protect \n     her interests. You and all of the others in Congress have \n     taken oaths to support, protect, and defend this nation. I \n     believe, at this juncture, that you still want to do that. \n     Make Idahoans proud of your initiatives and just do what is \n     right. God, help us all.\n     Byron, Mountain Home AFB.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am late with this response. I feel we need to build more \n     refineries in this country. Access to oil is not as much of a \n     problem as being able to refine it for our uses. They try and \n     tell us it costs too much to get it out of the ground. What \n     is better self reliance or dependency on others?\n       Our elected officials have too many fingers in the pie, and \n     we need to get rid of all lobbyists and let the voters decide \n     what is best for our country's welfare. There is no quick fix \n     for the troubles we are in, except for bringing control of \n     our self sufficiency back to our country instead of relying \n     on other countries.

I \n     budgeted $62,000 for fuel this fiscal year. I determined this \n     amount using $3.25 per gallon of gasoline and the average \n     amount of fuel we use monthly/yearly. The average fuel bill \n     for the fleet was $3,500 a month. Since the soaring of fuel \n     prices, it is approximately $5,000 a month and still \n     climbing. I have asked for $95,000 to cover FY2009.\n       I have made some minor changes to patrol procedures by \n     limiting the amount of miles put on the cars in a shift. \n     Handling ``calls for service'' by telephone if possible, \n     rather than driving a patrol car to the complainant's \n     residence, etc. There are still more limitations I may \n     implement if need be.\n       Obviously, this affects the safety of the community if \n     deputies are not able to actively patrol and deter criminal \n     activity. Since taking office in 2005, our crime rate has \n     gone down and our solve rate has gone up. These statistics \n     prove we are doing a better job at being proactive and taking \n     criminals off the street. I worry about the safety of this \n     community and my statutory duty to protect and serve.\n       I am in support of expanding our domestic production of \n     petroleum. We need some relief ASAP. The support from your \n     office is greatly appreciated.\n     Chad, Payette.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am like a lot of Americans, I have to drive. Carpooling, \n     mass transit, bicycles or skateboards are not going to help \n     me. I am a sales rep, and I have to drive as does everyone \n     else in my office. This is a crisis that did not have to \n     happen. The environmentalists got their way and have damaged \n     the economy and security of this country. Let us drill now. \n     Just announcing that we are going to drill and build nuclear \n     plants will drop the price of crude. No one believes we will. \n     Get this done. It is critical.\n     Tom.\n                                  ____\n\n       If we are serious about saving gas, we need to do two \n     things: (1) Slow down. . .driving 55-60 mph rather than 70-80 \n     mph will save gas and substantially reduce demand, and (2) \n     Better regulate speculation of oil futures. There are about \n     10,000 offshore drilling permits that have been issued but \n     that are currently not being used, so the oil companies \n     obviously aren't highly motivated to explore. We all have \n     hardship stories. What we need is action at your level.\n     Chuck, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family and I have had to curtail some of our planned \n     and/or camping trips this summer because of the cost of fuel. \n     I had planned on going camping this summer for a few days but \n     now I have to change my plans so I will have enough fuel to \n     get back and forth to work.\n       I am a retired (credited with 38 years service) and a \n     disabled military veteran. I was injured in Vietnam and then \n     again in Desert Storm. I do not get much from my retirement \n     ($501) after they take my disability and taxes from it so I \n     have to keep working along with my wife so that we can afford \n     to have a home and be able to eat.\n       I agree with the President that we have to drill off the \n     coast and in ANWR along with coming up with alternate fuel.\n     John.\n                                  ____\n\n       Just a short message--thank you for your attention to this \n     matter, Senator Crapo. This whole thing is a big lie. We are \n     one of the richest nations in energy and reserves. We do have \n     the resources and there is no shortage. It is all there and \n     it has been proven and everyone knows it, so what are not we \n     tapping into it?\n       Other countries are controlling us because we depend on \n     them. And the other thing is that a few tree huggers here are \n     able to shut us down as far as tapping into our own reserves. \n     That is just not right and has to stop now.\n       This problem has not happened overnight and cannot be fixed \n     overnight, but changes can be made and should be made now, so \n     we can start heading in the right direction. It will take \n     time but it needs to start now. The government needs to step \n     up to the plate now and so does each state, including Idaho, \n     and put a stop to this wrong that is being done to each of \n     us.\n       Thank you for your time and attention and please be a doer \n     and not just a hearer.\n     Lyle, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I live in Nampa, where the price of gas has not yet $4.50. \n     I know in other parts of the country it is well above that. \n     While it may be a good idea to have alternative flue sources, \n     that is still a long while coming. The immediate solution is \n     to drill for our own oil. Both in ANWR, and in the Gulf of \n     Mexico. I mean if the Chinese are going to drill for it in \n     the gulf we might as well to. Better that we get some of that \n     oil than none.\n       Bottom line we have our own oil why are we buying it from \n     others at outrageous prices?\n     Eric, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       My suggestion to help save energy is to bring back the \n     Amtrak line from Salt Lake City to Portland.\n     Lori, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       This is a response to your email soliciting ``stories'' \n     about the effects of the high price of gasoline on Idahoans.\n       I lived and worked in Colorado from 1969-77, and in Los \n     Angeles from 1977-2004. I began visiting Idaho around 1979, \n     and moved to Hailey in 2004--in large part, because it \n     reminded me of Colorado in the 1970s: a beautiful natural \n     landscape, appreciated by many locals and visitors.\n       This country has been on a gas-guzzling binge for fifty \n     years. I am sick and tired of hearing people complain about \n     the cost of gas, driving solo in their inefficient cars, and \n     unwilling to carpool or contribute towards mass transit \n     options.\n       We do not need to expand domestic petroleum production. We \n     need to learn conservation and seek alternative energy \n     sources. The ``God-given right'' to tear up the landscape for \n     oil and selfish-use is at the heart of what is wrong with \n     people and their mind-set on a global scale.\n       Wake up and smell the coffee.\n       I dare you to share this email (uncensored) with your \n     Senate colleagues.\n     Mark, Hailey.\n                                  ____\n\n       I have been commuting to Boise from Caldwell since 1988. I \n     now spend approximately $400 per month on gas. I drive a mid-\n     sized car and am unable to carpool because of my work hours, \n     which vary. I never know if I am going to have to work late \n     or not. There are no other options for me. So, because of the \n     fuel prices, all I buy are groceries and gas. The US should \n     look into more nuclear power, alternative fuel sources such \n     as hydrogen and increase drilling in this country. For years, \n     I worked in the Utah area where they drilled and capped \n     numerous wells. As far as I know, those wells are still \n     capped. Why aren't we using more domestic oil? Alaska is \n     supposed to contain lots of oil, but we do not drill there. I \n     believe that in this day and age, it would be possible to \n     drill without excessive damage to the environment.\n     Kathy.\n                                  ____\n\n       I understand you are seeking a response to the energy \n     issue. We the people of the U.S. and Idaho have a responsible \n     to make sure that when we obtain our natural resources we \n     make sure it is done environmentally proper or as best as \n     possible as the times dictate.\n       We should drill domestically offshore and on land, with the \n     addition of building refineries to coup with the domestic \n     demands. We should conduct other alternatives as well while \n     we are drilling as well. The U.S. government should have \n     incentives in place for developers, manufacturers and \n     consumers for the alternative energy, i.e. tax credits that \n     we have for hybrid auto.\n       Thanks for taking time in reading this note.\n                                                    Joseph, Eagle.\n\n[[Page S2075]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n       As a resident of the outlying area of Clearwater County, \n     the price of gas is wreaking havoc. The prices on goods in \n     Orofino have risen dramatically. People go to Lewiston a lot \n     to shop, but that has become prohibitive also. The economy in \n     general is taking a hit because it is costing the timber \n     companies an arm and leg to haul logs, therefore it is \n     trickling down to the other businesses. Recreation is being \n     hit because people cannot afford the fuel. Something has to \n     be done. As a country we need to band together to help \n     conserve energy, and reduce our dependence on foreign oil \n     sources. It seems to be yet another case of the rich getting \n     richer, and the poor getting poorer. What would happen to \n     this nation if for one week, nothing moved? No food was \n     hauled, no freight was moved, no gasoline was purchased. For \n     the first time in my lifetime, I fear that a depression is \n     nearing.

Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I ask \nmy colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of a remarkable \nwoman, Lani Silver. Lani was a passionate activist, oral historian, \njournalist, filmmaker, speaker, and artist who passed away January 28, \n2009.\n  Lani was born on March 28, 1948, in Lynn, MA. Shortly after she was \nborn, her family moved to San Francisco. When she was 19, Lani traveled \nto South Africa, where she observed the awful impacts of apartheid. \nLani was profoundly affected by this experience, and when she returned \nto San Francisco she began what was to become a lifetime commitment to \nprogressive causes.\n  In 1981, Lani founded the Holocaust Oral History Project. Over the \nnext 20 years she recorded over 1,700 oral histories, with over 1,400 \nHolocaust survivors and witnesses. Lani also served as a consultant to \nSteven Speilberg's Shoah Foundation, which recorded 53,000 Holocaust \nsurvivor oral histories. Thanks to Lani's vision and determination, \nthese valuable stories were not lost forever.\n  Lani's commitment to social justice took many forms. In 2006 she \ncowrote and produced an opera about Yukiko Sugihara, a Japanese \ndiplomat in Lithuania who, during World War II rescued thousands of \nJews during the Holocaust by hand-writing visas against the orders of \nthe Japanese Government. Lani also organized events, exhibits, and \nmedia campaigns around the world to honor Sugihara and make sure his \nimportant story would not be forgotten.\n  In 2000, Lani founded the James Byrd Jr. Racism Oral History Project, \nin honor of James Byrd, Jr., who was brutally murdered in Jasper, TX, \nin 1998 by three White supremacists. The project has recorded 2,500 \noral histories on racism in America with participants from the San \nFrancisco Bay area, Jasper, and Houston, TX.\n  Lani's many contributions have not gone unrecognized. In 1996, Lani \nreceived the Woman of the Year award from KQED public television and \nradio, and in 2003 she received the Alumni of the Year award from the \nCity College of San Francisco.\n  Lani stood out as a driven activist who cared for her community \ndeeply and will be remembered by friends and colleagues as earnest, \nhumble, and dedicated to the ongoing fight for equality and fairness. \nHer optimism, dedication, and courage are reflected by the thousands of \nindividuals whose lives she has enriched and improved. We will always \nbe grateful for Lani's example of passionate activism.\n  Lani is survived by sisters Lori Silver and Lynn Jacobs; nieces Sara \nSilver Jacobs, Brette Silver Jacobs, and Lauren Shaber; nephews Jose \nJacobs and Justin Shaber, and brother-in-law Syd Shaber. Our hearts go \nout to Lani's family and friends during this difficult time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/10/senate-section/article/S2075-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 912.

A bill to improve the lives of our Nation's veterans and \ntheir families and provide them with the opportunity to achieve the \nAmerican dream; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Baucus, Senator \nLincoln, Senator Burr, and Senator Collins to introduce the Keeping Our \nPromise to America's Military Veterans Act. Quite simply, my colleagues \nand I strongly believe that Congress must remain focused on fully \nsupporting our veterans and their families in the 111th Congress. As we \nbegin this new Congress, our legislative priorities should reflect the \nunending gratitude of the American people for the sacrifices of our \nveterans and their families in defending the Nation and our way of \nlife.\n  To date, the war on terrorism has already generated nearly 1 million \ndischarged veterans and their ranks will grow with nearly 300,000 new \nveterans per year. The Congress must not waver in our commitment of \nsupport for their service, as well as the service and sacrifices of \neach of our citizens who have taken that extra step and donned the \nuniform of this great Nation. The bill that we are introducing would \nexpress the sense of Congress that legislation should be enacted in the \n111th Congress to improve the lives of our Nation's veterans and their \nfamilies and provide them with the opportunity to achieve the American \ndream, including legislation to assure funding for medical care and for \ntimely and accurate adjudication of all benefit claims, to assure \naccesses to high quality treatment for PTSD and TBI conditions, and to \nassure a seamless transition for veterans and their families from \nmilitary to civilian life.\n  As we consider legislation for this Congress, I point out, for \nexample, the problem of providing the VA health care system with \nfunding in a timely and predictable manner. With the exception of last \nyear, VA appropriations have historically not met this simple standard. \nTo correct this problem, I have supported, and will continue to support \nmeasures to make VA appropriations mandatory, or to provide advance \nappropriations to the VA. Neither are new budget concepts, but rather a \nmeans of achieving timely, predictable, and sufficient funding of VA \nhealth care via the current annual appropriations process. I joined \nwith a number of senators in the last Congress, including then-Senator \nBarack Obama, on legislation to provide advance appropriations to the \nVA, and will continue to work to this end in the 111th.\n   Of the many challenges on which this Congress must act in the weeks \nand months ahead, we believe that it is imperative that we not waver in \nour support for our Nation's veterans and their families. I sincerely \nhope that my colleagues will join Senator Baucus, Senator Lincoln, \nSenator Burr, Senator Collins, and me and offer their support for this \nimportant legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself and Mr. Burris):\n  S. 404. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to expand \nveteran eligibility for reimbursement by the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs for emergency treatment furnished in a non-Department facility, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce legislation to correct a \ndeficiency in the law governing health care for veterans. Under current \nlaw, originally enacted on November 30, 1999, a veteran who is enrolled \nin VA's health care system can be reimbursed for emergency treatment \nreceived at a non-VA hospital. However, the statute only permits such \nVA reimbursement if the veteran has no other outside health insurance, \nno matter how limited that other coverage might be.\n  This sole payor provision means that a veteran who has any insurance \nis not entitled to reimbursement from VA for emergency medical \ntreatment received at a non-VA facility. This is true even if the \nveteran's insurance policy does not cover the full amount owed.\n  The bill I am introducing would amend current law so that a veteran \nwho has outside insurance would be eligible for reimbursement in the \nevent that any outside insurance does not cover the full amount of the \nemergency care. VA would be authorized to cover the difference between \nthe amount the veteran's insurance will pay and the total cost of care. \nIn essence, VA would become the payor of last resort in such cases. \nThis would keep the veteran from being burdened by exorbitant medical \nfees with no insurance with which to pay them.\n  In addition to amending current law in a prospective manner, this \nlegislation would also allow the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to \nretroactively apply this law to emergency treatment received between \nthe effective date of the current law and the date of enactment of the \nlegislation I am introducing today.\n  One example of the sort of case to which this discretionary authority \nmight apply is one that came to the Committee's attention involving a \ndisabled Vietnam veteran who was in a serious motorcycle accident which \nled to a medical bill for emergency room care of over $100,000. This \nveteran, who lived in Illinois, had state mandated auto insurance which \nincluded a medical benefit of $10,000. Since he had this other \ninsurance, VA was precluded from paying for his care and the veteran \nwas personally responsible for the difference between the amount \ncovered by his state-required policy and the total charge for his care. \nHad this veteran\n\n[[Page S2081]]\n\nhad no insurance at all, VA would have paid the entire amount.\n  I urge our colleagues to cosponsor this legislation and to work with \nme and the other members of the Veterans' Affairs Committee to address \nthis gap in VA benefits.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 404\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

EXPANSION OF VETERAN ELIGIBILITY FOR REIMBURSEMENT BY \n                   SECRETARY OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FOR EMERGENCY \n                   TREATMENT FURNISHED IN A NON-DEPARTMENT \n                   FACILITY.\n\n       (a) Expansion of Eligibility.--Subsection (b)(3)(C) of \n     section 1725 of title 38, United States Code, is amended by \n     striking ``, in whole or in part,''.\n       (b) Limitations on Reimbursement.--Such section 1725 is \n     further amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c), by adding at the end the following \n     new paragraph:\n       ``(4)(A) If the veteran has contractual or legal recourse \n     against a third party that would, in part, extinguish the \n     veteran's liability to the provider of the emergency \n     treatment and payment for the treatment may be made both \n     under subsection (a) and by the third party, the amount \n     payable for such treatment under such subsection shall be the \n     amount by which the costs for the emergency treatment exceed \n     the amount payable or paid by the third party, except that \n     the amount payable may not exceed the maximum amount payable \n     established under paragraph (1)(A).\n       ``(B) In any case in which a third party is financially \n     responsible for part of the veteran's emergency treatment \n     expenses, the Secretary shall be the secondary payer.\n       ``(C) A payment in the amount payable under subparagraph \n     (A) shall be considered payment in full and shall extinguish \n     the veteran's liability to the provider.\n       ``(D) The Secretary may not reimburse a veteran under this \n     section for any copayment or similar payment that the veteran \n     owes the third party or for which the veteran is responsible \n     under a health-plan contract.''; and\n       (2) in subsection (f)(3)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``, including the Secretary of Health \n     and Human Services with respect to the Medicare program under \n     title XVIII of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395 et \n     seq.) and the Medicaid program under title XIX of such Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.)''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (B), by inserting before the period at \n     the end the following: ``, including a State Medicaid agency \n     with respect to payments made under a State plan for medical \n     assistance approved under title XIX of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1396 et seq.)''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--\n       (1) In general.--The amendments made by subsections (a) and \n     (b) shall take effect on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, and shall apply with respect to emergency treatment \n     furnished on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Reimbursement for treatment before effective date.--The \n     Secretary may provide reimbursement under section 1725 of \n     title 38, United States Code, as amended by subsection (a) \n     and (b) for emergency treatment furnished before the date of \n     the enactment of this Act if the Secretary determines that, \n     under the circumstances applicable with respect to the \n     veteran, it is appropriate to do so.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Bennett, Mr. Bayh, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. \n        Brown, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Johnson, Mr. \n        Kennedy, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Whitehouse):\n  S. 405. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat a deduction equal to fair market value shall be allowed for \ncharitable contributions of literary, musical, artistic, or scholarly \ncompositions created by the donor; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today we reintroduce the Artist-Museum \nPartnership Act, and once again, I am pleased to be joined in this \neffort by my good friend Senator Bennett from Utah.\n  This bipartisan legislation would enable our country to keep \ncherished art works in the United States and to preserve them in our \npublic institutions. At the same time, this legislation will erase an \ninequity in our tax code that currently serves as a disincentive for \nartists to donate their works to museums and libraries. We have \nintroduced this same bill in each of the past five Congresses, and I am \nhopeful that this will be our year. In the past, our bill has been \nincluded in the Senate-passed version of the 2001 tax reconciliation \nbill, the Senate-passed version of the 2003 Charity Aid, Recovery, and \nEmpowerment Act, and the Senate-passed version of the 2005 tax \nreconciliation bill. I would like to thank Senators Bayh, Boxer, Brown, \nCochran, Dodd, Durbin, Johnson, Kennedy, Sanders, Schumer, and \nWhitehouse for cosponsoring this non-partisan bill.\n  Our bill is sensible and straightforward. It would allow artists, \nwriters, and composers to take a tax deduction equal to the fair market \nvalue of the works they donate to museums and libraries. This is \nsomething that collectors who make similar donations are already able \nto do. Under current law, artists who donate self-created works are \nonly able to deduct the cost of supplies such as canvas, pen, paper and \nink, which does not even come close to their true value. This is unfair \nto artists, and it hurts museums and libraries large and small that are \ndedicated to preserving works for posterity. If we as a nation want to \nensure that works of art created by living artists are available to the \npublic in the future for study and for pleasure this is something that \nartists should be allowed to do.\n  In my State of Vermont, we are incredibly proud of the great works \nproduced by hundreds of local artists who choose to live and work in \nthe Green Mountain State. Displaying their creations in museums and \nlibraries helps develop a sense of pride among Vermonters, and \nstrengthens a bond with Vermont, its landscape, its beauty, and its \ncultural heritage. Anyone who has contemplated a painting in a museum \nor examined an original manuscript or composition, and has gained a \ngreater understanding of both the artist and the subject as a result, \nknows the tremendous value of these works. I would like to see more of \nthem, not fewer, preserved in Vermont and across the country.\n  Prior to 1969, artists and collectors alike were able to take a \ndeduction equivalent to the fair market value of a work, but Congress \nchanged the law with respect to artists in the Tax Reform Act of 1969. \nSince then, fewer and fewer artists have donated their works to museums \nand cultural institutions. For example, prior to the enactment of the \n1969 law, Igor Stravinsky planned to donate his papers to the Music \nDivision of the Library of Congress. But after the law passed, his \npapers were sold instead to a private foundation in Switzerland. We can \nno longer afford this massive loss to our cultural heritage. Losses to \nthe public like this are an unintended consequence of the 1969 tax bill \nthat should be corrected.\n  Congress changed the law for artists more than 30 years ago in \nresponse to the perception that some taxpayers were taking advantage of \nthe law by inflating the market value of self-created works. Since that \ntime, however, the government has cut down significantly on the abuse \nof fair market value determinations.\n  Under our legislation, artists who donate their own paintings, \nmanuscripts, compositions, or scholarly compositions would be subject \nto the same new rules that all taxpayer/collectors who donate such \nworks must now follow. This includes providing relevant information as \nto the value of the gift, providing appraisals by qualified appraisers, \nand, in some cases, subjecting them to review by the Internal Revenue \nService's Art Advisory Panel.\n  In addition, donated works must be accepted by museums and libraries, \nwhich often have strict criteria in place for works they intend to \ndisplay. The institution must certify that it intends to put the work \nto a use that is related to the institution's tax exempt status. For \nexample, a painting contributed to an educational institution must be \nused by that organization for educational purposes and could not be \nsold by the institution for profit. Similarly, a work could not be \ndonated to a hospital or other charitable institution that did not \nintend to use the work in a manner related to the function constituting \nthe recipient's exemption under Section 501 of the tax code. Finally, \nthe fair market value of the work could only be deducted from the \nportion of the artist's income that has come from the sale of similar \nworks or related activities.\n\n[[Page S2082]]\n\n  This bill would also correct another disparity in the tax treatment \nof self-created works--how the same work is treated before and after an \nartist's death. While living artists may only deduct the material costs \nof donations, donations of those same works after death are deductible \nfrom estate taxes at the fair market value of the work. In addition, \nwhen an artist dies, works that are part of his or her estate are taxed \non the fair market value.\n  I want to thank my colleagues again for cosponsoring this bipartisan \nlegislation. The time has come for us to correct an unintended \nconsequence of the 1969 law and encourage rather than discourage the \ndonations of art works by their creators. This bill will make a crucial \ndifference in an artist's decision to donate his or her work, rather \nthan sell it to a private party where it may become lost to the public \nforever.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous cnsent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 405\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am proud to join the Senator from \nVermont today to introduce the Artist-Museum Partnership Act. He and I \nhave introduced this legislation in the past, and we hope that our \ncolleagues will see this bill for what it is: a reasonable solution to \nan unintentional inequity in our Tax Code.\n  This legislation would allow living artists to deduct the fair-market \nvalue of their art work when they contribute their work to museums or \nother public institutions. As the Tax Code is currently written, art \ncollectors are able to deduct the fair market value of any piece of art \nthey donate to a museum, but the artist who created the work is only \nable to deduct the material cost, which may be nothing more than a \ncanvas, a tube of paint, and a wooden frame, if he or she donated their \nart to a museum. Thus, there exists a disincentive for artists to \ndonate their work to museums. The solution is simple: treat collectors \nand artists the same way. This bill would do just that.\n  Certainly, this bill would benefit artists, but more importantly, the \nbeneficiaries would be the museums that would receive the artwork and \nthe general public who would be able to view it in a timely manner. \nThis change in the Tax Code would increase the number of original \npieces donated to public institutions, giving scholars greater access \nto an artist's work during the lifetime of that artist, as well as \nprovide for an increase in the public display of such work.\n  I would like to thank Senator Leahy for his work on this bill. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. The benefit of \nthe Artist-Museum Partnership Act to our Nation's cultural and artistic \nheritage cannot be overstated. This minor correction to the Tax Code is \nlong overdue, and the Senate should act on this legislation to remedy \nthe problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 406. A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide Medicaid coverage of drugs prescribed for certain research \nstudy child participants; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce Nino's Act, to provide for the continuance of successful \ntreatment for children who are required to leave National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, research studies. The NIH provides the greatest medical \nresearch in the world on innumerable diseases, including cancer, \nAlzheimer's, Parkinson's. The NIH also conducts excellent research on \ndiseases that affect children. To conduct that research many brave \nchildren must partake in research studies including observational, or \nnatural history, studies and clinical trials to test experimental \ntherapies. This participation is critical to understanding diseases and \nultimately finding cures at the NIH.\n  To participate in the trials and studies, children and their families \noften make considerable sacrifices. Families will travel great \ndistances to receive treatment that may provide relief from the child's \nillness. In many cases, parents and doctors will have tried many \ntreatments for the child's disease about which little may be known or \nunderstood. The NIH studies represent an opportunity for both the \nmedical community to learn more about the disease and the child to be \nstudied and potentially treated by the best researchers in the world.\n  When the experimental treatments are successful, it is cause for \ngreat celebration for the child. The joy, however, can end quickly as \nthe studies come to end but the children who have been part of them \ncontinue to be stricken by these terrible illnesses.\n\n[[Page S2083]]\n\n  Nino's Act seeks to transition children out of the NIH studies as \nthey end so they don't experience a gap in their important treatment. \nThis legislation continues the successful treatment initiated in NIH \nstudies by providing access to the same prescription drugs for children \nwho are required to leave NIH clinical studies due to the studies \nending, researcher leaving, or other reason. Often drugs that are used \nsuccessfully in these studies have not yet been approved by the Food \nand Drug Administration or have not been approved for treatment of the \nchild's specific disease. As such, it is nearly impossible for children \nto get access or insurance coverage for these drugs. This bill makes \nthat access possible by requiring Medicaid to cover the cost of \ntreatment in the event that the children's health insurance does not.\n  On occasion, insurers will cover the cost of the treatment for these \nchildren if they have adequate insurance and the FDA has approved the \ndrug for off-label uses. More often than not, however, children do not \nhave health insurance, or have insufficient insurance to obtain these \ndrugs. As a result, children suffer their diseases without relief from \nthe treatment as established in the clinical NIH studies. To ensure \nthat these children have access to successful care post-study, Nino's \nAct requires Medicaid to cover the cost of treatment for these \nchildren. While Medicaid access is traditionally based on income, due \nto the importance of these drugs to the child's well-being the income \ncomponent will be waived. To ensure Medicaid is not unnecessarily \ncovering medication, Nino's Act requires the physicians participating \nin the research to certify the treatment as successful and essential.\n  This important issue was introduced to me by Lori Todaro of Newville, \nPA. Lori's son Nino suffers from Undifferentiated Auto-Inflammatory \nPeriodic Fever Syndrome. This disease takes a devastating toll on those \nwho suffer from it. The auto-inflammatory disease can cause joint \ninflammation arthritis, Crohns, colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, and \ncyclical high fevers. Treatment for Periodic Fever Syndrome is \nexperimental at best; Lori and Nino have visited a number of doctors \nand tried many medications in an effort to control the disease.\n  In 2003, Nino was fortunate to be selected to take part in an \nobservational study at NIH in Bethesda, Maryland for Undifferentiated \nAuto-Inflammatory Periodic Fever Syndrome. During the course of the \nstudy, Nino was given a new medication and his condition greatly \nimproved. Before he participated in the study he was being fitted for \nwheelchairs and was home schooled because his symptoms were so \ndisruptive and unpredictable. The NIH treatment allowed him to resume a \nnormal life and enabled him to attend school and play soccer. While \nNino's treatment was successful he could not remain part of the study \nindefinitely and was encouraged to seek coverage for his treatments \nthrough his private insurer. Initially, the Todaro's insurer would not \nagree to cover the cost of the experimental drug and only after an \nintense lobbying effort by Lori, did the insurer agree to cover Nino's \nprescriptions.\n  Nino's story is a successful one, but also serves to highlight the \nissue that children and their families are facing as they transition \nout of NIH studies. For many, NIH trials are a source of hope for \nrelief from the worst diseases known to man. The excellent doctors and \nresearch teams at NIH make invaluable contributions to our \nunderstanding of complex and debilitating diseases. This legislation \nseeks to amplify the NIH's contributions by allowing America's sickest \nchildren to continue their successful treatment under Medicaid \ncoverage. I encourage my colleagues to work with Senator Casey and me \nto move this legislation forward promptly.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. \n        Murray, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Brown, Mr. Webb, Mr. Tester, Mr. \n        Begich, Mr. Burris, Mr. Specter, Mr. Isakson, Mr. Wicker, Mr. \n        Johanns, and Mr. Graham):\n  S. 407. A bill to increase, effective as of December 1, 2009, the \nrates of compensation for veterans with service-connected disabilities \nand the rates of dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nsurvivors of certain disabled veterans, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, as Chairman of the Senate Committee \non Veterans' Affairs, I introduce the Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-\nLiving Adjustment Act of 2009. This measure would direct the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to increase, effective December 1, 2009, the rates \nof veterans' compensation to keep pace with the rising cost-of-living \nin this country. The rate adjustment is equal to that provided on an \nannual basis to Social Security recipients and is based on the Consumer \nPrice Index.\n  All of my colleagues on the Committee on Veterans' Affairs, including \nSenators Burr, Rockefeller, Murray, Sanders, Brown, Webb, Tester, \nBegich, Burris, Specter, Isakson, Wicker, Johanns, and Graham join me \nin introducing this important legislation. I appreciate their continued \nsupport of our nation's veterans.\n  Congress regularly enacts an annual cost-of-living adjustment for \nveterans' compensation in order to ensure that inflation does not erode \nthe purchasing power of the veterans and their families who depend upon \nthis income to meet their daily needs. This past year Congress passed, \nand the President signed into law, Public Law 110-324, which resulted \nin a COLA increase of 5.8 percent for 2009. The 2010 COLA has not yet \nbeen determined.\n  The COLA affects, among other benefits, veterans' disability \ncompensation and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving \nspouses and children. Many of the more than 3 million recipients of \nthose benefits depend upon these tax-free payments not only to provide \nfor their own basic needs, but those of their spouses and children as \nwell. Without an annual COLA increase, these veterans and their \nfamilies would see the value of their hard-earned benefits slowly \ndiminish, and we, as a Congress, would be neglecting our duty to ensure \nthat those who sacrificed so much for this country receive the benefits \nand services to which they are entitled.\n  It is important that we view veterans' compensation, including the \nannual COLA, and indeed all benefits earned by veterans, as a \ncontinuing cost of war. It is clear that the ongoing conflicts in Iraq \nand Afghanistan will continue to result in injuries and disabilities \nthat will yield an increase in claims for compensation. Currently, \nthere are nearly 3 million veterans in receipt of VA disability \ncompensation.\n  Disbursement of disability compensation to our nation's veterans \nconstitutes one of the central missions of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs. It is a necessary measure of appreciation afforded to those \nveterans whose lives were forever altered by their service to this \ncountry.\n  I urge our colleagues to support passage of this COLA increase. I \nalso ask our colleagues for their continued support for our nation's \nveterans.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the Veterans' \nCompensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2009. As the Ranking \nMember of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I am pleased to \njoin the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Akaka, and all of the \nCommittee's members in introducing this important bill.\n  As part of its mission to ``care for him who shall have borne the \nbattle, and for his widow, and his orphan,'' the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, provides a range of benefits to veterans and their \nfamilies. These benefits include disability compensation for veterans \nwho suffer from disabilities incurred in or aggravated by their \nmilitary service and dependency and indemnity compensation for the \nspouses or children of disabled or deceased veterans. Although we can \nnever fully repay them for their service or sacrifices, these payments \nmay help ease their financial burdens and improve the quality of their \nlives.\n  The bill we are introducing today will ensure that more than 3 \nmillion veterans and their family members--including more than 130,000 \nin my home state of North Carolina--will receive a cost-of-living \nincrease in their VA benefits this year. These annual increases help \nensure that the value of the benefits provided by a grateful nation \nwill not decline over time as a result of inflation.\n\n[[Page S2084]]\n\n  Last year, I was proud to support the enactment of the Veterans' \nCompensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2008, which resulted in a \n5.8 percent increase in VA benefits. Under this bill, the amount of the \nincrease for 2009 would be the same as that provided to Social Security \nrecipients, which will be announced later this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Conrad, \n        Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 408. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide a \nmeans for continued improvement in emergency medical services for \nchildren; to the committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President. Today, along with my colleagues, Senators \nHatch, Kennedy, Conrad, Dorgan, and Akaka, I introduce The Wakefield \nAct, also known as the Emergency Medical Services for Children Act of \n2009. Since Senator Hatch and I worked toward authorization of EMSC in \n1984, this program has become the impetus for improving children's \nemergency services nationwide. From specialized training for emergency \ncare providers to ensuring ambulances and emergency departments have \nstate-of-the-art pediatric sized equipment, EMSC has served as the \nvehicle for improving survival of our smallest and most vulnerable \ncitizens when accidents or medical emergencies threatened their lives.\n  It remains no secret that children present unique anatomic, \nphysiologic, emotional and developmental challenges to our primarily \nadult-oriented emergency medical system. As has been said many times \nbefore, children are not little adults. Evaluation and treatment must \ntake into account their special needs, or we risk letting them fall \nthrough the gap between adult and pediatric care. The EMSC has bridged \nthat gap while fostering collaborative relationships among emergency \nmedical technicians, paramedics, nurses, emergency physicians, \nsurgeons, and pediatricians.\n  The Institute of Medicine's recently released study on Emergency Care \nfor Children indicated that our Nation is not as well prepared as once \nwe thought. Only 6 percent of all emergency departments have the \nessential pediatric supplies and equipment necessary to manage \npediatric emergencies. Many of the providers of emergency care have \nreceived fragmented and limited training in the skills necessary to \nresuscitate this specialized population. Even our disaster preparedness \nplans have not fully addressed the unique needs posed by children \ninjured in such events.\n  EMSC remains the only federal program dedicated to examining the best \nways to deliver various forms of care to children in emergency \nsettings. Reauthorization of EMSC will ensure that children's needs \nwill be given the due attention they deserve and that coordination and \nexpansion of services for victims of life-threatening illnesses and \ninjuries will be available throughout the United States.\n  I look forward to reauthorization of this important legislation and \nthe continued advances in our emergency healthcare delivery system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 408\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Wakefield Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are 31,000,000 child and adolescent visits to the \n     Nation's emergency departments every year.\n       (2) Over 90 percent of children requiring emergency care \n     are seen in general hospitals, not in free-standing \n     children's hospitals, with one-quarter to one-third of the \n     patients being children in the typical general hospital \n     emergency department.\n       (3) Severe asthma and respiratory distress are the most \n     common emergencies for pediatric patients, representing \n     nearly one-third of all hospitalizations among children under \n     the age of 15 years, while seizures, shock, and airway \n     obstruction are the other common pediatric emergencies, \n     followed by cardiac arrest and severe trauma.\n       (4) Up to 20 percent of children needing emergency care \n     have underlying medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, \n     sickle-cell disease, low birth weight, and bronchopulmonary \n     dysplasia.\n       (5) Significant gaps remain in emergency medical care \n     delivered to children. Only about 6 percent of hospitals have \n     available all the pediatric supplies deemed essential by the \n     American Academy of Pediatrics and the American College of \n     Emergency Physicians for managing pediatric emergencies, \n     while about half of hospitals have at least 85 percent of \n     those supplies.\n       (6) Providers must be educated and trained to manage \n     children's unique physical and psychological needs in \n     emergency situations, and emergency systems must be equipped \n     with the resources needed to care for this especially \n     vulnerable population.\n       (7) Systems of care must be continually maintained, \n     updated, and improved to ensure that research is translated \n     into practice, best practices are adopted, training is \n     current, and standards and protocols are appropriate.\n       (8) The Emergency Medical Services for Children (EMSC) \n     Program under section 1910 of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 300w-9) is the only Federal program that focuses \n     specifically on improving the pediatric components of \n     emergency medical care.\n       (9) The EMSC Program promotes the nationwide exchange of \n     pediatric emergency medical care knowledge and collaboration \n     by those with an interest in such care and is depended upon \n     by Federal agencies and national organizations to ensure that \n     this exchange of knowledge and collaboration takes place.\n       (10) The EMSC Program also supports a multi-institutional \n     network for research in pediatric emergency medicine, thus \n     allowing providers to rely on evidence rather than anecdotal \n     experience when treating ill or injured children.\n       (11) The Institute of Medicine stated in its 2006 report, \n     ``Emergency Care for Children: Growing Pains'', that the EMSC \n     Program ``boasts many accomplishments . . . and the work of \n     the program continues to be relevant and vital''.\n       (12) The EMSC Program is celebrating its 25th anniversary, \n     marking a quarter-century of driving key improvements in \n     emergency medical services to children, and should continue \n     its mission to reduce child and youth morbidity and mortality \n     by supporting improvements in the quality of all emergency \n     medical and emergency surgical care children receive.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this Act to reduce child \n     and youth morbidity and mortality by supporting improvements \n     in the quality of all emergency medical care children \n     receive.\n\n     SEC. 3.
