Mr. President, from the outset of the health care \ndebate, Americans have had one key test for reform: Will it make health \ncare cost less? Will it make health care cost less? Well, over the past \nfew months, a number of independent groups have reached the conclusion \nthat the legislation we have seen fails that test. In fact, it would \nmake health care more expensive. So even aside from the issue of \nwhether the so-called government option is in or out of the bill that \nhits the floor, I think it is fair to say it isn't what the American \npeople were looking for.\n  Let's start with the independent, nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice. The CBO says the proposed fees and taxes on drug makers, \nmedical labs, and medical device manufacturers would lead to higher \nhealth care premiums for Americans who get health insurance through \ntheir employers, and\n\n[[Page S10744]]\n\nit says premiums will go up for people who choose to buy their own \ninsurance. So whether you get insurance through your employer or \nwhether you buy it on your own, your premiums go up. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, another nonpartisan group, also looked at the \nlegislation. It says that a proposed excise tax on insurers would also \ndrive up the cost of employer-provided insurance. Here are two \nindependent, nonpartisan groups looking at the health care legislation \nwe have seen. They both conclude it will drive up the cost of health \ncare.\n  Americans thought reform was supposed to lower costs, not raise them. \nYet every day it seems we see further confirmation that the plans under \ndiscussion would lead to higher costs and more long-term spending and \ndebt.\n  One study we have seen says the Democrats' tax on insurance plans \nwould cost families nearly $500 per year in higher premiums starting \nnext year, long before any of the proposed benefits would kick in. \nAnother study says that a family of four in my home State of Kentucky \nwould see their premiums go up from about $350 a month to nearly $800 a \nmonth--a big increase. Even if these families were eligible for the \nsubsidies in the Democratic bill, their premiums could still be about \n50 percent higher than they are now. This is mind-boggling. Only in \nWashington would lawmakers propose a health care reform that actually \nraises costs and do so in the very same month the Federal Government \nrecorded its largest deficit in history and at a time when unemployment \napproaches 10 percent.\n  Americans thought the whole point of reform was to lower costs. Yet \nthe plans we have seen would do just the opposite, and the American \npeople are taking notice. Americans are asking us to follow through on \nthe initial pledge to lower health care costs, but that means enacting \nreforms that would actually lead to lower costs, such as getting rid of \njunk lawsuits and incentivizing healthy choices. Americans want reform. \nInstead, the administration and its allies in the Senate are giving \nthem higher premiums, higher taxes, and massive cuts to Medicare. Mr. \nPresident, that is not reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10744-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, with the words ``health care reform,'' \neverybody would expect costs to go down, premiums to level off, and \nmore people being served. But it seems as though the proposals that are \nbefore the Senate are going to increase taxes, cut Medicare, and \nincrease health insurance premiums. I think anybody hearing that would \nsay that is not health care reform or at least not the health care \nreform they expected Congress to pass.\n  So we are here in the Congress, soon about to consider a single bill \nthat will personally affect the lives of every single American. Not \noften do we pass a bill that affects the lives of every single \nAmerican, and not often do we pass a bill that restructures 17 percent \nof the U.S. economy--maybe never before.\n  As one Washington Times editorial pointed out--and I am going to \nquote from it, and it is here for the audience to read:\n\n       [The U.S. health care system] is bigger than Great \n     Britain's entire economy. Imagine five bickering \n     Congressional committees trying to redesign the British \n     economy successfully in just a few weeks. No wonder people \n     are getting nervous.\n\n  It is true, people are getting nervous. As I travel around Iowa, I \nhear a lot of concern about out-of-control government spending and a \nmassive government takeover of our health care system. People are \nworried that health care reform will result in lower quality, less \naccess, and government bureaucrats deciding what health insurance they \ncan or can't have. On top of all of that, Gallup released a poll last \nweek saying 49 percent of Americans believe their personal costs will \nget worse--yes, worse--after health care reform is enacted. The poll \nalso reported that only--and I emphasize ``only''--22 percent actually \nthink costs will go down. Less than one-quarter of the people polled \nactually thought health reform would accomplish its top priority: \nmaking health care more affordable.\n  I can't speak for my colleagues. I don't know what they are hearing \nfrom their constituents. But I know Iowans can't afford to pay more for \nhealth care. Costs are already rising three times faster than the rate \nof inflation. Costs are straining family budgets, and they are making \nit increasingly difficult for employers to offer health insurance.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, and even the Office of the Actuary at the U.S. Department of \nHealth and Human Services have told us what the American people already \nknow: These massive partisan health care reform bills are going to make \nthe problem worse.\n  Let me emphasize for the American people who might be listening that \nthe people at the Congressional Budget Office, the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, and the Office of Actuary at the Department of HHS are \nprofessional, not political. They don't change from time to time when \nthe makeup of Congress changes. They are there over a long period of \ntime studying things in an intellectually honest way to tell it like it \nis. This is what they are saying: These massive partisan health care \nreform bills are going to make the problem worse.\n  So I wish to go to some analyses we have already received from these \nnonpartisan, intellectually honest organizations.\n  According to a September 22 letter from CBO to Chairman Baucus about \nthe Finance Committee bill:\n\n       Premiums in the new insurance exchanges would tend to be \n     higher than the average premiums in the current-law \n     individual market.\n\n  So according to CBO, after these bills spend $1 trillion, many of the \npeople struggling to afford their premiums today will actually end up \nseeing those premiums go up if this bill is enacted. The Congressional \nBudget Office also commented on how the tax increases would also raise \npremiums.\n  During the Finance Committee markup, Senator Cornyn asked this \nquestion:\n\n       Would the new fees on health insurers be passed down to \n     health care consumers?\n\n  Dr. Elmendorf, Director of CBO, responded by saying:\n\n       Our judgment is that, [the new fees] would raise insurance \n     premiums.\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation confirmed that they came to the same \nconclusion during the markup. Mr. Barthold, the director there, said:\n\n       Basic economics is that that fee will be reflected in \n     higher premium costs.\n\n  Let's not forget that these new insurance fees begin next year, in \nthe year 2010, 3 years before any of the reforms in the bill take \neffect. So it is irrefutable that premiums will go up for every single \nAmerican starting next year as a result of a bill that came out of the \nSenate Finance Committee.\n  The Office of the Actuary with the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services--another nonpartisan, highly regarded set of expert \nanalysts, by the way--has also looked at some of the Democratic health \nreform proposals.\n  In a memo released on October 21, the Department of Health and Human \nServices, Office of Actuary, provided an analysis of House bill H.R. \n3200. In the memo, the Health and Human Services actuary writes that \nthe House bill does bend the growth curve, meaning the inflationary \nincrease in health care costs. Of course, a top priority for Congress \nand the White House was to bend that curve. Unfortunately, the chief \nactuary says the Democratic leadership and the White House have failed \nto tell the American public it bends the curve in the wrong direction--\nnot downward but upward.\n\n[[Page S10745]]\n\n  According to the HHS memo, health care spending would actually \nincrease if the House bill became law. The actuary writes it this way:\n\n       In the aggregate, we estimate that for calendar years 2010 \n     to 2019, national health expenditures would increase by $750 \n     billion, or 2.1 percent, over the updated baseline \n     projection.\n\n  While some of the supporters of these partisan bills may not want to \ntell their constituents, we all know that as national spending on \nhealth care increases, American families will bear a burden through \nincreased health insurance premiums.\n  Let me be very clear. As a result of the pending health care \nproposals, most Americans will pay higher premiums for health \ninsurance.\n  Some of my colleagues will try to refute this claim by mentioning the \ntaxpayer-funded subsidies included in these health care bills. It is \ninteresting that they don't even try to deny, in the process of talking \nabout taxpayer-funded subsidies, that premiums will still go up. They \ndon't deny that. They just say the government--or let's say the \ntaxpayers--are going to pick up the tab.\n  It is true the proposals we have seen so far include about $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in cuts to Medicare and massive tax increases to pay for this \nnew entitlement program. But once again, some of my colleagues fail to \nmention that most Americans would not qualify for these subsidies. Most \nAmericans--about 160 million--get their health care through their \nemployer.\n  But if you are one of those people who get their health care through \nan employer, you don't qualify for any subsidy until you spend 10 \npercent of your income on health care premiums.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 7 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. The other side plans to throw much of your hard-earned \ndollars at it to make premiums appear affordable. But even with their \n$1 trillion in spending, the Congressional Budget Office has confirmed \nthat in 2019 only about 7 percent of those insured will be getting \ngovernment subsidies.\n  So even though there will be a huge new taxpayer-funded subsidy \nprogram to help pay for these premium increases, most people would not \nactually qualify for any of that help. They will just be stuck with \nhigher taxes--yes, higher taxes--less choices--yes, less choices--and \nhigher health insurance premiums.\n  Some people may wonder what parts of the bill are driving up these \ncosts. We have already identified the new insurance fee.\n  One analyst of the Federal policy group concluded that the insurance \nfee alone could raise premiums up to $500 per year per family. Then \nthere are the new benefit requirements.\n  Under the proposals we have seen so far, the Federal Government is \nnow defining what kind of insurance you can buy anywhere in the United \nStates. This means it will be illegal for insurers to sell or for you \nto buy many of the policies people are currently enrolled in.\n  By law, it will be illegal to buy policies that don't meet an \nactuarial value of 65 percent and cover a long list of mandated \nbenefits.\n  The consulting firm Oliver Wyman has said that since this new Federal \nminimum standard is higher than many of the policies sold today, new \nenrollees will have to pay about 10 percent more to meet the new \ngovernment benefit standard.\n  This is just under the Finance Committee bill. That 10-percent \nincrease in premiums would be much higher under any of the House bills \nand the Senate HELP Committee proposals.\n  Once again, the other side of the aisle will point to a \ngrandfathering policy that, as the President has said, will let you \nkeep what you have. But they fail to mention that this grandfathering \npolicy doesn't count if you ever plan to move or, two, your insurer \nstops offering coverage or, three, you want to change your policy to \nadd vision or dental coverage.\n  If you meet any one of those criteria, the promise that you will be \nable to keep what you have doesn't apply to you.\n  Another factor that will drive up premiums is the new age rating \nrules. These rules set limits on the amount premiums can vary between \nyounger and older enrollees.\n  Some of the proposals being considered would tighten this variation \nso much it will drive up premiums by almost 70 percent for younger, \nhealthier enrollees. So all those so-called young invincibles we need \nto get into the health insurance pool, all the recent college \ngraduates, will be hit hardest by the increase in premiums because of \nthe proposed market reforms.\n  Taking all these factors into account, Oliver Wyman actuaries also \nconcluded that individuals would pay as much as 73 percent more as a \nresult of the policies in the Finance Committee bill. Small businesses \ncould face about a 20-percent increase, which will lead to about 2.5 \nmillion less people getting coverage through their small business.\n  We can certainly debate all these numbers. Some may question whether \nrates will increase by that much. I am sure some will question the \nsources of these studies, although I should note we didn't take these \nestimates at face value. In fact, ever since the Gang of 6 meetings, we \nhave had some of the best independent actuaries and insurance experts \nanalyzing this data.\n  But even the people who want to debate the sources do not deny the \nfact that health insurance premiums will go up as a result of the bills \nwe are considering. I am beginning to understand the game. I am \nactually beginning to wonder if the reason no one is denying it is \nbecause this is intentional.\n  If these bills drive up premiums in the private market, it is going \nto make it a lot easier to push for a government-run insurance program \nor a new entitlement program.\n  A Washington Post story over the weekend reinforced this concern:\n\n       [Senator] Reid's original inclination was to leave the \n     public option out of the final bill . . . but his liberal \n     colleagues began urging him two weeks ago to reconsider, \n     after insurance industry forecasts that premiums would rise \n     sharply under the Finance Committee bill.\n\n  Let's hope the Democratic leadership and the White House aren't \nwilling to push a bill that forces 200 million people to pay higher \npremiums unless they enroll in a new government entitlement insurance \nprogram. But that is certainly what it sounds like.\n  Whatever the motive may be, the facts are undeniable. Health \ninsurance premiums will increase for every individual and small \nbusiness as early as next year as a result of the pending health bills. \nIt will hit young, healthy people the hardest. It will cause small \nbusiness to stop offering health insurance premiums. We have heard it \nfrom Joint Tax, we have heard it from CBO, and we have heard it from \nthe Office of the Actuary within the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services.\n  I wish to make sure all the American people hear it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, this health plan being forced on America \nunder phony, tight timelines bites off too much, fails to deliver on \npromises, and passes the costs on to hard-working Americans.\n  When the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance \nhear the term ``health care reform,'' they expect Washington to do \nsomething that lowers the cost of their health insurance premiums. That \nreaction should not be surprising, since the President and \ncongressional leaders have explicitly promised that reform would lower \nhealth care costs to the average American family.\n  Unfortunately, the bills Congress has developed will do the exact \nopposite. These bills will increase health care costs.\n  Several recent reports have highlighted what I and some of my \ncolleagues have been saying for months. The combination of increased \ntaxes, expensive mandates, and new regulations in these bills will \nactually increase the cost of health care for most Americans. \nUnemployment is higher than it has been in decades. The housing market \nis in distress. There is an out-of-control Federal debt and deficit. \nMore and more middle-class Americans are feeling squeezed by \nirresponsible decisions being made here in Washington. Unfortunately, \nthe health care\n\n[[Page S10746]]\n\nbill being put together by the majority leader behind closed doors--and \nnot on the Web yet--is another example of irresponsible policies.\n  It is important for the American people to understand how these bills \nwill actually increase their health care costs. I wish to highlight 10 \nspecific ways these bills will increase premiums for Americans and \nindividuals. Taken together, these provisions will increase costs, they \nwill stifle competition, and they will take choices away from families, \nindividual Americans, and small businesses.\n  Here are the top 10 ways the bills before Congress increase health \ncare costs:\n  No. 1, the two committee bills rely on taxing the young to pay for \nthe old is what the number crunchers call adjusted community rating. \nThis means the premium charged to a healthy 22-year-old will have to \nincrease to be much closer to the premiums charged to someone who is \nmuch older and sicker. This means young people will pay a lot more for \nhealth insurance premiums than they do today.\n  Over 40 percent of the uninsured are between the ages of 18 and 34, \nthe same age group that will be hit the hardest, with the highest price \nincreases, if this bill passes. Experts estimate that in most States, \npremiums for the youngest 30 percent of the population will increase by \n69 percent under the tight age bands being considered in one of the \nSenate bills. These extreme price increases will force the young and \nhealthy out of the market. Most young people will probably do the math \nand decide, let's see, I can pay the $750-a-year tax penalty rather \nthan pay $5,000 a year more for health insurance. If they get sick \nlater, they can enroll in health insurance later.\n  No. 2, premiums will increase because of the new federally mandated \nrequirements on health plans. The bill will mandate that most health \ncare plans have to meet new, higher specified actuarial values. If you \ndon't know the term ``actuarial value,'' you are not alone. Let me put \nthis as simply as I can. Actuarial value is a technical term that \ndescribes the amount of total health care spending that is paid for by \nthe health plan; in other words, all the benefits and enrollee cost-\nsharing provisions a health care plan covers. Typically, as actuarial \nvalues increase, premiums increase and the cost-sharing requirement \ndecrease. If you are healthy, you cannot opt for lower premiums or for \nhigher copays than your government will tell you or you will pay the \npenalty.\n  The bottom line is, experts estimate that 50 percent of the \nindividual market policies purchased today and about 20 percent of the \npolicies purchased by small businesses today have actuarial values that \nare lower than what the Democrats think you should have, which means \nmillions of Americans will be forced to buy more expensive \nplans. Compliance with these benefit requirements could cause premiums \nfor the new purchasers to increase by about 10 percent for individuals \nand about 3 percent for small businesses. For small businesses, 3 \npercent is a high rate of profit.\n\n  No. 3, premiums will increase because of the new federally mandated \nbenefit packages. All plans must include a long list of benefits \nregardless of what Americans need or want. Why should a 30-year-old \nsingle man be required to pay for ovarian cancer screening? \nAdditionally, at least every year the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices will be required to define and update--perhaps increase--the \ncategories of covered treatments, items, and services.\n  Not surprising, what this will mean is that the list of mandated \nbenefits will inevitably get longer and further increase costs. If \nthese bills are enacted, every disease advocacy group, drug \nmanufacturer, and health care provider will hire more lobbyists to see \nthat all health plans are required to cover their unique diseases, \ntreatments, and procedures.\n  That is no way to run a health care program. I believe consumers \nrather than lobbyists should decide the benefits package that best \nmeets their needs. Otherwise, there will be more mandates and higher \ncosts.\n  If this bill becomes law, I would not be surprised if every plan in \nAmerica is required to cover massages and acupuncture. I am not saying \npeople should not get massages or acupuncture if they want to pay for \nthem, but I don't think all Americans should be required to enroll in a \nplan that covers every single benefit.\n  No. 4, premiums will increase because of new excise taxes on medical \ndevices and drugs. The official scorekeepers at the Congressional \nBudget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation have been clear in \nstating that these taxes will be passed on to patients. That means \nconsumers will see the prices of everything from power wheelchairs to \npacemakers to prescription drugs, such as Prilosec, significantly \nincrease. These price increases will also ultimately increase health \ninsurance premiums for the millions of Americans who already have \nhealth insurance.\n  You don't use any of those? Remember, insurance is spreading the \nrisks so you get to pay, too.\n  No. 5, premiums will increase because of the new excise tax on health \ninsurance providers. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation have said these taxes will be passed on to people \nin the form of higher premiums. This tax alone could raise premiums for \na family by $487 a year.\n  No. 6, premiums for health insurance will increase when 14 million \nmore Americans are enrolled in the Medicaid Program. Several studies \nhave highlighted how Medicaid's inadequate payments to doctors and \nhospitals directly increase costs to everybody else by forcing these \nproviders to make up for their losses under Medicaid by shifting those \ncosts on to private purchasers.\n  The current health reform bills include the biggest expansions of the \nMedicaid Program since it was created in 1965, while doing nothing to \naddress Medicaid's inadequate doctor and hospital payment rates. If \nsomeone cannot see a doctor, they do not have insurance. This will mean \nbillions of dollars in additional costs would have to be shifted on to \nindividuals who already have health insurance, thereby driving up their \npremiums. Nearly 40 percent of doctors will not see Medicaid patients \nbecause of the low reimbursement rates.\n  As I said, if someone does not see a doctor, they do not have health \ncare.\n  No. 7, premiums will increase for so-called Cadillac plans because of \nthe new 40-percent excise tax. Companies will respond to this new tax \nby shifting the costs on to individuals who are the insured or by \nreducing the value of the health care benefits they provide. \nEventually, this tax will start hitting the Chevys and the Buicks, not \njust the Cadillacs.\n  Experts estimate that in many metropolitan areas the lowest option \nbronze plan--that is what we require--under the Finance Committee bill \nwill be considered a so-called Cadillac plan as early as 2016. This \ndoes not even go into effect until 2013.\n  No. 8, premiums will increase because of the new fee to sell plans in \nthe mandated exchanges. The Congressional Budget Office estimates plans \nwould have to pay a surcharge to sell on the exchange, which would add \nabout 3 percent to premiums.\n  No. 9, premiums will increase because of the new reinsurance program. \nThis new program will cost Americans $20 billion, and those costs will \nbe passed on to someone, most like the healthy enrollees.\n  No. 10, premiums will increase because of the new tax for comparative \neffectiveness research. Washington bureaucrats will tax patients so the \ngovernment can decide which treatments are acceptable and which \ntreatments are denied. Rationing? We have seen this story before in \nother countries such as England. We know this will lead to the delay \nand denial of care for our seniors. It is no wonder that a recent \nRasmussen poll noted that 59 percent of our Nation's seniors oppose the \ncurrent legislation.\n  Taken together, the 10 policies I just described will cumulatively \nincrease health insurance premiums for millions of Americans who \ncurrently have health insurance. It is another squeeze on our Nation's \nmiddle class.\n  In my home State of Wyoming, a healthy 35-year-old man can currently \nbuy a high-deductible policy for about $90 a month. The scorekeepers at \nthe Congressional Budget Office estimate the silver plan under the \nFinance Committee bill will be $392 a month.\n\n[[Page S10747]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is only 3 minutes on the \nSenator's time.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask for 3 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. The scorekeepers at the Congressional Budget Office \nestimate the silver plan under the Finance Committee bill will increase \nto $392 a month. That is over a 300-percent increase. None of the folks \nI talked with from Wyoming can afford to pay 300 percent or more for \ntheir health insurance. In another economic time, this policy would be \nbad enough. In today's climate, it is irresponsible.\n  We all agree the health insurance market is broken and needs to be \nfixed. Everyone who wants health insurance should be able to get it, \nand they should not have to spend their hard-earned dollars to get it.\n  No American should be denied health insurance because they have \ncancer, diabetes, acne, or some other preexisting condition. No one \nshould lose their health insurance because they forgot about an old \ninjury when they filled out a form. No one should be denied health \ninsurance, period.\n  These reforms are very important and long overdue. However, we can do \nbetter. These goals should be implemented in a way that drives down \ncosts for the majority of Americans who already have health insurance. \nCongress needs to learn from the experiences of the States that have \nalready enacted these types of reforms. The States did not pass reforms \nwith the goal of increasing costs for a majority of their residents, \nbut that is precisely what has happened over time.\n  We need to enact reforms that will actually reduce costs and make \nhealth insurance more affordable. That is what the American people want \nbut, unfortunately, that is not what the current bills do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to speak for up to 10 minutes in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10747-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10747-S10748]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS\n\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I again rise to urge my colleagues, \nparticularly from the other side, to join us in passing an extension of \nunemployment insurance, to stop blocking a program that is so necessary \nto every person in this country, not just those who are losing jobs but \nthose who are fearful their jobs might be taken away.\n  This is a national issue, an emergency. It requires attention and \naction now, not weeks from now. For the last several weeks, we have \nbeen trying to get an agreement to proceed. Last week, Leader Reid \njustifiably filed the first of what could be three cloture motions that \nsome on the other side would insist we must proceed through until we \ncan enact this important effort and benefit for 15.1 million unemployed \nAmericans.\n  Everyone in Congress, regardless of party affiliation, is concerned \nabout jobs. There is no unemployment crisis just in red States or in \nblue States or in purple States or any color States. This is a \nnationwide problem. It requires a nationwide solution, and one of the \nfirst steps is simply extending unemployment benefits for the people \nwho are running out of these benefits or who may, in fact, lose their \nemployment and need these benefits.\n  We have to create jobs. That is the ultimate solution to the current \neconomic crisis. We must have a sustainable and robust recovery. We are \nreceiving some encouraging signs. It is estimated that when the gross \ndomestic product for this quarter is reported, it will be about 3 \npercent, the first time GDP since the second quarter of 2008. But \npositive GDP is not the answer for people who are looking for work \nunsuccessfully. They need the benefits of extended unemployment \ncompensation.\n  This legislation is very straightforward. It ensures that out-of-work \nAmericans can provide for their families, can stay in their homes, and \ncan maintain a sense of dignity while they continue to search for \nemployment in a very difficult market.\n  Not only is it simply the right thing to do because it demonstrates \nsome degree of recognition of the extraordinarily difficult situation \nfacing so many in this Nation, but unemployment compensation insurance \nhelps to aid the economy. You don't have to be an economist to \nunderstand that getting money to people who will spend it quickly on \nbasic necessities spurs demand and helps prevent further erosion of the \neconomy. Yet my colleagues on the Republican side continue to ignore \nthe urgency of the situation.\n  As stated, last week the distinguished majority leader had to file a \ncloture motion to proceed to the House-passed unemployment insurance \nextension. This is unprecedented.\n  Congress has acted eight times--in 1958, 1961, 1971, 1974, 1982, \n1991, 2002, and 2008--to establish temporary programs that provided \nadditional weeks of unemployment compensation benefits beyond regular \nunemployment compensation and any extended benefits.\n  Let's take a moment to look back at the recent unemployment insurance \nextensions under both Democratic and Republican administrations.\n  President George Herbert Walker Bush signed an unemployment insurance \nbill into law that passed the Senate with near unanimous support. Not \nonce, but twice--in November 1991 and February 1992, when the \nunemployment rate was 7 percent and 7.4 percent, respectively. And we \nare at a much more serious moment in our economic history today than \nthose years ago.\n  In July 1992, President Clinton signed an unemployment insurance bill \ninto law that passed with unanimous support in the Senate. The \nunemployment rate was 7.7 percent.\n  In March and November 1993, President Clinton signed two more bills \ninto law that passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The \nunemployment rate was 7 percent and 6.6 percent, respectively.\n  In the 1980s, President Reagan signed an unemployment insurance bill \ninto law that unanimously passed a majority Republican Senate. The \nunemployment rate was 8.8 percent. Months earlier, it was double \ndigits.\n  These past votes, under Republican and Democratic Presidents and \nmajorities of both parties in the Senate, demonstrate the nonpartisan \nnature of extending unemployment insurance when the economy is weak and \nunemployment is high. It is that simple.\n  In fact, further reinforcing this notion is that the national \nunemployment rate has now risen to 9.8 percent and may not stabilize \nuntil next summer--much higher than the preceding incidents in which, \non a bipartisan basis, under Republican and Democratic Presidents, we \nmoved expeditiously to extend unemployment benefits.\n  Nearly 2 million Americans will exhaust their benefits by the end of \nthe year, but as I speak on the Senate floor, hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans have already exhausted their benefits.\n  Mr. President, 3,800 Rhode Islanders will benefit immediately from a \nFederal extension, a majority of whom have already exhausted their \nbenefits going back, in some cases, several months. Hundreds more in my \nState exhaust their benefits each passing week.\n  So why are the Republicans sidetracking this legislation? Let's take \na look at the list of amendments.\n  We all, as Senators, have a right to propose amendments, but when \nthey are proposed simply to delay and not to constructively advance an \nissue, we have to look very skeptically at the amendments. There is an \namendment concerning ACORN on which we have already voted. This seems \nto be just an attempt to delay not an attempt to responsibly legislate.\n  It is my understanding that Majority Leader Reid has made many offers \nto the other side of the aisle so that the Senate can proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of this critical legislation. It is \ndisappointing these offers have been rejected.\n  This bill is about stabilizing our economy. It is about helping \nAmericans who, through no fault of their\n\n[[Page S10748]]\n\nown, cannot find work. It is about this body, the Senate, taking action \non behalf of people.\n  I urge immediate consideration of this extension. I hope we can pass \nit tonight rather than be forced to another series of pointless and \npolitical cloture motions.\n  I want to briefly mention another proposal related to this issue that \nis important to consider which would help in this terrible crisis of \nunemployment.\n  I have introduced the Keep Americans Working Act to strengthen and \nexpand work share programs. These are programs in which 16 States, at \nthe moment, pay a portion of unemployment benefits if the employer \nkeeps the person on the payroll but reduces their hours to reduce costs \nand continues to pay their benefits--their pension and health care.\n  So far this year, approximately 137,000 layoffs have been averted in \nStates that have this program. We have a breakdown of the 16 States. In \n2008, 58,000 Americans were taking advantage of the work share program. \nThey would work for 3 days a week, for example, and they would be off 2 \ndays. They would receive unemployment compensation pro rata for those 2 \ndays. The employer would keep benefits flowing, in terms of health \ncare. They would have valuable workers not sent away from the firm but \nstill engaged in productive activities.\n  I visited a firm in Rhode Island that has this program. It is wildly \npopular with not only the workers but also with the managers. In Rhode \nIsland, we have jumped from 2,800 last year to 5,400 this year, and it \nis rising.\n\n  When I was at this plant, one of the workers said: This is the only \nway I can keep paying for my mortgage; this is the only way I can keep \npaying for the food we put on the table for our children. And the plant \nmanager said: This is the only way I can keep a valuable worker so I \ncan keep producing. I think it is a program that deserves close \nattention. This program in Rhode Island has helped many people avoid \nbeing completely laid off, and it has also helped the drain on the \nunemployment compensation fund because paying a pro rata share is a \nmuch better deal for the fund than paying the full benefits when \nsomeone is laid off completely.\n  There are 16 States, as indicated here. They rank from Arizona, \nCalifornia, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Massachusetts, \nMaryland, Minnesota, Missouri, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas, \nVermont, and Washington. Again, this program is not a one-State, one-\nregion, one-area program. This is a national program which I hope can \nbe emulated by the other States. It is a win-win, and I hope we can \nmove forward and take up this legislation as a complement to what we \nare proposing in the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  The real key, though, ultimately is to get the jobs flowing again, \nand that is something we have to work on. That is something on which we \nhave made some progress but not sufficient progress. We can't rest \nuntil there is confidence again that throughout this land people have a \njob, they feel confident they can keep it, they can provide for their \nfamilies, and they can contribute to this great Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10748-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10748-S10750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADDRESSING AMERICA'S PRIORITIES\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I wish to commend my colleague from Rhode \nIsland for his statement on the unemployment situation facing our \ncountry and also join in his remarks with some concern and dismay over \nthe opposition of the Republican Senators to extending unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Tens of thousands of people in my home State of Illinois and all \nacross the United States have been unemployed for long periods of time \nand have now reached the end of their eligibility for unemployment \ncompensation. They are still unemployed. They are still trying to keep \ntheir families together, pay the rent, put food on the table, pay for \nsome medical bills, and they need unemployment compensation for that to \ncontinue. So we have proposed extending unemployment compensation \nbenefits--the safety net for America--while they look for jobs and \nwhile this economy starts ever so slowly to turn around.\n  The opposition comes from the Republican side of the aisle. They \noppose extending unemployment compensation benefits. You think: How \ncould they rationalize that in an economy where there are six \nunemployed people for every available job? Their answer is: We have \nother, more important things we want to debate on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  Well, let's take a look at what those are. First, they want to return \nto the debate over an organization known as ACORN. ACORN is an \norganization that has not been in business in Illinois for 8 or 9 \nyears, so I don't know any of the leaders in that organization \npersonally. I can't say that I can recall working with them on any \nmajor issues. But you remember the videos a few weeks ago, those \nalarming videos of some ACORN employees who were apparently conspiring \nwith people on how to break the law. Those employees have been fired, \nas they should have been. They should be investigated, and if they are \nguilty of criminal activity, they should be prosecuted. That is clear. \nBut that is not enough for those who listen to the rightwing cable and \nTV shows. There has to be more.\n  Well, I have called for a full investigation of ACORN. I want the \nGovernment Accountability Office to find what Federal monies have been \nspent with that organization and make sure it was spent honestly and \nspent well. An investigation is appropriate. It is known as due \nprocess. But that is not enough for some on the Republican side of the \naisle.\n  One Senator from Louisiana wants to go further. He wants to offer \nanother amendment to flog ACORN, and he is holding up unemployment \nbenefits in Louisiana and Illinois and across the Nation until he gets \nhis amendment, until he can make his speech, until he can beat on ACORN \nagain. Well, that may be his idea of serving the public need. It is not \nmine. Let's save that debate for another day, if we have to have it at \nall. Let's not make thousands of people in Louisiana and Illinois--\ncurrently unemployed, desperate to keep their families together and a \nroof over the heads of their children--suffer because a Senator here \nwants to debate whether we can think of some new way to punish ACORN. \nYou know, for most people, as President Obama said the other day in an \ninterview, there are many more important things in life than this \norganization and the sorry conduct of a few employees. But for this \nSenator, it is enough to hold up unemployment compensation for \nliterally hundreds of thousands of American people. That is the \nreality.\n  In addition, there is a program called E-Verify. E-Verify is a way to \ntry to establish that a person applying for a job is actually a \ncitizen. They want to use computers, accessed through telephones and \ncomputers, to determine whether the identity and the Social Security \nnumber given to the employer are, in fact, valid or illegal. It has \nbeen a tough program to get up and running. In fact, it is loaded with \nenough uncertainty and error that some question whether we should \npursue it until we have worked out the details. Innocent people were \ncaught up in the E-Verify early days and identified as not being legal \nwhen in fact they were. So what we have done is to extend this program \nfor 3 years while we work out obvious problems with it.\n  One Senator on the other side of the aisle said it is not enough. I \nam going to hold up unemployment benefits, he says, until this program \nis extended permanently. Well, that is a worthy debate and topic, but \nis it worthy enough to deny unemployment compensation benefits to \nthousands of people out of work while we debate whether E-Verify should \nbe extended 3 years or permanently? Doesn't seem to rise to the same \nlevel of importance, in my estimation.\n  That is what is holding up unemployment benefits for hundreds of \nthousands of people--amendments like that from the Republican side of \nthe aisle which, to my way of thinking, don't really measure up to the \ngravity of the issue we are considering.\n  I wish those Senators from the States offering those amendments would \ngo back home and meet some of these unemployed people, maybe sit down \nand buy them a cup of coffee, talk with them about what their lives\n\n[[Page S10749]]\n\nhave been like being out of work for 2 or 3 years, what it means to \nhave no health insurance because you lost your job, folks who have \nexhausted their life savings and now don't know which way to turn. I \nget e-mails and letters every day from them, people across my State. \nAnd these are not folks who have drifted in and out of work; many of \nthem have worked uninterrupted for 25 or 30 years and now find \nthemselves out in the street through no fault of their own. They are \ntrying their darndest to find a job, to improve their skills so they \nare more marketable, and we should give them a helping hand.\n  Incidentally, the money that pays the unemployment compensation \nbenefits comes from a fund to which they contributed. While we work, we \nput a little money away in a fund on the possibility that someday we \nwill be out of work, and if it ever happens, then we are given at least \nenough money to get by while we look for a job, from that same fund. It \nis a basic insurance policy. These folks who are caught up in a tough \nrecession need an extension of their benefits for some additional \nweeks--20 weeks is what our bill provides.\n  So for those who argue that this is some form of welfare, I would \nlike to correct them. These are benefits paid out of funds paid in by \nworkers across America and employers, and it is a fund that needs to be \nexercised right now, to be used right now for their benefit.\n  Mr. President, I am also concerned about some of the debate I have \nheard on the floor this morning from the other side when it comes to \nhealth care reform. I would like to stand here and compare the \nDemocratic proposal for health care reform and the Republican proposal \nfor health care reform. Now, that would be a good debate. But \nunfortunately I can't because there is no Republican proposal for \nhealth care reform.\n  One of the elements of our Democratic approach in the Senate will be \nsomething called opt-out. To put it in a nutshell, we are trying to \ncreate a not-for-profit health insurance company to compete with \nprivate health insurance companies so there will be actual \ncompetition--to keep them honest--and we try to bring costs down. We \nknow private health insurance companies are exempt from antitrust laws. \nThey can fix prices, they can allocate markets, they can jam through \nincreases in premiums, and there is not much you can do about it since \nthere is no competition. So a public option, a not-for-profit health \ninsurance company, would be competitive.\n  There are some who argue against that and say that goes too far. Even \nthough it is not government-run health insurance like single payer--it \nis a not-for-profit option--they say it goes too far. So the Democratic \napproach to health care reform says that individual States can decide \nwhether they want to have a public option available to the people who \nlive there. If the State of Iowa, whose Senator came to the floor this \nmorning, decides they don't like a public option, they can opt out of \nthe public option. It is their choice. Each State can make that choice. \nThat is what opt-out is all about.\n  Opt-out is also what the Republicans' strategy on health care is all \nabout. They have opted out of this debate. Take an example: The Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee considered over 500 amendments \nto health care reform. Among the amendments adopted were 150 Republican \namendments, accepted in the committee. Some were technical, some were \nsubstantive, and in good faith they were debated and agreed to. Once \n150 amendments were added to the health care reform bill in the HELP \nCommittee. The vote was called, and when it was called, not a single \nRepublican Senator would vote in favor of the bill they had just spent \nweeks amending.\n  It turns out there is only one Senator--Senator Olympia Snowe of \nMaine--who joined in the Finance Committee to report out a bill. She is \nthe only Republican Member of Congress, House or Senate, who has \nactually voted for health care reform. All of the other Senators who \nhave come to the floor criticizing what we are putting forward as our \ndraft proposal on health care reform have not voted for it and have not \nproduced an alternative.\n  The need is still there, and the need is very serious. Let me give an \nexample, if I can, about the need in terms of a real-life story back in \nmy State of Illinois.\n  There is a young man named Marcus Evans. Marcus reached a point in \nlife where he couldn't walk upstairs without losing his breath, and he \nknew something wasn't right. He is 17 years old, and he began suffering \nfrom shortness of breath, which kept him out of pickup basketball games \nbut even made it difficult for him to walk around his house. He went \nfrom doctor to doctor trying to figure out the problem, but he was \nuninsured--one of 47 million Americans uninsured.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's 10 minutes has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So Marcus Evans, being uninsured, couldn't find a doctor \nto diagnosis his problem.\n  At the time, Marcus's mom was a working mother of two. She worked as \na part-time dental assistant. She didn't receive health insurance \nthrough her job and her family did not qualify for Medicaid, which is \nhealth insurance for poor people.\n  For 3 years, Marcus tried to get medical care without success. He was \nrepeatedly told that more tests couldn't be done. He was told they were \njust too expensive, and he was basically told nothing was wrong. In \nfact, something was very wrong. Marcus Evans was suffering from t-cell \nlymphoma, a form of cancer that affects the lymph nodes. Do you know \nhow he received the diagnosis? After Marcus's aunt called 911 because \nher nephew literally couldn't breathe, he was rushed to an emergency \nroom where he received, finally, an MRI--his first MRI after years of \nvisits to doctors with no diagnosis. That test revealed a significant \nmalignant tumor pressing on his esophagus, which explained the symptoms \nhe had been complaining about for more than 3 years.\n  Marcus said:\n\n       I nearly died before I got the proper health care. It took \n     a lot for them to actually do the test.\n\n  Well, that is the situation that is familiar to millions of \nAmericans--people who either don't have insurance or don't have much \ninsurance. They are unable to afford health care premiums for \npreventive care out-of-pocket, and it takes a severe complication and a \ntrip to an emergency room before they receive any appropriate medical \ncare. They earn too much money for public aid and too little money to \nafford private health insurance.\n  For Marcus, a disease that could have been caught and treated when he \nwas a high school student went undiagnosed for years as he tried and \nfailed to get quality treatment. Instead of going away to college after \ngraduating from high school, Marcus found himself stuck at home too \nsick and too scared to leave home.\n  Today, after chemotherapy and successful surgery, Marcus is in \nremission and working to put his young life together. His struggles \naren't over. Most of his friends have debts from student loans; Marcus \nowes more than $100,000 in medical bills at the age of 21--$100,000--\neven after the hospital forgave him $40,000 for his hospital stay.\n  Still, he is trying to move forward. He is enrolled as a part-time \nstudent at Chicago State. He has a little job with the city, a job that \nprovides him at least some health insurance. It could have made a \ndifference in his life many years ago.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       I see the difference when you have insurance and when you \n     don't. It's like night and day. When I didn't have insurance, \n     they just pushed me aside.\n\n  Marcus doesn't blame the doctors who told him he was suffering from \nnothing more serious than asthma. He said he understands doctors were \nfaced with an impossible choice caused by our Nation's dysfunctional \nhealth care system.\n  He said:\n\n       Doctors shouldn't have to worry about whether a patient has \n     insurance. No decision should have to be made except let's \n     take care of this person.\n\n  It is simple logic, common sense. That is what health care reform is \nall\n\n[[Page S10750]]\n\nabout, and it poses very fundamental questions for us in this country: \nWho are we? What do we stand for? Are we going to change the current \nsystem?\n  There are those fighting change in the system, and those leading the \nfight are health insurance companies. They are making plenty of money \nunder the current system even though causes such as Marcus Evans' end \nup being untreated, and young men end up suffering as a result of it.\n  That is why this health care debate is so important. I hope at some \npoint, a couple, maybe even three Republican Senators would step up and \nsay: We want to be part of this historic debate. We don't want to stand \non the sidelines and complain about the plays that are being called. We \nwant to be into the actual field of battle to help craft a bipartisan \nbill.\n  So far they have turned us down every step of the way except for one \nSenator, Ms. Snowe of Maine. I hope that can change, and I hope those \nwho come to the floor every day and complain about health care reform \nwill take 1 day to propose their suggestions. What do they want to do? \nIf they want to stick with the current system, if they do not want to \nchange health care as we know it today, have the courage to stand up \nand say just that. But, unfortunately, they have said over and over \nagain: We want to criticize. We want to opt out. We don't want to be \npart of this debate.\n  That doesn't solve the problems our Nation faces.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first let me compliment my colleague from \nIllinois. He is right that the health care system in this country is in \nneed of repair or reform. He is right also about the people who are out \nthere believing they are insured when in fact they are one serious \nillness away from bankruptcy.\n  Ten years ago in Fargo, ND, I met a woman who had $600,000 in the \nbank. She said she had a job, she had health insurance, and she had \nequity in a home. Ten years later it was gone. She has a very serious \nillness. She is a quadriplegic and needs a substantial amount of care, \nand all those assets are gone. She had insurance and all those assets \nare gone because her insurance had a cap.\n  A lot of people don't know that. They say: I have health insurance. \nTheir insurance often has a cap on how much the insurance company will \npay in the aggregate, which means they are just one serious illness \naway from bankruptcy. That is just one among others of the reasons \nthere needs to be some change with respect to the health care issue.\n  I think this will be difficult. I commend the majority leader for \ntrying to put a bill together. It will come to the floor of the Senate. \nWe will have an opportunity to review it and offer amendments, which is \nthe way it should be. My hope is at the end of the day we will be able \nto advance the issue of health care and improve the health care system \nin this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10750-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FEDERAL RESERVE POLICY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted to mention very briefly--and I \nwill speak about this a bit more later--the daily news about the \npayment of very large bonuses by some of the largest financial firms \nthat received TARP funds or other funds from the Federal Government to \ntry to keep them afloat during difficult times last year. The notices \nof the bonuses and profits of those firms at this point are very \ntroubling to me and to a lot of other people.\n  I want to mention that a group of us a while back wrote to the \nFederal Reserve Board asking the Federal Reserve Board to release \ninformation about how much money went out the back door of the Federal \nReserve Board when, for the first time in history, they allowed \ninvestment banks to come to the loan window of the Federal Reserve \nBoard and get direct loans. For the first time in history, last year, \nthey did that.\n  Now the question is, Who got money from the Fed's direct window? \nUnder what conditions did they get that money? How much money did they \nget? A lot of us have asked the Federal Reserve Board to release that \ninformation.\n  Is that information important? It sure is, to me. Are the companies \nthat are now proposing to pay the very large bonuses the same companies \nthat got money out of the direct loan window of the Fed for the first \ntime in history? Probably. What conditions were attached to that money? \nWhat were the rates, if any? We would like to know the specifics.\n  On September 16, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board wrote back \nto us saying that releasing these names would hinder the Fed's \nassistance efforts.\n  That is just a specious argument. The American people's money is put \nat risk. The American people have the right to know how much money went \nout that direct lending window at the Fed. We have a right to know--\nMembers of Congress, the American people have a right to know. The \nFederal Reserve Board is saying we don't have a right to know and they \ndon't intend to tell us.\n  I am going to talk about this a bit more later. There was a related \nFOIA case in which a judge found the Federal Reserve had ``improperly \nwithheld agency records.'' The judge called the Fed's argument that \nborrowers would be hurt if their names were released--the judge says \n``that was conjectural, without evidence of imminent harm.''\n  Despite the fact that the judge has determined that, we still don't \nhave a release of this information. In a news article of a \ncongressional hearing, it said a Federal official said the Fed was \n``giving serious consideration'' to releasing the names of firms that \nreceived assistance.\n  In the same article they quoted Fed General Counsel Scott Alvarez as \nsaying at the hearing:\n\n       We would be happy to work with you to establish procedures \n     for disclosure.\n\n  A few days following that a Bloomberg news article said:\n\n       The Fed had decided to appeal the ruling that had ordered \n     the Fed to release the information.\n\n  The question is, Why does the Fed believe we and the American people \ndo not have a right to know? It makes no sense to me. I am going to \nspeak about this at greater length later, but, clearly, as big bonuses \nare going out the back door, don't we have a right to know how much \nmoney went in the front door from the Federal Reserve to these \ninstitutions? How much, at what rate, and so on? I am going to continue \nto ask these questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10750-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10750]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Irene Cornelia \nBerger, of West Virginia, to be United States District Judge for the \nSouthern District of West Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise to speak on precisely the \nissue the clerk reported. That is something which is extremely \nimportant to me and also extremely important to the people of West \nVirginia, a historic decision we are going to make.\n  Today the Senate will consider the nomination of Judge Irene Berger \nto serve on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West \nVirginia. I have had the pleasure of knowing Judge Berger for many \nyears and having a very high regard for her and liking her very much \nfor many years. I continue to be amazed by her tremendous intellect, \nher calmness--a very marvelous calmness which speaks of integrity and \nknowledge and fearlessness in the face of whatever may come\n\n[[Page S10751]]\n\nup--and, of course, her complete dedication to public service, which I \nwill talk about.\n  She is a phenomenal person and a true professional, which is why I am \nso proud to join with Senator Byrd in recommending her to the President \nfor this judgeship. Without any doubt, Judge Berger is one of the most \nqualified people to serve on the Federal bench. She truly is \nunmatched--in her professionalism and in her experience and in her \ndemeanor--for this position. She has the temperament that should be \nexpected of any judicial nominee, which is not just calmness and the \nright demeanor, but she embraces the courtroom, masters the courtroom. \nShe is in charge of the courtroom. It is a wonderful thing.\n  She is very smart, obviously. She is very fair. She is dispassionate, \nshe is rational, she reaches her decisions in a very calm and \ndeliberative way, showing respect and equal treatment to all claimants \nbefore her in the courtroom.\n  I think it is perhaps, and I would judge, her upbringing that helped \nJudge Berger to be the outstanding person and judge that she is today. \nShe grew up in a very large family in one of the four poorest counties \nin the United States of America. She worked hard, got a good education, \nand ultimately earned her law degree from the West Virginia University \nCollege of Law.\n  Rather than seeking--which would make some sense in view of what she \nhad been through--a high-paying job in a corporate law firm, which \nwould have been hers just for the asking, so to speak, she decided to \ndo what is natural to her, which is to give back to her community and \nto her State by devoting her entire 30-year legal career to serving her \nfellow West Virginians. In so doing, she has gained profound experience \nat nearly every level of our judicial system.\n  She began her career as a legal aid attorney, protecting the rights \nof our State's most vulnerable citizens, and then kept our communities \nsafe by serving for 12 years as a prosecuting attorney in Kanawha \nCounty, WV, which is the county in which I live. She would go on to \nserve briefly as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District \nof West Virginia before being appointed to fill a vacancy as a circuit \njudge for the Thirteenth Judicial Circuit of West Virginia, a position \nshe held for 15 years.\n  As an attorney and a jurist, Judge Berger's hard work and \ndetermination have earned her the unqualified respect of all of her \npeers. Federal judges--everybody has written in saying this is the best \nperson.\n  After her initial appointment to the circuit court, the voters of \nKanawha County, WV--and that was part of why that position in the court \nis different from the one she is now hopefully going to be voted into--\nvoted three times to keep her in that office because of her reputation \nas an honest, thoughtful, and skilled jurist.\n  I think we all agree the Federal judicial system is fundamental to \nour democracy's continued vitality, and there is absolutely no one I \ntrust more than Judge Berger to faithfully and skillfully serve in this \nenormously important role.\n  Those are words, of course, but they are words, in my case, that come \nfrom deep within me. The American people deserve to know when they \nenter the courtroom that their judge is committed to justice and to \nequality and will treat them fairly, and that is exactly the type of \njudge Irene Berger is and will continue to be if we make that possible.\n  She made that clear in her confirmation hearing by saying:\n\n       I want to say very strongly that I will ensure that all \n     parties are treated fairly and equally. They will be heard \n     equally, be they rich or be they poor.\n\n  Judge Berger has also remained an integral part of our community and \nour State. With her uncommon wisdom and insight she assumed leadership \npositions, obviously, within the court system and has been called to \nserve and agreed to serve on a number of boards of nonprofit \norganizations and educational institutions.\n  She's writ large in life in West Virginia, I just have to say that. \nHer honors and awards are many. I almost hesitate to mention them \nbecause that is what everybody does, but it should be said: West \nVirginia College of Law, Outstanding Woman of Law Award; YWCA Woman of \nAchievement; the American Bar Association Foundation Fellowship; West \nVirginia University's Outstanding Alumna; and the NAACP Image Award for \nLeadership, to name just a few.\n  I am perhaps most impressed by Judge Berger's courage and \ndetermination and her refusal to back down from any worthwhile \nchallenge. She was one of the first students to integrate her local \nelementary school in McDowell County. That was not easy. McDowell \nCounty is the most southern county in West Virginia and, in fact, most \nof it is south of Richmond, VA.\n  She is the first in her family to attend college. That can only be \nadmirable. That can only talk about sacrifice and determination in a \nclose family unit, family values. She was the first African-American \nwoman to serve as a circuit court judge in West Virginia.\n  If confirmed today, she would, I proudly say, become the first \nAfrican-American Federal judge in the history of West Virginia. \nGranted, the history of West Virginians is not as long as the history \nof New York. But it goes back to 1863, I would say to the Presiding \nOfficer, and we are very proud of that.\n  I would like to close by personally thanking Judge Berger and her \nfamily. Her dedication to her country and State means so much to me. I \nwish to see her confirmed. I am not a lawyer, but I have been in West \nVirginia a long time. I started as a VISTA volunteer. I know a good \nperson when I see one.\n  Her willingness to assume this important role speaks volumes about \nher character as a person and as a judge. I would like to thank \nPresident Obama for his leadership in nominating Judge Berger for this \nposition. He could not have selected a more qualified person. I cannot \nwait for them to meet.\n  Finally, I would also like to thank Majority Leader Reid, Minority \nLeader McConnell, Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Sessions, and the \nwhole Judiciary Committee for allowing us to move forward on this \ncritical nomination by, I will have to say, a unanimous vote for \nforwarding her nomination.\n  We can rest assured Judge Berger will serve with enormous honor and \ndistinction, as her predecessor, the Honorable David A. Faber, served \nbefore her.\n  I am proud and all West Virginians deserve to be proud and are proud, \neven if they have no idea what is going on right now, as one of our own \npremier legal minds and unwavering leaders continues to serve our \nNation and the cause of justice.\n  I yield the floor, and I ask unanimous consent that all quorum calls \nduring the debate on the Berger nomination be equally charged to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I know time has been reserved for \nMembers to debate the confirmation of a district court judge in West \nVirginia. I certainly support that confirmation. It is interesting that \nthere are not too many Senators coming to talk about this particular \njudge, even though there was a request that we reserve time on the \nfloor in order to debate the nomination.\n  I raise this because there are four nominees ready for confirmation \nto the courts of appeal and six district court judges who are ready for \nconfirmation, having been moved through the committee, who, for some \nreason, Republicans are now not allowing us to bring to the floor for \nconfirmation. This is a deliberate effort to try to slow pace of the \nconfirmation process of Federal judges appointed by President Obama.\n  I think this is wrong, and people should understand it. In my own \ncircumstance in Maryland, we have a judge who has been approved by the \ncommittee for the circuit court of appeals, Judge Andre Davis. A \nhearing took place in April of this year. The Judiciary Committee \nreported out his confirmation by an affirmative vote of 16 to 3. This \nis clearly a nonpartisan\n\n[[Page S10752]]\n\nrecommendation. Judge Davis is highly respected by members of the bar \nin Maryland. He has 22 years' experience as a district court judge. He \nhas handled all types of cases. He has been recommended as being fair \nand evenhanded and is ideally suited to serve on the appellate court. \nHe will add diversity to the court, being the third African American, \nwhen he is confirmed, and he will be confirmed. There have been \nanonymous holds put on appellate court judges on a rotating basis and, \nin some cases, on district court judges, in an effort to slow down the \nprocess.\n  When we get a chance to vote on his confirmation, whether it requires \na cloture vote or not, he will be overwhelmingly approved, as he should \nbe. He is well qualified to serve on the appellate court.\n  I am somewhat perplexed. Floor time is valuable. Time has been set \naside now to talk about the confirmation of a West Virginia district \ncourt judge. Yet I don't see too many Members rushing down to speak. \nWhy haven't we brought up the other six district court judges ready for \naction? Why haven't we brought up the four appellate judges, if there \nis a desire to debate, so we have time now. Let's debate the issue. If \nthere is a need for a vote, let's determine how much time is necessary \nand then let's get a vote. If there is a sincere effort to filibuster, \nwhich I find regrettable, then notify the leadership. Let's schedule a \ncloture vote on these nominations.\n  The bottom line is, this is an abuse of the rights of an individual \nMember of the Senate, and certainly it is wrong for us to hold up the \nconfirmation of judges who are prepared to take on this public \nresponsibility. There is a bill pending that would create new judges. \nWhy don't we fill the current vacancies? Why don't we get these \nappointments to the floor and vote on their confirmations?\n  I know in Maryland there is strong support for Judge Davis's \nconfirmation. I hope we can work out arrangements and bring these \nnominations forward and carry out our responsibilities to vote up or \ndown those who are nominated to serve on the Federal bench.\n  I know there have been accusations made back and forth. I opposed \nseveral of President Bush's nominees to the court. In each case, I made \nit clear I was prepared to vote at any time. I never delayed \nconsideration of those appointments, including those to the appellate \ncourt. They were brought forward, and we voted them up or down. All I \nam saying to my Republican friends is let's bring these nominations to \nthe floor of the Senate; let's get a chance to vote on these \nnominations; let's not schedule time to talk about a district court \njudge and that person's confirmation, when in reality there has been \nvery little interest shown in coming forward.\n  I see the distinguished ranking member of the Judiciary Committee. He \nhas been fair and has tried to work this out. I don't know what the \nissue is on his side on an individual Member objecting to other judges \ncoming forward. I hope we will have a chance to bring forward other \nnominations so we may move forward with one of the principal \nresponsibilities of a Senator, to act in the confirmation of Federal \njudges, to give advice and consent to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I rise to speak on President Obama's \nnominee to the district court for the Southern District of West \nVirginia, Judge Irene Cornelia Berger. The historic significance of her \nnomination should not be lost on anyone. If confirmed, she will be the \nfirst African American to serve on the Federal bench in the State of \nWest Virginia. She has had a distinguished career. She has been a State \njudge for the last 15 years. Before that, she was a State prosecutor \nfor 12 years and a lawyer for the Legal Aid Society. I enjoyed the \ndialogue we had during her confirmation hearing and was especially \npleased to see her responses to the questions for the record. She \nindicated in those answers outright that she did not agree with the \nempathy standard President Obama has used, saying:\n\n       A judge should apply the law to the facts of a case without \n     being influenced by sympathy or empathy.\n\n  She further stated that it is never proper for a judge to indulge his \nor her own sense of empathy in deciding what the law means. I \nwholeheartedly agree and am pleased to be able to support her \nnomination. The President's nominations deserve deference, although we \ndo have a constitutional responsibility to examine the nominees, to ask \nthe tough questions, to support them when we can and to oppose them \nwhen that is the appropriate action.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy on the pace of his hearings. Last week, the \ncommittee held its 16th judicial nominations hearing. But I wish to set \nthe record straight about a few things. At this point in his \nPresidency, President Bush had nominated 60 judges, but only 22 \nnominees had hearings. In contrast, President Obama has nominated only \n23 judges, including a Supreme Court nominee, which took a great deal \nof our time, as it rightly should. Yet 16 of his nominees have received \nhearings.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee is doing its job. We are processing \nnominees at a reasonable pace, in a fair and bipartisan manner. There \nare those who say that Republicans are slow-walking nominees. I suggest \nthat is a preemptive accusation to complain about something they think \nmight happen. It is not happening, in my view. The raw numbers show \nthat. Those same individuals also claim that the vacancy rate on the \nFederal courts is higher now and, therefore, we need to confirm more \njudges than we did during President Bush's first 2 years in office. \nHowever, the need to fill vacancies does not undercut the \nresponsibility to properly vet those lifetime appointments.\n  Furthermore, we can only process the nominees we have before us. \nThere are currently 22 circuit court vacancies but only 9 nominees \nbefore the Senate. There are 75 district court vacancies and only 10 \nnominees before the Senate. This chart shows that. These are the \nvacancies in blue and the red represents the circuit court nominees. \nThese are the only the nominations we have received so far. To date, \nPresident Obama has announced a total of only 23 nominees, one of which \nwas a Supreme Court nominee. By this time, the Bush administration had \nsent the Senate 60 nominees, almost three times as many.\n\n  Over the past few weeks, I have heard the chairman of our committee \ncome to the floor and state that the pace of confirmations is not \nacceptable. I wish to point out a few numbers to those who now say \nDemocrats confirmed a significant number of President Bush's nominees. \nAs I told the chairman, I hate to get into this. We have been doing \nthis for a number of years, but I am not going to remain silent while \nthe record is distorted. We need to talk about perspective, and if we \nare going to continue to have tit-for-tat, I will be down here to \nexplain the other side of the question.\n  President Bush had fewer nominees confirmed than any two-term \nPresident in modern history. President Clinton had 377 confirmed; \nPresident Bush only got 326. President Clinton was also able to confirm \ntwo Supreme Court nominees. Under the Bush administration, the \nDemocrats held up qualified nominees for years in some cases, denying \nan up-or-down vote even though a majority of the Senators were ready \nand willing to confirm.\n  There are those who say the Republicans are filibustering nominees, \nand to them, I say that is not correct. A hold is not a filibuster. \nWhen a Member of this body has concerns about a nominee, they have a \nright to put a hold on that nominee. The majority leader has the \nprerogative to file cloture on that nomination. There were nominees \nthat I have strongly opposed and have voted against, but I voted for \ncloture when the majority leader sought to bring up the nomination so \nthe nominee would get an up or down vote. That is the way you overcome \na hold.\n  Madam President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I think most of us in this body who were here remember \nthat soon after President Bush was elected in 2000, a group of well-\nknown liberal professors--Laurence Tribe, Marsha Greenberger, and Cass \nSunstein--he is the one who has recently been appointed by President \nObama to one of his administration posts who believes animals should \nhave\n\n[[Page S10753]]\n\nlawyers appointed for them--met with the Democratic leadership. The New \nYork Times reported at that time that they proposed changing the ground \nrules of the confirmation process. They proposed that Senators consider \na nominee's ideology. For the first time in the history of the country, \nthey proposed that the burden be shifted to the nominee to somehow \nprove they were worthy of the appointment instead of having the Senate \nrespect the presumptive power of the President to make the nomination \nand then object if there was a disagreement. This was a major change in \nthe history of the Senate. It was done by the Democrats when we had a \nRepublican President.\n  It was clear to me then that as a result of that meeting, a majority \nof the Democratic Members of the Senate agreed. After the Democrats \ntook control of the Senate a few months later when Senator Jeffords \nchanged parties, the Senate confirmed only 6 of President Bush's 25 \ncircuit court nominees. Five nominees had bipartisan support, and two \nwere prior Clinton nominees. President Bush renominated two prior \nClinton nominees. They confirmed them, but only a few others were \nconfirmed. Yet the majority of President Bush's first nominees \nnominated on May 9, 2001, waited years for confirmation.\n  Priscilla Owen was nominated to the Fifth Circuit, a fabulous supreme \ncourt justice in Texas. It took 4 years for her to be confirmed. She \nwas on the short list for the Supreme Court. She is a brilliant \njustice.\n  Now-Chief Justice John Roberts was nominated at that time for the DC \nCircuit--one of the most brilliant Justices I have ever seen come \nbefore the Senate. It took two years for him to be confirmed, and he \nhad to go through two hearings.\n  Jeffrey Sutton, another brilliant nominee to the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals, was confirmed but only after 2 years in 2003.\n  Deborah Cook was nominated for the Sixth Circuit--it took 2 years to \nget her nomination confirmed.\n  Dennis Shedd, nominated to the Fourth Circuit--it was a year and a \nhalf before he was confirmed.\n  Michael McConnell, a brilliant lawyer--and so is Dennis Shedd, but \nMcConnell is a real intellectual--for the Tenth Circuit, it took a year \nand a half before he was confirmed.\n  Terrence Boyle waited almost 8 years, until his nomination lapsed at \nthe end of President Bush's term. He never got a vote.\n  Perhaps the most disturbing story was that of Miguel Estrada, who was \na brilliant, outstanding, well-qualified consensus nominee. He was \nnominated to the DC Circuit on May 9, 2001. He waited 16 months just to \nget a hearing--16 months--only to be confronted with unreasonable \nrequests for more information. After almost 2 \\1/2\\ years in limbo and \na protracted 6-month long filibuster battle, we brought his name up a \nnumber of times, and he was blocked by filibuster. Mr. Estrada withdrew \nhis name from further consideration, and we remain baffled as to why \nsuch a fine nominee was treated so poorly. His character was attacked \nand his nomination was ultimately blocked for no reason other than the \nfact that some said he was so capable he would have been on the short \nlist for the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I don't say all of this to say there is going to be payback. I do not \nbelieve in that. It is time for us to move forward with judicial \nnominees in the right way. I am saying this to set the record straight \nbecause I will not stand silent and have what is happening today be \ncompared with the incredibly obstructive actions the Democrats took in \nearly 2000.\n  That said, this Senate, when I think of many of its Members, \nunderstands that it would be wrong for us to be a rubberstamp for every \nnominee. We have a constitutional duty to vet nominees. As a minority \nparty, we have a duty to ask the important questions that may not be \nasked at other points in the process.\n  During his campaign, President Obama pledged he would strive for a \nbipartisan administration, but the President has failed to put action \nbehind those words in a number of instances. He has refused to \nrenominate some of the noncontroversial consensus circuit court \nnominees who were not confirmed by the Senate in the last Congress, as \nPresident Bush did when he took office. For example, Glen Conrad had \nthe support of his Democrat home State Senator. Yet he was never given \na hearing before the end of the Bush administration. Peter Keisler had \nbroad bipartisan support from lawyers and colleagues throughout the \ncountry, a brilliant and capable nominee, but never got a vote. He was \ndenied a vote by the Democratic leadership. In addition, Mr. Keisler \nwas praised in the Justice Department Inspector General's report, one \nthat dealt with the danger of politicizing the Department of Justice. \nThe IG examined it and praised Mr. Keisler because he spoke and acted \nin opposition to those who appeared to have allowed political \nconsiderations to play a role in hiring decisions. He focused on the \ncandidate's qualifications. But rather than being rewarded for his \ncourage, he fell victim to the very partisan wrangling he stood \nagainst.\n  Now, I think President Obama chose to set an aggressive tone by \nnominating Judge David Hamilton, a former board member and vice \npresident for litigation of the Indiana chapter of the ACLU, as his \nfirst circuit court nominee. Judge Hamilton's nomination is clearly \ncontroversial. It was only exacerbated by the rushed hearing schedule \non his nomination. Indeed, I think it is fair to say he is outside the \nmainstream of even President Obama's nominees. Instead of embracing the \nconstitutional standard of jurisprudence, Judge Hamilton has embraced \nthis empathy standard, this feeling standard. Whatever that is, it is \nnot law. It is not a legal standard. He has said that he believes a \njudge will ``reach different decisions from time to time . . . taking \ninto account what happened and its effect on both parties, what are the \npractical consequences.''\n  Judge Hamilton also appears to have embraced the idea of a living \nConstitution. In 2003, he indicated in a speech that a judge's role \nincluded writing footnotes to the Constitution. I am not aware that a \njudge has the power to write footnotes to the Constitution, which has \nbeen ratified by we the people of the United States of America.\n  When Senator Hatch questioned him about these comments in a followup \nquestion, he retreated somewhat but then gave a disturbing answer in \nthe next question about judges amending the Constitution or creating \nnew rights through case law.\n  This judicial philosophy has clearly impacted his rulings. He issued \na number of controversial rulings during his time as a district court \njudge and has been reversed in some very significant cases. So that is \nwhy he is having difficulty on the floor of the Senate and has not \nmoved forward.\n  Yet the Democrats will not call up another nominee, Judge Beverly \nBaldwin Martin for the Eleventh Circuit, on whom everybody is prepared \nto vote.\n  Andre Davis, whom we have heard about before, has been nominated to \nthe Fourth Circuit. We have had a number of battles over the failure to \nfill some of the vacancies on that court. President Bush submitted a \nnumber of nominations and couldn't get them up for a vote. For example, \nJudge Robert Conrad, Judge Glen Conrad, Steve Matthews, and Mr. Rod \nRosenstein. Mr. Rosenstein was nominated to a seat designated as a \njudicial emergency on November 15, 2007--the very seat for which Mr. \nDavis has now been nominated--and he was held up. These vacancies were \nbasically maintained by our Democratic Senators from Maryland for 9 \nyears. The ABA rated Mr. Rosenstein ``unanimous well qualified.'' He \nwas unanimously confirmed as U.S. attorney for the District of \nMaryland. He held several positions in the Department of Justice under \nboth Democrat and Republican administrations. But he waited 414 days \nfor a hearing that never came. His nomination was returned in January \nof this year.\n  In 2008, a Washington Post editorial stated that:\n\n       Blocking Mr. Rosenstein's confirmation hearing . . . would \n     elevate ideology and ego above substance and merit and would \n     unfairly penalize a man who people on both sides of this \n     question agree is well qualified for a judgeship.\n\n  So after a few weeks went by, the Democrats were already blaming the \nRepublicans, saying they are not moving fast enough on Mr. Davis, who \nhas some serious problems in his background, and I just have to say I \nam\n\n[[Page S10754]]\n\nconcerned about it. He has been reversed quite a number of times. But \nhe certainly has had his hearing. He had a hearing 27 days after his \nnomination, and he was voted out of committee on a split vote just 36 \ndays later.\n  There is no question that Mr. Davis is a good man, but his record is \na cause for some concern. He has been reversed by the Fourth Circuit \nnumerous times in cases where he misapplied the law, including six \ncriminal cases where he threw out evidence that could have been used to \nhelp convict a criminal. He was reversed at least six times in cases \nthat he had wrongly dismissed because there remained unresolved issues \nbetween the parties. He dismissed the case in its entirety and the \nparties had to appeal. Six times he was reversed at great expense and \ndelay. If he didn't accurately assess the facts or apply the law in \nthese more simple cases at the Federal trial court level--some of them \nare not so complicated; others are--is he qualified now to be on the \nFourth Circuit? So these are the concerns we have.\n  Mr. Chen, a U.S. magistrate, was recently nominated for the Northern \nDistrict of California. He stated that he finds ``most rewarding . . . \ncontributing to the development of the law via published opinion, \nespecially if it comports with my view of justice.'' That is pretty \nnice if you can develop the law--in other words, make law and make sure \nit comports with your view of the law. A judge is supposed to be a \nneutral umpire. They are not supposed to use their moment on the bench \nto rewrite the law to make it say what they would like it to say. If \nthey would like to write the law, let them run for Congress.\n  Mr. President, Judge Chen made a number of speeches and statements \nabout which I am concerned. I will not go into that today. But these \nare some of the nominees who are going to have some difficulty on the \nSenate floor.\n  Most of the nominees, such as the one on whom we are about to vote, \nwill go through in an expeditious manner. Too often a problem we are \ndealing with is that there is a philosophy out there--I don't think it \nis a legal philosophy but rather nonlegal--that it is legitimate for a \njudge to look outside the law in judging, and that it is legitimate for \ntheir personal policy preferences and those matters to impact their \ndecisionmaking.\n  We are talking about a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench. \nThere is no opportunity to examine the nominees after they have been \nconfirmed. They should demonstrate that they will not render rulings \nthat go beyond the plain meaning of the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair and just say that I intend to support \nthis nominee. I will conclude by saying that those of us in the \nminority intend to give these nominees a fair hearing and to allow the \nmajority of them to have up-or-down votes promptly. But those we think \nshould be objected to will have a difficult time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I know my friend from Alabama mentioned \nthe ongoing issues of filling the judicial vacancies. We can talk about \nindividual cases, and I am more than happy to do that. But I think we \nneed to look at the record, at the number of judges, the number of \nvacancies, and the record during the different administrations.\n  There is a disturbing trend that is developing with the Republicans \nblocking President Obama's confirmations by inaction, by not allowing \nus to, in fact, bring those nominations to the floor for a confirmation \nvote.\n  I am going to use two charts to point out the differences we have \nseen with Republicans using tactics to deny confirmation votes and the \ntime during the years when President Bush made the appointments. During \nthe Clinton years, we saw an increase in the number of vacancies that \ncould not be brought to the floor for a vote. It reached 110 vacancies \nin the judicial branch at the end of the Clinton administration. The \nDemocrats worked with the Republicans during President Bush's years, \nunder times when Republicans were in control and when Democrats were in \ncontrol of Congress. The number went down to 53 percent when President \nBush left office. We are now up to 94. We are seeing a significant \nincrease in the number of unfilled positions. Yet there are \nnoncontroversial nominees who have been approved by the Judiciary \nCommittee who have not been brought to the Senate floor.\n  I will talk about the appellate court because we think it represents \na deliberate effort to slow-walk the confirmation process.\n  When President Clinton was in office, we saw an escalating number of \nappellate court judges who were delayed and not acted upon--doubling \nfrom 16 to 32 when President Clinton left office. We know the appellate \ncourt is where most of the appellate decisions will be made because \nvery few cases go to the Supreme Court. These are critical judges.\n  During President Clinton's years, the Republicans used every tactic \nthey could to deny the confirmation of appellate judges. Look what \nDemocrats did during President Bush, whether in the minority or \nmajority. We not only reduced the number of vacancies on the appellate \ncourt, we brought it down--in 1 case, from 32 to 9. When President \nObama took office, it was 13. It is now up to 21.\n  There are four nominees who have been approved by the committee who \nare ready for action right now on the floor of the Senate. This is an \nabuse of the rights of the minority. We need to vote on these \nconfirmations. The appellate courts need these judges. The district \ncourts need these judges. We have, right now, over 10 judges ready for \na vote on the Senate floor, none of whom I believe will require an \nextraordinary vote because I think they are basically without \ncontroversy.\n  Let's get on with these responsibilities and bring these forward. \nThese facts indicate that clearly there has been a deliberate effort, \nand it is not right. I ask my Republican friends to end this and let's \nbring up these matters for an up-or-down vote.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, as the Senate prepares to debate the \ncritical reform of our Nation's health care system, I am privileged to \nstand at the Massachusetts desk from which the voice--that \nunmistakable, booming voice--of the most effective legislator of our \ntime was heard throughout this Chamber that he loved for nearly a half \ncentury.\n  The voice of Senator Edward M. Kennedy called out against injustice, \ndenial of opportunity, and needless suffering of every kind. Sometimes \nwith humor, sometimes with indignation, he spoke skillfully and \ntirelessly as a champion of working families, the poor, the disabled, \nand those engaged in a constant struggle for economic and social \njustice.\n  Of all the issues on which he led the Senate and our Nation, the one \nTed Kennedy called the cause of his life was the battle for affordable, \nquality health care. He saw the need as universal--made real by \nexperiences deeply personal. He was the father of three children who \nfaced serious illnesses and received the finest health care in the \nworld.\n  He understood firsthand the anguish of a parent who learns that a \nchild is gravely ill. He found it unacceptable that some Americans \nreceive quality health care while millions of others do not.\n  For almost 50 years, his voice thundered in this Chamber and across \nthe Nation with a clear and compelling message: affordable, quality \nhealth care must be a basic right for all, not a privilege for the few.\n  In Senator Kennedy's own maiden speech in this Chamber, he noted the \nconventional wisdom that freshman Senators should be seen and not \nheard. But he felt compelled to speak out on the Civil Rights Act of \n1964 because it was the defining moral issue of that time.\n  As the newest of freshman Senators, who is honored to stand briefly \nin his place, I have no doubt about my obligation to Senator Kennedy, \nto the values and friendship we shared, to the citizens of \nMassachusetts, and to the country we love. So I am grateful for this \nopportunity to speak out at another defining moment for our Nation, on \nwhat I and Senator Kennedy believe to be the moral issue of this time.\n  At this moment, we are closer to realizing the long-held dream that \nall\n\n[[Page S10755]]\n\nAmericans have access to quality, affordable health care than at any \ntime in our Nation's history. By seizing this moment, we will, at long \nlast, put America on equal standing with other nations that long ago \nassured their citizens quality, affordable health care as a matter of \nright.\n  Despite the urging of Republican and Democratic Presidents alike, \nfrom Theodore Roosevelt to Bill Clinton, the United States remains the \nonly industrial Nation that has yet to guarantee health care for all \nits citizens.\n  It has been 40 years since Edward Kennedy gave his first speech on \nthis issue. In an address at the Boston University Medical Center, he \ndeclared the time had come to establish a national plan to provide \naffordable and quality health care for every American.\n  Rough estimates at the time suggested 25 million were without any \ncoverage. Today we have 46 million uninsured Americans.\n  In the four decades since Ted Kennedy issued that challenge, despite \nthe expenditure of trillions of dollars and a passing of a generation, \nmillions of Americans worry each day whether their health insurance \nwill be there for them and for their children. They fear their \ninsurance company will drop them if they are sick or set limits on \ntheir coverage that will leave them destitute. They wonder if their \ninsurance will be adequate and if they are but one serious illness away \nfrom bankruptcy.\n  They ask why insurance companies are permitted to charge higher \npremiums for women than for men. They are afraid, if they lose their \njobs, they will be unable to get new insurance because they have a \npreexisting condition. Worse, tens of millions of our fellow citizens \ngo to bed each night praying their children will stay well because they \nhave no insurance at all. They work hard, they play by the rules, they \ndo everything possible to provide for their families, but they need \nevery penny to put a roof over their heads and food on the table. In \nthe end, they simply cannot afford health insurance.\n  After decades of falling short of the mark, quality, affordable \nhealth care for all Americans is, at long last, within their reach. \nThanks to the leadership of Senator Reid, Senator Dodd, Senator Baucus, \nand others, in combining the bipartisan work of the Health and Finance \nCommittees, and thanks to similar work being done in the House of \nRepresentatives and the leadership and support of President Obama, we \nare closer than ever to fixing our broken health care system.\n  Yes, there are issues yet to be resolved. In the days ahead, I, too, \nwill advocate for a public option because we need to stimulate \ncompetition and reduce costs in the health care marketplace.\n  I will also speak for the so-called CLASS Act, a voluntary, self-\nfunded, self-insured, deficit-reducing plan that will protect millions \nof Americans against the crushing cost of long-term services and \nsupport so necessary in their senior years.\n  But as this debate moves forward, we who are privileged to serve in \nthis historic body, on both sides of the aisle, have the opportunity \nand the obligation to take the long view, to put aside partisan \npolitics and come together to seize this unique and critical moment in \nour history.\n  Bipartisanship works for the people. Only 3 years ago, with Senator \nKennedy's guidance, Democrats and Republicans in Massachusetts worked \ntogether to adopt a health reform plan approved by a Democratic \nlegislature, signed by a Republican Governor, and implemented with \nessential support from a Republican President.\n  The experience of Massachusetts was bipartisan. It has helped to \nshape the legislation this Senate will soon consider. Our national \nlegislation draws ideas from both sides of the aisle and from all parts \nof the political spectrum. Similar to our Massachusetts reform, it will \nmake a lifesaving and cost-saving difference for millions of Americans, \nwhatever their station in life and whatever their political persuasion.\n  It is regrettable that efforts for reform in the Senate and the House \nhave been under assault by special interests that have a financial \nstake in our failing health care system. As part of that opposition, \nthey have attacked the success of our reform in Massachusetts. But let \nme set the record straight.\n  First, because of our bipartisan reforms, less than 3 percent of the \nMassachusetts population is without health insurance today, lower than \nany other State.\n  Second, the most respected independent fiscal watchdog concluded that \nMassachusetts implemented its reform in a fiscally responsible and \nfinancially sustainable way.\n  Third, unlike every other State, employer-based health insurance is \nincreasing in Massachusetts.\n  Finally, according to a recent statewide poll by the Harvard School \nof Public Health, 79 percent of the public, and practitioners in every \nsector of the Massachusetts health care system, including physicians, \nstrongly supports our bipartisan reform.\n  Let me quote a recent message from a Massachusetts doctor:\n\n       You will be glad to know that I just saw the very last \n     uninsured patient in my panel of about 300 patients for whom \n     I am the primary care physician. He is a 62-year-old diabetic \n     electrician from Mattapan. He finally got his insurance last \n     month--with help of [the reform law], we are now finally \n     getting his eye exam, his blood work, and refilling all his \n     prescriptions.\n\n  That is just one example of a substantial difference a bipartisan \nhealth reform measure has made in the lives of the people of the \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts. That is the kind of substantial \ndifference bipartisan reform can make in the lives of people all across \nAmerica.\n  I am the 100th Member, the most junior Member of this distinguished \nbody. But I am hopeful that a newcomer's perspective will be received \nas a constructive contribution to this debate.\n  Let me be candid. At this moment, when American families are \nimperiled by economic hardship and uncertainty, it gives them no \ncomfort to see the Senate so politically polarized over an issue that \nshould be bringing us together on their behalf.\n  The accelerating health care and health costs crises strike fear in \nthe hearts of the average American family. These crises should not be \ndividing this Chamber; they should be uniting us. These crises do not \ndiscriminate in their impact on our constituents. They are the common \nfears of Republicans and Democrats, Independents and the unenrolled, \nold and young, urban and rural, businesses large and small, workers \norganized and unorganized, the self-employed and the unemployed, \nmarried and single, straight and gay, and Americans of every ethnic or \nracial heritage.\n  These are the people we are honored to represent. They expect us to \nwork together in their common interests and, I submit, they deserve no \nless.\n  Years from now, history will look upon this debate and record that \nthis was our opportunity to act on a defining domestic obligation of \nour time. During the coming weeks, I hope each of us will take the long \nview, think beyond the politics of the day, and come together in good \nfaith to do what is right for our people.\n  When I accepted my oath of office a month ago, much was made of my \nbeing the 60th vote for health reform. This debate should not be about \none party reaching 60 votes. It should be about 100 Senators reaching \nout to each other to reform a health care system that will better \nreflect the true values and character of our Nation.\n  As this debate continues, we would do well to pause for a moment to \nhear Ted Kennedy's voice in the quiet of our hearts. You and I know he \nwill urge us to seize this moment to come together in this common cause \nand to make sure, at long last, that all Americans will have access to \nthe quality, affordable health care they have long deserved and now so \nurgently need.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Madam President, I congratulate my colleague from \nMassachusetts, who has made his first comments on the floor of the \nSenate, what is traditionally called a maiden speech, and what for many \nyears a speech that often took months, if not, in some cases, years for \na Senator to make. The times have changed and, indeed, the issues have \nchanged. Now Senators, by custom, address the floor much before that \nkind of time period has elapsed.\n  Let me say I am glad that is the custom, and I am glad my colleague, \nPaul Kirk, is here to share in his ability to\n\n[[Page S10756]]\n\nbe able to present his values and the values of Ted Kennedy and \nMassachusetts to the Senate, with respect to the issue he talked about \ntoday.\n  I cannot say that for many of us who sat here and listened to this, \nas we looked across the Senate at this desk, that there still is not an \nadjustment as we look there and do not see our friend Ted Kennedy but \nsee, instead, the person who has been chosen to follow in his \nfootsteps.\n  I know Ted Kennedy would be both enormously proud and enormously \npleased that Paul Kirk spoke the way he did today and chose to speak as \nhe did about health care.\n  Paul Kirk was in the Senate working for Ted Kennedy in 1969, when Ted \nKennedy first took up the great cause of health care. It was no \naccident that he came to be here working for Ted Kennedy, though it was \nsomewhat of an effort because Paul had chosen to work in the \nPresidential campaign of Robert Kennedy. When Robert Kennedy was \nassassinated, Paul felt there was not a place in politics for him, and \nso he stepped back for a moment. It took Ted Kennedy a considerable \namount of personal persuasion and effort to give him a sense that \nworking in the Senate, working with him was the best way to try to \ncarry on. That was the beginning of an extraordinary working \npartnership. I think Paul worked with Ted Kennedy until about 1977 or \nso in the Senate, but he never stopped working with him as both a \nfriend and an adviser. He went on to become the founder of the \nPresidential Debate Commission. He chaired the Democratic National \nCommittee. He has chaired the Kennedy Library, and now he comes to us \nas an extraordinarily appropriate replacement, to the degree there can \never be a replacement--we all understand the difficulties of that--for \nour friend Ted Kennedy.\n  I thank him for his words today. I thank him for his willingness to \ncome and serve at a difficult time. I thank him for being willing to go \nthrough all the gyrations one has to go through to meet the standards \nof the Ethics Committee of the Senate to serve just, knowingly, for \n4\\1/2\\ months. That is a great statement both about his feelings about \nbeing chosen to fill the seat he fills but also about his commitment to \npublic service.\n  I thank my colleague for his comments about health care. He is \nabsolutely correct; we are on the cusp of a historic choice in this \ncountry, and I think it is more than fitting that Paul Kirk, who knows \nTed Kennedy's staff, who had such a close relationship with him, who \nshares his values so intensely, is here to be part of this vote.\n  He is absolutely correct. While he is the 60th vote, it may change \nsome of our ability to move or not move, the thought he expressed about \nour desire to have all Senators join in this historic moment and weigh \nin, in a way that permits more of them to take part is exactly what the \nSenate is about.\n  I close by saying, as I looked across at Paul, I thought about this \ntransitional moment, of his first speaking and following in the \nfootsteps of Ted Kennedy from that seat and that desk. It reminds all \nof us that we all come and we go here. It gives us a sense of the \ntimelessness, if you will, of this institution. It reminds us that \nwhile we do change and we come and go, this institution is here, the \nCongress is here, the country is here, the demands of the people are \nhere, and good people keep coming here to try to meet those demands and \nlive out the best values for our Nation.\n  I congratulate my colleague for representing Massachusetts so \neffectively, for keeping faith with Ted Kennedy and this institution, \nand helping to remind us of the importance of the work ahead of us in \nthe days ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, next to the door of Senator Kennedy's \nold office--now Senator Kirk's office--is a small brass plaque that \nSenator Kennedy had mounted near the door with an old Gaelic greeting: \nCead Mile Failte--100,000 welcomes. With his first maiden speech on the \nfloor of the Senate, I extend to Senator Kirk, my colleague, \nofficially, Cead Mile Failte, 100,000 welcomes to this great body. The \nfact the Senator would stand and speak to an issue of such enduring \nsignificance, not only to the Nation but to Senator Ted Kennedy, is \nentirely fitting.\n\n  Forty-five years ago, Ted Kennedy gave his maiden speech on the floor \nof the Senate, addressing the moral issue of his time--the issue of \ncivil rights. Over the years, he came to understand the issue of health \ncare is an issue of civil rights. His son, Congressman Patrick Kennedy, \ntells the story when his dad was in the hospital recently recuperating \nfrom cancer, he would walk the wards. We can see him plodding along, \ngoing from room to room, talking to people about how they were doing \nand, more specifically, how they were paying for their medical care.\n  Ted never stopped caring about not only the many people he \nrepresented in Massachusetts and around the Nation but around the \nworld. During the time he served in the Senate, he extended the reach \nof civil rights and opportunity through health care, with Medicaid and \nMedicare and COBRA and children's health insurance and so many other \nthings that he was a part of. I am honored the Senator is here today, \nas he has said, to be the voice and the vote of Senator Edward M. \nKennedy. The question asked is: Will the circle go unbroken? With the \nSenator's speech today, it is clear it is unbroken; that the Senator is \ncarrying on the fine tradition not only of Senator Kennedy but of so \nmany people who were inspired by his words over the years.\n  I congratulate my colleague on his maiden speech on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I simply wish to rise and acknowledge the \nwise words of a good man and a good Senator in the great tradition of \nTed Kennedy.\n  I thank the Senator, for his work, his commitment, and his \ndedication. With his help, we will complete the work Senator Kennedy \nstarted.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10756-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I am very pleased that the Senate will vote \ntoday to confirm West Virginia Circuit Court Judge Irene C. Berger for \na seat on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of West \nVirginia. I thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions for moving \nthe nomination forward. Along with my colleague, Senator Jay \nRockefeller, I was proud to recommend Judge Berger, for she is not only \nan outstanding jurist, she is also an exemplary person. A native of \nBerwind, in McDowell County, WV, Judge Berger has devoted her legal \ncareer to public service in West Virginia.\n  As a young attorney, she provided legal services to those who were \nmost needy. As a prosecutor, Judge Berger obtained many high-profile \nfelony convictions. Judge Berger has served as a circuit judge for the \nThirteenth Judicial Circuit of West Virginia for 15 years--1\\1/2\\ \ndecades--and she has devoted countless hours of service to her \ncommunity.\n  Through her drive and determination, Judge Berger broke barrier after \nbarrier. She was the first in her family to attend college. She was the \nfirst African-American woman to serve as a circuit judge in West \nVirginia. Embodying true mountaineer spirit and pride, Judge Berger's \ncontributions to legal service and to education have been substantial. \nSitting on the bench, she will continue her fine service to her \ncommunity and to the great State of West Virginia.\n\n[[Page S10757]]\n\n  I want to be the first to congratulate Judge Berger, and I thank my \ncolleagues for their support of this very fine lady.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it has taken nearly a month to obtain \nRepublican consent to consider the nomination of Judge Irene Berger to \nthe Southern District of West Virginia. Judge Berger is a consensus \nnominee unanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, the highest \nrating possible. Her nomination has the support of both of West \nVirginia's highly respected Senators. Senator Byrd, as the senior \nmember of the Senate, is the President pro tempore and is the longest \nserving Senator in history. Senator Rockefeller is a senior member and \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee. I thank the Senators from West \nVirginia for their statements in support of the nomination, their work \non this nomination, and their recommendations of outstanding judicial \nnominations for West Virginia over many years.\n  Republican delay in the confirmation of this consensus nominee \ncontinues a pattern that has been followed all year. Last week, the \nSenate was finally allowed to consider the nomination of Roberto A. \nLange to the District of South Dakota. I regret that the Republican \nminority allowed 3 weeks to lapse since the nomination was reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee before allowing the Senate to \nconsider it. They also required 2 hours of debate on the nomination, \nthough they used fewer than 5 minutes to discuss the merits of the \nnominee. In that 5 minutes, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee endorsed the nomination. That nomination had the support of \nboth Senator Johnson and Senator Thune, a member of the Senate \nRepublican leadership. Ultimately, Judge Lange's nomination was \nconfirmed 100 to 0, but only after weeks of unnecessary delay.\n  The pattern is being repeated today with respect to Judge Berger. \nWhen confirmed, Judge Berger will be the first African American in the \nhistory of West Virginia to serve as a Federal judge. For the last 15 \nyears, Judge Berger has served as a circuit judge in county court. \nBefore that, she spent more than a decade as a State and Federal \nprosecutor.\n  So I ask, why has the Republican minority delayed consideration of \nthis experienced and highly qualified jurist and of this historic \nconfirmation for the last several weeks? Will any Republican explain \nwhy there will remain nine other judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the Judiciary Committee on which Senate Republicans \ncontinue to refuse to allow the Senate to proceed? Two were reported in \nJune and have been stalled for more than 4 months.\n  Last week, the Senate also finally confirmed the nomination of Judge \nWilliam Sessions of Vermont to chair the U.S. Sentencing Commission. An \nanonymous, unexplained Republican hold stalled that nomination for more \nthan 5 months. The majority leader was forced to file a cloture \npetition in order to end the obstruction. Cloture petitions were \npreviously required to overcome Republican obstruction on the \nnominations of David Ogden to serve as the Deputy Attorney General and \nTom Perez to serve as the Assistant Attorney General heading the Civil \nRights Division.\n  I said last week before the Senate unanimously confirmed Judge Lange \nthat these delays are a dark mark on the Senate. They prevent us from \ndoing our work. Worse, this obstruction means that nominees must place \ntheir lives on hold for an undetermined amount of time. The Senate \nshould be the conscience of the Nation. These needless and harmful \ndelays, particularly in connection to consensus nominees, make the \nSenate look foolish.\n  Judge Berger's nomination is one of 13 judicial nominations reported \nfavorably by the committee this year to fill circuit and district court \nvacancies on Federal courts around the country. The President has \nworked hard to consult with Republicans and Democrats alike to make \nconsensus, well-qualified selections. Unlike his predecessor, he has \nnot sought to turn judicial nominations into a partisan matter. Ten of \nthese judicial nominations were reported by the Judiciary Committee \nwithout a single dissenting voice. Yet, due to the pattern of \nRepublican delay, this is just the fourth of those nominations allowed \nto be considered by the Senate.\n  It is now October 27. By this date in George W. Bush's first year in \noffice, the Senate had confirmed a total of 12 lower court judges, \nincluding 4 circuit court judges. We achieved those results with a \ncontroversial and confrontational Republican President after a midyear \nchange in the Senate to a Democratic majority, in spite of the attacks \nof September 11, despite the anthrax-laced letters sent to the Senate \nthat closed our offices, and working virtually around the clock on the \nPATRIOT Act. By comparison, this year the Republican minority has \nallowed action on only three judicial nominations to the Federal \ncircuit and district courts, with only one circuit court confirmation \nall year. Judge Berger's confirmation will raise the total judicial \nconfirmations to only one-third of that achieved by this date in 2001.\n  I made sure that President Bush's judicial nominations were treated \nbetter than President Clinton's had been by the Republican Senate \nmajority. By contrast, Senate Republicans are making sure that \nPresident Obama's nominees are treated worse even worse than they \ntreated President Clinton's nominees. By this junction in President \nClinton's first year, the Senate had confirmed twice as many judicial \nnominees as we have this year.\n  This is all despite the fact that President Obama sent nominees to \nthe Senate 2 months earlier than did President Bush. This is despite \nbipartisan support from Republican Senators like Senator Lugar, Senator \nThune, Senator Martinez, Senator Alexander, Senator Chambliss, and \nSenator Isakson for President Obama's judicial nominees to judicial \nvacancies affecting their home States.\n  When I served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first term, I did my best to stop the downward spiral \nthat had affected judicial confirmations. Throughout my chairmanship, I \nmade sure to treat President Bush's judicial nominees better than the \nRepublicans had treated President Clinton's nominees. During the 17 \nmonths I chaired the Judiciary Committee in President Bush's first \nterm, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. At the end of his \nPresidency, although Republicans had chaired the Judiciary Committee \nfor more than half his tenure, more of his judicial nominees were \nconfirmed when I was the chairman than in the more than 4 years when \nRepublicans were in charge.\n  Senate Republicans began this year threatening to filibuster every \njudicial nominee of the new President. They have followed through by \ndragging out, delaying, obstructing, and stalling the process. The \nresult is that 10 months into President's Obama's first term, the \nSenate after today will have confirmed only four of his nominations for \ncircuit and district courts while judicial vacancies skyrocket around \nthe country. After reducing vacancies as low as 43 last year, even \nduring the last year of President Bush's second term and a Presidential \nelection year, vacancies have already more than doubled to 95 vacancies \naround the country in our Federal circuit and district courts. There \nare another 26 future vacancies already announced. These vacancies are \nat near record levels. We can do better. The American people deserve \nbetter. Justice should not be delayed or denied to any American because \nof overburdened courts.\n  When will Senate Republicans allow the Senate to consider the \nnominations of Judge Hamilton to the Seventh Circuit, Judge Davis to \nthe Fourth Circuit, Judge Martin to the Eleventh Circuit, Judge \nGreenaway to the Third Circuit, Judge Honeywell to the Middle District \nof Florida, Judge Nguyen to the Central District of California, Judge \nChen to the Northern District of California, Ms. Gee to the Central \nDistrict of California, and Judge Seeborg to the Northern District of \nCalifornia?\n  President Obama made his first judicial nomination, that of Judge \nDavid Hamilton to the Seventh Circuit, in March, but it has been \nstalled on the Executive Calendar since early June, despite the support \nof the senior Republican in the Senate, Senator Lugar. The nomination \nof Judge Andre Davis to the Fourth Circuit was reported by\n\n[[Page S10758]]\n\nthe Judiciary Committee on June 4 by a vote of 16 to 3, but has yet to \nbe considered by the Senate. The nomination of Judge Beverly Baldwin \nMartin to the Eleventh Circuit has the support of both of Georgia's \nSenators, both Republicans, and was reported unanimously from the \nCommittee by voice vote on September 10 but has yet to be considered or \nscheduled for consideration by the Senate. The nomination of Judge \nJoseph Greenaway to the Third Circuit has the support of both New \nJersey Senators and was reported unanimously from the Committee by \nvoice vote on October 1 but has yet to be considered or scheduled for \nconsideration by the Senate. All of these nominees are well-respected \njudges. All will be confirmed, I believe, if only Republicans would \nconsent to their consideration by the Senate. Instead, the President's \ngood efforts are being snubbed and these nominees stalled for no good \npurpose.\n  The Senate's failure to adhere to its tradition of regularly \nconsidering qualified, noncontroversial nominees has not been limited \nto filling vacancies on the Federal bench. The Republican minority has \nirresponsibly stalled nominations to critical posts in the Department \nof Justice, depriving the President, the Attorney General, and the \ncountry of the leaders needed to head important divisions at the \nJustice Department. These are important leaders of our Federal law \nenforcement efforts. Presidents of both parties, especially newly \nelected ones, are normally accorded greater deference to put in place \nappointees for their administrations.\n  Yet, 10 months in to President Obama's first term, five nominations \nto be Assistant Attorneys General remain stalled on the Senate's \nExecutive Calendar due to Republican opposition and obstruction. These \nare the President's nominees to run 5 of the 11 divisions at the \nJustice Department--nearly half. By comparison, at this point in the \nBush administration the Senate had confirmed nine Assistant Attorneys \nGeneral and only one nomination was pending on the Senate Executive \nCalendar. The difference is that the Republican minority is refusing to \nconsider these nominations.\n  The President nominated Dawn Johnsen to be the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice \nDepartment on February 11. Her nomination has been pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar since March 19. That is the longest pending \nnomination on the calendar by over 2 months. We did not treat President \nBush's first nominee to head the Office of Legal Counsel the same way. \nWe confirmed Jay Bybee to that post only 49 days after he was nominated \nby President Bush and only 5 days after his nomination was reported by \nthe committee.\n  Mary Smith's nomination to be the Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the Tax Division has been pending on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar since June 11--more than 4 months. We confirmed President \nBush's first nomination to that position, Eileen O'Connor, only 57 days \nafter her nomination was made and 1 day after her nomination was \nreported by the committee. Her replacement, Nathan Hochman, was \nconfirmed without delay, just 34 days after his nomination.\n  President Obama's nomination of Ignacia Moreno to be the Assistant \nAttorney General in charge of the Energy and Natural Resources Division \nhas been on the Senate Executive Calendar for over a month, even though \nit was reported by the Judiciary Committee by unanimous consent. By \ncomparison, a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed President \nBush's controversial nomination of Thomas Sansonetti to the position \nonly 1 day after it was reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  Chris Schroeder's nomination to be the Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the Office of Legal Policy has been pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar since July 28. It was reported by voice vote without \na single dissenting voice. President Bush's first nominee to head that \ndivision, Viet Dinh, was confirmed 96 to 1 only 1 month after he was \nnominated and only a week after he his nomination was reported by the \ncommittee. The three nominees to that office that succeeded Mr. Dinh--\nDaniel Bryant, Rachel Brand, and Elisabeth Cook--were each confirmed by \nvoice vote in a shorter time than Professor Schroeder's nomination has \nbeen pending. Ms. Cook was confirmed 13 days after her nomination was \nreported by the committee even though it was the final year of the Bush \nPresidency. By contrast, the majority leader may have to file another \ncloture position in order to overcome Republican obstruction and obtain \nSenate consideration of Professor Schroeder's nomination.\n  Instead of withholding consents and filibustering President Obama's \nnominees, the other side of the aisle should join us in treating them \nfairly. We should not have to fight for months to schedule \nconsideration of the President's judicial nominations and nomination \nfor critical posts in the executive branch.\n  I look forward to congratulating Judge Berger and her family on her \nhistoric confirmation, and I thank the West Virginia Senators for their \nstrong support of the nominee through another extended and unnecessary \ndelay.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Irene Cornelia Berger, of West Virginia, \nto be United States District Judge for the Southern District of West \nVirginia?\n  Mr. HATCH.

Mr. President, currently the Nation's unemployment rate is \nhigher than it has been since 1983. In my home State of Michigan, the \nunemployment rate is 15.3 percent, 5.5 percent higher than the Nation's \nunemployment rate of 9.8 percent. Translated into real people, this \nmeans over 15 million Americans are unemployed, more than 740,000 of \nwhom are living in Michigan. As of October 16, more than 44,000 \nMichiganians have exhausted their much needed unemployment benefits, \nand by the end of this year, the number will rise to almost 100,000 \npeople. Since the beginning of this year, Michigan has been losing on \naverage 27,000 jobs per month. Our people need help.\n  My constituents make a simple request: Please act so our benefits do \nnot run out. These people are eager, even desperate for work. Until the \neconomic recovery that appears to be starting begins creating new jobs, \nthese Americans need our help. They need us to listen. They need us to \nhelp ensure they can still feed and clothe their families and remain in \ntheir homes.\n  Economists tell us that direct payments such as unemployment \ninsurance are also the best, most efficient way to boost economic \nactivity in a downturn. In fact, economists estimate that for every $1 \nwe provide Americans in extended unemployment benefits, we generate \n$1.64 in new economic activity.\n  Michigan's families are waiting. America's workers are waiting. We \nmust pass this legislation extending unemployment benefits. Every day \nthat passes without doing so deepens the pain and suffering of our \npeople.\n  Today's vote on cloture on the unemployment benefits extension is a \ncritical vote for millions of Americans. I hope we rise to the \noccasion. The people of Michigan, the people who so desperately need \nwork and cannot find it are waiting eagerly and hopefully.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, last week I spoke on the floor about the \nurgent need to pass an extension of unemployment insurance that would \nhelp 18,000 people from the State of Washington and millions of \nAmericans across the country. I came here and told the story of three \nWashington State families who have lost their jobs in the most \ndifficult time since the Great Depression and who desperately need the \nsupport that an extension would give them to get back on their feet. \nUnfortunately, despite the hard work of many of my colleagues on the \nfloor, this small measure of financial stability has been delayed to \nfamilies across the country who need it the most, families who right \nnow, as we debate about whether we will get to the bill, are having a \nmuch more agonizing debate at home about how to make next month's rent \nor even next week's grocery budget if their unemployment runs out.\n  For these families, this bill will provide real help. It provides \nevery single unemployed worker who has exhausted his or her benefits, \nregardless of the State they live in, an additional 14 weeks of \nsupport. It extends unemployment to laid off workers in States hardest \nhit by job losses, including my home State of Washington, by 6 weeks. \nIt makes critical changes to help more families, like making sure an \nadditional $25 per week in benefits that Congress included in the \nrecovery act doesn't count against someone who is seeking food stamps.\n  Washington State workers and Americans across the country have been \nhurt through no fault of their own. They are out there every day \nlooking for work. While we are seeing some progress on the economic \nfront, for many of them the job market is still discouraging. \nUnemployment is now at 9.8 percent. That is a 26-year high. Since this \nrecession began back in December of 2007, over 7.4 million people have \nlost their jobs, and the 15 million Americans who are trying to find \njobs are searching for an average of 6.5 months before something comes \nthrough for them.\n  While those statistics clearly point out the need for this \nlegislation, the stories behind those statistics are even more of a \ncall to action. Last week, I told of the stories that have been pouring \ninto my office from people who are unemployed in my home State of \nWashington. These are workers who are not asking for a handout; they \nare just asking for a small measure of support as they work very hard \nto try to get back on their feet. Today, I wish to share a couple more \nstories from the hundreds that have come into my office over the past \nfew days urging me to do everything I can to get this bill passed.\n  I heard from a woman named Loretta Messick. She lives in Auburn, WA. \nShe sent me a message just yesterday. She told me she has been working \nfor more than 25 years, but she was recently laid off for the first \ntime ever in her career. She said she is desperately looking for work, \nbut she is not sure she is going to be able to find any before her \nbenefits run out. She is working with her bank, she told me, to try and \nadjust her mortgage payments, but she told me that if unemployment runs \nout, she fears her family is very much in danger of losing their home.\n\n  Loretta is not alone. I also have a story from a woman named Patricia \nObrist. She lives in Renton, WA. Patricia and her husband both had jobs \nin the construction industry--good jobs, she told me--but they were \nlaid off when business slowed down for the companies they worked for. \nShe told me she has only 8 weeks of unemployment benefits left and \nthen, she said, she is going to have to start dropping expenses such as \nhealth care, the car payment, their mortgage. She asked me for just a \nlittle more time for her to find a job and to give her a chance to \navoid losing everything she has worked so hard for.\n  For Loretta, for Patricia, for their families, and millions more like \nthem, these questions haunt them every day: What will we do if support \nruns out? Where will we go when our savings are exhausted, when the \ncredit card payments can no longer be met? What do we do when the bank \nwill not wait any longer for a mortgage payment? Whom do we turn to?\n  In a time of national crisis, it is our job to make sure we are \nanswering those questions. We can, by helping to provide a bridge to \nfinancial stability. We cannot sit on the sidelines. Doing so would \nonly compound the problems we already face. More families will be \npushed into bankruptcy, more homes will be foreclosed upon, more people \nwill lose their health care, and less progress will then be made on the \nroad to financial recovery for all of us. We can't sit by as working \nfamilies are pushed to the brink by a financial crisis they did not \ncreate but they are paying for.\n  I hope all our colleagues listen to the voices of their constituents \nand join us in passing an unemployment extension that makes sure the \nstruggles of America's laid-off workers are not ignored. This bill \ncould not come at a more crucial time.\n  I wish to point out that these benefits would mean very little if we \ndon't quickly get them into the hands of the people who need it most. \nThe people of our State workforce agencies, people such as the \nEmployment Security Department in my home State, are critical to making \nthat happen. Despite the increasing demand, they have been working \ntirelessly to serve unemployed claimants, and I know this time will not \nbe any different. So I wish to take a second to applaud them for their \nefforts to make sure these funds are distributed as quickly as possible \nto eligible claimants.\n  I appreciate all those who have been working hard to bring the \nunemployment extension bill to the floor of the Senate. I urge us to \nact now. We should not block this with any other efforts,\n\n[[Page S10760]]\n\neven though many of them are important. Our families are struggling. We \ncannot afford to see anybody else lose their health care or their home \nor their car or their financial stability. Let's pass this unemployment \nextension and then move on to continuing the other important work that \ncomes before the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when I am \nfinished speaking the Senator from Illinois be recognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last week, something remarkable happened on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate--bipartisanship broke out. We had a vote \nwhere 40 Republicans were joined by 12 Democrats and 1 Independent to \nvote down a piece of legislation that would have added $250 billion--\n$\\1/4\\ trillion--to the Federal debt. That $\\1/4\\ trillion, with \ninterest, was $300 billion.\n  It was highly anticipated, as we were heading toward that vote, that \nthere would be enough support to pass it. But I think it tells Members \nin the Senate, and probably people around the country, that there is a \ncertain amount of discomfort among Senators when it comes to spending, \nborrowing, and adding to the debt $\\1/4\\ trillion. I think that is \ngood. That is the kind of bipartisanship I wish we had more of in the \nSenate: bipartisanship in the interest of fiscal discipline. Fiscal \nsanity in this country would be a welcome prize for most Americans.\n  As we draw nearer to the next stage of the debate on health care--and \nI would argue that was sort of the first vote on health care reform \nbecause it was a health care-related vote and, frankly, something many \nof us believe needs to be addressed. The physician reimbursement issue \nis an issue Congress deals with on a year-to-year basis. This would \nhave put a 10-year solution in place, but, again, at a cost of $250 \nbillion--$300 billion with interest--and not paid for, borrowed, put on \nthe Federal debt, a Federal debt which is already growing at a record \npace.\n  Last year, the deficit was $1.4 trillion. The deficit this year is \nexpected to be at a comparable range, and every single year, as we \nspend more than we are taking in, we borrow more and more from future \ngenerations. In fact, last year, in fiscal year 2009, which was just \nconcluded, 43 cents out of every dollar that was spent by the Federal \nGovernment was borrowed. Yet we were talking about putting another $\\1/\n4\\ trillion--$300 billion with interest--on that Federal debt with the \nvote that was held last week.\n  So I was very pleased that bipartisanship did break out on the floor \nof the Senate and that we were able to defeat a piece of legislation \nthat, frankly, would have saddled future generations with even more \ndebt than they are already facing.\n  I think the next big issue in the debate over health care, Mr. \nPresident, has to do with whether--in the legislation that is being \nwritten behind closed doors--there is going to be a so-called public \noption, which is the phraseology that has now been adopted to describe \nwhat I would characterize as a government plan, and whether that \ngovernment plan is going to have an opt-in for States, an opt-out for \nStates, or whether it will have a trigger that will take effect \nsomewhere down the road. All these questions, in my mind, belie the \nbasic fundamental fact that what we are talking about is government-run \nhealth care.\n  Whether we have a State opt-in or a State opt-out or some sort of \ntrigger, the conclusion is still the same: we are going to have a \ngovernment plan that will compete with the private health care market \nand the opportunities that are available to most Americans. When you do \nthat, of course, I think you put the competitive marketplace at an \nunfair disadvantage because the government, obviously, will have huge \nadvantages, and eventually over time you will see more and more people \npushed into that government plan, more and more employers will drop \ntheir coverage as people gravitate toward the government plan.\n\n  My point simply is this: Whether you call it a State opt-in or a \nState opt-out or a trigger, a government plan by any other name is \nstill a government plan. What we are talking about is creating a \nmechanism whereby the Federal Government can enter into the marketplace \nand compete against the private sector when it comes to offering health \ncare insurance to people in this country. That, to me, is an \nunacceptable outcome and I hope one that will be defeated.\n  It seems to me at least that the vote last week perhaps is an \nindication that there already is some discomfort developing among \nMembers here, in a bipartisan way, on the direction in which this \nhealth care debate is headed.\n  I think the No. 1 concern most Americans have when it comes to health \ncare reform is the issue of cost. It really is. How are my day-to-day \ncosts for health care going to be impacted by the debate occurring in \nWashington, DC? Is health care reform going to drive that cost down or \nis it going to increase it?\n  What we have questioned consistently with respect to all the \nproposals out there, including the more recent version released by the \nSenate Finance Committee of which we finally got a written copy last \nweek, over 1,500 pages, currently being merged with the Senate HELP \nCommittee legislation--again in a process which is very closed to most \nMembers of the Senate where a handful of people in a room are \ndeveloping this--we hope to see that merged version at some point here \nin the not too distant future and know what it is going to cost because \nI think that is a consideration all of us are going to be following \nvery closely: What is this latest version going to cost?\n  For most Americans, the issue is going to come back to how it impacts \nmy premiums. We have now seen the Congressional Budget Office, we have \nseen the Actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services, we \nhave seen a number of independent studies that have said this is going \nto bend the cost curve up, not down. In other words, you are going to \nsee overall health care costs increase, you are going to see premium \ncosts increase for most Americans.\n  In fact, if you are one of the 185 million Americans who derive their \nhealth insurance through their employer, you are going to see higher \npremiums. There are those who are going to get their insurance through \nan exchange--18 million Americans--for whom subsidies are available. \nBut if you are one of the 185 million Americans who get their health \ncare insurance through their employer, you are not going to be eligible \nfor a subsidy. You are, however, going to be paying the higher taxes \nthat are associated with this and you are going to see your premiums go \nup.\n  The most recent, I guess, analysis of this, which was released last \nweek by the Department of Health and Human Services, by the Chief \nActuary there, suggested that overall spending for health care at the \nend of the 10-year period would be up 2.1 percent. In other words, \ntoday we spend about $1 in every $6 of our entire economy--one-sixth of \nour GDP is spent on health care. In 2019, we will be spending 21.3 \npercent or over one-fifth of our entire economy on health care. So $1 \nout of $5 in our economy is going to pay for health care at the end of \nthat period. What does that mean? It means health care spending is \ngoing to increase by about $750 billion over that period of time. That \nis the wrong direction to go if you are talking about reform.\n  As I said before, most Americans, when they look at how this impacts \nthem, want to know whether health care reform that is being acted on by \nCongress is actually doing something to impact the cost of their health \ncare in a positive way--in other words, that the cost for their \npremiums, their health care premiums, is going down.\n  I say again, based upon all the analysis that has been done with \nrespect to my State of South Dakota, I have seen several studies which \nsuggest that if you buy your insurance in the individual marketplace, \nyou could see your\n\n[[Page S10761]]\n\npremiums go up as much as 47 percent. If you are a family buying in the \nindividual marketplace, you could see your premiums go up as much as 50 \npercent. In fact, there have been some analyses done that suggested \npremiums could go up as much as 73 percent for some people.\n  What does that mean to the average American who is observing this \ndebate? It means not only are you going to see taxes go up--according \nto the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax Committee, the tax \nincreases in the bill are going to hit the middle-income classes the \nhardest. In fact, about 90 percent of the tax burden will be borne by \nthose making less than $200,000 a year. According to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, over 50 percent of the tax burden will be borne \nby those making less than $100,000 a year. The taxes are clearly going \nto hit right at middle-class Americans. If you are a senior over 65, \nyou are going to see significant cuts in Medicare because that is one \nof the ways the new expansion of this program, this new entitlement \nprogram, is financed and paid for. So you are going to see higher \ntaxes, you are going to see cuts to Medicare, and then ironically, as I \nsaid earlier, you are going to see your premiums go up. The average \nAmerican has to be sitting out there asking: What is the whole purpose \nof this exercise?\n  One of the things that has been advocated in the debate over health \ncare reform is we have to cover the people who are not covered. There \nare a lot of Americans who do not have access to health care coverage \ntoday. That could be addressed. There are lots of ways that could be \naddressed, but the way it is proposed to be addressed here actually \nleaves 25 million Americans uncovered. So not only have you raised \ntaxes, cut Medicare, and increased premiums for people who already have \ninsurance, you leave 25 million Americans without health care coverage. \nHow can you, in any stretch of the word, characterize or define that as \nhealth care reform?\n  As the debate gets underway, I hope last week's vote was an \nindication, at least, of the initial stages of this debate; that there \nis some bipartisan support for constraining spending, for fiscal \nresponsibility, and for fiscal discipline; and that as we get into \nthis, we can move away from this discussion about a $2 trillion \nexpansion of the Federal Government financed with tax increases and \nMedicare cuts and premium increases for 185 million Americans who get \ntheir insurance through their employer and start focusing on things \nthat actually would provide greater competition and would bend the cost \ncurve down, would drive costs down for most Americans. We believe that \nis a fair place to start.\n  We think there are things that could be done that would accomplish \nthat, one of which is allowing people to buy insurance across State \nlines, creating a bigger market, a more expansive market for people in \nthis country. Another is to allow people to join larger groups and get \nthe benefit of group purchasing power, small business health plans--\nlegislation voted on a number of times here and always been defeated. \nWe ought to address the issue of medical malpractice reform and \ndefensive medicine, which costs, some estimates are, $100 billion a \nyear in terms of additional spending.\n  There are many solutions that we think make sense that actually do \nget at the issue of cost, which, as I said, is where I think most \nAmericans are concerned about health care reform and where all the \nbills we have seen so far, including the one that was released by the \nSenate Finance Committee, fall short. It doesn't do anything to impact \npremiums, the health care costs for most Americans, at least those \nAmericans who have health insurance; it raises them at the same time it \nraises taxes on working families in this country and cuts Medicare for \nsenior citizens to the tune of $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  If you take a fully implemented 10-year time period for this--bear in \nmind that many of the tax increases in this bill are implemented \nimmediately and the actual other provisions in the bill are implemented \nlater on down the road in 2013. So you see a distorted view of what \nthis bill really costs. The 10-year fully implemented cost is $1.8 \ntrillion, almost $2 trillion. That amount, of course, is financed \nevenly between cuts in Medicare Programs and tax increases on people in \nthis country.\n  I do not think that is what we want to see in terms of reform. It \ncertainly is not what I think the American people are expecting \nCongress to do. They are expecting health care reform that does do \nsomething about getting their costs under control. This bill, the last \nbill we have seen--of course, we have a bill that is being merged now \nbehind these closed doors which we hopefully will see in the near \nfuture--falls short on that account, and that is why I hope there will \nbe strong bipartisan opposition to this legislation, allowing us to \nstart over and in a step-by-step process work in a way that will \nactually impact, in a positive way, the costs most people are paying \nfor insurance in this country by driving the overall cost of health \ncare down rather than up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I applaud the remarks of the Senator from \nSouth Dakota about bipartisan cooperation on health care reform. We \nhave been trying all year, and unfortunately there has only been one \nRepublican Senator, Senator Snowe of Maine, who has voted to report a \nbill from committee; not a single Republican Congressman--none--and no \nother Republican Senator.\n  In fact, when the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \nconsidered this health reform bill--and it is a big one because it \naffects $1 out of $6 in our economy and virtually every American--there \nwere over 500 amendments. Over 150 were offered by the Republican side \nof the aisle and adopted. There were 150 Republican amendments, and not \none single Republican Senator would vote for the bill. That is \nfrustrating.\n  Senator Max Baucus, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, \ndetermined to get bipartisan support, sat down with three Republican \nSenators literally for months--Senator Grassley of Iowa, Senator Enzi \nof Wyoming, and Senator Snowe of Maine--and said: Let's do this \ntogether. Let's do a bipartisan bill. Eventually, one fell off, the \nother fell off, and finally Senator Snowe was the only one who would \nvote for it.\n  I applaud the Senator from South Dakota calling for bipartisanship. \nWe have tried. And the notion that we are going to throw out all we \nhave done and start over--what, another 500 amendments in the HELP \nCommittee? Another 150 Republican amendments, and then they are going \nto vote against the bill?\n  We have a bill moving forward. It is a painful, difficult process, \nand the other side has nothing except criticism. They basically tell us \nwhat is wrong with our bill, and when we ask them: What will you do to \nsignificantly change health care in America, they have nothing. The \ncurrent system is unsustainable. The cost of the current system is \ngoing to break the backs of individuals and families and businesses and \ngovernments.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, the insurance industry told us: If you pass health \ncare reform, we guarantee you we will raise premiums. And they will. \nTrust me, they will. How do I know that? They have done that \nconsistently every year. They just announced a 15-percent increase in \nhealth insurance for next year for businesses. Fewer businesses will be \nable to offer health insurance. How can they say this with certainty? \nYou would say it is like guaranteeing that the price of a certain \ncommodity is going up.\n  What about competition? The fact is, there is little or no \ncompetition in health insurance. First, this is one of two businesses \nin America exempt from antitrust. That means the heads of the insurance \ncompanies selling health insurance can legally sit down together and \ncollude and conspire on the premiums they are going to charge people \nacross America. They can decide how much they will charge and agree \namong themselves that they are going to charge the same thing. And they \ncan allocate markets in America and say, well, this particular market \nin Los Angeles belongs to this health insurance company, this market in \nChicago belongs to this health insurance company, and it is legal--the \nMcCarran-Ferguson law. It is legal.\n  When they threaten to raise health insurance premiums, mark my words,\n\n[[Page S10762]]\n\nthey can do it. The only thing that stops them is competition. If there \nis some other entity out there offering health insurance that is \ncompetitive, at a lower price, then we have competition. What do we \ncall that? The public option.\n  The people who come to the floor and criticize the notion of a public \noption--I have yet to hear the first person come to the floor and \ncriticize Medicare. We created Medicare over 40 years ago and said: If \nyou are over the age of 50, we are going to give you peace of mind. You \nwon't go to the hospital and lose your life savings because of medical \nbills. That is what Medicare is all about. It has worked. Seniors live \nlonger, they get better care, they have their independence, and they \ncan live by themselves longer, which is exactly what they want to do. \nAnd they are not exhausting their savings.\n  When I was a child growing up, it was not unusual for grandma or \ngrandpa to come and move in with you because they reached a point in \ntheir lives where they didn't have anything, and their families brought \nthem into that spare bedroom. It happened in my family and a lot of \nothers. Then came Social Security, then came Medicare, and then came \nindependence, where they could have the kind of independence they enjoy \nand want to have.\n  How many people have come to the floor criticizing the public option \nin government health insurance and calling for the abolition of \nMedicare? None. Not one. Maybe somebody will. I have yet to hear it.\n  I am all for bipartisanship, but I hope we put it in context. If we \nare going to deal with cost, if we are going to make sure Medicare is \nfinancially sound for years to come, if we are going to make sure the \nabuses of the health insurance companies come to an end--whether \npreexisting conditions or caps on payments for medical care--then we \nhave to pass legislation. Merely coming here and saying what is wrong \nwith the existing bill is not enough.\n  There is also a need for bipartisanship when it comes to the \nunemployed in America. Here is something on which you would think we \ncould all basically agree. If you are one of the unfortunate millions \nof Americans out of work, if you have reached the point where you do \nnot have a regular paycheck and you are trying to keep the lights on in \nyour house, trying to pay the rent or the mortgage, put food on the \ntable for your kids and some clothing and basic needs of life, gasoline \nin the car, we have always said in that situation, the American \nfamily--that is all of us, the collective Nation of America--will come \nand help.\n  Unemployment benefits will be the first thing we will help you with \nso you have something, a check, to get by on while you are looking for \nanother job. Sadly, this recession has been very deep and has gone on \nfor a long period of time. Millions of Americans have exhausted their \nunemployment benefits, and we have extended their benefits, realizing \nwe have not turned the corner as we hoped we would, and we still have \nto realize a lot of people will not be able to find jobs quickly.\n  It used to be this was done automatically. We said: Well, we may \nbicker and squabble over economic policy. We may disagree on a lot of \nissues, but we will agree on this issue. The safety net in America \nshould be there for unemployed people. Unfortunately, that has not been \nthe case when it comes to the unemployment benefits we need today.\n  We have tried, more than once, to bring to the floor of the Senate a \nbill to extend unemployment insurance for Americans who are still out \nof work and need help. As I said, it should not be a partisan issue. \nThe unemployment rate is close to 10 percent across the Nation. In many \nareas of the country, including my home State, it is even higher. Each \nday that goes by more people are running out of their benefits.\n  Here is story from a man who has written me from Mt. Vernon, IL, in \nJefferson County, southern Illinois:\n\n       I have been unable to find a job. I have been unemployed \n     since May 2007. My employment benefits exhausted in \n     September. I am 54 years old. I have worked in factories most \n     of my adult life. Therefore I have gone back to school. I \n     still need a job. I realize I am not the only one. Please \n     help us. I have no health care insurance. I have no life \n     insurance since I lost my job. I am praying for our country. \n     God bless you.\n\n  A woman from my hometown in Springfield, IL, writes:\n\n       Mr. Durbin, I lost my job when the economy went south at \n     the end of last summer. I am 54 years old, and at that \n     awkward age, cannot retire, and not as attractive to \n     employers as a younger job candidate, no degree and not \n     enough work years left to pay back a student loan to get a \n     degree. I have two kids. I am trying to help them get through \n     college. I went from earning $30 an hour in telecom to $8.25 \n     hour an hour in retail. Without my unemployment benefits, \n     even my modest house payments are going to become difficult. \n     Can anything be done to move the extension through the \n     Senate? I am down to my last couple of weeks of benefits. I \n     have lots of office skills and experience but cannot quite \n     compete in this tight job market. Thanks for being our voice \n     in the Senate.\n\n  The unemployment rate in Illinois now is 10.5, in Peoria it is 11.1 \npercent, in Decatur it is 12.4 percent, in Kankakee it is 12.8 percent, \nand in Rockford it is 15 percent. Our State is not alone with these \nnumbers.\n  In the 19 days since Republicans in the Senate blocked our move to \npass a strong unemployment insurance extension bill, another 130,000 \nAmericans who cannot find work have lost their benefits. If we did not \npass the extension of unemployment insurance this week, we will put \n200,000 families in a position of not being able to put food on the \ntable. It is that stark. It is that real. Some 20,000 of those families \nlive in my State.\n  How do I explain to my constituents why the Senate has not acted on \nthis bill that we obviously need and need desperately? Well, we cannot \npass it because on the Republican side of the aisle they want to offer \namendments.\n  Do the amendments have anything to do with unemployment or the \npayment of unemployment benefits? No.\n  One amendment from a Senator from Louisiana is to, once again, for \nthe fourth or fifth time in the Senate in the last few months, flog an \norganization known as ACORN. How many times are we going to take up the \ntime in the Senate to go after this organization? I do not know. But as \nlong as it is Exhibit A on rightwing radio and TV, Members will come to \nthe floor and say: Well, let me do something that might be mentioned \ntomorrow on one of these talk shows.\n  Well, that might be an interesting political exercise if it was not \nat the expense of these people who are basically unemployed and running \nout of money. The Senator from Louisiana wants to offer this amendment \nthe fourth or fifth time. By the end of this year, nearly 9,000 \nfamilies in Louisiana will lose unemployment insurance benefits if we \ndo not act; 38,000 families in Alabama; 4,000 families in Kentucky will \nhave lost their benefits during the month of October alone; 5,000 \nfamilies in Arizona will have lost their assistance this month.\n  I would like to believe, at some point, even though we like to give \nspeeches on the floor--and I am doing it right now--that you might step \nback and say: It might be more important that we pass this bill and \nthen give the speech afterward. I hope we can. We should not be \nsurprised families need our help. Unemployment has jumped across \nAmerica. We need to do more than just help Americans find work. We need \nto provide small businesses better access to credit so they can grow \nand create jobs. We need to think about what other incentives we can \nput in place to help all employers, large and small, create jobs. In \nthe meantime, we need to fix the safety net.\n  I would like to ask my colleagues who come to the floor and ask for \nbipartisanship, can we be bipartisan when it comes to unemployment \nbenefits? It is not just the Democrats who are out of work, it is \nDemocrats, Republicans, Independents, folks who do not vote, folks who \ndo not think much of us, and folks who may have thought a little bit \nmore of us before we got into this mess. This is a time for \nbipartisanship. In about an hour we will have a chance to vote. Let's \nhope Members from both sides of the aisle will come forward and stand \nup for these families who are so desperate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this morning we had the first of 3 days of \nhearings we are having on the proposed Kerry-Boxer climate bill. It was \none I never quite had an experience such as that before. Senator Kerry \ncame in, was given 30 minutes to talk about the same thing Al Gore has \nbeen talking about for the last 15 years, without any chance to rebut.\n  What I would like to do is take a few of the statements. It is a very \nconfusing issue we have because we do not have a lot to work with. We \nwere given a draft of a bill with some analysis. I think it was a \ncouple days ago--not time to get into it. But the bottom line is, it is \ngoing to be the same thing, according to the EPA, as the Waxman-Markey \nbill.\n  So what I would like to do is use them interchangeably, since that \nwas the response we got from the EPA when we made a request that we be \ngiven time to get an analysis, an EPA analysis of the bill. I think the \nwords were: You do not need an EPA analysis of the bill because it is \nthe same bill, for all practical purposes, as Waxman-Markey.\n  So that is what we have. I would like to go over it point by point. \nSenator Kerry is correct that cap and trade will impose higher costs in \nthe form of higher prices for electricity and gasoline. I think we do \nknow these costs are there.\n  According to the National Black Chamber of Commerce, the bill--which \nI will refer to as ``the bill,'' it could be Waxman-Markey, it could be \nKerry-Boxer--the bill would increase gas prices by 19 cents a gallon by \n2015, 38 cents a gallon by 2030, 95 cents a gallon by 2050. \nAlso, electricity bills would rise by about 4 to 5 percent in 2020.\n\n  I say this because the head of the National Black Chamber of Commerce \nwas an excellent witness. He brought the point home. Not only is this \nbill--this cap-and-trade bill--expensive, it would be something that \nwould be regressive because the percentage of expendable income by a \npoor person is far greater than a rich person on such things as home \nheating and driving your cars. So his whole point was it was a \nregressive tax.\n  In a recent Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing, Senator \nJeff Sessions asked the government witnesses--the government witnesses \nwere CBO, EPA, EIA, and the CRS--whether anyone disagreed with the \nfinding that the net effect of cap and trade would be to reduce jobs. \nNone did. Again, this morning, most of the witnesses responded in the \nsame way.\n  Then Senator Kerry talked about the NASA scientists. ``The best \nexperts we have,'' he said, ``tell us that the last 10 years have been \nthe hottest in decades on record.''\n  Of course, we know that we have--in fact, just the other day, last \nweek, BBC, which is certainly no friend of skeptics, in their lead \nstory said: What happened to global warming? This headline came out as \na bit of a surprise; so, too, might the fact that the warmest year \nrecorded globally was not 2008 or 2007 but 1998. It went on to say that \nfor the last 11 years, we have not observed any increase in global \ntemperatures. In fact, we have actually had the indication we are \nstarting another cyclical cooling spell.\n  Senator Kerry said: That is why countries of the world, including \nIndia, China, and the United States, have agreed to limit the global \nrise in temperature to just 2 degrees Celsius. In fact, this is not \ntrue. I am sure he thinks it is true or he would not have said it. But \nChina is the world's leading emitter of CO2. India is No. 3. \nIndia has been moving up. We have a quote from the top environmental \nminister in India, whose name is Jairam Ramesh: ``India will not accept \nany emissions reduction target, period.'' He went on to say: ``This is \nnon-negotiable.'' You cannot get any more emphatic than that.\n  At the same time, when you talk about China, they may give you some \nlip service. Let's keep in mind, though, that China is cranking out \ncoal-fired generating plants at two a week right now. So that does not \nshow there is much interest in China to do anything close to what has \nbeen represented. The next statement made was that the pollution \nreduction measures in this bill are tightly focused on maximum impact.\n  Only companies emitting 25,000 tons of carbon each year are covered, \n98 percent of America's businesses. The bill still covers three-\nquarters of America's carbon pollution. So what he is saying is that \nthree-fourths, as near as I can determine, of the carbon that is \nemitted comes from only 2 percent of America's businesses.\n  The fact is, the Kerry-Boxer bill or ``the bill,'' I will say--\nbecause it could be Markey or the same--contains no provision to stop \nthe EPA's endangerment finding, which would trigger a flood of \nregulations under the Clean Air Act. As such, all the sources Senator \nKerry mentions would be covered in some form of regulation under the \nact.\n  Second, Senator Kerry ignores the fact that the sources he mentioned \nwould be severely impacted by higher energy prices, declines in \nproductivity, fewer jobs in the sluggish economy that would arise \nbecause of Kerry-Boxer and Waxman-Markey.\n  I mentioned what the National Black Chamber of Commerce had said \nabout that. I think that should stand. He stated: Third, climate change \nand our dependence on foreign oil are a threat to our national \nsecurity. I agree with that. We are dependent upon foreign countries \nfor our ability to run this machine called America.\n  Unfortunately, this is a very partisan subject because it is the \nDemocrats who insist on having a moratorium on offshore drilling. The \nproblems we are having right now--we have something, and this came out \njust last week. The new report from the Congressional Research Service \nreveals that America's combined recoverable natural gas, oil, and coal \nreserves are the largest on Earth.\n  We keep hearing people say: We do not have these reserves. We do. Far \ngreater than Saudi Arabia's; they are No. 3. No. 4 is China. That is \nnot even talking about including America's immense oil shale and \nmethane hydrate deposits. So we have the largest reserves and the \ncapability, I believe, and I will make this statement and, hopefully, \nsomeone will refute it because I cannot find anything to the contrary; \nthat is, we are the only country that will not develop its own natural \nresources.\n  They say we are dependent on other countries. Well, yes, we are \nbecause politically they will not let us develop our own resources. I \nwould say that between the oil and gas and the coal--and of course we \nare all concerned about nuclear, we want to do everything we can to \novercome the obstacle that such a small percentage of our energy comes \nfrom nuclear. However, that is not going to be here tomorrow. We need \nto start working on that now.\n  I am talking about things where we can get energy produced right in \nthe United States and stop--we could actually stop our dependence on \nforeign oil just by developing our own natural resources.\n  Then Senator Kerry talked about 11 former admirals and high-ranking \ngenerals who issued a seminal report warning that climate change is a \nthreat multiplier.\n  They talk about famines and catastrophes. These assertions, which \nwere first made by Al Gore back when he did his science fiction movie, \nhave all been refuted. Consequently, when I hear 11 former admirals and \ngenerals out of 4,000, if they could only find 11, I think they have a \nproblem.\n  The other thing is the fact that the bills would do virtually nothing \nto stop the pandemics, droughts, floods, and the like. According to an \nanalysis by Chip Knappenberger of Master Resource:\n\n       No matter how the economic and regulatory issues shake out, \n     [Waxman-Markey] will have virtually no impact on the future \n     course of the earth's climate.\n\n  He went on:\n\n       By the year 2050, the Waxman-Markey Climate Bill would \n     result in a global temperature ``savings'' of about 0.05 \n     degrees Celsius.\n\n\n[[Page S10764]]\n\n\n  That reminds me, back in the 1990s we had an analysis by, at that \ntime, one of the top scientists around. This was done by then-Vice \nPresident Al Gore. The guy's name was Tom Wigley, a top scientist. Vice \nPresident Gore gave him the chart. He said: If we were to sign on to \nthe Kyoto Treaty, if we complied with its emissions requirements, how \nmuch would this reduce the temperature in 50 years?\n  The answer was 0.07 degrees Celsius. That is not even measurable. He \ndidn't use that afterwards, but we found the report. Nonetheless it was \nthere, and it is quite obvious.\n  Stop and think about the fact that we have gone through these natural \ncycles year after year. We have the cycles, and they show what we are \ngoing through. It reminds me--and I am old enough to remember--of the \nmiddle 1970s when the same publication, Time magazine, and the rest of \nthem, many of the same scientists said we would have to do something \nabout global cooling because another ice age was coming, and we have to \naddress it.\n  We have to keep in mind there is a lot of money in these statements. \nPeople like to think a disaster is occurring because there is a lot of \nmoney in it.\n  That reminds me of something else said this morning by Senator Kerry. \nHe talked about Duke Energy and others. There are about five major \ncorporations in America that joined a group called CAP USA. These were \ncorporations that came in and said: We are stewards of the environment. \nWe want to do something. We embrace cap and trade.\n  Then we stopped and did an analysis of the five that appeared before \nthe committee only to find that without exception, each one of the \nfive, if we were to have some type of a cap and trade--and it doesn't \nmatter whether it was the Markey bill or the current Kerry-Boxer bill--\nif we were to do that, we know what the results would be because we \nhave gone through this before over and over again. The idea that we \ncould have something like this and not have the problems come has been \ndisproven for a long period.\n  Let's go back to the Kyoto Treaty. We actually have had five debates \non the Senate floor. We had the Kyoto Treaty, then in 2005 the McCain-\nLieberman bill, then the 2003 McCain-Lieberman bill, then the 2008 \nWarner-Lieberman bill. In each case we had analyses done by the Wharton \nSchool of Economics, by MIT, and other groups. They all agreed it would \nbe an expensive proposition. They said it would cost the American \npublic between $300 and $400 billion a year.\n  I know that is difficult for people to understand. How does that \nimpact me? But we do have an analysis that breaks that down. For the \naverage family, it would cost about $2,000 a year. In my State of \nOklahoma, it would be more than that because the price would be higher \nin the central part of the United States than it would be on the east \ncoast or the west coast.\n  The cost is going to be there, and it doesn't seem to make too much \ndifference which of the five different approaches we soundly defeated \nin the past is under consideration. Senator Kerry also claims that \nIndia is working on its own domestic legislation to reduce carbon \npollution. I already read what their top people have said. They have no \nintention of doing it. In fact, I have talked to people who are from \nChina, people who are saying: We are sitting back and are kind of \nhoping maybe America will do this because, if they do, American \nmanufacturers have to go someplace to find their energy.\n  Since we have rationed it in this country, if we should pass such a \ncap-and-trade bill, then that would send more manufacturing jobs to \nplaces where there is no rationing.\n  I appreciate very much Lisa Jackson, the new Director of the EPA. \nSeveral weeks ago--she was there again this morning--she was on the \nwitness stand. I asked a question: If we were to pass one of these \nbills like the Waxman-Markey bill, and we were to pass it unilaterally, \nhow much would that reduce emissions globally?\n  The answer was, it wouldn't. I would go one step further. It will not \nreduce them unless we include Third World countries, the major \nemitters--China, India, Mexico, and these other countries. If we don't \ndo that, then we will chase our manufacturing bases where there are no \nrestrictions, and that would have the effect, common sense would \ndictate, of increasing CO2 emissions.\n  We have gone through this now for 10 years. I think it is going to \ncome to a climax in Copenhagen. Once every year the U.N. has this big \nparty, and they have all these countries come in and say what they are \ngoing to do to try to stop emission of greenhouse gases.\n  I had one--I will not mention his name, but he was from the West \nAfrican country of Benin--who was there the last time I attended one of \nthese conferences. It was in Spain at that time, I believe. Milan, \nItaly. I went up to this individual and I said: You and I have talked \nabout this before. You know there is no relationship between greenhouse \ngases and global warming.\n  He said: Yes, but this is the biggest party of the year. So you are \ngoing to have a lot of people to go to Copenhagen in December who \nreally aren't strongly behind the effort of the United Nations.\n  One last time, it all started with the United Nations, the IPCC, the \nIntergovernmental Climate Change Program. It started there. They are \nthe ones who are perpetrating this thing. As we get into the debate--\nand we will have more hearings tomorrow--I hope we will be in a \nposition, before we send a bill to the floor from the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee, to analyze it.\n  We have called upon the EPA to give us an analysis so that we will \nhave something and we will know more specifically, is this just a \nwarmed-over bill that passed the House, the Waxman-Markey effort, or is \nthis something that is different? According to the EPA, it is about the \nsame. I suggest it is about the same as it was back in 2005, 2003, and \nback during the Kyoto discussion.\n  We will move forward. We have seen certain incontrovertible truths \nthat have come up. One is there is no question that if something like \nthis is passed, something like the draft form we are discussing and \nhaving hearings on right now, if this should become a reality it would \nbe the largest tax increase in the history of America. The last large \ntax increase we had was in 1993. It was called the Clinton-Gore tax \nincrease. It increased marginal rates, inheritance taxes, gasoline \ntaxes, capital gains taxes, all the rest. We were pretty outraged at \nthe size of that increase. That was a $32 billion tax increase.\n  According to all the analyses we are looking at now, this would be 10 \ntimes the size of that tax increase.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl be recognized \nwhen I have completed my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, let me respond to my friend in regard to \nthe global climate change bill that was introduced by Senators Kerry \nand Boxer. Today Chairman Boxer started hearings before the Environment \nand Public Works Committee on the climate change bill. I agree with my \ncolleague, we want to make sure we get this right. This is an important \nissue, and we want to take the time necessary to make sure this bill \ndoes what it needs to do.\n  There is a sense of urgency for many reasons. We can look globally at \nwhat is happening with climate change and the impact on the stability \nof countries. We now have climate migrants, those forced out of their \nhomes because of rising sea levels.\n  I don't have to take my colleagues to Asia or Africa or Europe. I can \ntake them to Maryland on the Eastern Shore, Smith Island is \ndisappearing. The residents are concerned as to what is going to happen \nto their homes. I can show them in my own State the urgency of dealing \nwith global climate change by talking to watermen who tell me the \nChesapeake Bay is warming too quickly. As a result, the sea grasses are \nnot surviving and juvenile crabs cannot survive, affecting the \nwaterman's livelihood. There is a sense of urgency for the sake of our \nenvironment, for the sake of America being an international leader on \nthis issue to move forward with global climate change.\n  Let me offer a reason with which I think everyone will agree: We need \nan energy policy that not only allows us\n\n[[Page S10765]]\n\nto lead on the environmental issues but also helps us on the economic \nfront. Clean energy will mean new jobs, good jobs in America. We \ndeveloped the technology for alternative and renewable energy sources. \nLet's keep the jobs in America. These are good jobs. This bill means \nmore jobs in America by investing in technology that other countries \nare now investing more in than America. They understand the future is \ngoing to be in wind power and solar power and, yes, in nuclear power. \nThis bill allows us to move forward so we can keep jobs in America.\n  Lastly, I think everyone will agree that from a strategic point, we \nneed to use less energy and produce more in America. The bill Senator \nKerry has brought forward will help us achieve those goals.\n  I look forward to debating global climate change and energy policy. I \nhope we can come together for the sake of the Nation, for the sake of \nthe future, and develop an energy policy that not only will keep us \nsafe, will not only help our economy, but will be responsible on \ninternational environmental issues and be an international leader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10765-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         UNEMPLOYMENT EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, shortly we will be voting on a cloture \nmotion on the motion to proceed to the unemployment compensation issue. \nSenator Durbin addressed this issue a few minutes ago. I want to \nunderscore how important it is for us to move forward.\n  Yesterday I had the opportunity to visit one of our employment \noffices in Maryland. We have a one-stop location where people looking \nfor work can come and get the services of not only governmental \nagencies but nonprofit agencies to help them find employment. I have \nbeen to these offices in the past in Maryland. I have had a chance to \ntalk to people who are seeking employment.\n  When I walked into that office yesterday, I was shocked to see how \nmany people were there. It was hard to get through the door. People \nwere coming in desperate to try to find jobs because there are no jobs \nout there for them to find. They are desperate to be employed, not only \nfor the sake of having income but for the dignity that comes with \nemployment. We have a problem out there. I think we all understand \nthat.\n  I will give you two people with whom I talked yesterday: Bernice from \nAnne Arundel County, a resident who worked for a mortgage company until \nit went out of business, she has been unemployed since September 2008. \nShe is about ready to lose her UI benefits. She talked about how \ndifficult it was for her to talk about this, how difficult it was for \nher to tell her story. All she wants is a job. She wants the dignity \nand income of a job.\n  Charlene from Baltimore talked about being employed by Business \nManager for Watermark Media. She lost her job in September 2008 when \nthe company went out of business. She is a very qualified individual. \nYet she cannot find employment. Her UI ran out on October 25. Her \nhusband is expected to lose his job this week, and it is possible she \nwill lose her family home.\n  That is what we are talking about, people in our communities who are \nunemployed and cannot find employment. We now know there is about 1.9 \nmillion Americans who will run out of unemployment benefits by the end \nof this year unless we act, unless we take action. That includes about \n25,000 Marylanders who will find themselves without any benefits. \nCurrently, there are over 15 million Americans who are unemployed and \nover 200,000 Marylanders who can't find jobs. We need to act. We need \nto act on behalf of Bernice and Charlene and the literally hundreds of \nthousands of Americans who shortly will be running out of their \nunemployment benefits.\n\n  The bill before us is an extension of an additional 14 weeks of \nbenefits for every State in the country. The original bill that came \nover from the House had a trigger mechanism of 8.5 percent \nunemployment. I brought this chart to show my colleagues why it is \nimportant to extend benefits in every State in this Nation. I think \nMaryland is a typical State.\n  Our unemployment numbers may be a little bit lower than the national \naverage. We are in the 7 percent unemployment rate. But look at the \norange counties in my State of Maryland: Cecil County, 8.6 percent \nunemployment; Caroline County, 8.8 percent unemployment; Dorchester \nCounty, 10.9 percent unemployment; Somerset County, 9.5 percent; \nWashington County, one of the growth counties not far from here, 9.4 \npercent unemployment--some of those people commute to Washington to \nwork--and then Baltimore City, the center of our State, 10.6 percent \nunemployment.\n  I thank the leadership for bringing forward an unemployment \ncompensation proposal to extend benefits that apply to every State \nbecause we need it in Maryland. I could talk about minority \nunemployment and the fact that the African-American unemployment rate \nin this country is around 15 percent. The Latino unemployment rate is \naround 12 percent. There are pockets of unemployment in all of our \nStates that are at extraordinarily high numbers, and that is why we \nneed to extend the unemployment benefits.\n  Let me also point out that these are not benefits that aren't paid \nfor. These are insurance benefits. They are paid for by the current \nworkforce. They pay into a fund so we have money available in a \nrecession to help those who lose their jobs and can't find employment. \nThat is why it is called unemployment insurance benefits. It is there \nfor this circumstance.\n  Is there anyone here who denies that we are not in a tough time if \nyou are looking for a job? We all know that. So now is the time to \nextend unemployment benefits so people have income in order to be able \nto literally survive until our economy can rebound.\n  Let me also point out, I know there are a lot of us who are always \nlooking for bills on which to put amendments. I understand the \nfrustration of some of my colleagues. Here is a bill, it is a tax bill, \nlet's put a provision on it. Quite frankly, I have a few provisions I \nwould like to see enacted into law. This is not the right bill to do it \non. If we put amendments on this bill and let it go back to the House \nwith issues that are unrelated to unemployment compensation, it could \ntake a long time to reconcile those differences.\n  We already have some differences with the House with regard to the \nStates that qualify. Let's reconcile that quickly so that individuals \nsuch as Charlene, who currently are losing their benefits, know soon \nthat they are going to be able to continue to get these unemployment \nbenefits. It is important that we act quickly to get the job done.\n  One last point for my colleagues. This is important. It is the right \nthing to do. It is what government is here for--to help people who are \nliterally out of luck because of no fault of their own but the economy. \nIt is what we are supposed to do as far as the right type of social \nprograms to protect people during tough economic times. But there is a \ntradeoff that helps our economy. This money goes directly back into our \neconomy. Every dollar we pay out in unemployment insurance benefits \nwill come back and have a multiplier effect of more money than we give \nin benefits in helping our economy grow. So this is the right remedy to \nhelp our economy. It is the right thing to do for the 1.9 million \nAmericans who otherwise would lose their benefits by the end of the \nyear.\n  We have a chance in just a few minutes to move this bill forward so \nit can be reconciled with the House quickly, and then we can assure the \npeople of our community that, indeed, we responded and provided the \nappropriate type of relief for those who cannot find employment today.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10765-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10765-S10767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AFGHANISTAN TROOP REQUEST\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I believe it is now time for President Obama \nto move forward with General McChrystal's plan for executing the war in \nAfghanistan and to fully support his troop request.\n  The President has correctly called Afghanistan a ``war of \nnecessity.'' The counterinsurgency strategy that he announced last \nMarch is a good one, and it has been widely accepted. Having read \nGeneral McChrystal's August report, I believe it may represent our only \nchance to successfully implement\n\n[[Page S10766]]\n\nthe March strategy, and it will require the forces that General \nMcChrystal has recommended.\n  There is no reason to delay the decision regarding a troop increase \nuntil after the Afghan election, a point that I will talk about in a \nmoment. Our national security is at stake regardless of the government \nin Kabul. The outcome of the Afghan runoff election on November 7 will \nnot change our mission there. Whether Abdullah or Karzai wins, our \nmission will be the same, and time is not on our side. General \nMcChrystal's August report said we have only 1 year. It is now down to \n10 months, and it will take time to get troops in-country.\n  I want the President to know and the American people to know that \nRepublicans will support the President if he follows through on his \nstrategy and provides General McChrystal with the resources he needs. \nBut this must be done in a timely fashion. The strategy can only \nsucceed if it is implemented within the next 10 months and with the \nresources that have been recommended.\n  The stakes are high in Afghanistan. When President Obama announced \nhis strategy last March, he said:\n\n       If the Afghan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-\n     Qaida to go unchallenged, that country will again be a base \n     for terrorists who want to kill as many of our people as they \n     possibly can.\n\n  Mr. President, he was right. The Afghan people are watching. When I \nwas in Afghanistan this past April and visited with tribal elders in \nKandahar, for example, it was very clear the Afghan people were looking \nto the United States for a commitment to their security. If we can't \nprovide that security to them, they will be forced to make \naccommodations with the Taliban.\n  Pakistan is also under threat, as Secretary Clinton recently pointed \nout. She said:\n\n       The extremists in Pakistan, whatever their titles or \n     whatever their affiliation, are increasingly threatening the \n     authority of the state.\n\n  We all know if nuclear-armed Pakistan were to fall into extremists' \nhands, the world would face a monumental crisis. Moreover, if Pakistan \nsenses a lack of commitment on our part, how long will it be until it \nseeks accommodation with al-Qaida and affiliated terrorist groups?\n  For these reasons, we must not shortchange the mission in \nAfghanistan. General McChrystal was very clear about the need for more \ntroops. In his assessment he said the following:\n\n       ISAF, [the International Security Assistance Force]--\n\n  Of which the United States is a part--\n\n     requires an increase in the total coalition force capability \n     and end strength.\n\n  During an August speech to the Veterans of Foreign Wars, President \nObama made this pledge to our Armed Forces:\n\n       I will give you a clear mission, defined goals, and the \n     equipment and support you need to get the job done. That is \n     my commitment to you.\n\n  Of course, the President can now demonstrate that commitment by \nfollowing the advice of his general and providing the resources that \nhave been requested.\n  What exactly is General McChrystal's plan? Well, I think his \nassessment demonstrates both a thorough understanding of the Afghan \npeople and the enemy we are fighting. He described the situation as:\n\n       Three regional insurgencies [that] have intersected with a \n     dynamic blend of local power struggles in a country damaged \n     by 30 years of conflict.\n\n  Not an easy situation, obviously, and he described the enemy as \nfollows:\n\n       The conflict in Afghanistan can be viewed as a set of \n     related insurgencies, each of which is a complex system with \n     multiple actors and a vast set of interconnecting \n     relationships among those actors. The most important \n     implication of this view is that no element of the conflict \n     can be viewed in isolation.\n\n  In other words, we can't defeat al-Qaida without also addressing its \nsupport networks--the Taliban and the so-called Haqqani groups. These \nare the groups that work with al-Qaida, protect it, and give it a place \nto hide when we attempt to deal with al-Qaida.\n  In order to effectively counter this enemy, General McChrystal \nproposed a comprehensive plan that would effectively implement the \nPresident's strategy--improve the performance of the Afghan security \nforces, prioritize responsible and accountable governance, gain the \ninitiative to reverse the insurgency's momentum, and focus our \nresources on areas where vulnerable populations are the most \nthreatened.\n  One of the key principles of General McChrystal's plan is increasing \nAfghan ownership of its own security. He said in his assessment:\n\n       ISAF, with the Afghan National Security Force, must shift \n     its approach to bring security and normalcy to the people and \n     shield them from insurgent violence, corruption, and \n     coercion, ultimately enabling the Afghan government to gain \n     the trust and confidence of the people while reducing the \n     influence of insurgents.\n\n  Further, General McChrystal describes this step as necessary to fix \nwhat he calls the ``crisis of confidence'' in the Afghan Government and \ncoalition forces.\n  General McChrystal has also said that more effective integration and \npartnership between Afghan and coalition forces will enable a more \nrapid expansion of the Afghan security force's capacity and \nresponsibility for security. The same method was implemented in Iraq, \nresulting in a dramatic increase in the quality of Iraqi security \nforces.\n  So those who say we should only train more Afghan troops and police \npresent a false choice. General McChrystal proposes a total \ncounterinsurgency strategy with both more Afghan police and military \nforces; but until they are trained sufficiently to do the job, an \nadequate and sufficient group of U.S. and NATO forces to both train the \nAfghan forces and provide the security that is necessary during that \ninterim period of time.\n  General McChrystal stated in his assessment:\n\n       Ideally, the Afghan National Security Forces must lead this \n     fight, but they will not have enough capacity in the near \n     term given the insurgency's growth rate. In the interim, \n     coalition forces must provide a bridge capability to protect \n     critical segments of the population. The status quo will lead \n     to failure if we wait for the ANSF to grow.\n\n  That is to say, the National Security Forces of Afghanistan.\n  So, again, to simply argue we should train more NATO and U.S. \nsecurity forces in the interim is a false choice. We need to do both. \nBut in order to do the former, we must do the latter; that is to say, \nwe have to increase our own troop strength in order to have the ability \nto both hold the line and train the Afghan forces who will ultimately \nbe able to provide security for that country.\n  Now to the matter of time. General McChrystal said in his assessment:\n\n       Time matters; we must act now to reverse the negative \n     trends and demonstrate progress.\n\n  One of the key points the general made in his assessment was this: He \nsaid:\n\n       I believe the short-term fight will be decisive. Failure to \n     gain the initiative and reverse insurgent momentum in the \n     near term (next 12 months)--while Afghan security capacity \n     matures--risks an outcome where defeating the insurgency is \n     no longer possible.\n\n  As he said, time is of the essence. By the way, this 12-month clock \nstarted ticking in August when he submitted his report. So at this \npoint, 10 months remain on the general's stopwatch to turn the tide of \nthis war.\n  Even if the President makes the right call without further delay and \ngives General McChrystal the resources he needs to prosecute the \nstrategy the President ordered in March, it will take months before \nadditional troops are available for the mission.\n  Unlike Iraq where we did have at least a nominal infrastructure in \nplace, in Afghanistan there are few roads and fewer other amenities and \nfacilities with which to support the troops. All of that takes \nadditional time to create.\n  The troop surge in Iraq didn't turn the tide of that war until 6 \nmonths after President Bush announced it. As I said, that was on \nterrain significantly easier to navigate than Afghanistan's mountainous \nborder region where many of our soldiers are fighting today.\n  Coalition forces are losing ground to the Taliban with current troop \nnumbers. According to General McChrystal:\n\n       Many indicators suggest the overall situation is \n     deteriorating, despite considerable effort by ISAF.\n\n  So I submit that President Obama should delay no longer a decision to \ndeploy troops that are necessary within\n\n[[Page S10767]]\n\nthis 12-month timeframe set out by General McChrystal in order to \nretake the momentum of this war.\n  Finally, I mentioned earlier the Afghan election should not delay the \nPresident's decision. I disagree with the argument some have made that \nthere should be some sort of test to determine whether the Afghan \nGovernment will be a reliable partner before we decide to commit \nadditional troops.\n  The very reason U.S. troops are fighting in Afghanistan is because \nthere is no strong government to maintain security and fight corruption \nthere. The point is to make it more reliable, to influence it to be \nless corrupt, and to protect the Afghan people so they will reject \nTaliban control and support their government.\n  We need to help foster a situation in which the Afghan Government can \ngrow into an institution that can provide for its people. That is what \na successful exit strategy will look like. We should not curtail our \neffort in Afghanistan because of a less-than-ideal political situation \ntoday.\n  President Karzai noted last week:\n\n       The [Afghan] institutions are just young toddlers in this \n     democracy that resembles a toddler. It walks and falls. We \n     have to understand that, and we have to accept the Afghan \n     elections in the context of the Afghan situation and the \n     poverty and lack of means in this country.\n\n  I add to that that President Karzai and his administration need to be \nmore forceful in helping to bring those institutions about, to ensure \nthat the election is not fraudulent and to ensure that his government \nis not corrupt and to do what is necessary to gain the trust of the \nAfghan people.\n  But are we likely to have more influence in achieving that result by \ndeciding that we can't commit the troops necessary to carry out the \nrecommendations of General McChrystal, all of which will probably push \nthe Afghans further toward the Taliban or by making the point that we \nare going to help establish the kind of government that is reliable and \nwe are going to do that by engaging in this counterinsurgency strategy \nwith everything that it takes, including the additional troops that are \nrequired, and thereby have the kind of influence over the Afghan \nGovernment that will bring it into a more reliable situation and enable \nthem to rely on the security we provide rather than making \naccommodation with the Taliban?\n  General McChrystal stated in his assessment that one of the key \nsources of the Taliban's strength is the perception by Afghans that a \nvictory by the Taliban is inevitable. We need to make sure it is not. \nHow can the United States expect to influence matters in Afghanistan if \nwe are viewed as looking for a way out and not putting in the troops \nGeneral McChrystal has requested?\n  Very importantly, this same question applies to Pakistan. We ask \nPakistan to help us fight the Taliban and al-Qaida and other terrorist \ngroups who are active in Afghanistan. But if we are viewed as an \nunreliable partner because we are not willing to commit sufficient \ntroops, the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan will hedge their bet \nwith the terrorists and their supporters. That is what has happened \nthere in the past.\n  When I went there last April and talked to Ambassador Holbrooke \nbefore I went, I said: Mr. Ambassador, what message would you like us \nto try to convey?\n  He said: Help them understand we are there for the long run. We are \nnot going to cut and run; we are going to stay with them and help them \nand do whatever is necessary for them to gain control of their country.\n  I conveyed that message, and I believed it, and I want to believe it. \nBut if we do not make the decisions to carry out this strategy the \nPresident announced in March, then the Pakistanis are going to be \nasking the same questions we did a few months ago: Will you be with us? \nWill you stand with us or are we going to have to make accommodations \nwith people neither you nor we like very much? One individual said: Why \nwould they make enemies with the people they are stuck with long after \nwe have left? In other words, they don't live in a very good \nneighborhood. I think that is what General McChrystal's request is \nabout--proof that we are committed to seeing this fight through against \nthe common enemy.\n  Interestingly, we faced a similar situation in Iraq. If we had opted \nagainst the surge in 2007, at a time when Iraq's central government was \nextremely weak and unable to protect its citizens from the insurgency \nthere, the Iraqi people most likely would not have been able to \neventually take ownership of their own security. But they did.\n  Similarly, if President Obama were not to provide the additional \ntroops General McChrystal needs, I believe we risk allowing Afghanistan \nto become the country it was on September 10, 2001--a result that none \nof us want.\n  In Iraq, the surge created the space for Prime Minister Maliki to \ntake greater control and reduce corruption in the Iraqi Government, and \na troop surge in Afghanistan would allow President Karzai--or a new \nPresident Abdullah if he were to win--to do the same.\n  A stable and legitimate government in Kabul is critical to the \nsecurity of Afghanistan. But the United States cannot hinge its \nstrategy on the current reliability of the Afghan Government, and the \nPresident should not wait until after the election to announce his \ntroop decision. To do so would suggest that the United States doesn't \nhave a core national interest of its own in Afghanistan, one based on \nour security. Yes, we aim to help establish the rule of law in \nAfghanistan, but our core national interest in that nation does not \nchange based on who is elected in their November 7 runoff.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I believe General McChrystal's \nassessment really rises above the political fray. It offers an \nobjective description of what is happening on the ground and what \nresources are needed to turn the tide of this war. This report may \nrepresent our only chance to successfully implement the President's \nMarch strategy--as I said, a strategy with which I think we all agree--\nand it will require the forces General McChrystal has recommended.\n  Regardless of the current status of the Afghan Government, we must \nfoster a situation in which it can grow into a government that can \nprovide basic services, and that will require, first of all, providing \nsecurity for its people. Our influence over this process will be far \ngreater if we make it clear that we are there to stay until our goals \nare achieved.\n  It has been 2 months since General McChrystal sent his assessment to \nWashington. I respectfully submit my recommendation to the President \nthat he approve this full troop request and that he do so as soon as \npossible. If he does, as I said, I believe Republicans will be very \nsupportive of his policy.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is before the Senate at this time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10767-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10767-S10768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS EXTENSION\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, in about 50 minutes the Senate will be \ncalled upon to vote on a motion to invoke cloture on a very important \npiece of legislation extending unemployment benefits for American \nworkers.\n  Another 7,000 jobless Americans will lose their unemployment \ninsurance today, just as 7,000 did yesterday and 7,000 more will \ntomorrow. The Republicans have held up this matter for approximately 3 \nweeks. What does that mean? It means that the first week, 49,000 \nAmericans were people whose unemployment insurance ran out, and they \nhad nowhere to turn. In 2 weeks--the math is simple--it was 98,000 \nAmericans from all over America, including the State of Delaware and \nthe State of Nevada. In 3 weeks, it was 147,000 people, just the same. \nThese are people who are desperate. To say I am disappointed in the way \nRepublicans have shown a complete lack of regard for the people behind \nthose staggering numbers is an understatement. Approximately 150,000 \npeople have been hurt as a result of the intransigence of the \nRepublicans in the past weeks.\n\n[[Page S10768]]\n\n  The Presiding Officer and the Senator speaking are from States that \nhave small towns and cities; 150,000 is a huge city by Nevada \nstandards. A city of 150,000--that is what has happened these last 3 \nweeks. That is 150,000 people without anywhere to turn. Their \ngovernment is not helping them. They have likely begged and borrowed \nfrom family as much as they could. Their savings are gone.\n  We know that when the economy recovers, the unemployment rate is one \nof the last numbers to rebound. That is what economists call a lagging \nindicator. That is just the way it is and has always been. So even as \nthe economy begins to turn around, jobs will turn around slower.\n  That fact, incidentally, is all the more reason for us to fix our \neconomy faster, to stop putting off reforming a broken health insurance \nsystem that bankrupts so many families. In America today, people are at \nthe courthouse filing bankruptcy. Last year in America, 750,000 people \nfiled bankruptcy because of medical costs.\n  How many people do you think filed for bankruptcy in France, Germany, \nJapan, Switzerland, England, Canada? How many filed for bankruptcy as a \nresult of health care costs? Zero. People say: Oh, socialized medicine. \nFrance, Germany, and Japan have private insurance.\n  Our health care system bankrupts many families. We need to do a lot \nof things to get us out of this hole we are in. The sooner we do these \nthings, the sooner jobs will come back. But they are not back yet. The \npeople of Nevada and others across the Nation are hurting. Unemployment \nis at a 26-year high in our country and at an alltime high in Nevada. \nWe became a State in 1864. It is the highest unemployment rate we have \never had.\n  These good, hard-working people lost their jobs most of the time \nthrough no fault of their own, and many lost their health care along \nwith it. They are having trouble finding new jobs, and so they are \nburning through whatever savings they have, if they have any, if they \nput away for their old age or children.\n  Some of these unemployed Americans are beginning their careers, some \nwere at the prime of their careers, and some are scrambling to finish, \nwith dignity, what they earned over decades of hard, honest work.\n  This is the Democrats' simple proposal. It is not very complicated at \nall: Let's support those families who have been the victims of this \nrecession. They need to put food on the table, send their children to \nschool, and pay the ever-rising medical bills.\n  If you want to do something that will help jump-start the economy, \nthat will stimulate the economy, how about giving these people who are \nout of work and have been out of work for an extended period of time a \ncheck? What are they going to do with it? They are going to spend it. \nWhy? Because they have to.\n  We are not asking for much, and we have the money to help them. Over \nthe years, workers have contributed a little bit each paycheck to fund \na safety net in the event they lost their jobs. It was insurance \nagainst unemployment. That is what it is called--unemployment \ninsurance. That is exactly what has happened. Now they want to take \nthat money--money set aside for this purpose--to keep them afloat until \nthey land the next job.\n  We have a proposal--a paid-for proposal, one that does not add a dime \nto the deficit--to extend to workers their unemployment insurance by up \nto 14 weeks and up to 20 weeks in States such as Nevada that have been \nhit the hardest. We have the power and the ability to do it. That is \nwhat we should do. It is the right thing to do.\n  The Republican response to that idea might sound familiar. It is a \nword we have heard from them more and more in recent days. The \nRepublican response in helping the unemployed is two letters: No. \nRepublican Senators from Louisiana, Alabama, Arizona, and Kentucky are \namong those saying no to helping unemployed citizens in Louisiana, \nAlabama, Arizona, and Kentucky. I doubt that is the kind of legislating \ntheir constituents had in mind when they sent them to the U.S. Capitol \nand asked them to be their voice in Congress.\n  When we first brought up this bill 3 weeks ago, Republicans decided \nthey would rather fight a partisan fight, as they have been doing now, \nthan help unemployed men and women in their own States. This \nunemployment is not targeted to just a few States. The Republicans \ndecided to make a political statement by demanding completely \nirrelevant amendments, amendments not germane, amendments that have \nlittle, if anything, to do with unemployment or even the economy, \ngenerally, and they decided the political statement was more important \nthan helping constituents afford to pay bills. That is wrong. It is an \noutrage.\n  That day when we started this legislation, when we first brought it \nto the Senate floor to help unemployed Americans, Republicans said no. \nThe sad part about it, they are still saying no. I hope, after all we \nhave been through and when that vote comes at 6 o'clock, we will have \nsome brave souls step across the aisle and help us get this done.\n  When we started this process 3 weeks ago, they said no. The next \nmorning, 7,000 people woke up without the unemployment insurance on \nwhich they had been counting. The next week we tried again. By now, we \nhave 49,000 people who have lost their unemployment benefits. Once \nagain, Republicans said no. Again, 7,000 Americans lost the help they \nneeded to get by. Then, last week, we tried again. Once again, the \nRepublicans said no. Again, we had a week of 7,000 people losing their \nwork benefits.\n  In the days since Republicans first said no to helping unemployed \nAmericans, we have about 150,000 who have lost the relief they \ndesperately need. Today, while Republicans continue to waste time, to \nstall so we cannot get things done here, another 7,000 will be added to \nthe approximately 150,000 who have already lost their unemployment \ninsurance. If we do not act, that number, by the end of the year, will \nbe 2 million. I wonder how much higher does that number have to climb \nbefore Republicans put people ahead of their partisan excuses.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 7 \nminutes on the Republican time of the time allotted after 5:30 p.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to draw the attention of the \nbody today to a policy initiative that was put forward by the Obama \nadministration last week. It is on a topic a lot of people have been \ninvolved in for a long period of time. It involves Sudan, Darfur, and \nthe genocide taking place in Sudan. It now involves new policy steps \nthe administration is proposing to take to build a relationship and \novertures to the Sudanese Government.\n  This is engagement to the extreme because President Bashir of Sudan \nis an indicted war criminal whose government is conducting a genocide, \nas declared by the Congress of the United States and the \nadministration. For the first time in the history of America, we would \nbe engaging an individual who is both an indicted war criminal, being \npursued by the International Criminal Court, and also who has conducted \na genocide in Darfur. We are talking about: OK. We need to start maybe \nengaging, and now there have been visas issued to top members of \nPresident Bashir's inner circle to come into the United States and \ndiscussion of a carrot-and-stick approach to Sudan, when he is running \na genocide in Darfur and is an indicted war criminal. This is atrocious \non its face. It is engagement to the extreme. It is wrong, and it would \nbe harmful to long-term U.S. interests.\n  What happens the next time an individual is involved in genocide? Do \nwe say: If you start behaving a little less worse on your genocide, we \nwill start to give you some carrots to help you out. What about the \nnext indicted war criminal, do we say: If you are a little less bad, if \nyou only kill 500 a day instead of 1,000, we are going to start \noffering you carrots instead of sticks in\n\n[[Page S10769]]\n\nthis approach. This undermines the moral authority of the United \nStates. It is the wrong thing to do.\n\n  I wish to give a couple historical examples.\n  Toward the end of World War II, Heinrich Himmler, who was No. 2 in \ncharge--but after Hitler committed suicide was No. 1 in charge--of Nazi \nGermany reached out to the Allied commander, General Eisenhower, and \nwanted to start negotiating with him: If he could be allowed to live, \nthey might negotiate some sort of settlement. Eisenhower completely \nignored it and treated him like the war criminal he was. Can you \nimagine if we would have started negotiating with Himmler at that time?\n  Let me give some more recent examples. What about Serbian leader \nKaradzic, the so-called ``Butcher of Bosnia,'' accused of slaughtering \nhundreds of thousands of innocent people? The State Department did not \nsay: If you are a little less bad and don't kill quite as many people, \nwe will start negotiating with you. They didn't say that. They put a $5 \nmillion reward out to anybody who gave us information leading to his \ncapture, and he currently resides in a prison in The Hague.\n  What about Charles Taylor, the ``Butcher of Liberia,'' who ran on an \nelection slogan--listen to this: ``He killed my pa, he killed my ma, \nbut I will vote for him.'' That was his election slogan. Taylor was \ndirectly involved in coordinating and supporting unthinkable atrocities \nover many years and, after ceding power, was indicted for war crimes \nand crimes against humanity.\n  Here is an indicted war criminal. Did we say to him: OK. Mr. Taylor, \nif you start not killing as many people, we will negotiate with you? Of \ncourse not. What the Congress did was offered and passed legislation \ngiving a $2 million reward for Taylor's capture, and he now sits in a \nprison in The Hague.\n  It would be unthinkable for us, in those circumstances, to say: OK. \nWe will start negotiating with these indicted war criminals, butchers \nof their own people, and we are going to start working with you because \nyou are going to act a little less bad. Yet that is what we are talking \nabout with President Bashir, an indicted war criminal, conducting a \ngenocide in Darfur that we have declared.\n  We have had hundreds of thousands of people across America going to \nrallies to save Darfur, and now we are talking about a carrot-and-stick \napproach with him?\n  I say no. I say we cannot do this, and if we do this in this \ncircumstance, what about future genocidal regimes? What about future \nindicted war criminals? Is there any standard upon which the United \nStates can or will stand at those points in time or could we, at that \npoint in time, if we do this in this particular case?\n  I am all for getting some form of movement on the north-south \nagreement so the south can vote next year and will probably vote to \nsecede and form its own country in the south. I think that is prudent \nand wise, after many years of civil war and the negotiations that took \nplace to get a north-south agreement. But I do not at all think you can \ntrade that for us negotiating with this indicted war criminal.\n  I urge my colleagues not to support this effort on behalf of the \nadministration to engage a genocidal regime in Khartoum.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' attention. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, what is the pending business before the \nSenate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10769-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10769-S10772]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2009--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 30 \nminutes of debate prior to a vote on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe motion to proceed to H.R. 3548, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled between the leaders or their designees.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, the unemployment rate is now 9.8 percent. Before long \neconomists expect it to top 10 percent. That means nearly 15 million \nAmericans have lost their jobs--15 million. That is 15 million people \nlooking for work. About 5 million people have been looking for work for \nmore than 6 months. There are about 3 million job openings. That is 15 \nmillion people chasing 3 million jobs.\n  We are in what folks call the ``Great Recession.'' Real people are \nfacing real hardships every day. On September 15 of this year, the \nFinance Committee held a hearing on unemployment insurance benefits and \nwhere we would go from there. Senators discussed the effects of the \ncurrent condition on beneficiaries, the business community, and the \nState unemployment systems. We considered proposals to support \nunemployed workers through the continuing recession.\n  A recent edition of the Federal Reserve's Beige Book reported that \nthe economy is still stabilizing. Unfortunately, the labor market still \nremains weak. Companies are being cautious about adding permanent \nstaff. Instead, they are asking more from their existing staff.\n  We need to continue our work to create jobs, and we also need to help \nour neighbors who are looking for work. That is what we did in the \nRecovery Act. We need to act on behalf of unemployed Americans and \ntheir communities. In helping our unemployed neighbors, we also can \nhelp to keep open the neighborhood grocery store and the neighborhood \ngas station. That is how unemployment insurance benefits not just \npeople who are unemployed but helps communities.\n  In helping our unemployed neighbors, we also help to keep houses out \nof foreclosure. In helping our unemployed neighbors, we also help our \neconomy and ourselves.\n  The House of Representatives passed a bill to give an additional 13 \nweeks of benefits to unemployed people in States with unemployment \nrates of 8\\1/2\\ percent or more. That is what the House did. I commend \nour colleagues in the House for their rapid response. But Leader Reid \nand I want to make sure all Americans who have exhausted their benefits \nduring these tough times get help.\n  Today we are joined by Senator Reed of Rhode Island, Senator Shaheen, \nSenator Dodd, and a total of 38 Senators in all in offering an \namendment to the House bill. Our amendment would give 14 additional \nweeks of benefits to unemployed people who exhaust their benefits no \nmatter what State they live in--14 additional weeks of benefits for \neveryone. Our amendment would also give 6 additional weeks of benefits \non top of that to unemployed people who exhaust their benefits in \nStates with 8\\1/2\\ percent unemployment or more. So 14 weeks to all \nStates, and then an additional 6 weeks in those States where \nunemployment is 8\\1/2\\ percent or more.\n  The total cost of our package is $2.4 billion and paid for with an \nextension of the Federal unemployment tax, or FUTA, until June 30, \n2011.\n  Today we have a chance to lend support to unemployed Americans. In so \ndoing, we have a chance to help our economy and ourselves. But first we \nhave to proceed to the bill. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation and vote for the motion to invoke cloture.\n  Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New Hampshire, \nMrs. Shaheen, who is one of the main cosponsors of the amendment. She \nis the real strong advocate of getting this legislation passed and a \nstrong advocate for the people of her State, and I deeply appreciate \nher work.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus for his very kind \nremarks and for his leadership to do something to help those workers \nwho are unemployed across this country who are losing their benefits \nand don't know where to turn.\n  As Senator Baucus has said, the Senate is about to vote on a motion \nto advance the Unemployment Compensation Extension Act. I am \ndisappointed that we still haven't been able to pass this extension, \nbut this evening we can\n\n[[Page S10770]]\n\nvote to overcome a procedural hurdle and take an important step \nforward.\n  As Senator Baucus has said, this is critical legislation that will \nhelp nearly 2 million jobless Americans who are about to have the \nsafety net pulled out from under them. The bill provides 14 additional \nweeks of unemployment insurance to jobless workers in all 50 States, \nand in those States where unemployment is the highest, they would \nreceive an additional 6 weeks.\n  For 3 weeks, this critical legislation has been delayed for nothing \nmore than political reasons. In that time, more than 100,000 Americans \nhave exhausted their unemployment benefits. The American people should \nbe outraged about these delays. I hope today those in opposition will \nend their obstruction, will stop the political games, and will help us \npass this bill to stimulate our economy and help those Americans who, \nthrough no fault of their own, can't find a job.\n  I am confident that when we finally get to the vote, this extension \nwill garner the broad bipartisan support it deserves. That is because \nunemployment isn't a New England problem or a Montana problem or a \nsouthern problem. It isn't a Republican, an Independent, or a \nDemocratic problem. It is a hardship that hits every community in every \nState in every part of our country.\n  I recently visited an unemployment office in Manchester, NH, and I \nheard from people who, despite their best efforts, are unable to find a \njob. They want to get back to work, but they face one of the worst job \nmarkets since the Great Depression. I want to share this afternoon a \ncouple of stories I heard from unemployed workers and those who have \ncalled my office pleading for help.\n  Carry-Ann is a 39-year-old single mother from Concord. She wrote that \nshe has been out of a job for more than a year, and she has been \nrelying on unemployment to support her two teenagers and to pay the \nmortgage. Carry-Ann qualified for a job training program, and she has \nbeen training for a career in health care.\n  That is appropriate, given the other debate that is going on in this \nbody.\n  She has been training for that career in health care because she \nknows that is a sector that needs workers. But if her unemployment runs \nout, she wrote, she will lose her home and she will have to relocate, \nwhich means she would not be able to finish her job training program \nand will lose the prospects of getting a good new job.\n  Carry-Ann isn't asking for a handout. She is trying to gain self-\nsufficiency for herself and for her family by getting educated and \ngaining the skills she needs to build a career. But she will be unable \nto do so unless we pass this extension.\n  Richard is a 43-year-old from Somersworth, NH, one town over from \nwhere I live in the southern part of the State. He explained that he \nhas been looking for work for over a year. He has been using his \nunemployment benefits to support his family. Richard used to have a \nmanagement job, and at interviews he has been told time after time that \nhe is overqualified and he would not be considered. Employers think he \nwill leave their job as soon as better opportunities open.\n  But Richard has a family to support today and his benefits are going \nto run out soon. He is like many Americans looking for work right now. \nIf we do nothing, he could lose his credit, his car, and his home.\n  Extending unemployment benefits will help Richard and Carry-Ann and \ntheir families and tens of thousands of others like them across this \ncountry. It will help them weather this storm.\n  As I have said many times, when we extend unemployment, we are not \njust helping jobless workers, we are also helping the businesses that \nprovide the goods and services that unemployed workers need. People \ncollecting unemployment spend their benefits immediately on necessities \nto keep their families going, which means these dollars get into \ncommunities almost as soon as the check arrives.\n  Economists say, dollar for dollar, extending unemployment benefits is \none of the most cost-effective actions we can take to stimulate the \neconomy. Passing this extension of unemployment benefits is the right \nchoice for unemployed workers and for our communities.\n  Mr. President, this extension is long overdue. We owe it to those \nAmericans who are out of work to pass this extension.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, if Senator Shaheen wishes to take more \ntime, I am more than willing to extend it to her.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I have finished, but I thank my colleague very much, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator very much.\n  I say to my colleagues that now is a good time to speak on extending \nunemployment insurance, now that we are on the motion to proceed. We \nwill vote fairly quickly, but if Senators do want to come over to \nexpress their views, now is the time to do so.\n  Pending the arrival of Senators, Mr. President, I suggest the absence \nof a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time during the \nquorum call be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask the Presiding Officer, how much time \nis remaining on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes for each side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield to the Senator from North Dakota as much time as \nhe wishes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom Montana.\n  The issue before us is very simple. When you have a severe economic \ndownturn of the type we have had, a very deep recession, that is when \nyou try to employ the economic stabilizers that help people who lose \ntheir jobs--unemployment insurance. The extension of unemployment \ninsurance has almost always been nearly automatic because everyone \nunderstands the urgency of doing it. When many additional people have \nbeen unemployed for lengthy periods of time, you try to reach out and \nhelp.\n  The cloture vote tonight is on a motion to proceed, and it so \ndemonstrates the dysfunction of the Senate these days. The motion to \nproceed is filibustered by the other side when we are trying to help \nsome folks who have lost their jobs. Many have lost hope during a steep \neconomic decline. We can't even get cooperation on a motion to proceed \nto try to address the extension of unemployment benefits. It is pretty \nunbelievable to me.\n  Last fall, I watched some of the same folks who were objecting to \nthat rush to the starting line to see if we couldn't give hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to the biggest financial firms in the country that \nran this economy into the ditch--let's give them a lot of money. But \nyou know what, not when it comes to helping the folks at the bottom, \nthose who have lost their jobs.\n  By the way, last month 263,000 Americans lost their jobs; last \nmonth--263,000. Just pick one out of 263,000 and think of somebody \ncoming home from work and saying: Honey, I have lost my job; to say to \ntheir husband or wife: I have lost my job. It wasn't because I did a \nbad job, it was because they cut back at the plant or the office, so \nnow I am unemployed. It was not their fault. The question is, What do \nwe do when this happens? Normally when this happens, we extend \nunemployment benefits to those who are facing very difficult times.\n  This is the steepest, deepest economic decline since the 1930s. This \ncountry has been in very serious economic trouble for some long while \nnow. It nearly fell off a cliff last October. So this action now should \nbe almost automatic. But nothing, even common sense, is automatic \naround here because we are now struggling, at the end of today, a \nTuesday, to get a cloture vote on a motion to proceed to do something \nthat everybody knows we have a responsibility to do. It is almost \nunbelievable.\n  I want to say how frustrating it is that we do not get any \ncooperation on anything to move forward things that are of an urgent \nnature. I suppose this is not urgent, perhaps, unless you are\n\n[[Page S10771]]\n\nunemployed and trying to figure out: How do we get the money to eat? \nHow do we get the money to pay rent? How do we get the money to provide \nthe funding for the kids to go to school? It is probably not urgent for \npeople who are not in that situation, but if you are in that situation \nduring a very severe economic downturn, this is urgent. We need to \nextend these benefits.\n  My colleague from Montana and his committee have worked on this and \nbrought it to the floor. It would have been nice if they had gotten \njust a little cooperation so we would not have to go through this, file \na cloture motion, wait 2 days for it to ripen, then 30 hours \npostcloture. What is the deal? I don't understand at all. Dig your \nheels in when it comes to trying to help the folks who need help the \nmost and say the sky is the limit when it comes time to help those who \nhave the most? That turns logic on its head, in my judgment.\n  My hope is that at 6 o'clock tonight when we vote, we will have the \n60 votes. We should never have been put in the position to have to try \nto break a filibuster on a motion to proceed. We are not even on the \nbill; it is a motion to proceed to the bill. What an unbelievable lack \nof cooperation on something that is so essential during a steep \neconomic downturn, to help those whose jobs have been washed away, who \ndesperately need help for themselves and their families. That is what \nwe are trying to do.\n  I hope that perhaps following the disposition of this--and I hope we \nwill get this done--we will get some additional cooperation on things \nthat really matter.\n  I appreciate the time given me by the Senator from Montana.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nconsent that the time be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen).

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Pension Funding\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, we are in the midst of a terrible \neconomic recession. Over the course of the last year, we have lost \nmillions of jobs. In Pennsylvania, for example, by comparison, the \nunemployment rate percentage is lower than a lot of States, but in many \nparts of our State it is at a historic high, or at least a 15-year \nhigh. What that means in Pennsylvania is that we have just about a half \na million people out of work, even though some States have a much \nhigher percent in their unemployment rate. So we have a half million \npeople out of work.\n  The fact that we just had this vote on unemployment insurance is \nvitally important. It helps us meet a real need across the country. So \nwe have an economic crisis. People are living through the loss of a \njob, the loss of a home, or both--in some ways, the loss of their hopes \nand their dreams. Unfortunately, even as we get through this, even as \nwe begin to recover, and even as we are dealing with a longer term \nchallenge to our economy, which is health care--which is one of the \nreasons I think we have to pass a bill this year--there are other \nthreats we have to bear in mind. One of them involves not just \nbusinesses but, by extension, workers and families. I speak of the \nfunding of pension plans.\n  A lot of businesses across the country--a lot of workers have come to \nWashington to remind us that this pension issue is a looming problem \nfor a lot of businesses. I happen to be a member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, and that is one of the issues \nwe must deal with, and I think we will be dealing with, in the near \nterm.\n  Millions of Americans, not just throughout our history our recent \nhistory but especially now, rely upon any kind of retirement vehicle, \nand one of those, of course, is a good pension plan. We need to give \npeople in the twilight of their life the kind of security that comes \nwith a pension plan. We also have to make sure workers have that same \npeace of mind as they make their way through this very difficult \neconomy.\n  In 2006, the Pension Protection Act was passed by Congress. The main \npurpose of that act was to strengthen pension plans by implementing \ntougher funding rules. Most of the rules under the act took effect in \n2008, and at that time the stock market was in turmoil. The combination \nof stronger pension funding rules in a chaotic stock market caused \nalmost all pension plans to sustain a net loss, in essence.\n  I wish to turn to one chart that depicts that. One study released by \nMercer stated that the combined loss for pension plans totaled $469 \nbillion for 2008. We can see the differential from 2007 where there was \nan overfunding of some $60 billion. So in 2007, $60 billion up; the \nnext year lost over $400 billion, down; to be exact, $469 billion in \nterms of where we were in 2007 versus where we were at the end of 2008. \nBased upon this loss, pension plans have a funding deficit, a \ndifferential of $409 billion--$409 billion in 2008. In 2009, the \npension funding deficit is expected to increase\n\n[[Page S10772]]\n\nyet again despite recent recoveries in the stock market.\n  We have to do what we must to strengthen our economy and to give our \nworkers and their families and our businesses some peace of mind. That \nmight be the best way to describe it. So this is more than just a \nlooming crisis, more than just a problem in the near term, it is a \nproblem we have to deal with right now, in the next couple of months.\n  Recently, the House Ways and Means Committee held a hearing that \nfocused on pension funding relief. They gave an example at the hearing. \nNCR Corporation, a 125-year-old global technology company, testimony at \nthis hearing provided a specific example of how company pension plans \nhave been affected. NCR, this global technology company, had a pension \nplan that was 110 percent funded as of January 1, 2008.\n  So at the beginning of 2008, they were funded at 110 percent. They \nwere in good shape, for the most part. The funding status, as those in \nthe business know, is based on the amount of assets compared to the \namount of liabilities. By January 1, 2009, just 1 year later, this same \ncompany, due to unprecedented losses in the market, had its funding \npercentage drop to 75 percent. So in 1 year, this company goes from 110 \nup of funding to 75 percent, a huge loss.\n  This is what it means in terms of dollars. The percentages only tell \npart of the story. Prior to the market loss, this company, NCR \nCorporation, expected to make payments totaling $200 million over a 7-\nyear period. That is what they could see down the road: $200 million \nover that period. Instead, that payment has increased to $1.5 billion--\n$1.5 billion looking out ahead of them instead of $200 million. So $200 \nmillion becomes $1.5 billion, and that is what we are going to see \nunless Congress provides some relief.\n  We have heard from countless companies across Pennsylvania and across \nthe country that are in the same situation as this one example, the NCR \ncompany. The companies are not requesting a bailout. Let me say that \nagain: They are not requesting a bailout. The companies are not \nrequesting the American taxpayer to assist directly. The companies are \nsimply asking Congress to extend the time period of recognizing the \nlosses incurred during the market downturn.\n  In 2009--I will point to another study--Watson Wyatt reported that \nthere would be $32 billion in payments to fund pension plans in \nAmerica. Without any relief from Congress in 2010, that amount will \nincrease to over $90 billion and increase to $146 billion in 2011. So \nwe go from, in 2009, $32 billion, to 2010, and it keeps going up until \nwe get to 2011, just 2 years from now, $146 billion to pension plans in \nAmerica.\n  American companies that are already struggling to break even today \nwill have to decide between funding their pension plans and cutting \njobs. In order to avoid losing more jobs, at a time when the national \nunemployment rate is 9.8 percent, Congress should act swiftly to extend \nthe amortization period for recognizing certain losses in pension plan \nassets, including other temporary provisions that will provide funding \nrelief. Any relief should apply to single- and multiemployer pension \nplans.\n  As companies recover from the economic recession, we should not \ndiscourage economic growth by requiring a pension payment that will \nrequire companies to cut jobs. Instead, Congress should provide \ntargeted relief--targeted relief--that will enable companies to spread \nout the losses over an extended period of time, which will allow \ncapital to be invested in activities that will promote growth.\n  Ultimately, the intention of any pension funding relief legislation \nis to ensure the survival of the pension plan system. The American \npeople have a right to expect that pension plans be stable and secure \nfor their future. In Congress, we should work to implement any \nlegislation that provides a healthy pension system just in the same way \nwe provide security with a reformed health care system. In exchange for \nensuring a good pension, a secure pension, and a better health care \nsystem--that is what we are saying to the American workers and to \nAmerican businesses--it is important that we be very honest with \npeople, with our workers.\n  We are going to say to our workers: We want you to compete in a world \neconomy; we want you to go out and get more education; we want you to \nenhance your skill level; we want you to have a broader-based skill \nlevel so that when the economy takes a turn or market forces lead to a \nchange in the industry that you are employed in or lead to a change in \nour economy, you will have the skill and the knowledge and the training \nand the education to be able to adjust.\n  So we encourage people all the time to get more education. We \nencourage people all the time to enhance their skill level. But we will \nbe more successful in achieving that goal and we will be more honest \nwith workers if we can say to them: You don't have to worry as much as \nyou used to about your pension or about health care.\n  That should be a large part of the bargain, a large part of the \nagreement we make with our workers and our businesses because, if we \nare going to compete in a world economy, if we are going to have a \nhighly skilled workforce that does that for us over time, we cannot say \nto people: Go out and improve your skills, go out and get more \neducation, but we are not sure we can help you with your retirement \nsecurity or your health care security. We can't ask them to do three \nthings at one time. We can't ask them to go to work every day and worry \nabout whether they are going to have health care coverage or worry \nabout whether their kids are going to be covered or worry about whether \nthere is going to be a preexisting condition that will bar them from \ntreatment or coverage.\n  We can't allow a situation to persist where we say to them: Go to \nwork every day and continue to improve your skills and maybe get more \neducation, but we are not sure we can help you on health care and, by \nthe way, your pension plan might be at risk in the future; it may not \nbe there for you when you retire.\n  We have to do something in a very strategic and focused way to take \naway some of that worry on health care and on pension and retirement \nsecurity. If we do that, if we lessen that anxiety for people, I \nbelieve we are going to have a much more successful strategy as it \nrelates to telling people and encouraging our workers to get more \neducation, to get a heightened degree of training. If we do that, we \nare going to have a much stronger long-term economy. But we can't ask \npeople to do it all themselves--to bear the burden of health care, to \nbear the burden of retirement security, and to bear the full burden of \ntheir education, their training, and their skill development.\n  So that is why this pension issue, even in the midst of a health care \ndebate, is so critically important.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow afternoon President Obama will \nsign the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act \ninto law. I commend the President for acting so quickly on this \ncritical civil rights measure. Its protections are long overdue. Last \nweek, when the Senate was about to consider the Department of Defense \nauthorization conference report, I spoke in strong support of its \nprovisions including the hate crimes measure. At that time, I requested \nmy entire statement be included in the Record. Unfortunately, my entire \nstatement did not make it\n\n[[Page S10773]]\n\ninto the Congressional Record so I ask that it now be printed in full \nas it was prepared and offered at that time. I understand that this \nerror will be corrected in the bound version of the Record, but I \nwanted my full statement to be immediately available for those \nfollowing the specific details of how the language in the conference \nreport differed from my hate crimes amendment that the Senate passed \nearlier this year.\n  After more than a decade, Congress is finally set to pass the Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 as an \namendment to the National Defense Authorization Act, and I expect the \nPresident to sign it promptly. I am proud that Congress has come \ntogether to show that violence against members of any group because of \nwho they are will not be tolerated in this country.\n  I thank Senator Collins for cosponsoring the amendment with me. I \ncommend Senator Levin for working so hard to ensure that this provision \nwould go forward as part of the conference report. I congratulate the \nSenate majority leader, Senator Reid, for his essential role in this \nmatter. In the House of Representatives, Speaker Pelosi and Congressman \nClyburn were similarly instrumental in this enactment.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to remember Senator Ted Kennedy \nwho provided steadfast leadership on this issue for more than a decade. \nI wish he could have been here to see this bill, about which he was so \npassionate, finally enacted. I am honored to be able to see it through \nto the finish for him. I know it meant a lot to him. We miss him but \nhis good work goes on.\n  Earlier this month was the 11th anniversary of the brutal murder of \nMatthew Shepard, a college student who was beaten and killed solely \nbecause of his sexual orientation. Matthew's parents have worked \ncourageously and tirelessly for this legislation, which aims to ensure \nthat this kind of despicable act will never be tolerated in this \ncountry. The bill was named for Matthew, as well as for James Byrd, \nJr., a Black man who was killed in 1998 because of his race in another \nawful crime that galvanized the Nation against hateful violence. We \nappreciate and honor the important contributions of James Byrd's family \nas they have worked hard for this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, the years since these two horrific crimes have made \nclear that hate crimes remain a serious and growing problem. Most \nrecently, the shooting at the Holocaust Memorial Museum showed that \nthese vicious crimes continue to haunt our country. This bipartisan \nlegislation will help law enforcement respond more effectively to this \nproblem.\n  It is a testament to the importance of this legislation that the \nAttorney General of the United States came to the Judiciary Committee \nin June to testify in favor of it. We have been urged to pass this bill \nby State and local law enforcement organizations, and dozens of leaders \nin the faith and the civil rights communities. Michael Lieberman of the \nAnti-Defamation League and my friend, Janet Langhart Cohen, among \nothers, also testified passionately in favor of this legislation before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year. I also very much \nappreciate the support of Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference \non Civil Rights and Joe Solmonese of the Human Rights Campaign, who \nhave worked tirelessly to see this legislation passed.\n  The answer to hate and bigotry has to ultimately be found in \nincreased respect and tolerance for all our citizens. In the meantime, \nstrengthening our Federal hate crimes legislation to give law \nenforcement the tools they need is a necessary step.\n  The facts set out in several recent reports show that hate crimes and \nhate groups remain a major problem. Last June, the Leadership \nConference for Civil Rights released a report finding that ``the number \nof hate crimes reported has consistently ranged around 7,500 or more \nannually, or nearly one every hour of the day.'' A recent report from \nthe Southern Poverty Law Center found that hate groups have increased \nby 50 percent since 2000, from 602 hate groups in 2000, to 926 in 2008.\n  This historic hate crimes provision will improve existing law by \nmaking it easier for Federal authorities to investigate and prosecute \ncrimes of racial, ethnic, or religious violence. Victims will no longer \nhave to engage in a narrow range of activities, such as serving as a \njuror, to be protected under Federal law. It also focuses the attention \nand resources of the Federal Government on the problem of crimes \ncommitted against people because of their sexual orientation, gender, \ngender identity, or disability, which are much needed protections. In \naddition, this legislation will provide resources to State, local, and \ntribal law enforcement to address hate crimes.\n  In preparing this legislation and moving it through Congress, we have \nworked closely with the Justice Department to ensure that we are \nadvancing legislation that is fair, constitutional, and effective in \ncracking down on brutal acts of hate-based violence. It ensures that \nFederal prosecutors are able to rely on evidence of limited and \nrelevant additional conduct to prove that the violent act in question \nwas motivated by bias. It would also strengthen Federal jurisdiction \nover hate crimes and clarify key certification requirements to allow \nthe Federal Government to appropriately support, but not to substitute \nfor, State and local law enforcement. As a former State prosecutor, I \nbelieve respect for local and State law enforcement is critical.\n  This legislation was carefully crafted to respect constitutional \nlimits and differences of opinion. It will combat acts of violence \nmotivated by hatred and bigotry, but it does not target speech, however \noffensive or disagreeable, and it does not target religious expression.\n  I wish there had been more Republican support for this important \ncivil rights amendment. Nonetheless, in the Senate we worked to address \nbipartisan concerns and issues. We incorporated Republican amendments \nmandating guidelines for hate crimes prosecutions, further changing \nfirst amendment protections, and creating a new criminal offense for \nattacks against servicemembers because of their service.\n  I am disappointed that the servicemembers provision contains a \nmandatory minimum sentence because I believe that mandatory minimum \nsentences can have unintended and unfortunate effects on sentencing and \non our criminal justice system. However, I was pleased that we were \nable to limit the provision to one modest mandatory minimum sentence \nand require the United States Sentencing Commission to study the effect \nof mandatory minimum sentences. I am also glad that we were able to \npass this bill without adding a new Federal death penalty, which would \nhave needlessly inserted a divisive issue into this legislation.\n  I want to note that the sponsors and supporters intend with its \npassage, to authorize Federal investigations and prosecutions of those \nhate crimes described to the fullest extent permitted by the \nConstitution. Section 4707(a) of the defense authorization bill, which \ncreates Sec. 249(a)(2)(B) of the new hate crimes statute, is desired to \napply to the full extent of congressional authority under the Commerce \nClause. Similarly, section 249(a)(1) should be interpreted broadly, to \nthe full extent of Congress's authority under the 13th amendment.\n  Section 4710 of the bill sets out rules of construction for hate \ncrimes legislation. These rules of construction are meant to be read as \na collective whole. They simply confirm that the statute should be \napplied consistent with the first amendment and the Federal Rules of \nEvidence. They are not meant to prevent the admission of any evidence \nthat is relevant, consistent with the first amendment, and otherwise \nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence, including under rule \n404(b).\n  President Obama has worked closely with us to facilitate the quick \npassage of this vital hate crimes legislation. In his first few months \nin office, he has acted to ensure that Federal benefits are awarded \nmore equitably, regardless of sexual orientation, and now to ensure \nthat this hate crimes legislation becomes law. Unlike in previous \nyears, our bipartisan hate crimes bill does not face a veto threat. We \nhave a President who understands that crimes motivated by bias are \nparticularly pernicious crimes that affect more than just their victims \nand those victims' families. I expect the President to sign this \nlegislation without delay.\n\n[[Page S10774]]\n\n  Hate crimes instill fear in those who have no connection to the \nvictim other than a shared characteristic such as race or sexual \norientation. For nearly 150 years, we have responded as a Nation to \ndeter and to punish violent denials of civil rights by enacting Federal \nlaws to protect the civil rights of all of our citizens. The Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 \ncontinues that great and honorable tradition. Passage of this \nlegislation, at last, will show, once again, that America values \ntolerance and protects all of its people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10774-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  VOTE EXPLANATION--DOD AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss my decision to vote \nno for the fiscal year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Throughout my career I have always been a staunch supporter of our \nmen and women that serve our Nation. Their courage in the face of \ndanger to preserve our freedom is inspiring. And my vote on the Defense \nauthorization bill does not change that belief at all. In fact, I was \npleased to include legislation in this years bill that will require the \nSecretary of Defense to review and establish a long-term plan to \nsustain the solid rocket motor industrial base. This review will be \nvital to ensure we maintain a robust industrial base and our ultimate \nstrategic defense for decades.\n  I have always been impressed with the great working relationship I \nhave enjoyed with my esteemed colleagues on the Armed Services \nCommittee and their professional staffs. My vote by no means diminishes \nmy respect for the Armed Forces.\n  Unfortunately, the congressional majority has decided to needlessly \ninject controversy into what should have been a bipartisan effort to \nfund and support our troops in a time of war. I am, of course, speaking \nof the decision to attach the unrelated hate crimes provisions to this \nlegislation. For one reason or another, the Democrats have once again \ndecided that, even with their overwhelming majorities in the House and \nSenate, the Federal hate crimes legislation cannot be debated and \npassed on its own merits and that, instead, this divisive legislation \nshould become part and parcel with our efforts to provide our military \nwith much-needed resources.\n  I have long been opposed to this approach with regard to hate crimes. \nMake no mistake, none of us are indifferent to the problems associated \nwith violence motivated by prejudice and violence. However, I believe \nthat the approach provided for in this bill would needlessly expand the \npowers of the Federal Government at the expense of the traditional \npolice powers of the States. Worst of all, it would do so without a \ndemonstrated need. Indeed, a few months back, I asked the Attorney \nGeneral--who supports this legislation, by the way, in a hearing \nwhether there was any evidence of a trend that these crimes were going \nunpunished at the State level. He stated without reservation that there \nwas no such evidence and that, in fact, the States were, by and large, \ndoing a fine job in this area. If that is the case, what is the purpose \nof this legislation? Why are we going to expand the law enforcement \npowers of the Federal Government into what are essential State crimes \nwhen these crimes are already being handled adequately by the States? I \nhave yet to hear a decent answer to that question.\n  Now, some of us may be tempted simply to vote for the Defense \nauthorizations bill with the hate crimes provisions attached simply \nbecause the balance of the bill is good and worthy of support. Well, I \nworry that if we go along with this now, what will they add to so-\ncalled ``must pass'' bills in the future? I believe that when it comes \nto funding our troops, we should do our best to speak in a unified \nvoice. By taking this path, it seems that the majority would rather \nmake a political statement than offer the military our bipartisan \nsupport. For that, I am greatly disappointed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10774-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OBJECTION TO S. 1782\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to alert my colleagues that \nI intend to object to any unanimous consent agreement for the \nconsideration of S. 1782, the Federal Judiciary Administrative \nImprovements Act of 2009. This legislation will increase the Federal \noutlays for the judicial branch and does not have an offset to the \nspending increases.\n  In particular, I object to two provisions in S. 1782. First, this \nlegislation will increase Federal expenditures by allowing senior \nexecutives in the Federal courts, the Federal Judicial Center, and the \nSentencing Commission to carry over more annual leave days from 1 year \nto another. The bill would change the current allowance, 240 hours--30 \ndays--to 720 hours--90 days. This provision is a limited benefit to a \nnumber of senior executives and will cost Federal taxpayers millions of \ndollars.\n  Second, the legislation includes a provision increasing the salaries \nof the four division directors at the Federal Judicial Center. This \nprovision would increase the salary from Executive Schedule V--\n$139,600--to Executive Schedule IV--$149,000. While this is only a \nslight increase to the spending outlays, it is the wrong message to \nsend the American taxpayers when nearly 10 percent of the workforce is \nunemployed.\n  Americans across the country are tightening their belts and finding \nways to save money. Social Security beneficiaries are fighting to \nstretch their dollars because they will not see a cost-of-living \nincrease for 2010 for the first time in nearly three decades. To expand \nbenefits in the judicial branch for a chosen group of senior executives \nis the wrong thing to do when everyone is making sacrifices and \nmillions of Americans are looking for work.\n  If the Senate majority insists on offering S. 1782 for consideration \nnotwithstanding my objection, at the very least, I will insist on \noffering S. 657, the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act as an amendment and \nrequest a rollcall vote. Unless this amendment is afforded a vote, I \nwill continue to object to any unanimous consent agreement regarding S. \n1782. In this time of financial uncertainty, we should not be providing \nsenior executives in the judiciary increased benefits absent \nlegislation that will bring some sunshine to the courts by allowing \nmedia coverage of court proceedings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10774-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10774-S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                TRIBUTE TO NORTH CAROLINA WWII VETERANS\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am proud to recognize a group of \n102 World War II veterans from the Triad region of North Carolina who \nare traveling to Washington, DC, on October 28 to visit the memorials \nand monuments that recognize the sacrifices of our Nation's invaluable \nservicemembers.\n  The Triad Flight of Honor sponsored this trip to the Nation's Capital \nfor surviving World War II veterans in the Triad area. Our veterans \nwill visit the World War II, Korean, Vietnam, and Iwo Jima Memorials.\n  This will be the second Triad Flight of Honor trip. The organization \nflew their inaugural group of veterans to Washington, DC, on October 3, \n2009. I had the honor of visiting with that group of veterans when they \nreturned to Greensboro, NC. I was joined by my father-in-law, MG (Ret) \nCharles T. Hagan, Jr., U.S. Marine Corps Reserve, a World War II \nveteran, just before he died. Two more Triad flights for the spring of \n2010 have already been scheduled, and hundreds of veterans in the area \nare hoping to participate.\n  World War II was the defining period for a generation that bravely \nanswered the call to serve our country. Young men and women, driven to \nprotect America, enlisted in droves. Unfortunately, too many of those \nbrave servicemembers met an untimely death on the battlefields of \nEurope and the South Pacific. More than 400,000 American servicemembers \nwere slain during the course of the long war, and over 60 million \npeople worldwide were killed, including 40 million civilians. The \nAllied Forces' ultimate victory is a testament to the brave soldiers, \nsailors, airmen, and marines who put their lives on the line to fight \nfor liberty and freedom.\n  This week, 102 Triad veterans will see the memorials dedicated to \ntheir service. I thank the Triad Flight of Honor for making these trips \na reality.\n\n[[Page S10775]]\n\n  I ask the Senate to join me in honoring these brave veterans who are \ntrue North Carolina heroes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10775-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. JAMES MICHAEL SMITH\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I recognize Dr. James \nMichael Smith on his inauguration as the 16th President of Northern \nState University in Aberdeen, SD. Dr. Smith comes to Northern State \nfrom Bowling Green State University where he had served as vice \npresident for economic development. He is a veteran organizational \nleader, with experience leading educational institutions at both the K-\n12 and postsecondary levels. Prior to joining the senior administrative \nteam at BGSU, Dr. Smith was dean of the School of Education at Indiana \nUniversity South Bend. Dr. Smith also served in administrative \ncapacities at West Texas A and Butler University. He will begin his \ntenure with the knowledge that Northern State University has been named \nfor the third year in a row to the U.S. News and World Report's Top \nPublic Undergraduate Institutions in the Midwest. Dr. Smith has said \nNSU is ``excited to once again be named to this prestigious list, and \nwill continue to build momentum at Northern State by focusing on new \nprograms, expanded technology and increased graduate offerings.'' \nEveryone in the region is excited to help him join in these goals.\n  At the investiture of Dr. Smith, history will literally be at his \nfingertips. The pen used in this ceremony will be the same one used to \nswear in the 15 Northern presidents before him. It was used to sign the \nbill that created the Northern Normal and Industrial School in 1901 and \nit went up in the space shuttle Discovery in 1991.\n  I would like to offer Dr. James Smith the very best as he begins his \ntenure with one of South Dakota's finest institutions of higher \nlearning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10775-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY RELATIVE \n TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF THE GOVERNMENT OF SUDAN AS DECLARED IN \n            EXECUTIVE ORDER 13067 OF NOVEMBER 3, 1997--PM 37\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S10775, October 27, 2009, the Record reads: report; with \nwas referred to the Com-\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: report; which was \nreferred to the Com-\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

We need to commit ourselves to \nstrengthening our nuclear nonproliferation efforts and to take the \nactions supported by the United Nations Security Council and the \nCommission.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require an annual report by the \nPresident's Coordinator for WMD Proliferation and Terrorism to address \nthe Commission's findings regarding United States nuclear \nnonproliferation efforts. The report will provide an assessment of IAEA \ncapabilities to detect possible military diversions of nuclear \nmaterials; will address actions taken to upgrade the physical security \nof civilian nuclear facilities in the United States; will identify the \nmeasures taken to minimize the use of weapons usable highly enriched \nuranium; will document the steps taken to implement the Energy \nDevelopment Program under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Act of 1978; \nwill compare the security standards at civilian nuclear facilities to \nthose at military facilities; and will detail what the U.S. is spending \nto promote civilian nuclear energy abroad.\n  The challenges of nuclear proliferation are global in nature and \nrequire sustained international collaboration. This bill would further \nour international efforts by requiring an additional report on the \nprogress of United States Government cooperative efforts with the \nDirector General of IAEA to examine how IAEA could better meet its \nnuclear safeguard goals; promote the transparency of foreign visitors \nto safeguarded sites; acquire and implement near-real-time surveillance \nat sensitive sites; use fees to fund inspections; and require advance \nnotice and analysis of transfers of dual-use nuclear technologies.\n  I have long been a proponent of improving our nonproliferation \nefforts. Last month, I introduced the Energy Development Program \nImplementation Act, S. 1675, to support non-nuclear, alternative energy \ndevelopment in developing countries. In addition to this, I called for \nthe Government Accountability Office to examine proliferation risks in \nIAEA's Technical Cooperation Program and chaired numerous hearings on \nimproving our Nation's nonproliferation capabilities. We should \nremember that nuclear technology that can be used for peaceful uses may \nin some cases be used to support dangerous, clandestine programs.\n  I believe that promoting greater international cooperation toward \nnonproliferation is crucial. This bill would make the U.S. an even \nstronger partner in these efforts and enhance the ability of Congress \nto help tackle the dangers of nuclear proliferation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to allow members of the Armed Forces who served on active duty \non or after September 11, 2001, to be eligible to participate in the \nTroops-to-Teachers Program, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nMichael Bennet in introducing the Post-9/11 Troops to Teachers \nEnhancement Act. This legislation would allow more veterans and school \ndistricts to participate in the Troops to Teachers program. In addition \nto expanding the program, the proposed bill would create an advisory \nboard that would be charged with improving awareness and participation \nof the program, ensuring that the program meets the needs of our \nschools and veterans. I hope that my colleagues in the Senate will also \nsupport this important piece of legislation.\n  In 1994, Congress authorized the Department of Defense, DOD, to \noversee a new national program, Troops to Teachers, which was designed \nas a Transition assistance program for retiring or separating members \nof the military to obtain their teaching credentials and place these \nteachers in schools throughout the country. The program was \nreauthorized by Congress in 1999. That reauthorization transferred \nresponsibility for oversight and funding from the DOD to the Department \nof Education and authorized $10,000 bonuses to participants who agreed \nto teach in ``high-need'' schools. Troops to Teachers was later \nincorporated and reauthorized under the No Child Left Behind Act of \n2001. Since its inception, over 11,000 teachers have been hired by \nschool districts across the Nation, of which many are nontraditional \nfirst-time teachers.\n  Teaching is among the most honorable professions in our society. I \nbelieve we should encourage military veterans to enter the teaching \nprofession and that this bipartisan bill would further enhance the \nTroops-to-Teachers program. Simply put, the proposed legislation would \nreduce the years of military service requirements from 6 to 4, extend \nthe eligibility to all schools that receive Title I funds, and create \nan advisory board that would coordinate and make recommendations to \nCongress in regards to the program.\n  Current eligibility guidelines for the Troops to Teachers require \nthat members of the military have 6 years of service and that members \nof the guard and reserve have 10 years of service with a commitment to \nserve an additional 3 years. The requirement of 6 years active duty is \nleaving many single enlistment contract 4 year veterans and/or Guard \nmembers out of consideration. Lowering the required years of service \nwould expand eligibility and create a larger pool of potential teachers \nfor this program.\n  Under the current Troops to Teachers program, participants who agree \nto teach for 3 years in a ``high need'' schools are eligible to receive \na $5000 stipend to offset the cost of teacher certification. The \nproposed legislation would extend the eligibility for the stipend to \nany eligible teacher who agrees to teach 3 years in a school that is in \na district receiving Title I funds. The proposed bill would retain the \noptional bonus of $10,000 which is available to individuals who take \njobs in low-income schools. This legislation would result in a 49 \npercent in the number of eligible schools for the program. For my home \nState of Arizona, over 600 additional schools would become eligible to \nparticipate in the program.\n  A recent GAO Report revealed that although Troops to Teachers is a \nsuccessful program, it suffers from a lack of coordination and \noversight. To remedy this concern, the proposed legislation would \ncreate an advisory board that consists of a representative from the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Education, and representatives \nfrom state offices and veteran's service organizations to make \nrecommendations on ways to improve and expand the program.\n  Our veterans make excellent candidates to impart the virtues of \nserving to a cause to the next generation and instill the value of \nlearning as a means to self-improvement and much nobler ends. Their \nunique experiences bring a more diverse teaching environment to our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Udall of New Mexico):\n  S. 1933. A bill to establish an integrated Federal program that \nprotects, restores, and conserves natural resources by responding to \nthe threats and effects of climate change, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Natural \nResources Climate Adaptation Act. I am pleased that Senators \nWhitehouse, Baucus, and Tom Udall have joined me as original \ncosponsors.\n  The science is clear that climate change is happening and numerous \nscientific reports as well as the everyday experience of many \nAmericans--demonstrate that the impacts have already begun to affect \necosystems across the country. This bill recognizes that quick action \nis needed to insure the long-term viability of ecosystems on which our \ncommunities as well as our fish and wildlife depend. It will support \nand enable Federal and State agencies and other interested parties to \naddress the negative impacts of climate change on our natural resources \nin the most effective possible ways.\n  We know that healthy, functioning ecosystems are vital to human \nhealth, economic viability, and fish and wildlife populations. I \nbelieve that we are at a critical juncture in protecting our valuable \nnatural resources. In solving the climate change problem we must ensure \nthe well-being of our natural world if we are to have a thriving \neconomy and a healthy environment. This is the reason I am introducing \nthis bill.\n  This is not a problem that is hypothetical. Climate change impacts \nare irrevocably affecting our natural world and the health of our \ncommunities today, and these impacts will increase. We must act now.\n  We often forget that healthy ecosystems are essential to human as \nwell as wildlife needs. They are necessary to provide us, for example, \nwith a clean and abundant drinking water supply, clean air to breathe, \nand a well-functioning economy in addition to habitat for a diversity \nof fish, wildlife, and plant species. Not to mention a place to take \nour children fishing, and to enjoy the personal inspiration of the \nnatural world.\n  My home State of New Mexico is a dry State and the challenges \nassociated with climate change are already impacting our land and our \nwater supplies. There are already many competing demands for our \nlimited water resources which will only be heightened by the effects of \nclimate change. Existing threats to our public lands such as wildfires \nand deforestation may become more prevalent. New Mexico's Bandelier \nNational Park has recently been identified as one of the ``25 National \nParks in Peril'' due to climate change related impacts and other \ntreasures within our State may also be in jeopardy of degradation if \nactions are not taken to protect them.\n  Our landowners, ranchers, water managers, and State officials are \nworking to evaluate and mitigate the current and expected impacts of a \nwarming climate on our State's natural resources and water supply. For \ninstance, in 2005 the New Mexico Climate Change Council and Advisory \nGroup prepared a report summarizing the potential impacts of climate \nchange in New Mexico\n\n[[Page S10781]]\n\nand the State Engineer's office prepared an additional report on the \nimpacts of climate change on the water supply and water management \nstrategies. These reports are being used to guide State officials in \naddressing these issues. In addition, New Mexico has joined other \nwestern States to form the Western Regional Climate Initiative to \ncoordinate efforts at reducing greenhouse gases.\n  The legislation introduced today seeks to complement existing natural \nresources-related programs in New Mexico and other States across the \ncountry. This legislation supports and facilitates the development and \ndissemination of scientific research on climate change between Federal \nagencies, States, Indian tribes and interested stakeholders. This \nongoing research will in turn play a significant role in guiding these \nentities in the management of our natural resources.\n  This bill also establishes several forums to encourage effective \ncoordination and communication in creating a Federal strategy and \nsubsequent Federal and State adaptation plans that will help natural \nresources adjust to a changing climate. Finally, the Act provides \nadditional funding for existing Federal and State wildlife conservation \nprograms to be used exclusively for adaptation-related activities.\n  The Natural Resources Climate Adaptation Act follows on the good work \nof several of my colleagues in both the House and the Senate. Chairman \nRahall and Subcommittee Chairman Grijalva have developed legislation in \nthis area, and their own adaptation bill, H.R. 2192, was incorporated \ninto the broader cap-and-trade legislation that passed the House of \nRepresentatives earlier this year.\n  Senators Kerry and Boxer have adopted provisions similar to this bill \nin their climate legislation at the request of two leaders on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee: Senators Baucus and Whitehouse. \nThe legislation I am introducing today is complementary to the work \nthat has already been done. My cosponsors and I share the same goal of \nmaking sure natural resources adaptation is included in any climate \nchange legislation that comes before the Senate.\n  Many Americans already recognize the critical need for this \nlegislation. A coalition of over 600 diverse groups has written to \nCongress describing the current and potential negative impacts of \nclimate change on our natural resources and urging us to include \nlanguage in any climate bill to address those impacts. By way of \nexample, the groups in this coalition include environmental \norganizations, local Rod & Gun Clubs, fisheries coalitions, scientific \nresearch groups, and religious groups.\n  If we fail to act to address the impacts of climate change on our \nAmerican landscape, the negative effects will be felt by all of us. I \nam committed to working through this legislation and other means to \nensure that we do what is necessary to protect our precious natural \nresources from one of the greatest challenges ever faced.\n  I would like to thank Senators Baucus, Whitehouse, and Tom Udall for \ntheir leadership on this issue and their cosponsorship of this bill. I \nlook forward to working with them and our colleagues to pass \nlegislation to carry out this important purpose.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1933\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prevent \nthe avoidance of tax on income from assets held abroad, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nForeign Account Tax Compliance Act of 2009.\n  The bill gives the IRS powerful tools to find US taxpayers who are \nhiding their money in offshore accounts. It includes strong incentives \nfor individuals to properly report income from assets held in offshore \naccounts. The days of sending your money offshore to avoid paying US \ntaxes are over.\n  This package is the result of a collaborative effort with the House \nand has the support of the White House and the Treasury Department. It \nis fully consistent with the policies in the preliminary draft of \noffshore compliance proposals that I released in March of this year to \ndetect, deter, and discourage offshore tax evasion.\n  The bill is a practical solution to a very challenging problem. For \nthe first time, the tax law would authorize the IRS to receive \ninformation reports from foreign financial institutions disclosing the \nidentities of their US account holders and the amounts being held in \nthe accounts.\n  Individuals with offshore accounts would be required to provide \ndetails of those accounts on their tax returns.\n  Trust rules would be significantly strengthened to prevent the true \nbeneficiaries from hiding behind a nominee owner.\n  It will not be so easy to hide your money from Uncle Sam anymore.\n  Following the recommendation of the Government Accountability Office, \nthe IRS would have more time, up to 6 years, to find and examine \nunreported and misreported offshore transactions.\n  Robust penalties would be in place for those who still try to skirt \nthe rules.\n  This bill would improve tax compliance without raising taxes on \nanyone. These are taxes that already are legally owed.\n  Those who game the tax system by hiding their money in offshore \naccounts, like those in the recent UBS scandal, unfairly shift the tax \nburden to honest taxpayers who comply with their tax obligations. The \nIRS estimates that up to 52,000 individuals hid billions of dollars in \noffshore accounts through UBS.\n  Offshore tax evasion is a significant part of the tax gap and it has \ngone on long enough.\n  I believe this bill will be a turning point in putting an end to \noffshore tax evasion.\n  I look forward to working with my Colleagues here in the Senate and \nin the House to enact this important piece of legislation this year.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ROCKEFELLER (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. Lautenberg, \n        Mr. Schumer, Mr. Thune, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 1938. A bill to establish a program to reduce injuries and deaths \ncaused by cellphone use and texting while driving; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am introducing comprehensive, \nbipartisan legislation to reduce deaths and injuries caused by drivers \ntexting and holding cell phones, I am delighted to have four original \ncosponsors join me today: Senator Hutchison, the ranking member of the \nSenate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee; Senator \nLautenberg, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee's Surface \nTransportation and Merchant Marine Infrastructure, Safety and Security \nSubcommittee, Senator Schumer, and Mr. Thune, the ranking member of the \nSurface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee.\n  According to the Department of Transportation, distracted drivers \nlast year killed 5,800 people. Distraction was a factor in 16 percent \nof all traffic fatalities. In addition, distracted drivers injured \n515,000 people, which accounted for 22 percent of all people injured in \ntraffic accidents.\n  Distracted driving covers a range of activities: eating, reaching for \nan object, texting, or using a cell phone. An analysis of 5,471 \npassenger vehicle crashes investigated by the National Highway Traffic \nSafety Administration, NHTSA, found that 18 percent of drivers just \nprior to the crash were engaged in at least one non-driving activity, \nwhich included cell phone use.\n  We all know that the explosion of cell phone use and texting in the \npast three years has brought distracted driving to a new level of \ndanger. Now we have the new data, provided by the same researchers who \nrecord seat belt use levels for NHTSA: at any given daylight hour, 11 \npercent of vehicles are driven by a person holding a hand-held \nelectronic device. That translates into 812,000 drivers not paying full \nattention to driving at any given moment of the day, which makes our \nroads more dangerous for everyone.\n  The statistics regarding deaths and injuries caused by distracted \ndrivers provide the foundation for us to act. But the tragic, \nindividual stories of deaths and injuries to innocent people compel us \nto act.\n  In October 2008, 29-year-old Tiffany DeGroft was exchanging text \nmessages with her boyfriend while driving her Jaguar on Braddock Road \nin Centreville, Virginia. The text messages indicate that her boyfriend \nwas upset. His last text message read: ``Why aren't you answering me \nnow?'' Tiffany DeGroft did not answer because her car had missed a \ncurve in the road. She was killed on impact. A Fairfax County detective \nsaid, ``We found the phone on the floor in the open position. I suspect \nshe was actually reading the text.''\n\n  While that story is tragic, it becomes even more so when the person \ntexting doesn't kill himself or herself, but innocent persons instead.\n  In September 2008, 13-year-old Margay Schee in Marion County, FL, was \nriding home from school in a school bus. A truck driver, who by his own \nadmission was distracted by a cell phone conversation, slammed into the \nback of the bus, which had its flashers on while stopped. The bus \ncaught fire, killing Margay in a vehicle that is designed to protect \nchildren.\n  In September 2006, college student Reggie Shaw sent 11 text messages \nover 30 minutes to his girlfriend as he drove his truck along a two-\nlane highway in rural Utah. Shaw sent the last text message one minute \nbefore he called police about the accident. Investigators concluded \nthat Shaw sent that last text message just as he crossed the yellow \nline of the rural highway, striking an oncoming car. James Furaro and \nKeith O'Dell, both rocket scientists, were killed instantly.\n  Unlike some highway safety issues that are complicated to address, \nthis one is not. Writing and reading text messages while driving a \n2,000-pound vehicle is dangerous--not only for the driver, but also for \nthe driver's passengers and everyone else using the roads. Crashes \ninvolving commercial vehicles--such as trucks and buses--can result in \neven more catastrophic accidents than passenger cars. An 80,000-pound \ntruck will crush a small car like a soda can.\n  Texting takes a driver's eyes off the road for at least four seconds \nat a time--long enough at high speeds to travel the length of a \nfootball field. Under those circumstances, there is no time to react to \na stopped car, a stop sign, or another road hazard. In fact, a recent \nstudy by the Virginia Tech Transportation Instistitute on behalf of the \nFederal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, FMCSA, found that motor \nvehicle operators who are texting are 23 times more likely to cause a \ncrash, or near-crash, than a non-distracted driver. Deaths and injuries \nto innocent people are the inevitable and tragically avoidable result.\n  In 2006, the National Transportation Safety Board, after \ninvestigating several accidents, made a recommendation to the FMCSA to \nban cell phone use by commercial driver's license holders who have \nendorsements to carry passengers or drive school buses. I commend the \nTransportation Secretary's recent actions to begin addressing these \nrecommendations. But I am concerned that the Department of \nTransportation should be doing more to eliminate these unsafe driver \ndistractions.\n  Several States have taken action to ban texting while driving, and to \nlimit cell phone use to hands-free devices.\n\n[[Page S10786]]\n\nBut not enough states have done so. Since Constitutional considerations \nprohibit the federal government from directing states to enact traffic \nlaws, we at the federal level can only give states funding incentives \nto act with regard to passenger vehicle drivers. That is why I am today \nintroducing the Distracted Driving Prevention Act of 2009.\n\n  First, this legislation would create a grant program to send money to \nstates that enact laws to prohibit texting and hand-held cell phone use \nwhile driving. While we wish the states would enact these common-sense \nsafety measures on their own, the history of highway safety tells us \nthat many states will fail to act unless we give them an incentive to \ndo so.\n  To qualify for a federal grant, a state must enact an absolute ban on \ntexting while driving. No exceptions. There should be no exception for \na driver taking his or her eyes off the road. For states to receive the \ngrant, the prohibition on texting must have significant penalties, \nincluding increased fines and other penalties for a driver who causes \nan accident while texting.\n  The second requirement for a State to receive a grant is to enact a \nlaw that bans holding a cell phone while driving. When people drive, \nboth hands should be on the wheel. The grant program does not ask \nstates to completely ban cell phone use by drivers; our legislation \nwould allow the use of a hands-free device during a phone call. We also \nallow states to make exceptions for holding a cell phone to call for \nemergency services.\n  States qualifying for the grant must completely ban cell phone use by \ndrivers under the age of 18. A driver under 18 years old may not even \nuse a hands-free device. For these inexperienced drivers, the \nadditional distraction of using a cell phone can be deadly. Many \nparents already encourage their teenage drivers to not use a cell phone \nwhile driving. But having the police enforce this law will be even more \neffective.\n  With more States enacting a ban on texting and hand-held cell phone \nuse, we need to get the message out so that drivers obey the law. Our \nlegislation would create a new national education campaign based upon \nthe tremendous success of the recent drunk driving and seat belt \nadvertising campaigns. These advertising campaigns are not only an \nopportunity to remind people of the law, but also a means by which to \neducate drivers about the dangers of texting and cell phone use. This \neducation can change driver behavior even when law enforcement might \nnot be present.\n  In addition to nationwide advertising, we also will direct NHTSA to \ntarget some local markets with advertising in states and cities that \nhave already passed texting and cell phone use laws.\n  Unlike passenger vehicle drivers, a truck driver's vehicle is also \nhis or her office space. Devices to receive directions, follow-up on \norders, or maintain contact with dispatchers are necessary to perform a \ntruck driver's duties. These devices, too, can become distractions, as \nthey require eyes and attention to be removed from the roadway. \nTherefore, this legislation would require the Secretary of \nTransportation to issue regulations within one year specifically on the \nuse of electronic and wireless devices by commercial motor vehicle \ndrivers and those who operate certain school buses. The Secretary would \nbe authorized to ban the use of certain devices if the Secretary \ndetermines that they interfere with the safe operation of a commercial \nmotor vehicle. The bill also would allow the Secretary to permit \nexceptions for emergency uses. We need to make sure that commercial \nmotor vehicle drivers are operating their trucks and buses in the \nsafest manner possible.\n  Furthermore, this legislation will require that states, as part of \ntheir federal grant for data collection, begin collecting distracted \ndriving data about each vehicle crash, starting with the police reports \nof the crash. By requiring law enforcement officers to inquire about \nthe possible role that texting or cell phone use might have played in a \ncrash, and requiring states to collect that data, we can better \nunderstand the scope and causes of the distracted driving problem.\n  To bolster the new data collection at the state level, this \nlegislation would require the Transportation Secretary to establish a \ndedicated program at the Transportation Department to study all forms \nof distracted driving across all modes of transportation. Better \nresearch is essential to finding the best strategies for reducing \ndeaths and injuries caused by distracted driving.\n  This legislation also charges the Federal Communications Commission \nwith studying potential initiatives to raise awareness and reduce the \nproblems caused by distracted driving. By bringing aboard the agency \nwith oversight of wireless carriers, we add another stakeholder that \ncan help us develop creative solutions to address this problem.\n  One last note about this legislation: it is paid for. The grant \nprogram that encourages states to enact a primary seat belt law has run \na surplus in recent years as the number of states enacting a new \nprimary seat belt law has slowed. Any state that enacts a new primary \nseat belt law in 2010 and 2011 would still receive their safety belt \ngrant. But the remainder of the funding for that program will be \nredirected for the nationwide distracted driving advertising campaigns, \nand sent as grants to states that prohibit texting and hand-held cell \nphone use.\n  Creating incentives for states to take action against distracted \ndriving, launching a nationwide campaign to educate drivers about the \ndangers of texting and cell phone use, and collecting better data about \ndriver behavior will result in fewer deaths and injuries on our \nnation's roads.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this comprehensive bill that will save \nlives and prevent injuries by reducing distracted driving.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/27/senate-section/article/S10786-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 323--HONORING EDWARD W.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Democratic Republic of Congo was devastated by a \n     civil war carried out in 1996 and 1997 and a war that began \n     in 1998 and ended in 2003, which resulted in widespread human \n     rights violations and the intervention of multiple armed \n     forces or armed non-state actors from other countries in the \n     region.\n       (2) Despite the signing of a peace agreement and subsequent \n     withdrawal of foreign forces in 2003, the eastern region of \n     the Democratic Republic of Congo has continued to suffer from \n     high levels of poverty, insecurity, and a culture of \n     impunity, in which illegal armed groups and military forces \n     continue to commit widespread human rights abuses.\n       (3) According to a study by the International Rescue \n     Committee released in January 2008, conflict and related \n     humanitarian crisis in the Democratic Republic of Congo have \n     resulted in the deaths of an estimated 5,400,000 people since \n     1998 and continue to cause as many as 45,000 deaths each \n     month.\n       (4) Sexual violence and rape remain pervasive tools of \n     warfare used by all parties in eastern region of the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo to terrorize and humiliate \n     communities, resulting in community break down which causes a \n     decrease in the ability of affected communities to resist \n     control by illegal armed forces and a loss of community \n     access to minerals. Sexual violence and rape affect hundreds \n     of thousands of women and girls, frequently resulting in \n     traumatic fistula, other severe genital injuries, and long-\n     term psychological trauma.\n       (5) A report released by the Government Accountability \n     Office in December 2007 describes how the mismanagement and \n     illicit trade of extractive resources from the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo supports conflict between militias and \n     armed domestic factions in neighboring countries.\n       (6) In October 2002, the United Nations Group of Experts on \n     the Democratic Republic of Congo called on member states of \n     the United Nations to adopt measures, consistent with the \n     guidelines established for multinational enterprises by the \n     Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, to \n     ensure that enterprises in their jurisdiction do not abuse \n     principles of conduct that they have adopted as a matter of \n     law.\n       (7) In February 2008, the United Nations Group of Experts \n     on the Democratic Republic of Congo stated, ``individuals and \n     entities buying mineral output from areas of the eastern part \n     of the Democratic Republic of Congo with a strong rebel \n     presence are violating the sanctions regime when they do not \n     exercise due diligence to ensure their mineral purchases do \n     not provide assistance to illegal armed groups'' and defined \n     due diligence as including the following:\n       (A) Determining the precise identity of the deposits from \n     which the minerals they intend to purchase have been mined.\n       (B) Establishing whether or not these deposits are \n     controlled or taxed by illegal armed groups.\n       (C) Refusing to buy minerals known to originate, or \n     suspected to originate, from deposits controlled or taxed by \n     illegal armed groups.\n       (8) In its final report, released on December 12, 2008, the \n     United Nations Group of Experts on the Democratic Republic of \n     the Congo found that official exports of columbite-tantalite, \n     cassiterite, wolframite, and gold are grossly undervalued and \n     that various illegal armed groups in the eastern region of \n     the Democratic Republic of Congo continue to profit greatly \n     from these natural resources by coercively exercising control \n     over mining sites from where they are extracted and locations \n     along which they are transported for export.\n       (9) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1857, \n     unanimously adopted on December 22, 2008--\n       (A) broadens existing sanctions relating to the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo to include ``individuals or entities \n     supporting the illegal armed groups . . . through illicit \n     trade of natural resources,''; and\n       (B) encourages member countries to ensure that companies \n     handling minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo \n     exercise due diligence on their suppliers.\n       (10) Continued weak governance in the Democratic Republic \n     of Congo has allowed the illicit trade in the minerals \n     columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite, and gold to \n     flourish, which empowers illegal armed groups, undermines \n     local development, and results in a loss or misuse of tax \n     revenue for the Government of the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo. The development of stronger governance and economic \n     institutions that support legitimate cross-border trade in \n     such minerals would--\n       (A) help prevent the exploitation of such minerals by \n     illegal armed groups; and\n       (B) enable the hundreds of thousands of people who depend \n     on such minerals for their livelihoods to benefit from such \n     minerals.\n       (11) Metals derived from columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, \n     wolframite, and gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo \n     are used in diverse technological products sold worldwide, \n     including mobile telephones, laptop computers, and digital \n     video recorders.\n       (12) In February 2009, the Electronic Industry Citizenship \n     Coalition and the Global e-Sustainability Initiative released \n     a statement asserting that--\n       (A) use by the information communications technology \n     industry of mined commodities that support conflict in such \n     countries as the Democratic Republic of Congo is \n     unacceptable; and\n       (B) electronics companies can and should uphold responsible \n     practices in their operations and work with suppliers to meet \n     social and environmental standards with respect to the raw \n     materials used in the manufacture of their products.\n       (13) Notwithstanding the extensiveness of the supply chains \n     of technological products and the extensiveness of the \n     processing\n\n[[Page S10789]]\n\n     stages for the metals derived from columbite-tantalite, \n     cassiterite, wolframite, and gold used in such products, \n     companies that create and sell products that include such \n     metals have the ability to influence the situation in the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo by--\n       (A) exercising due diligence in ensuring that their \n     suppliers provide raw materials in a manner that does not--\n       (i) directly finance armed conflict;\n       (ii) result in labor or human rights violations; or\n       (iii) damage the environment;\n       (B) verifying--\n       (i) the country from which the minerals used to derive such \n     metals originate;\n       (ii) the identity of the exporter of the minerals; and\n       (iii) that all appropriate tax payments are made; and\n       (C) committing to support mineral exporters from the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo who--\n       (i) fully disclose their export payments; and\n       (ii) certify that their minerals do not--\n\n       (I) directly finance armed conflict;\n       (II) result in labor or human rights violations; or\n       (III) damage the environment.\n\n     SEC. 602. STATEMENT OF POLICY.\n\n       It is the policy of the United States, as affirmed by the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo Relief, Security, and \n     Development Promotion Act of 2006 (Public Law 109-456; 22 \n     U.S.C. 2151 note) and consistent with United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1857 (2008), to promote peace and security \n     in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo by supporting \n     efforts of the Government of the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo, other governments in the Great Lakes Region of Africa, \n     and the international community--\n       (1) to monitor and stop commercial activities involving the \n     natural resources of the Democratic Republic of Congo that \n     contribute to illegal armed groups and human rights \n     violations in the Democratic Republic of Congo; and\n       (2) to develop stronger governance and economic \n     institutions that can facilitate and improve transparency in \n     the cross-border trade involving the natural resources of the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo in order to reduce exploitation \n     by illegal armed groups and promote local and regional \n     development.\n\n     SEC. 603.

or\n       (3) damage the environment.\n       (d) Strategy.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall, \n     working with the Administrator of the United States Agency \n     for International Development, submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a strategy to address the linkages \n     that exist between human rights abuses, armed groups, and the \n     mining of columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite, and \n     gold in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n       (2) Contents.--The strategy required by paragraph (1) shall \n     include the following:\n       (A) A plan to assist the Government of the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo and other governments in the region in \n     establishing and effectively implementing the necessary \n     frameworks and institutions to formalize and improve \n     transparency in the trade of columbite-tantalite, \n     cassiterite, wolframite, and gold.\n       (B) An outline of assistance currently being provided and \n     an assessment of future assistance that could be provided by \n     the Government of the United States to help the Government of \n     the Democratic Republic of Congo strengthen the management \n     and export of natural resources in the eastern region of the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo.\n       (C) A description of punitive measures that could be taken \n     against individuals or entities whose commercial activities \n     are supporting illegal armed groups and human rights \n     violations in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.\n       (e) Annual Human Rights Reports.--In preparing those \n     portions of the annual Country Reports on Human Rights \n     Practices relating to the Democratic Republic of Congo or \n     countries that share a border with the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo, the Secretary of State shall ensure that such reports \n     include a description of any instances or patterns of \n     practice that indicate that the extraction and cross-border \n     trade in columbite-tantalite, cassiterite, wolframite, or \n     gold has negatively affected human rights conditions or \n     supported specific human rights violations, sexual or gender-\n     based violence, or labor abuses in the eastern region of the \n     Democratic Republic of Congo, during the period covered by \n     each report.\n       (f) Annual Organization for Economic Co-Operation and \n     Development Investment Committee Report.--In preparing the \n     United States' annual report to the Organization for Economic \n     Co-operation and Development Investment Committee, the \n     Secretary of State shall include a description of efforts by \n     the United States to ensure, consistent with the Organization \n     for Economic Co-operation and Development Guidelines for \n     Multinational Enterprises, that enterprises under United \n     States jurisdiction are exercising due diligence to ensure \n     that their purchases of minerals or metals are not \n     originating from mines and trading routes that are used to \n     finance or benefit illegal armed groups in the Democratic \n     Republic of Congo.\n       (g) Authorization of Appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to the Secretary of State for fiscal year \n     2010 such sums as may be necessary for the Secretary to carry \n     out the provisions of this section.\n       (h) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on Appropriations, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, and the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs of the Senate;
