Mr. President, following leader remarks, if any, we will \nresume consideration of H.R. 1105, the appropriations bill. The floor \nis open for debate and amendment. There will be no rollcall votes \nduring today's session. I have spoken to the Republican leader and \nassistant leader. We expect to have a finite list of amendments that \nwill be entered into the Record within the next hour.\n  I know it is very difficult for people to understand the Senate \nsometimes. For those of us who have served in this body for an extended \nperiod, it is even difficult sometimes for us. But it is a wonderful \ninstitution that has a long list of precedents building up since we \nbecame a country. The Founding Fathers, when they wrote the \nConstitution, wanted a unique legislative system, and they gave us one. \nThe House of Representatives is elected every 2 years. No one has ever \nbeen appointed to serve in the House of Representatives. If someone \nresigns or dies, there is a new election. In the Senate, that is not \nthe case. There are 6-year terms and 2-year terms. The House runs every \n2 years. Their ears are in tune with the constituency like no one else. \nWe are, some say, the saucer that cools the coffee. Sometimes we cool \nit for a long period. But that is the rules. An individual Senator has \ntremendous power. This isn't anything new. This is the way it has \nalways been. I want everyone to recognize that the Senate is an \ninstitution that works on comity. We have to work together.\n  We are proceeding forward on this large spending bill to make up work \nthat we had not completed the last several years. We thought we were \ngoing to finish last night. A significant number of Republicans wanted \nmore amendments. As a result, a number of my Republican friends called \nme and said: We think we need more amendments. We know we said we were \ngoing to vote to end debate, but we believe there should be more \ndebate. I wish I had not received those phone calls, but I understand \nhow the Senate works. No one broke their word to me. It was a \nmisunderstanding only.\n  We are where we are. I have spoken to the Republican leadership, \nSenator McConnell and Senator Kyl. Within the next little bit we will \nhave a finite list of amendments. We will work our way through those. \nIt is my understanding Senator McCain is going to be here today to \noffer an amendment. There are a number of other Senators who are going \nto offer amendments. We will work through these.\n  It is my understanding that the House is going to, within an hour or \nso, do a CR that will take us through Wednesday. I will work with the \nRepublican leader. I will probably file cloture today to make sure we \nhave some instrument to move forward on. We can arrange the time \nwhenever we want. The reason we will go that way, it was set up last \nnight procedurally that if there were 60 votes on cloture, there would \nautomatically be a third reading of the underlying bill. That is what \nwe will do again so there is no need to have two separate votes. We \nwill do our best to give everyone ample time as to when this vote will \ntake place, the reason being, Senator Kennedy is back now. We were \nhappy to see him yesterday. He looks great. He was at the White House \nfor a health conference.\n\n[[Page S2856]]\n\nWe want to make sure we give him ample time to be here. He is receiving \nsome of his treatment outside Washington, DC.\n  I think that pretty well outlines where we are.\n  We are the Senate. We were last night and we are today. We will work \nthrough the legislation as quickly as we can and move on to other \nthings. We have important work to do. We have some nominations we will \ntry to do the first part of the week, but we can do those the latter \npart of the week. The House passed some bankruptcy legislation. I spoke \nto the Republican leader about that today. We might go to that. We have \nthe lands bill that might be coming back to us. We have lots to do. We \nhave 4 weeks left in this work period and a lot remaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/06/senate-section/article/S2856-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 615\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak in reference to an \namendment which I believe will be included in the list of amendments by \nthe Republican side. It relates to the DC voucher program. Senator John \nEnsign of Nevada is offering an amendment that will be part of our \nconsideration on Monday or Tuesday relative to the future of the DC \nvoucher program. The DC voucher program was created 5 years ago at a \ntime when the Republicans were in control of the White House and of \nCongress. What they offered to the District of Columbia was an offer \nthey couldn't refuse, a substantial amount of money--I believe it was \n$14 million--for the public schools of the District, another $14 \nmillion for the public charter schools, and about $14 million to create \na DC voucher program. The theory behind the DC voucher program is that \nthey would award this Federal money to families with children in \nvoucher schools, private schools, not public schools. They could use \nthis money to pay for tuition to send their children to these schools.\n  This is the first of its kind where the Federal Government would \ndirectly provide money to parents to send children to private schools. \nIt is an experiment. It was described as such. It was initiated 5 years \nago when the Republicans were in control. It came through the \nAppropriations Committee. Senator Mike DeWine of Ohio was one of its \nstrong proponents.\n  We considered several amendments in the committee. I came to this \nwith mixed feelings but skepticism, mixed feelings because I am not an \nopponent of private education. My wife and I sent our three children to \nCatholic schools. That was our choice. We continued to pay our property \ntaxes to support public schools. I have openly supported public school \nreferenda in my community. I have done everything in my State to make \nsure there was adequate funding for public schools, but we made a \npersonal family decision, based on a number of circumstances, to send \nour children to the local Catholic schools. That was our decision at \nour expense. I have no prejudice against private education. If I \nentrusted my children to it, I certainly believe in it.\n  But the question always came up in my mind: Who should pay for it. We \nwere prepared as a family to pay for it. It was an extra sacrifice we \nwere prepared to bear.\n  The argument behind DC voucher schools is that some families can't or \nwon't bear that burden of the cost of private education. So they should \nhave direct Federal subsidy, Federal payments to defray or defer any \ncost of tuition. That was the theory behind it.\n  My skepticism had a lot to do with the fact that I think our first \nobligation is to the public school system. The DC public school system \nis struggling. Credit the new Mayor, Mr. Fenty; he has hired Michelle \nRhee, an extraordinarily talented young woman, to be chancellor of DC \nschools, and she is intent on improving the quality of the public \nschools. That is something we should invest in, something we should \nsupport.\n  The debate 5 years ago was interesting. I offered three amendments. \nThe first amendment said that any building used as a school under the \nDC voucher program had to pass the life safety code, had to be \ninspected as being safe for children to go to school. I guess one could \nsay it goes back to 50 years ago, my memory of the terrible Our Lady of \nAngels fire at the school in Chicago that killed so many children and \nnuns in the building and led to changes and stricter enforcement of the \nlife safety code for school structures in Illinois.\n  My goal in the DC voucher program was to establish at least a \ncomparable standard for the safety of buildings used for DC voucher \nstudents as buildings used as public schools. I don't think that is \nunreasonable. Every parent should have the peace of mind that their \nchild is safe in that building.\n  I offered the amendment in the Appropriations Committee. It was \ndefeated by those who argued we could not restrict or hamper DC voucher \nschools. As a consequence, they wanted to defeat my amendment. \nIncidentally, a GAO study, in November of 2007, on the DC voucher \nprogram showed the sites of some of the schools and specifically noted \nthat two of the schools operated without a certificate of occupancy as \nprivate day schools--just what I feared.\n  These are buildings--one looks like a private residence, the other \nlike a commercial building--that do not look like schools at all, and \nthey did not pass the basic standards for health and life safety that \nwe require of schools in the District of Columbia. So my amendment was \ndefeated.\n  The second amendment I offered said teachers in the DC voucher \nschools had to have a college degree. Now, that is a basic requirement \nof any teacher in public schools in DC or most States in\n\n[[Page S2857]]\n\nthe Union. The amendment was defeated, and the argument was made: No, \nno, no. DC voucher schools have to be ``creative.'' We have to open \nthis to people who do not have college degrees to teach.\n  Well, I am afraid of the mischief that would result from that, but my \namendment was defeated.\n  The third amendment I offered said DC voucher schools had to have the \nsame test administered in terms of student achievement as the DC Public \nSchools so at the end of the day we could compare performance and \noutput. Are the kids in voucher schools doing better or worse than the \nkids in DC Public Schools? If they are not doing any better, it \nchallenges the premise of this DC voucher program. My amendment was \ndefeated, rejected. ``People in the DC voucher schools should not be \nrestricted to the kind of achievement tests they offer.''\n  Now, those three amendments, I thought, waved three red flags: the \nbuildings did not have to be as safe as public schools, the teachers do \nnot have to have college degrees, and the schools would not be \nsubjected to the same achievement tests. Now, that does not say to me \nthe people creating the DC voucher program had a lot of confidence in \nwhat they were doing. They just wanted to make their point of \nestablishing a DC voucher program.\n  So 1,700 students now in Washington, DC, have benefited from this \nvoucher program and are at private schools. Some are Catholic schools; \nsome are not. Some are private. There are a wide variety of them. Some, \nthey say, are world-class schools, and others, frankly, are not.\n  Now, here we are coming up on the fifth anniversary of the passage of \nthis legislation and, in fact, the program was supposed to expire. It \nwas an experimental program. The authorization ended.\n  Well, I faced that when I wrote this appropriation for this year and \nsaid: I will tell you what I will do. I will extend the life of the DC \nvoucher program 1 additional year, and in that additional year, I think \nwe should have two things occur. First, the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs, under Senator Joe Lieberman's \nchairmanship, should have a hearing and consider reauthorization \nlegislation. What will be the next phase of the DC voucher program? \nWhat requirements will we impose on these schools in the next \nreauthorization? How are they doing? What mistakes were made?\n  I can tell you, the Government Accountability Office, in their survey \nback in 2007, found some serious issues in terms of the DC voucher \nprogram. The Washington Scholarship Fund, the group that runs the \nprogram, was a small operation, until they were given the \nadministration of this program. The Government Accountability Office \nsaid they did not believe they were fully prepared to handle a program \nwith millions of dollars.\n  The GAO also had serious concerns about the accounting and check-\nwriting process. Is it legitimate for us to ask questions about whether \ntaxpayers' dollars, subsidies to parents for DC vouchers, are being \nspent appropriately? Well, I hope so. Accountability should be demanded \nof all of us in all programs. But those who are for the voucher program \napparently do not want to go through this kind of investigation. Well, \nI do not believe that is a right approach.\n  The GAO said the processes are not integrated for accounting and \ncheck writing, and the WSF--at the time in November 2007--had to set up \na new system. They had concerns with information security. The \nWashington Scholarship Fund used temporaries for data entry, had \ninadequate password security--the list goes on and on. Some of these \nthings are easily corrected. Others go to the heart of the \nadministration of this program.\n  There were programmatic concerns too. On average, the Government \nAccountability Office found that students met income requirements, but \nless than 50 percent came from ``in need of improvement schools.'' See, \nthe idea was these kids would leave schools that were not good-\nperforming schools and go into voucher schools. Well, it turns out over \nhalf the kids were in schools that were doing a good job, at least by \nthe standards of public education. So that raised a question on the \nprogram.\n  They also noted students are clustered in a small number of schools. \nMr. President, 16 out of 60 schools enrolled 60 percent of the voucher \nstudents. In 7 schools, over 50 percent of the students enrolled \nreceived vouchers. So it was a handful of schools that were really the \nsubject of the voucher program.\n  The Washington Scholarship Fund is supposed to conduct site \ninspections and look at the financial stability of the school. Based on \nthe information provided to the GAO at the time of this report, it is \nunclear whether they conducted these thorough site visits.\n  So we said to the Lieberman committee--and, incidentally, Senator \nLieberman is favorably disposed toward this program. I do not recommend \nit to him or refer it to him or suggest he consider it believing he is \nprejudiced against it. He is not. He wants to support it, but he wants \nto make sure it is running well.\n  So we include a provision: Keep the program alive for another year. \nProtect all the students in the program. In the meantime, we should \nhave an authorization. The committee should investigate how it is being \nmanaged and decide what the future will be. What will the next 5 years \nlook like?\n  The legislation that created this said to the Department of \nEducation, specifically: The Secretary may make grants under this \nsection for a period of not more than 5 years to the Washington \nScholarship Fund. We extended it for 1 year. They knew creating the DC \nvoucher program it was a 5-year program. We gave them an additional \nyear so they could review this program and see how effective it might \nbe.\n  Now, there is a second part I put in this legislation which \napparently rankles some on the other side. Here is what it says: The \nWashington Government, the DC City Council, has to vote to continue the \nvoucher program. How unreasonable is that?\n  I heard this morning on NPR Senator Ensign say: Well, we know they \nare opposed to it, so we want to take away local control of this school \nprogram. I have not heard that very often from the Republican side nor \nfrom the Democratic side. I would not want to live in a political \njurisdiction where someone imposed a program on families and students \nwithout asking whether it was a reasonable thing to do, and in this \ncase, whether the DC Public School System should, in fact, absorb a \nvoucher program.\n  But on the Republican side of the aisle, most of whom voted against \nthe idea of giving DC voting rights in Congress, want to impose this. \nThis is their laboratory. This is where they want to have their \nexperiment on voucher schools, and they do not want close scrutiny. \nThey do not want an investigation. They do not want a reauthorization. \nThey want to continue this program indefinitely, funding millions of \ndollars into a program that has been found to have significant \ndeficiencies.\n  Until this bill that is before us today, there was no requirement \nthat teachers in DC voucher schools have college degrees, but I put \nthat requirement in the law. I lost that issue 5 years ago, and I think \nit is only reasonable we have that requirement today. So for the next \nyear they are going to have to have teachers with college degrees, and \nthe buildings have to be inspected. What is wrong with that? Would \nanyone want to send their kids to a school building that is dangerous \nor potentially dangerous? Apparently, some do. They want us to step \naway, not to have any scrutiny or any oversight over these school \nbuildings. I am not one of those, and I could not in good conscience \nallow this program to continue without having that requirement.\n  Now, I will be honest with you. I backed off of the achievement test \nrequirement after speaking to Chancellor Rhee. I said: Why don't they \nhave the same test?\n  She said: They should. But if you are only going to allow this \nprogram to continue under the law for 1 year, and it is uncertain what \nhappens after that, don't impose on them the costs of changing \nachievement tests. It costs millions of dollars. So let them stay with \nthe current achievement test, even though they cannot be compared to DC \nPublic School students with that achievement test.\n  So I deferred that, saying: Why impose a $2 or $3 million cost on \nthem? Let the authorization committee decide whether that ought to be \nthe case. I will certainly argue for it.\n\n[[Page S2858]]\n\n  So now we have the Republicans saying: We do not want the program \ninvestigated. We do not want it reauthorized. We do not want the people \nof the District of Columbia to have any say as to whether it will be \npart of their public school system. That is the Republican position. I \nthink it is unfair. I think it is unwise. I think it is bad policy.\n  If this program is good, it will stand on its own feet. If it is a \nprogram that needs improvement, let's make the improvement. If it is a \nprogram that has failed, let's move on and try something that will \nsucceed. We are talking about the lives of children.\n  I might also say, Chancellor Rhee, I think, comes to her job with the \nDC Public Schools with a fresh, positive attitude. We need to make sure \nall the kids in DC, whether they are in voucher schools or not, have a \nhigh-quality education. The same goes for my State of Illinois and the \nState of Virginia. That is our first obligation. So that is where we \nstand today.\n  The Ensign amendment is going to be offered. At that time, we will \nhave a chance to debate it even further. But we have funded the program \nthrough the next school year. Senator Lieberman has given his word to \nme and those who support the program on the other side that he will \nhave a timely hearing so we can get on with this review and \nreauthorization in a reasonable way.\n  Two separate studies by the Department of Education have clearly \ndemonstrated that the Washington voucher program has no statistically \nsignificant impact on student academic achievement. We knew this \nprogram was going to expire in 5 years. We need to ask whether the \nmoney might be better spent on some other approach, whether it is in \nthe DC Public Schools or into charter schools. It is time we take time \nfor careful and deliberate consideration of this program.\n  For those who have written in several publications: Durbin is just \nout to kill this program, I had a chance to do that, and I did not. I \nextended the program beyond its authorization for an additional year, \ngave them adequate funds to continue serving the students who are \ncurrently in the program, with the understanding, at least in the bill, \nthat we would take the time to carefully study the DC voucher program.\n  For those who believe in the voucher program, do not be afraid. Do \nnot be afraid to step forward and let people take a look at what has \nhappened. Let's see what the successes and failures of this program \nhave been and then decide how to go forward. I think that is a critical \nobjective we can achieve.\n\n\n                         Omnibus Appropriations\n\n  Mr. President, I would like to say one other word about the pending \nlegislation, the omnibus bill. I have listened to so many speeches on \nthis floor about earmarks. I made a point yesterday in television \ninterviews back in Illinois to make it clear what I was talking about \nin terms of projects coming back to our State that were earmarks.\n  I do not think I can be any more transparent about earmarks. What we \ndo in my offices is to put on our official Web site every request I \nmake for earmarked funds, congressionally directed spending from \nappropriations bills. For every single request, I indicate who is going \nto be the recipient, how much money was asked for, what is the nature \nof the request, and clearly make a statement that I have no conflict of \ninterest involved in making the request. I think that is required by \nlaw, and it is certainly a valuable requirement.\n  Then we go through the process of the Appropriations Committee \nchoosing those earmarks they can put into a bill. At the end of the \nday, we not only send out press releases in terms of those projects \nthat have been approved, we make it clear, so people know, start to \nfinish, every step of the way.\n  So when I was on the news yesterday, I said to some of the local \nnewscasters: The word ``earmark'' has such a negative connotation, but \nthe word ``earmark'' should be remembered in this context: I have \nmillions of dollars in this bill that will go to communities in the \nsuburbs of Chicago that have been dealing with serious flooding \nproblems for decades. We have made significant progress. I worked with \nMayor Tony Arredia in Des Plaines, IL, before he gave up the office \nrecently, and we protected many parts of his community that used to be \nregularly, annually devastated by floods--earmarks in appropriations \nbills for flood control.\n  The metropolitan area and sanitary district has this deep tunnel that \nwe put money into by earmark year after year after year, so that storm \nwater can be collected there and will not run off to integrate with the \nsanitary sewer system and will not cause degradation of Lake Michigan \nand rivers and tributaries nearby. That is one area.\n  The second area I focused on in the earmarks has been transportation. \nThere are specific earmarks in this bill for the expansion of the \nChicago Transit Authority and other transit systems in our area. They \nare struggling to survive with the recession. We are trying to make \nsure passengers do not have to pay outrageous amounts of money for them \nto continue to be successful in their operation.\n  Another earmark: $4 million in this bill goes for the Chicago \nshoreline on Lake Michigan. When they surveyed the people of Chicago a \nfew years ago and asked: What is the most important thing we have in \nour city that you are proudest of, they said: Lake Michigan, \noverwhelmingly. And they should. It is a beautiful expanse of water. \nAside from the scenery and the beauty of it, it is part of the Great \nLakes, one of the greatest sources of drinking water supplies in the \nworld.\n  So what we have done is to address a 100-year-old shoreline that was \ncrumbling and falling apart. I sat down with Mayor Daley. We entered \ninto an agreement with the Army Corps of Engineers. With this \nagreement, the city put money up-front. We came in with money on the \nFederal side. We have reduced the overall cost of the project and \naccelerated by years--as you drive along that lakefront, you can see \nthey are building a modern lakefront that will serve us for decades to \ncome. It is an earmark. It is an earmark in the bill.\n  When I hear people come to the floor saying: This is an outrage that \nall these earmarks are in the bill, I think to myself: There is nothing \noutrageous about this. We bragged about it. We have had press \nconferences about it. The people of our city think it is money well \nspent.\n\n  There is money in here as well going to hospitals to buy critical \nequipment. It is all listed--every single hospital, every single \ndollar--whether it is for research, cancer research, Alzheimer's \nresearch at universities, for example, or if it is buying critical \nequipment for hospitals that many times don't have the resources to do \nso. I try to help them out if I can. I think that is part of my job.\n  I listened to these overall criticisms of earmarks and I don't doubt \nthat pouring through the thousands that may be in here, we are going to \nfind some that are questionable. That is natural. One Congressman and \none Senator may think something is important to his district, his \ncommunity, his State; others may question it. That is part of the \nprocess. They should be questioned. But at the end of the day, to say \nthat when you take 1 percent of this bill and allow Members of Congress \nto zero in on specific issues in their States, in their districts, that \nthere is something inherently evil, wicked, criminal or wrong with it, \nit is not the case.\n  I wish to salute Senator Inouye, who is our chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee, for what he and Congressman David Obey, the \nHouse Appropriations Committee chairman, agreed to do, which is to \ndramatically cut back the overall cost of earmark projects. Under the \nRepublican leadership a few years ago, about 4 to 5 percent of an \nappropriations bill would be earmarked. They have brought it down to \njust over 1 percent. The goal is 1 percent. I don't think that is \nunreasonable, that 1 percent of the spending bill would be \ncongressionally directed in a transparent and open process; otherwise, \nwhat happens, we give the money to the agency downtown and they decide \nwhere to spend it. It isn't as if the money would not be spent; oh, it \nwill be spent, but it may not be spent as effectively or for projects \nthat are as valuable as many of us who represent these areas believe.\n  We could have given the money to the Army Corps of Engineers for the \nLake Michigan shoreline. I can say what would have happened. It would \nhave cost more, there would have been\n\n[[Page S2859]]\n\nless local contribution, and it would have taken many more years to get \nstarted. We avoided all that with the earmark process. I know there is \ngoing to be a lot of debate--some even this morning on this--but my \nfeeling is we are reaching the right balance of disclosure, \ntransparency, and limiting the number of earmark projects so the \ntaxpayers can have confidence that, at the end of the day, there is a \nprocess here and the scrutiny that there should be when it comes to \ntaxpayers' dollars. At the end of the day, some of my colleagues will \nnever be satisfied. They just will not be satisfied until every earmark \nis removed. I hope that doesn't happen. I think we can make the process \nbetter.\n\n\n                              U.S. Economy\n\n  Mr. President, I also wish to say a word about the state of our \neconomy today, if I can, and set it apart in the Record because this is \na historic anniversary week. As you may know, 76 years ago this week, \nexactly, on March 4, 1933, the President, Franklin Roosevelt, took the \noath of office for the first time. He faced an America broken to its \nknees--not by a war or an invasion but by a depression which had broken \nthe confidence of a proud nation.\n  It is hard for many people today to even imagine how frightened \nAmericans were the day after he became President. Jonathan Alter, a \nnews analyst for Newsweek, who comes from Chicago, recently wrote a \nbook about the transition and beginning of the F.D.R. Presidency called \n``The Defining Moment.'' He sketched the picture very well. He said at \nthat time America has experienced its gravest crisis since the Civil \nWar.\n  The American economic system had gone into a state of shock. Days \nbefore the F.D.R. inauguration, the New York Stock Exchange suspended \ntrading indefinitely and the Chicago Board of Trade bolted its doors \nfor the first time since it opened in 1848. In the 3 years since the \ncrash of the stock market, 16 million jobs had disappeared in 1933 and \nbusiness investment had dropped 90 percent. America's official \nunemployment rate was 25 percent. In some areas, it went as high as 80 \npercent when it came to adult men. More than 5,000 banks had failed. \nPeople who were unlucky enough to put their money in them had lost \neverything.\n  The great economist, John Maynard Keynes, was asked by a reporter at \nthe time if there was any precedent for what happened to the world \neconomy. He replied: Yes. It lasted for 400 years. It was called the \nDark Ages.\n  In his first inaugural address, Franklin Roosevelt told a shaken \nnation: ``Only a foolish optimist can deny the dark realities of the \nmoment.'' But then he went on to reassure America and said: ``The only \nthing we have to fear is fear itself--'' that famous phrase--\n``nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyzes needed \nefforts to convert retreat into advance.''\n  F.D.R. said we needed to abandon the failed ideas that led us into \neconomic crisis and try something new and bold. The Federal Government, \nthe President said, will treat the task of economic recovery ``as we \nwould treat the emergency of a war.''\n  What America needed, the new President said, was ``action, and action \nnow'' to put Americans back to work and restore strength to our economy \nand rebuild people's faith in the future. He assured us: ``This is no \nunsolvable problem if we face it wisely and courageously.''\n  Where are we today, 76 years later, 76 years after F.D.R. took that \noath of office on March 4, 1933? Another new President has inherited \nthe worst economic crisis since that historic day in 1933. This crisis \nis not another Great Depression, thank the Lord, but it is grave. It is \ndangerous. It is unlike any crisis we have seen in our lifetime. Sadly, \nit appears to be getting worse at this moment. America lost more jobs \nlast year than at any time since World War II. Manufacturing is at a \n28-year low. Many businesses can't borrow or make payroll. Many workers \nand retirees are seeing their life savings disappear. People have seen \nthe values of their homes and retirement plans plummet, and a large and \ngrowing number of Americans are uncertain and anxious about the future.\n  President Obama, sworn into office on January 20 of this year, has \nbeen in office a little over 6 weeks. He has made it clear we need to \nact and act quickly; otherwise, he says, the recession could linger on, \nunemployment could continue to grow, we could lose a generation of \npromise and potential as millions of Americans have to forgo college \nand a chance to train for jobs of the future. We could lose our \ncompetitive edge in the world if we don't act. In short, an already bad \nsituation could get worse. He proposed to Congress, soon after he was \nsworn in, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act--the most sweeping \nin history.\n  Similar to Franklin Roosevelt and Abraham Lincoln--another President \nwho inherited a major economic crisis during the Civil War--this \nPresident has said we must put our American house in order, put \nAmericans back to work, and invest in America's future. He has said the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act represents not just new policy \nbut new thinking; a new approach to meeting our most urgent challenges. \nIt will save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs over the next 2 \nyears while investing in priorities such as health care and education. \nIt enables us to rebuild America's crumbling infrastructure--the roads, \nthe bridges, the schools.\n  The economic recovery plan also includes help for States. My State of \nIllinois is in deep debt. We are hoping this recovery plan will help \nthem get through this difficult period. Also, it has a tax cut for most \nworking families. Ninety-five percent of them will receive this tax cut \nas soon as next month. It is a smart plan that invests in things that \nwork. Congress, the President, and respected economists agree now is \nnot the time to create new bureaucracies and new Government agencies. \nWe should use existing programs wherever possible to make sure the \nrecovery funds are invested quickly and efficiently to stabilize this \neconomy. We are relying on experienced and knowledgeable Government \nprofessionals, but as most of us know, there is no playbook you can \npick up at the library or find on a Web site. We are trying to make \nwise decisions based on economic experience.\n\n  I think this program we passed is a start, but the bill before us is \nequally important. This bill continues the function of Government. This \nbill allows many Federal agencies to continue with funding that is \nnecessary so they can perform valuable services. If we don't pass this \nbill, we will reduce the amount of money that is being spent by these \nagencies at a time when our economy needs the spending to create the \njobs to move us forward.\n  We are going to lose about $1 trillion in purchasing of goods and \nservices this year. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, along \nwith this piece of legislation, will try to provide some jump-start to \nthis economy, a catalyst for more economic recovery and growth, which \nis something we desperately need.\n  There is more that is needed as well. Next week I am going to, after \nwe finish this bill, be talking about the housing crisis we face. I \nhave been pushing for 2 years for a change in the bankruptcy law to \nallow the courts, as a last resort, to rewrite a mortgage. Last night, \nthat measure passed in the House of Representatives. I hope we can take \nit up. We are in the process of working out the details of our Senate \nversion now, and I hope that by next week we will be prepared to \npresent it to our colleagues. We need their help. Some of them were \nskeptical when I last offered it. Many Democrats voted against it. They \nsaid: Well, we think this can work itself out. Some of those same \nMembers have come to me since and said it didn't work. We thought the \nvoluntary approach was what was needed; it didn't do the job. There are \ntoo many foreclosures. It is not only hurting the lives of those who \nlose their homes but the people who live next door.\n  I think it was Secretary Geithner who used the analogy at a hearing \nthis week of someone who lives next door to a man who smokes in bed. \nWell, because of that unwise conduct, the man's house catches fire, and \nbecause of that fire in a closely packed neighborhood it endangers all \nthe houses nearby. Now, you can shake your finger and say you never \nshould have smoked in bed or you can pitch in and try to put out that \nfire because, if you don't, it could affect your home too. The same \nthing is happening here. Whether\n\n[[Page S2860]]\n\nthe right decisions were made at the outset, whether people borrowed \nwhen they shouldn't have, whether people were the victims of predatory \nlending, that will eventually work itself out and we will know more \nabout it; but in the meantime, we need to stabilize this housing \nmarket.\n  I listen to some of the great sources of information in America and \none of them is Jon Stewart with the ``Daily Show.'' He had a program \nearlier this week that was a classic. It involved a fellow named \nSantelli who, on a CNBC cable show, went into this what he called \nhimself, a rant over the idea that we would help people facing mortgage \nforeclosure. He was critical of the wisdom of these people in entering \ninto mortgages when they should have known better, making guesses about \ntheir economic future that turned out to be so wrong. Mr. Stewart, in a \nstyle which I find very entertaining and amusing, then proceeded to \nreplay the statements made by economists on CNBC who downplayed the \nthought of a recession, who suggested that many of the great banking \nhouses that have failed were going to do fine. He tried to make the \npoint that even some of the people who were screaming at those who \nentered into mortgages they shouldn't have entered into got it all \nwrong when they tried to analyze the economy and give advice to \nAmerica.\n  People do make mistakes. They should be allowed to recover from those \nmistakes in a situation where continued mortgage foreclosures could \njeopardize housing markets and the value of everyone's home for years \nto come. That issue will come up before us next week. I look forward to \nit.\n  At this point, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been \npresented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to read the \nmotion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on H.R. 1105, the \n     Omnibus Appropriations Act.\n         Harry Reid, Daniel K.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the list of \namendments in this agreement be the only first-degree amendments \nremaining in order to H.R. 1105; that no amendment be in order to any \nof the listed amendments prior to a vote in relation thereto; that the \namendments must be offered and debated Friday, March 6; Monday, March \n9; or Tuesday, March 10; further, that upon disposition of the \namendments and the Senate has voted on a motion to invoke cloture on \nH.R. 1105 and cloture having been invoked, all postcloture time be \nconsidered yielded back, the bill be read a third time, and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n  Here is the finite list of amendments: Ensign amendment No. 615, \nwhich is pending; Vitter amendment No. 621; Sessions amendment No. 604; \nMcCain amendment No. 593--he is in the Chamber now waiting to offer \nthat amendment--Thune amendment No. 662; Barrasso amendment No. 637, \nwhich I understand he will offer on Monday; Enzi amendment No. 668; Kyl \namendment No. 631; Kyl amendment No. 629; Kyl amendment No. 630; Kyl or \ndesignee amendment--we have a copy of the proposal--Cornyn amendment \nNo. 673; and Bunning amendment No. 665.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken with the Republican \nleadership, and we are going to try to have four of these votes \nstarting at 5:30 on Monday evening.\n\n\n           Unanimous Consent Agreement--Continuing Resolution\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if and when the \nSenate receives from the House a joint resolution which provides for \nthe continuation of Government funding until March 11, 2009, if it is \nidentical to the measure which is at the desk, it be considered read \nthree times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that if it is not identical, then this order be null and void.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. This will get us teed up to work next week. I made my \nstatement this morning. The Senate is the body that it is. It is \nsometimes difficult for even those of us who serve here to fully \ncomprehend. But I think this Congress has reached a point in time where \nwe are working together, when adversaries work together. It doesn't \nmean we always agree, but I think we all have the end in mind to try to \nhelp the country and move legislation forward.\n  I appreciate the work of my leadership, Senator Durbin. He spent the \nevening with me last night. We finished about midnight. He is such a \ngood friend. I appreciate the conversation I had with Senator McConnell \nand the many conversations I have had with Senator Kyl.\n  Everyone is working in good faith, and this Senate agreement \nindicates that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to lay aside the \npending amendment for the purpose of calling up three amendments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 631\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the first Kyl amendment is numbered 631.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 631.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

None of the funds appropriated or otherwise \n     made available by this Act may be made available to resettle \n     Palestinians from Gaza into the United States.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 630\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the third amendment is numbered 630.\n\n[[Page S2861]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 630.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require a report on counter-smuggling efforts in Gaza)\n\n       On page 942, between lines 14 and 15, insert the following:\n\n\n              report on counter-smuggling efforts in gaza\n\n       Sec. 7093.  Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State, in \n     consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, \n     shall submit to Congress a report on whether additional funds \n     from Foreign Military Financing assistance provided annually \n     to the Government of Egypt could be expended--\n       (1) to improve efforts by the Government of Egypt to \n     counter illicit smuggling, including arms smuggling, across \n     the Egypt-Gaza border; and\n       (2) to intercept weapons originating in other countries in \n     the region and smuggled into Gaza through Egypt.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, until Senator McCain arrives, let me briefly \ndescribe these three amendments.\n  Amendment No. 630 requires a report on countersmuggling efforts in \nGaza. Within 90 days of the enactment of the Act, the Secretary of \nState, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, \nshall submit a report to Congress on whether additional funds from our \nmilitary foreign financing assistance, provided annually to the \nGovernment of Egypt, could be expended, No. 1, to improve efforts by \nthe Government of Egypt to counter illicit smuggling, including arms \nsmuggling across Egypt and the Gaza border, and No. 2, to intercept \nweapons originating in other countries in the region and smuggled into \nGaza through Egypt. This amendment requires a report to ensure the \nEgyptian Government can be even more effective in dealing with this \ndifficult problem.\n  Amendment No. 629 is a prohibition on the use of funds in this bill \nfor resettlement into the United States of Palestinians from Gaza. \nThere has been a suggestion that perhaps that might be permitted, and \nwe simply want to make it clear that will not be permitted with any \nfunds in this bill.\n  Finally, related to Gaza reconstruction, amendment No. 631 provides \nthat none of the funds available in this bill may be made available to \naid reconstruction efforts in Gaza until the Secretary of State \ncertifies that none of such funds will be diverted to Hamas or entities \ncontrolled by Hamas. The reason for that, of course, is that in \nproviding money to people in Gaza, it is very difficult to ensure that \nmoney doesn't go to terrorists, and we want the Secretary of State to \nensure that doesn't happen. That is what this amendment would provide.\n  Mr. President, that is the explanation of these three amendments, and \nI now yield to my colleague from the State of Arizona, Senator McCain.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 593\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 593, which is at \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent for its consideration, \nunderstanding that under a previous unanimous consent agreement the \nvote on the amendment will be on Monday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the pending \namendment is set aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCAIN] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 593.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that further \nreading of the amendment be suspended.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n      (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds provided in the bill)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC _. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FUNDS.\n\n       None of the funds in this Act may be used for any project \n     listed in the statement of managers that is not listed and \n     specifically provided for in this Act.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. It would prohibit funds to be spent on the thousands \nof earmarks that are listed in the statement of managers but that are \nnot included in the bill text.\n  We have seen a remarkable evolution over the past number of years \nhere in the Senate and House as to how we do business, and I think \nthere is no greater example of it than what we are considering and \nhave, fortunately, not passed. This is the legislation. In itself, it \nis 1,122 pages. You can thumb through it anywhere, and you will find \nmoneys to be spent on various projects, none of which--or very few of \nwhich have ever been authorized or examined by the committees that have \njurisdiction. That in itself is interesting.\n  This is a funding mechanism to keep the Government in business. It \nalso happens to be an 8-percent increase in spending over last year. It \nalso happens that the majority, the Democrats on the majority side last \nyear, chose not to pass these appropriations bills because they knew, \nor expected, that they would have a larger majority in the Senate and \nHouse and they would be able to increase spending, which is exactly \nwhat happened--an 8-percent increase.\n  Here on the other side of my desk is ``statement of managers.'' That \nstatement of managers is 1,844 pages. Guess what it is filled with. The \nsame earmarks and porkbarrel projects that are in the bill itself. The \nstatement of managers used to basically just be a statement of the \nmanagers of the bill saying this is a bill that is being put forward \nand the reasons for it, the rationale for it. It used to be just a few \npages. Now it is 1,844 pages. Remarkable. And guess what it is filled \nwith. It contains part of the 9,000 earmarked porkbarrel projects in \nthis bill, none of which have been authorized--or very few have been \nauthorized, let me put it that way. I am sure there are some funds in \nhere that have been authorized. But the earmarks in it are exactly \nthat: they are unauthorized projects.\n  What does that mean to the average citizen? They hear about earmarks \nand pork, but they do not really understand what it means. Well, the \nway the Congress is supposed to work is, there are two parts to \nlegislating. One is to review legislative proposals--both policy and \nfunding by committees--and they say: OK, we will authorize this \nproject, we will authorize $1.7 million for a honey bee factory in \nWeslaco, TX. I don't particularly think that is necessary, but at least \nit is authorized. And then it is supposed to go to the appropriating \ncommittee, and they figure out how much money there is and then they \nappropriate the money. That system is completely broken. It is \ncompletely short-circuited. Now we have bills this size, statements of \nmanagers this size, and no one has ever seen or heard of many of these \nprojects until it appears on the Members' desks. The system is \ncompletely broken.\n  So when I hear my colleagues stand up and defend these ``porkbarrel \nprojects,'' when they defend $300,000 for the Montana World Trade \nCenter, which may be necessary, why didn't they ask for it to be \nauthorized because of the need and then compete with all other projects \nthat are necessary and that Members of the Senate and the House believe \nare necessary for their districts or States?\n  Mr. President, 20 or 25 years ago, I can tell my colleagues, an \nearmark was an unusual event. It was an unusual occurrence. But the \nevil grew and grew and grew. Like any other evil, it grew and grew and \ngrew, so that now we are presented with legislation such as this, with \n9,000 of them. And I can guarantee you that none of my colleagues fully \nread this bill or the statement of managers. Now, some people say: \nWell, it is not very much. It is not very much. Well, our estimates are \nthat it is about $8 billion. Now, $8 billion to the average citizen is \na fairly good sum of money.\n  Another egregious pattern of behavior which has crept into this is \nthat there are policy changes that are put in, again fundamental \nchanges in policy written in, which, of course, the Senate does not \nthen have an opportunity to debate. One example is to do away with the \nvoucher system in the Washington, DC, school system. Another one has \nbeen noted this morning\n\n[[Page S2862]]\n\nin the Washington Post, called ``Truck Stop.''\n  When we signed a free-trade agreement with Mexico--I believe it was \n14 years ago--part of the deal was that Mexican trucks, provided they \nmet all the safety standards and all the requirements, would be able to \ncome into the United States, with reciprocal access to each other's \nmarkets. Thanks to the influence of the unions and others, there is an \namendment in this bill that basically kills that. Now, you can take \neither side of that issue. Maybe there are a lot of Americans saying--\neven though these Mexican trucks are inspected, even though they meet \nthe safety standards, even though we promised in the North American \nFree Trade Agreement that they would have access to our markets--maybe \nwe shouldn't do that. But should we be doing it in an appropriations \nbill, in a bill this thick, in a statement of managers this thick? \nShould we be making policy changes in here?\n  By the way, I will talk a little more about this later on, but the \nMexican Government is in an existential threat with the drug cartels in \nMexico. Phoenix, AZ, has now become the kidnapping capital of America. \nThere is violence on the south side of our border which is spilling \nover onto our side of the border. The President of Mexico, President \nCalderon, has staked everything on taking on the drug cartels, and the \ncorruption he is fighting is at the highest levels of Government. So \nwhat have we done in this appropriations bill? We have just sent a \nsignal to the Mexicans that we are not going to keep our agreements \nwith them. We are not going to stand by our solemn pledges to them. \nAnd, by the way, we are going to do it in an obscure provision in one \nof these either 1,122 pages or 1,844 pages.\n  So I hope the American people and our colleagues understand what it \nis that is so badly broken here. They say: How in the world do we--when \nunemployment today is at 8.1 percent and people can't afford their \nhealth insurance premiums, are losing their jobs, are being moved out \nof their homes--afford $951,000 for Sustainable Las Vegas; how do we \nafford $819,000 for catfish genetics research in Alabama?\n  You will note that there are always locations associated with these \nearmarks. I had a discussion with a Member of Congress about one of the \nprovisions having to do with tattoo removal--tattoo removal--because it \nhelps when combating gangs. Maybe tattoo removal needs to be funded, \nbut, of course, this earmark was directed to a specific geographic part \nof the country. So while the American people are suffering under the \nworst recession since the Great Depression, we here in Congress not \nonly are doing business as usual, we are wasting taxpayer money at an \nincredible rate, and these 9,000 earmark projects are part of that.\n  By the way, there are also 13 projects in this bill, which total \napproximately $9 million, that were the result of the efforts of an \noutfit called PMA. PMA is a lobbying group, the head of which was a \nformer staff member in the U.S. Congress, and PMA has been raided and \nshut down by the FBI. They are under active investigation for \ncorruption, and they were ``listed'' as those responsible for these 13 \nprojects. We can't even take those out. We can't even take those out.\n  It is really remarkable. On Thursday, the media reported that in \ndiscussions with Majority Leader Reid, Speaker Pelosi took the position \nthat if a single amendment to this omnibus bill was made by the Senate, \nshe would refuse to resubmit the bill as amended to the House but \nwould, instead, put the rest of the Federal Government under a \ncontinuing resolution for the remainder of the year.\n  I think we should be on a continuing resolution as we have been and \nexamine each one of these appropriations bills individually, debate \nthem, and decide what various appropriations should be and how they \nshould be funded and what the priorities are.\n  By the way, we also have proved that we can pass another continuing \nresolution because we just did. The insistence that not a single change \ncould be made or it would shut down the Government and jeopardize even \nthe most essential Government services was high drama at its best, used \nto sway Members to oppose even the most commonsense proposals, such as \ninsisting contracting be fair and subject to open competition and \nrestricting funding that was achieved through a lobbyist organization.\n  By the way, it is my understanding that last year this same \norganization, PMA, which has shut its doors, was raided by the FBI. The \nhome of the head of it was raided by the FBI, and last year they got \n$300 million worth of earmarks in an appropriations bill.\n  What I am saying is, this system has become a corrupt practice. That \nis why we have former Members of Congress now residing in Federal \nprison. That is why we have continuing indictments of people who were \ninvolved in the Abramoff scandal, which all had to do with obtaining \nthese earmarks in appropriations bills which were not authorized and \nnobody knew anything about. We even had a situation last year where a \ncouple of items were put into an appropriations bill after the \nPresident signed it--after the President signed the bill. They were \ninserted. Investigation of that is still going on.\n  It seems to be the Speaker's position that the Senate should have no \nvoice in a $410 billion appropriations bill that funds every agency in \nthe Federal Government other than Defense, Homeland Security, and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs. I have been deeply disappointed by many \nthings this new Congress and this new administration have begun. After \nall the campaign promises of changing the culture of Washington, \nbringing hope for a new era, bridging differences between people, \nparties, and ideology, what we have actually seen and what has been \ndelivered to the American people is far different: first, in the $1.2 \ntrillion stimulus bill and now in this massive $410 billion \nappropriations bill, which would, in a normal year, be the largest \nappropriations bill the Congress would pass. There has been no serious \neffort at bipartisanship. There is no serious effort to hear opposing \nviews, to have an honest debate, to balance carefully the policy \nimplications of our actions. We should engage in serious debate and \nvote on amendments without the false threat of a shutdown of the \nFederal Government or an out-of-the-hand rejection of all amendments.\n  The President has said, and the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget has said, this bill is last year's business. This bill is to \nfund the functions of Government this year--not last year, this year. \nTo say somehow that this is ``last year's business'' because we are \nvoting on funding for the operations of Government for this year is \ndisingenuous at best.\n  I have talked to Members on both sides. I have talked to people who \nsaid: Yes, we need to do something about this earmarking, and we would \nlike to sit down and do something about it. We would like to reduce it. \nThat is like saying you would like to reduce any other evil. You want \nto eliminate it.\n  There is a simple way, I say to my friends who say they are unhappy \nwith the way this explosion of earmarking and porkbarrel spending is \ntaking place. There is one simple solution: Authorize it. Send it \nthrough the authorizing committees. Then, if I have a problem with the \nBuffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, WY, for which I am going to \nspend $190,000 of our taxpayers' dollars, then fine. I may not like it, \nbut at least we will have gone through a process of scrutiny, of \nproposal, of authorization, and the Buffalo Bill Historical Center \nwould be in competition with other proposals for other historical \ncenters throughout the country if they are needed.\n  Maybe we need to improve blueberry production and efficiency in \nGeorgia. It is $209,000 to improve blueberry production and \nefficiency--in Georgia. Maybe not in Maine, maybe not other places \nwhere blueberries are grown, but in Georgia.\n  We want to spend $400,000 for copper wire theft prevention efforts. I \nwould like to prevent copper wire theft as well, but maybe it should \nhappen across the country. And I am sure the Alaska PTA needs $238,000, \nbut so do PTAs all over this country. Why should we earmark $238,000 \nfor the Alaska PTA? The list goes on and on.\n  As some of my colleagues may know, I have begun to twitter. We have \nbeen tweeting for the last week with ``Top Ten Earmarks,'' every day. \nWe could go on for days and days. I would like to mention some of them. \nWe began last Friday.\n\n[[Page S2863]]\n\n  No. 10 was $1.7 million for a honeybee factory in Weslaco County, TX; \n$300,000 for the Montana World Trade Center; $870,000 for wolf breeding \nfacilities in North Carolina and Washington; No. 7 was $332,000 for the \ndesign and construction of a school sidewalk in Franklin, TX; No. 6 is \n$1 million for Mormon cricket control in Utah; No. 5 was $650,000 for . \n. . management in North Carolina and Mississippi; No. 4, $2.1 million \nfor the Center for Grape Genetics in New York; No. 3 was $6.6 million \nfor termite research in New Orleans; No. 2 was $2 million for the \npromotion of astronomy in Hawaii; and No. 1, on our first day, was $1.7 \nmillion for pig odor research in Iowa.\n  Yesterday, the Chicago Tribune had an editorial entitled ``Whoa.'' It \ngoes on to say:\n       The Obama administration and Democratic leaders of the \n     House and Senate are blowing the lid off of spending \n     restraint. But they're finally meeting some resistance within \n     their own party.\n       Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), in an essay published Wednesday in \n     The Wall Street Journal, ripped a spending bill passed by the \n     House last week as ``a sprawling $410 billion compilation of \n     nine spending measures that lacks the slightest hint of \n     austerity from the federal government or the recipients of \n     its largesse.''\n       He said he will vote against it, and he urged President \n     Barack Obama to veto it if it passes the Senate. We second \n     that motion.\n       Politico.com reported Tuesday that 15 senators--14 \n     Democrats and one independent--met behind closed doors this \n     week to share concerns over the cost and reach of Obama's \n     proposed $3.55 trillion budget for 2010.\n       House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry \n     Reid and the Obama team are pushing a gaudy expansion of \n     deficit spending.\n       A $787 billion ``stimulus'' package. A $410 billion \n     spending bill. A $3.55 trillion budget.\n       Their reasoning: we need to do this in response to the \n     economic crisis. But it's sure sounding like business as \n     usual in Washington. When in doubt, spend. When not in doubt \n     . . . spend.\n       The $410 billion bill hikes discretionary spending by 8 \n     percent and includes at least 8,570 earmarks worth $7.7 \n     billion. ``Such increases might be appropriate for a nation \n     flush with cash or unconcerned with fiscal prudence, but \n     America is neither,'' wrote Bayh. ``Families and businesses \n     are tightening their belts to make ends meet--and Washington \n     should too.''\n       The Obama folks have tried to dismiss this huge spending \n     bill as a little cleanup work. ``Last year's business,'' said \n     Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.\n       Last year's business? No, this is the nation's business \n     right now. We're going to borrow this money right now and \n     carry the debt for decades.\n       The administration says Obama will sign this bill. \n     Hopefully, enough Democrats like Evan Bayh will join \n     Republicans in the Senate to put the brakes on this. Let \n     everyone catch their breath and rethink this spending spree. \n     Right now, Democratic leaders look like they're getting dizzy \n     from all the dollars they think they have to throw around.\n\n  What we should be doing is not passing this legislation now. Go back \nto the drawing board. Go through the appropriations bills and authorize \nthem as necessary and figure out how much we need to spend rather than \nhave a bill that is like this and like this, which nobody has read.\n  Also, if the Congress goes ahead and passes this bill, then the \nPresident should veto it. The President should abide by the commitment \nhe made in the campaign, the debate in Oxford, MS. The President of the \nUnited States, then-candidate Senator Obama, stated it clearly. He \nsaid: I will go line by line through these bills, and I will veto the \nones and scrub the ones that are not necessary.\n  The President, then-Senator Obama, made a commitment to the American \npeople. He can keep that commitment by vetoing this pork-laden bill.\n  The list goes on and on of these projects. I mentioned the 13 \nprojects of PMA.\n  I want to return to something that is very disturbing, and that is \nthe provision concerning free trade with Mexico. I would again like to \nquote from the Washington Post editorial today that says ``Truck \nStop,'' entitled ``Congress Flashes a Yellow Light on Free Trade With \nMexico.''\n\n       President Obama seems to have resolved, for now, an \n     incipient dispute with Canada over ``Buy American'' rules in \n     the stimulus package. The law would have hurt Canadian steel \n     exports to the United States, but, at the White House's \n     insistence, Congress appended language that blunted the worst \n     protectionist consequences. Now, however, Congress has turned \n     on Mexico, the United States' other partner in the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement. A $410 billion omnibus \n     spending bill contains a provision that would pretty much \n     kill any chance that long-haul freight trucks from Mexico \n     could operate in the United States, as had been promised \n     under NAFTA.\n       Economically, giving U.S. and Mexican trucks reciprocal \n     access to each other's markets makes a lot of sense. \n     Currently, Mexican rigs can drive in only a small zone on the \n     U.S. side of the border, where they must offload their goods \n     onto U.S. trucks. The process wastes time, money and fuel, \n     harming the U.S. environment and raising the cost of Mexican \n     goods to U.S. consumers. Yet access for Mexican trucks has \n     been bitterly resisted by U.S. interests, most notably the \n     Teamsters union--which claims that poorly regulated trucks \n     from south of the border would be a menace on U.S. highways.\n       In an effort to disprove that, the Bush administration \n     promoted a pilot project under which Mexican trucks, screened \n     by U.S. personnel, could operate freely within the United \n     States. The Mexican trucks compiled a safety record \n     comparable to that of American rigs. Mexican participation \n     was limited, however, because of the political uncertainty. \n     And safety was always a smokescreen for the Teamsters' real \n     concern--economic turf--anyway. Now the Democratic majority \n     on the Hill has slipped into the omnibus bill a provision \n     killing the program. The provision seems certain to survive, \n     given that the president supported such a measure when he was \n     a senator; his transportation secretary, Ray LaHood, backed \n     it as a member of the House.\n       When the U.S. economy needs all the help it can get, this \n     legislation perpetuates inefficiency and invites Mexican \n     retaliation against U.S. exports. To a world looking for \n     signs that Democratic rule in Washington would not mean \n     revived protectionism, this can only be a disappointment.\n\n  So you not only have these earmarks that are in the thousands, you \nnot only have companies that are under FBI raids and shut down by the \nGovernment, adding porkbarrel projects, but you also have policy \nprovisions in the bill which can damage relations with a country we \nneed good relations with, given the fact that the drugs we are creating \na demand for flow through their country.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Mexican Government, under the courageous \nleadership of President Calderon, is in an existential struggling with \nthe drug cartels. He needs to win. He needs to win for a variety of \nreasons, including the direct effect the flow of drugs from Colombia \nand other places, through Mexico into the United States, has and the \ndamage it does to our young people and others who are using drugs.\n  This amendment, as I stated, simply says that all these provisions, \nwhich are in 1,884 pages, some thousands of earmarks that are in the \n``statement of managers,'' not be prohibited from being spent because \nthey are not included in the bill here. It is a pretty straightforward \namendment. I hope my colleagues will approve it.\n  Finally, I would like to say again, if the President of the United \nStates wants to fulfill his promise to the people of this country if \nthis bill is passed, he will veto the bill and he will send it back and \ntell us to clean it up. These are tough times in America. These are \ntough times. We cannot afford to do business as usual in the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives. It is time the President led, veto this \nbill, if we pass it, and let's get down to the business of saving the \ntaxpayers' dollars, rather than the profligate spending spree we have \nbeen on for so long which has mortgaged our children's futures and has \ncommitted generational theft.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on Wednesday, the Senate voted on an \namendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn. The \namendment would have cut funding for thirteen congressionally directed \nprojects. Eight of these projects are from the Energy and Water \nDevelopment section of the bill.\n  Senator Coburn claimed these projects were included at the request of \na firm that is under investigation. But every project named in his \namendment was included in this bill at the specific written request of \na Member of Congress.\n  In fact, thanks to reforms we made in the last Congress, anyone can \ngo online and see exactly who requested these projects and where the \nfunding is going. We have gone to great lengths to make the process as \ntransparent as possible. Members of Congress who request funding for \nprojects also have to file a letter with the Appropriations Committee \nto certify that they and their family members have absolutely no \nfinancial interest in the earmark.\n  Let me be clear, I did not personally sponsor any of these projects.\n  In fact, all of the projects in the Energy and Water Development \nsection of\n\n[[Page S2864]]\n\nthe bill that were targeted by Senator Coburn's amendment were included \nby the House in their version of the fiscal year 2009 Energy and Water \nDevelopment appropriations bill. The Senate also carried one of the \neight in our version of the bill.\n  So while I did not sponsor any of these projects, I find these \nprojects are consistent with the work performed by the Department of \nEnergy, and I saw no reason to eliminate them.\n  Let me briefly describe the sorts of projects that we are talking \nabout.\n  One of the projects would provide $951,000 for the direct methanol \nfuel cell. This type of fuel cell has the potential to meet low power \nneeds, less than 1 kilowatt, with increased performance and improved \nstorage ability.\n  Another project is focused on solar energy, providing $951,000 to \nimprove the efficiency of home windows, with the same goal--reducing \nnet energy consumption.\n  As I said, every project on this list was requested by one or more \nMembers of Congress. The process is fully transparent and the Members \nof Congress who requested this funding are fully accountable. That is \nwhy I opposed the Coburn amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WARNER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/06/senate-section/article/S2864-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WARNER.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Just last week we had to trade in our truck, which was \n     fully functional, in excellent condition and paid for, to \n     finance a vehicle that we could afford to drive out of the \n     local area. I have family and friends at Hill AFB, UT and in \n     Eugene, Oregon. I have driven my truck to visit them before \n     but would seriously have to plan ahead and save money to do \n     it again using our truck. So, now we have a new to us used \n     vehicle (a 2002) that is great, but now I have two car \n     payments all over again. We had to weigh the fact that while \n     we had a great truck, what good does it do you if you have to \n     actually think about driving it someplace as close as \n     Mountain Home? We used to drive it between Mountain Home and \n     Micron all the time five years ago and never gave it much \n     thought. Thank goodness we live in Kuna now, but still, when \n     I go back to school, the 25 miles or so between Kuna and BSU \n     would make a serious dent in my GI Bill money, which is just \n     enough to cover daycare and tuition.\n     Meghan and Wesley.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing to you today out of major concern for our \n     nation's stability. The price per barrel of oil continues to \n     rise and, with it, so does our cost of living. I am just an \n     average stay-at-home housewife raising my 6-month-old \n     daughter with my husband, who works hard to be our sole \n     provider. In the last six months, we have resorted to me \n     giving up my job as a result of rising fuel, grocery and \n     daycare costs. My husband owns an SUV, which is parked \n     stationery now in our garage, and is taking my sedan to work \n     each day. I rarely leave the house because of fuel costs \n     skyrocketing! We do not have a lot of debt and rely on our \n     savings, which is now dwindling to keep up with the rising \n     costs of everyday living here in Idaho.\n       We are hurting, and I know from speaking to friends and \n     family, they are hurting, too. The economic stimulus checks \n     that we received went into my savings account to help our \n     family pay for gas and groceries. Every two weeks, I buy \n     groceries and it costs us $165 a visit, every time we fill up \n     the tank on our SUV its $100 dollars every week in a half. I \n     believe that we are in an economic crisis and that we are \n     entering a depression, not a recession. The media maintains \n     that we have not entered a recession yet. What reality are \n     the media and our legislators living in?\n       Please take control of this situation! Do not let oil \n     govern the direction our nation is sliding towards. Offer \n     consumers some sort of fuel alternative. Fortunately, we do \n     not use oil to heat our home. Those homeowners' must be \n     reeling watching the fuel costs soar. You must react now! \n     Salaries are stagnant, the cost of energy is rising, food \n     costs are rising, home prices are falling all of these \n     indicators of an impending Depression!\n       We cannot afford to wait 5 years for solutions to today's \n     energy crisis! My recommendation is to put a team together in \n     the city of Boise, which includes average middle class \n     citizens that can give a more realistic view of everyday \n     living costs and come up with some real alternatives/\n     solutions which can be implemented now!\n       Both my husband and I have pulled our 401k plans out of the \n     stock markets hoping for some stability. After working so \n     hard to save through the years, it is heart wrenching to \n     watch your 401k savings spiral downward! America is bleeding \n     and we have to stop the flow of red! Offer the American \n     people some real solutions. Solutions that do not include \n     lining the pockets of foreign oil industries with our \n     bleeding American dollars!\n       I thank you for your time. I am sure you are well aware of \n     this crisis. I wanted to give you a voice from an average \n     middle class American Homemaker. I look forward to your \n     administration making a memorable stand by offering America \n     real solutions to this energy crisis!\n     Adriana.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking our opinion; this is a fresh change \n     from the normal status quo in Washington. I live in central \n     Idaho in a subdivision that has 3 full time residents and the \n     closest town has a grand total of less than two hundred \n     people. I love where I live and would not trade it for \n     anything but it is getting harder and harder to just pay the \n     bills let alone do any outdoor activities that require fuel. \n     I work in construction and the company office that I work for \n     is 25 miles away and 1300 feet higher in elevation than where \n     I live. My wife works 15 miles away and has the same \n     elevation change. This winter we had over five feet of snow \n     on the level and temperatures below zero for many days. \n     Needless to say, riding a bicycle is out of the question, \n     driving a small car with no ground clearance just to get good \n     mileage is no more than an invitation to spend the night in \n     the snow in freezing temperatures. I have been paying $4.99 a \n     gallon for diesel for the last 4 weeks or so and gas for the \n     cars has been over $4.00 for about the same amount of time. \n     Our weekly gas budget has almost doubled in the two plus \n     years that we have lived here not to mention the cost of \n     propane going up. I can guaranty you that our wages have not \n     kept up and it does not look like there will be any increases \n     in income in the near future. In order to have a weekend at \n     the lake we now have to take at least one day off to make it \n     worthwhile to go and go once every three weeks instead of \n     every week or so. I have friends and family that used to come \n     up all of the time and can no longer afford to come up. \n     Tourism is a very large part of the economy up here and \n     without the people coming to visit, going out to dinner, \n     buying gas and just spending money this area will suffer.\n       I believe that we are being governed by a few very vocal \n     extremists and special interest groups, who have enough money \n     that they do not care or have lost touch with the average \n     person. They advocate for and lobby for (I do not have time \n     to lobby for anything or go to meetings I have to work to pay \n     for the gas) all of these special regulations that supposedly \n     protect something. I have been told by the government on more \n     than one occasion that ``We do not care what it costs to do \n     that but you must comply to our regulations''. We need to get \n     the government out of the way, drill for oil in Alaska and \n     off our coasts, build more refineries, increase the atomic \n     usage and cut the ties with the countries that do not like \n     us, but want our money and use it against us. In short we \n     need to become more self sufficient, like we were in the \n     past.\n       Thank you for your time\n     Wade.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you very much for your e-mail. I get so frustrated \n     and worried and feel like ``we the people'' are never \n     considered by the politicians who run our government.\n       For the past 20 years I have lived on a small ranch in the \n     south east corner of Idaho right near the Utah border. It has \n     always been hard for us to make a go of it on the ranch. In \n     fact, without our retirement we would never have been able to \n     make it. Our nearest grocery store is either 36 miles to \n     Malad or 46 miles to Tremonton, Utah. The\n\n[[Page S2865]]\n\n     nearest large town is Pocatello, which is 100 miles from us. \n     Ogden, Utah, is 80 miles and Brigham and Logan, Utah, are 60 \n     miles away. Needless to say we must travel quite a distance \n     to get the things we need. There are some times we must take \n     the truck and this takes a lot of gas. The high price of gas \n     is just killing us financially. Just the last two days we had \n     to spend $100 for fuel just to move our cattle from one field \n     to another. We have cut down our trips and that is pretty \n     hard to do when we really need something. There are trips to \n     the Dr. and we always have pills that need to be refilled.\n       My husband has worked very hard all his life to provide a \n     good living for our family. We have tried to prepare for the \n     future so we would not be a burden on our children or have to \n     live off the government. Our retirement is in a 401K in the \n     market and we are losing money every day. We are getting old \n     with no source of income and I will tell you it is pretty \n     frightening.\n       Everything in our economy is tied to oil and energy prices. \n     I think it is only fair to ask our Congress to act \n     responsibly and get doing something now!\n       The statistics I hear say we only use 15% of the oil \n     resources that are available right here in our own country. I \n     have heard politicians say it won't do any good to drill \n     because we won't see any results for such a long time. It \n     does not take a genius to realize that if we don't start \n     doing something now we will never get the relief we need.\n       I think we could start by doing something about those silly \n     regulations that prevent us from doing so many sensible \n     things.\n       I think we should be allowed to drill for oil and explore \n     for energy resources right here where we live. I think it can \n     be done responsibly if our hands are not tied with ridiculous \n     regulations. I also think we could start building new \n     refineries. I agree that we should explore and expand \n     alternative energy sources, including nuclear. What about \n     Iraq? We have done a lot for them why can't we get oil from \n     them?\n       The thing that I think is totally irresponsible is to tax \n     the oil companies and to put global warming nonsense before \n     the needs of human beings.\n       It has always been my philosophy that doing something \n     productive is better than setting on our hands and doing \n     nothing. I say to the congress roll up your sleeves and get \n     to work doing something worthwhile.\n       I would like to thank you for all the service and many \n     hours you have spent in behalf of all of us in Idaho. I am \n     grateful to have you for my Senator.\n     Louise, Stone.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a single parent trying to live on disability, a low \n     fixed income. The current price of gas has affected me \n     severely. I live two and a half hours one way from my doctors \n     in Boise and I must make three to four trips a month. I do \n     not have the resources to relocate or carry on like this.\n       These are a few things that I think have lead to the high \n     price of fuel in the U.S. Until recently, all energy futures \n     trading in the U.S. took place on the New York Mercantile \n     Exchange, which traditionally determined the market price of \n     crude oil and natural gas commodities bought and sold here in \n     the United States. Recently a large portion of the futures \n     exchange was moved to London England where they could operate \n     outside of the regulated exchange markets. Since this took \n     place it has driven the price of crude up dramatically, by \n     investors with little or no assets investing in the future \n     price of crude by putting up a fraction of the outright \n     value of the crude oil they are investing in. The basic \n     facts are clear--this market is purely and simply being \n     controlled by over-speculation.''\n       In 2000, at the urging of Enron and other large energy \n     traders, a provision was slipped into an omnibus bill \n     conference report that eliminated CFTC oversight of energy \n     commodities traded by large companies outside of the \n     regulated exchanges. This so-called Enron loophole has \n     severely restricted CFTC oversight of energy trading. Supply \n     and demand = There has not been a new refinery built in the \n     US in over 30 years. We have more oil here in the US than in \n     all of the Middle East if you take into consideration The \n     shale in the Rocky Mountains, the oil in ANWR Alaska and off \n     our coast.\n       All four of these things must be done to drive the price of \n     fuel down in the U.S.\n       1. Remove this loophole for energy futures traders.\n       2. Change the amount of money put up front by investors in \n     the futures trade energy market to 50%.\n       3. Allow drilling at ANWR in Alaska , off our coastlines \n     and also allow the extraction of oil from Rocky Mountain \n     shale.\n       4. Streamline the process for building new refineries \n     (cracking plants) in the U.S.\n       Your help is needed and appreciated.\n     Mark, Council.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for notifying me that you are trying to do \n     something about the gas prices. My husband and I are retired, \n     but we had no retirement to fall back on. Now we live on \n     Social Security. Our needs are not great, but the increased \n     gas prices and the resulting increased food prices are \n     dealing us a severe blow. We now drive to the grocery store \n     and to church and almost nowhere else. I have also cut down \n     on the groceries that I buy. We have even decided to cut way \n     down on our evening meal so that we do not have to buy so \n     much food. Any help you can give us and people in the US like \n     us will be so appreciated. I know being a Congressman is not \n     an easy job. I do thank you for working for the citizens of \n     Idaho and the United States.\n     Karen, Coeur d'Alene.\n                                  ____\n\n       The price of heating oil has quadrupled since installing \n     our heater. We left wood because of injuries not allowing \n     either one of us to get the wood, split, or even get it into \n     the stove. We are worried about being able to have any this \n     coming winter.\n       Our use of our boat--the only recreation that we have. The \n     boat does not use much fuel, about 2 gallons a day out on the \n     lake fishing. But we cannot get the boat to the lake. It \n     takes a rig to do that, and the rig only gets 24 miles per \n     gallon. And to make it worse, we are only 25 miles from the \n     lake or 9 miles to the Clearwater River! We have to worry \n     about heat this winter. So no recreation.\n       I work 15 miles from home. I have a car that gets 35 plus \n     miles per gallon. I only earn $6.25 per hour. At present gas \n     is $3.99 a gallon. It eats into any profits I might have. Any \n     higher and I will be forced to quit.\n       I know a girl who no longer can work there. She had a baby. \n     The cost of child care and fuel was more than her wages. So \n     she is on food stamps much to her dismay.\n       This right-to-work state with its low wages. It takes 3/4 \n     of an hour to earn a gallon of milk! And the rest of the \n     groceries go up every delivery of foods. Because of fuel \n     costs.\n       A lot of people, not only in this state, are in the same \n     boat. Some are having to give up jobs. Some are having to \n     close their businesses. Some are giving up their homes. It \n     hurts more out here in the real world than it does in the \n     beltway. The whole economy is going down the tubes all \n     because the price of energy.\n       The argument that it is only $50 or so per month more. \n     Well...then there is the add-on for food, and everything \n     else. And on a fixed income, with a low wage job to \n     supplement. That is a lot.\n       I will add another thing. The summer mix for the fuel cuts \n     the gas mileage. How's that one!! for a stupid regulation?\n       And you can bet your boots, if all those foreign countries \n     and speculators thought we were really going to drill our own \n     oil, the prices would drop like a rock. Drill for oil along \n     with all the other things. Build nuclear, build my hydropower \n     systems. Do it al. Open all the oil potential fields. Make \n     our country totally self sufficient. Get away from the \n     dictators!\n     Karen, Juliaetta.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family (Dad and four brothers) owns a roofing business \n     here in Boise. The high fuel prices have made it difficult \n     for us to make a profit. The price of materials has increased \n     every month for the past three months and some say that they \n     will increase by 30-40% before the end of the summer. I see \n     this as a direct result of the price of fuel. The \n     construction industry in Idaho has taken some hits and I \n     don't think that Idahoans can really afford for the price of \n     home production to increase. Especially when you consider how \n     many houses are currently on the market and how many people \n     are facing foreclosure.\n       America is the best country in the world. I think that our \n     dependence on foreign oil is the pinnacle of stupidity. We \n     have the resources, the technology and the manpower to become \n     energy dependent without hurting the environment. Capitalism \n     is the way to ensure that America will remain the best \n     country in the world. Please do your part to help us become \n     energy independent by letting us drill in our own country and \n     use our own resources without taxing the oil companies and \n     nationalizing energy production.\n       Idaho is the greatest state in America; I love it. It is \n     beautiful and I would like to share that beauty with my kids \n     someday without having to sell my house in order to pay for \n     the gas that it cost to drive around this great state. Thanks \n     for the great work!\n     Victor, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to tell you my story regarding the energy \n     prices, not only has our family been impacted by the cost of \n     fuel, but it has also been impacted by the loss of income. I \n     am a single parent, and up until a year ago had an income of \n     $35-38K a year. The only work I am able to find is part-time \n     employment for minimum wage. (I have too much experience for \n     the jobs posted.) Add that to the continuous increasing fuel \n     prices and the harder I try to get ahead and to make ends \n     meet the more behind I get. The stimulus check I received, \n     because of the high cost of fuel, went to bills and groceries \n     rather than into the economy as I would have enjoyed. I am \n     constantly ``robbing Peter to pay Paul'' within my budget. I \n     have to have a vehicle, which requires gasoline, to get to \n     work. With the cost of gas equaling an hour of net income, it \n     takes the biggest percentage after my mortgage/rent payment.\n       If possible, relief at the pump would be greatly \n     appreciated. I know I am not the only who has a limited \n     income and is struggling financially.\n     Lori, Garden City.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/06/senate-section/article/S2865-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2865-S2866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REUNION OF THE MUSICAL GROUP PHISH\n\n Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I want to give recognition to an \nevent taking\n\n[[Page S2866]]\n\nplace in Hampton, VA, beginning tonight, March 6. This weekend, \nVermont's own musical group, Phish, will celebrate a reunion not far \nfrom our Nation's Capitol, following their retirement in August of \n2004. Phish's fans, and all Vermonters, wish a warm welcome back to \nTrey Anastasio, Jon Fishman, Mike Gordon, and Page McConnell, and the \nvery best on their renewed musical journey.\n  In the summer of 2004, the band said farewell to thousands of fans \nwho had persevered through torrential rain and knee-deep mud--some \nhaving walked many miles to see the band's final concerts in a farm \nfield in Coventry, VT. For so many of the band's followers, it was a \nbittersweet moment, historic and mournful at once and the end of a \nsingular era in American rock and roll. True to the band's roots, and \ndespite the rain, it was fitting that the farewell took place in the \nmiddle of the glorious Vermont countryside.\n  Much to the joy of many Vermonters and people across the United \nStates, the band could not resist the desire to perform once again, and \nthis weekend marks their return to the stage in what Phish's fans hope \nwill be the beginning of a sustainable period of happiness and \ncreativity for the band.\n  What began at the University of Vermont in Burlington, and was \nnurtured at Goddard College in Plainfield, flourished into an enormous \ncreative musical force that delighted fans from across the world for \nmany years. They spread their music throughout Europe and Japan, from \ncoast to coast in the United States, and rang in the millennium in \nfront of 85,000 people on the Big Cypress Indian Reservation in \nFlorida, playing that concert's final notes as the sun rose over the \nhorizon at the dawn of a new century.\n  Theirs has been a remarkable journey of musical exploration, \nimprovisation and risk-taking much akin to the early era of the \nGrateful Dead. From outdoor summer festivals to Halloween celebrations \nthat found the band donning musical ``costumes'' by playing an album of \nanother musical group from beginning to end, Phish carved a niche in \nthe musical world that was left conspicuously empty with their \nretirement.\n  As Americans stand at a crossroads and contemplate the way forward \nduring a difficult time, artistic expression will play an important \nrole in reminding us all that despite the difficulties we face, we \nshould not forget those things in life that bring us happiness and that \nconnect us to one another. Whether we find solace in a good film, a \ngreat novel, making art through photography, writing, or painting, or \nexperiencing a musical performance, I want to acknowledge the ability \nof Americans to keep the creative spirit alive even when we face our \nmost daunting challenges. And I find reason for optimism in the fact \nthat the announcement of Phish's reunion was met with such overwhelming \nenthusiasm from their fans.\n  So as thousands of people welcome Phish back to the stage at the \nHampton Coliseum this weekend, I am proud to say as a Vermonter: Phish, \nit is good to have you back. I know you have been missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/06/senate-section/article/S2866-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:25 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to require a pilot program on training, certification, \nand support for family caregivers of seriously disabled veterans and \nmembers of the Armed Forces to provide caregiver services to such \nveterans and members, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the Spring of 2007, I met a 27-year-old \nArmy Sergeant named Eric\n\n[[Page S2867]]\n\nEdmondson. Eric was injured while serving in Iraq. During surgery to \ntreat his injuries, his brain was deprived of oxygen for a period of \ntime, and is now seriously disabled. It has been my honor to get to \nknow Eric and his family. I am humbled and inspired by their shared \nstruggle, pain, triumph and sacrifice as they have worked to help Eric \nrecover as much mobility and independence as possible.\n  Today I am introducing the Veteran and Servicemember Family Caregiver \nSupport Act of 2009, along with several other Senators. This bill \nproposes a program that would provide technical, financial and \npractical support for families like Eric's, families who are now caring \nfor a veteran or a returning servicemember whose disability requires \ninstitutional or home-based care.\n  The first version of this bill was introduced in the last Congress by \nthen-Senator Hillary Clinton. She already knew what many of us are now \nlearning. Families all across the country are figuring out how best to \ncare for returning servicemembers and veterans who are coming home with \nserious disabilities. We are recognizing that these families need more \nsupport than what most of them are finding.\n  This bill lays out a strong family caregiver support program. The \nprogram is for those seriously disabled veterans and servicemembers who \nhave a family member willing and able to provide care at home. We want \nto recognize that sacrifice, which probably involved a significant loss \nof income, and the value of the care they are providing. So the program \naddresses four key concerns--training and certification, payment for \nservices, respite care, and, finally, mental health and social support \nservices.\n  The first step is to provide training for those family members who \nbecome a primary caregiver for a seriously disabled veteran or \nservicemember. It is common for family members to have some informal \ntraining, but we should formalize that. Figure out what training \ncaregivers need and make sure they receive it. From changing burn wound \ndressings to wheelchair transfers, caregivers need the skills and \nknowledge to offer high quality, home-based care. The bill I am \nintroducing today calls on VA and DoD to develop and offer training and \na certification program for family caregivers.\n  We also need to pay for the services these trained and certified \nfamily caregivers provide. Amount of payment would be determined by the \nVA and DoD based on the amount and level of care required for each \nparticipant. Costs would be paid by VA, with DoD reimbursement to VA \nfor services benefiting servicemembers. It is only fair that care \nprovided by family caregivers, care for which the government would \notherwise be responsible, is acknowledged. Qualified family caregivers \nare often forgoing other income, even while providing a service of real \nvalue.\n  Respite care is another important part of this program. Caregivers \nneed time off. They deserve time off. VA and DoD have respite care \nprograms, but they are underutilized because the programs are \ninflexible, waiting lists are long, or providers are not available \nnearby. That is especially true in more rural areas. In this bill, we \nprovide for an alternate caregiver to be trained and certified who can \nfill in for the primary caregiver as needed. We've also asked the VA to \nstudy further options to improve the availability of respite care.\n  Finally, our bill directs VA and DoD to provide mental health \nservices to family caregivers when those needs are related to the \nprovision of care. For example, depression is almost twice as likely \namong caregivers as it in the general population. The caregiver program \nwould provide an assessment of the caregiver's needs and referral to \nrelevant services if necessary.\n  Members of the armed services came forward and served when duty \ncalled. As many as 6,800 of them have come home from the Afghanistan \nand Iraq wars unable to perform daily functions or live independently. \nNow it is time for the U.S. to come forward with support for those who \nare able to live at home because a family member is willing to provide \nthe care they need.\n  The sacrifices these family caregivers make are substantial, and can \ngreatly affect their long-term well-being. Most have to give up their \njobs outside the home, relinquishing health and retirement benefits and \nfuture earning power in the process. It is not uncommon for a family to \nmove across the country in search of the best care for their injured \nloved one. We owe it to them to provide assistance as they care for \ntheir loved ones, who are our heroes.\n  A strong family caregiver support program also makes good economic \nsense. Right now, families are providing the care that VA and DoD have \na responsibility to provide, but the families bear the cost. Because \nthese families are providing care without payment or support, the costs \nof the care is made invisible to VA and DoD.\n  The VA recognizes the economic benefits of providing preventive care \nto veterans, and acknowledges that informal caregivers are an important \nsource of providing such care. A recent VA study notes that ``providing \nsupportive services to caregivers will most likely help reduce the care \ncosts for patients . . . as they will require less use of emergency \ncare, institutionalization, and VHA services, while also improving \ncaregiver and patient outcomes.'' Finally, support programs for \ncaregivers keep the veteran with his or her family, delaying the day VA \nwill be obligated to provide more expensive institutional care.\n  In testimony before Congress in 2007, Donna Shalala, as co-chair of \nthe Dole-Shalala Commission, stated: ``many families are caring for \ntheir injured servicemember at home--and many of these servicemembers \nhave complex injuries. These families, forced into stressful new \nsituations, don't need more anxiety and confusion, they need support. \nFamilies are unprepared to provide 24/7 care. Those that try, wear out \nquickly.''\n  We have an opportunity to step up to ensure that veterans can have \nthe best care possible in return for their service to our country. Many \nof those who have been seriously injured in Iraq or Afghanistan have \nfamilies who have made enormous sacrifices to provide care. We owe \nthese families a helping hand to ensure that they have the tools and \nresources they need to provide the best care for their--and our--\nveterans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 543\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veteran and Servicemember \n     Caregiver Support Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Since September 11, 2001, at least 6,800 veterans have \n     been injured and are living with disabilities severe enough \n     to require in-home type care.\n       (2) Even with their disability benefits, the majority of \n     seriously wounded veterans and their families are not in a \n     strong financial position.\n       (3) In testimony before Congress in 2007, Donna Shalala, \n     cochair of the Dole-Shalala Commission, stated that \n     ``families are unprepared to provide 24/7 care. Those that \n     try, wear out quickly''.\n       (4) The best quality private rehabilitation facilities have \n     expertise in training family members to provide appropriate \n     care.\n       (5) Current in-home care programs have limited availability \n     and are severely underutilized. Patients who obtain in-home \n     care from such programs receive only about \\2/3\\ of the hours \n     of care to which they are entitled.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 68\n\n       Whereas the Pennsylvania National Guard is one of the \n     largest Guards in the Nation, with approximately 20,000 \n     soldiers and airmen;\n       Whereas since September 11, 2001, more than 17,000 \n     Pennsylvania National Guard soldiers and airmen have deployed \n     in support of the Global War on Terrorism;\n       Whereas the Pennsylvania National Guard is supporting the \n     largest deployment of Pennsylvania Guardsmen since World War \n     II;\n\n[[Page S2870]]\n\n       Whereas the 28th Combat Aviation Brigade (CAB) is preparing \n     for deployment to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom;\n       Whereas the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, now deployed \n     in Iraq, predates the United States Army, traces its lineage \n     to 1747, when Benjamin Franklin organized the ``Associated \n     Regiment of Foot'' (currently 1-111th Infantry) in \n     Philadelphia, and is the only unit in the National Guard to \n     field the Stryker vehicle;\n       Whereas the Pennsylvania National Guard has deployed to \n     more than 30 locations worldwide since September 11, 2001;\n       Whereas Pennsylvania's Army Aviation Flight Facility at \n     Fort Indiantown Gap is the first and only National Guard \n     facility in the Nation to achieve the Occupational Safety and \n     Health Administration (OSHA) Voluntary Protection Program \n     ``STAR Award'' for exhibiting exceptional safety management \n     principles and accident-free flying hours, and effectively \n     demonstrating the implementation of these principles during \n     years-long intensive OSHA inspections;\n       Whereas in 2008, the Pennsylvania Air National Guard's \n     (PaANG) 171st Air Refueling Wing flew more than 5,800 flying \n     hours with more than 1,600 sorties flown, representing an 85 \n     percent mission effectiveness rate;\n       Whereas the PaANG's 193rd Special Operations Wing flew more \n     than 3,000 hours with more than 1,000 sorties in 2008 and is \n     the only unit in the entire Armed Forces with an airborne \n     psychological operations broadcasting platform;\n       Whereas the PaANG's 111th Fighter Wing flew more than 675 \n     close-air support missions and provided more than 2,000 hours \n     of on-station time to coalition forces in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas soldiers and airmen from Pennsylvania's Counterdrug \n     Program supported 575 cases that resulted in the seizure of \n     more than $27,000,000 in illegal narcotics, money, weapons, \n     property, and vehicles directly related to illegal drug sales \n     in 2008: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commends the Pennsylvania National Guard for its \n     meritorious service to Pennsylvania and the Nation;\n       (2) honors the men and women who serve, or have served, in \n     the Pennsylvania National Guard; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to thank the \n     Pennsylvania National Guard for its continued service.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I have sought recognition to recognize \nthe contributions of the Pennsylvania National Guard in service to \nPennsylvania and the Nation. Pennsylvania units have taken part in \nevery conflict America has faced since the Revolutionary War, and \ncontributions made by the men and women of the Pennsylvania National \nGuard to our Nation's security continue to be nothing short of \noutstanding. The citizen soldiers and airmen who serve in the Guard \nhave answered the call to serve their Nation both at home and abroad \ntime and time again. I am honored to stand before you to recount some \nof the Pennsylvania National Guard's recent accomplishments.\n  With approximately 20,000 soldiers and airman in its ranks, the \nPennsylvania National Guard is one of the largest National Guards in \nthe Nation. It has the largest Army National Guard and the fourth \nlargest Air National Guard. I commend the Adjutant General of \nPennsylvania, Major General Jessica Wright, and Deputy Adjutant \nGenerals, Major General Stephen Sischo and Brigadier General Joseph De \nPaul, for ably leading this force that has armories or airbases in 90 \ncommunities throughout the Commonwealth.\n  Since September 11, 2001, over 17,000 Pennsylvania National Guard \nsoldiers and airmen have deployed to over 30 worldwide locations, and \nthe Guard is currently supporting the largest deployment of \nPennsylvania Guardsmen since World War II.\n  I regret that I do not have time to list all of the Pennsylvania \nNational Guard's accomplishments and accolades. I will briefly \nhighlight accomplishments of individual units within the Pennsylvania \nNational Guard that attest to the impressive quality of the whole.\n  Currently, the 56th Stryker Brigade Combat Team, an element of the \n28th Infantry Division, is deployed in Iraq. The unit, which is the \nonly unit in the National Guard to field the Stryker vehicle, traces \nits lineage to 1747, when Benjamin Franklin organized the ``Associated \nRegiment of Foot'', currently 1-111th Infantry, in Philadelphia.\n  Pennsylvania's Army Aviation Flight Facility at Fort Indiantown Gap \nis the first and only Army National Guard facility in the Nation to \nachieve the Occupational Safety and Health Administration Voluntary \nProtection Program ``STAR Award'' for exhibiting exceptional safety \nmanagement principles and accident-free flying hours, and effectively \ndemonstrating the implementation of these principles during years-long \nintensive inspections.\n  The Pennsylvania Air National Guard's 171st Air Refueling Wing, based \nin Coraopolis and commanded by Brigadier General Roy E. Uptegraff III, \nflew over 5,800 flying hours with more than 1,600 sorties flown in \n2008, representing an 85 percent mission effectiveness rate.\n  The Pennsylvania Air National Guard's 193rd Special Operations Wing, \nbased in Harrisburg and commanded of Brigadier General Eric G. Weller, \nflew over 3,000 hours and over 1,000 sorties in 2008 and is the only \nunit in the entire Armed Forces with an airborne psychological \noperations broadcasting platform.\n  The Pennsylvania Air National Guard's 111th Fighter Wing, based in \nWillow Grove and commanded by Colonel Paul Comtois, flew over 675 \nclose-air support missions and provided more than 2,000 hours of on-\nstation time to coalition forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The soldiers and airmen from Pennsylvania's Counterdrug Program \nsupported 575 cases that resulted in the seizure of over $27 million in \nillegal narcotics, money, weapons, property and vehicles directly \nrelated to illegal drug sales in 2008.\n  The accomplishments I have enumerated are but a few of the many that \nthe Pennsylvania National Guard can claim to its credit. Whether \nthrough deployments overseas, the deployment of 2,500 Pennsylvania Army \nand Air National Guard members to support hurricane disaster relief \nefforts along the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina, or service \nwithin the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the men and women of the \nPennsylvania National Guard have repeatedly answered the call to duty. \nTheir performance has been in keeping with the finest traditions of the \nmilitary and has reflected great credit upon themselves, the \nPennsylvania National Guard, and the United States Military.\n  I will continue to do all that I can in the United States Senate to \nensure that the Pennsylvania National Guard has the necessary \nequipment, training and facilities to accomplish the missions it is \ncalled on to perform both for the Commonwealth and the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/06/senate-section/article/S2870-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 673.

On a much more somber note, Americans got more bad news \ntoday.\n  For February, our Nation's unemployment rate is now a staggering 8.1 \npercent. This is the highest unemployment rate in more than 20 years. \nMore than 650,000 jobs were lost in February. These job cuts come on \nthe heels of 655,000 jobs lost in January and another 681,000 jobs lost \nin December.\n  This job loss means that what we are doing to solve the economic \ncrisis is not working. This job loss is much more than a bad number for \nmillions of Americans. These layoffs may mean missing a mortgage \npayment and facing foreclosure. These layoffs may mean not being able \nto take a sick child to the doctor. These job layoffs may mean not \ngetting enough money to put food on the table.\n  Right now, in every community across the Nation, workers are losing \ntheir jobs. These families are suffering as bills pile up and savings \nevaporate and businesses are struggling to meet payroll.\n  After the new administration heralded the passage of their trillion-\ndollar spending bill as the answer to this economic crisis, some \nAmericans began hoping their economic futures may be turning around. \nUnfortunately, this crisis is one where we cannot spend our way out.\n  Until we fix the real root of the crisis, our credit crisis, the \nhemorrhaging of jobs will not stop. I spoke about this earlier this \nweek, and I will keep speaking about it until policymakers decide to \nact responsibly.\n  The President, in his message in the State of the Union, said nothing \nis going to work until we fix the credit crisis. This latest jobs \nreport is another sad reminder that right now our financial system is \nnot working. Our financial system has become clogged with toxic assets, \nand until they are removed, fear and uncertainty will continue to \ndominate the markets and our economy.\n  Our banking and financial system affects every American's standard of \nliving, our ability to create and maintain jobs, and our ability to \ncompete globally. It is central to all financial and household \nactivities for Main Street America.\n  Nothing the Government has done, to date, is working. Instead, the \nprevious and the current administrations have been throwing billions in \ngood taxpayer dollars into bad, failing banks. Why hasn't pouring more \nmoney into the system worked? Because policymakers are only treating \nthe symptoms rather than the cause.\n  The good news is, though, we do not have to go back to the drawing \nboard. Under my American Credit Cleanup Plan, the Government can put to \nwork the statutory authorities already in existence and long used by \nthe FDIC, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, for failed banks. \nThis plan is to take advantage of the lessons we have learned. We saw \nwhat works in our Nation's experience during the savings and loan \ncrisis. We also saw what won't work.\n\n  During the 1990s, Japan lacked the will to clean up its sick banking \nsystem by taking out the toxic assets, and the end result was a ``lost \ndecade'' during which Japan was stuck in a recession. I, for one, \nrefuse to repeat Japan's mistakes, dooming the Nation's families and \nworkers to a recession any longer and deeper than it takes to clean up \nthe mess.\n  The first step toward recovery is to identify troubled banks and then \nremove the banks' toxic assets in a transparent, market-friendly manner \nthat is free from political interference and micromanagement. The toxic \nassets of the troubled banks would be removed through a temporary \nconservatorship. Under conservatorship, the first order of business \nthere is to protect the banks' depositors up to the current FDIC \nguaranteed loan levels. It is essential that we continue to protect \nAmerican families' investments.\n  Also, many Americans are understandably angry as policymakers debate \nlowering pay caps for some executives who got us into this mess. Well, \ncapping pay or taking away corporate jets isn't enough. Instead, we \nneed to fire the failed executives and the boards of directors that \ntook their businesses and their banks down the tubes.\n  Next, the Government needs to separate the bad assets from the good \nand hold the bad assets until the market conditions improve when the \nvalue of these assets--a good part of the value of these assets--can be \nrealized. Unlike the current ad hoc approach, my plan also provides an \nexit strategy. Once you get the bad assets out, you cleanse the toxic \nassets, then you have the restructured institution which won't continue \nto call on the taxpayer for more dollars to survive.\n  I share the bailout fatigue all Americans are feeling, but we cannot \nafford to ignore the crisis. Failing to act could lead to families \nbeing unable to get loans to refinance homes, farmers unable to get \ncredit to buy seed, students unable to get loans to go to school, and \nbusinesses unable to get credit to meet payrolls, keep workers, or \nexpand. Our economic recovery depends directly on unlocking the credit \nsystem. It is time for policymakers to act.\n  This action must be a bold, coherent, and smart approach like my \nAmerican Credit Cleanup Plan. It has to tackle the root cause of the \nproblem--the toxic assets--get them out of the system, and lead us out \nof this economic crisis and help Americans get back to work. I, for \none, say no more throwing good taxpayer money down a rat hole, no more \n``adhocracy'' where we look at the crisis of the day and throw money at \nsome institution that has already depreciated significantly in value in \nhopes of keeping it afloat. We need to take those institutions, cleanse \nthe assets necessary, get new management,\n\n[[Page S2872]]\n\n new executives, and put them back in the marketplace to function \nwithout Government interference.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/06/senate-section/article/S2872-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           ADJOURNMENT UNTIL MONDAY, MARCH 9, 2009, at 2 P.M.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
