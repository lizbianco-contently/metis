Mr. President, the fundamental principle behind Wall Street \nreform that we are going to finish this week is accountability. Those \nwho created the mess bear the responsibility for cleaning up the mess. \nOne of its most important provisions promises taxpayers they will never \nagain be asked to bail out big corporations that acted recklessly and \nput our economy at risk.\n  When it comes to the ongoing catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, our \nmotivation is exactly the same. It is no different. More than 20 \nmillion gallons of oil have leaked into and across the waters of the \ngulf coast since the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig exploded and sank \nabout a month ago. That is double the oil that spewed from the Exxon \nValdez.\n  Eleven crewmen died very quickly, horrific deaths, unnecessary \ndeaths. In the weeks since, an enormous tourism industry has been \nslowed and business at countless fisheries has been halted at a time \nwhen the gulf coast can hardly afford more economic hardship. Our \nenvironment has been polluted and life has been disrupted for many \nalong that coast. With every passing day, those consequences are only \ncompounded.\n  It is the responsibility of Congress and the administration to \ninvestigate this disaster and it is the responsibility of BP and anyone \nelse found culpable to foot the bill for the damages. They must be held \naccountable.\n  Some estimate this disaster will cost more than $14 billion. We have \nto put our foot down and make clear that taxpayers will not pick up \nthat tab. I will do everything in my power to make sure the polluters \npay the price, which they are obligated to do morally and, I believe, \nlegally.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3849-8", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Washington State. I appreciate it.\n  I rise because the Senate has three choices on how it is going to \nprotect coastal communities from the economic ravages of the oilspills \nwe are seeing in the gulf. We can have fishermen, coastal residents, \nand tourism-based small businesses endure the suffering of lost revenue \ncaused by a manmade disaster that was no fault of their own, which \nclearly in my mind isn't fair, we can have taxpayers provide them with \na safety net, which I oppose, or we can make polluters pay all the \ndamages they caused from a spill, which is the appropriate course.\n  It is not a hard choice. When I was a kid, my mother taught me all I \nthink we need to know here, and I am sure everybody was taught the same \nway: You clean up your own mess and you are responsible for it. That is \nall we are asking BP or any other company to do: Clean up the mess, pay \nfor whatever mess you can't clean up yourself and the damages that flow \nfrom what you did.\n  The current law sets a $75 million cap on how much an oil company has \nto pay for damages. That means BP doesn't have to pay more than $75 \nmillion for lost business revenue from fishing or tourism, damage to \nthe environment, the coastline or the lost tax revenues of State and \nlocal governments. So I have introduced a bill, along with a number of \nmy colleagues, raising that liability cap for offshore oil well spills \nfrom $75 million to $10 billion.\n  Some of my colleagues have objected to this proposal because they are \nworried it will drive oil drilling companies in the gulf out of \nbusiness. Well, in the case of BP, that is a little hard to understand. \nIt is a rather strange argument. After all, BP's profits amounted to \n$5.6 billion for the first 3 months of this year--profits, not \nproceeds, profits. That breaks down to $94 million in profits each and \nevery day. That means their current damages liability under the law of \n$75 million is less than one day's profits--less than one day's \nprofits.\n\n  Not every company drilling in the gulf is as big as BP, but why, I \nsay to my colleagues who raise that issue, should an oil company get \nsuch a low liability cap when any average person driving down the \nstreet has unlimited liability? Why should a company doing an \ninherently dangerous and potentially polluting activity such as oil \ndrilling enjoy such a low cap on liability, when the guy installing a \nsolar panel on your roof has unlimited liability? It simply doesn't \nmake sense.\n  The oil companies want it both ways. They want to keep the profits \nwhen everything works out well and times are good, but they want \ntaxpayers to bail them out when they spill. It is fundamentally wrong.\n  Our bill is as simple as it gets. It says no bailout for BP. It says \nBP pays for its own mess, not the Nation's taxpayers. It says either \nyou want to fully protect the small businesses and communities \ndevastated by the spill or you want to protect multibillion-dollar oil \ncompanies from being held fully accountable.\n  BP says they are going to be liable for all legitimate claims, but \nthey would not define what ``legitimate'' is. So if they are saying \nthat, why are we hesitant to raise the liability cap to make sure that \nwhat they are saying is kept true and that anyone else in the future \nwill have the same responsibility? Does anyone who has been watching \nthe images coming in from the gulf believe we should be protecting \nmultibillion-dollar oil companies instead of the small businesses, \nfisheries, and coastal residents who are losing their livelihoods?\n  It seems to me it is time this Senate stand up to big oil and make \nthem pay for their own mess, not taxpayers, small business owners, \nStates or the Federal Government.\n  I know a number of my colleagues who have cosponsored this \nlegislation with me wish to speak. At the end of that process, I intend \nto make a unanimous consent request so we can move forward and make \nsure now--not years later, now--that all those who are damaged as a \nresult of the spill in the gulf are protected and that taxpayers don't \npay one penny toward this liability that BP and others may have.\n  With that, for the moment, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from New Jersey \nbecause I, too, come to the floor to strongly support the Big Oil \nBailout Provision Act and to ask some simple questions of the Senators \nwho are objecting to this bill being passed. For whom are you fighting? \nWhom are you trying to help? Are you here to protect and shield the big \noil companies or to fight for families and taxpayers?\n  I know where I stand. I came to the Senate to fight for families and \nsmall business owners in my home State of Washington, and those are the \npeople I work for every single day--moms and dads who are working hard, \npaying their taxes, doing their best but who have watched, over the \nlast 2 years, as Wall Street executives and big banks derailed our \neconomy and then held out their hands for a bailout from the rest of \nus, men and women who have seen their friends, family, and neighbors \nlose their jobs, who have driven by neighborhood shops they have known \nfor decades that are now sitting empty and boarded up. They have seen \nall this, and they have also seen Wall Street and big banks go right \nback to their ``bonus as usual'' mentality, acting as though nothing \never happened, handing out millions of taxpayer dollars to their \nexecutives, and shamelessly sending lobbyists to Washington, DC, to try \nand water down reform.\n  Families in Washington State and across the country have seen all \nthis and they are angry about it and they have good reason to be. Those \nfamilies need to know that now we are fighting for them in the Senate. \nThe debate we are having today demonstrates clearly who is standing for \nthem and who is not.\n  Here are the facts: On April 20, 2010, there was a massive blowout \nand explosion on a BP oil platform in the Gulf of Mexico. Eleven \nworkers are missing, presumed dead; 17 more injured. The explosion, as \nwe know, caused a gushing spill that has poured hundreds of thousands \nof barrels of oil into the gulf and threatens to spill millions more. \nIt has created an environmental and economic tragedy the magnitude of \nwhich we are only now beginning to comprehend. It is threatening entire \ncommunities and businesses. The oil and chemical dispersants being \nsprayed into the gulf have the potential now to kill underwater \nwildlife and create underwater dead zones for years and years to come. \nThose are the facts.\n  The questions are: Who should be responsible for this cleanup? Who \nshould bear the burden for big oil's mistakes? Should it be the \ntaxpayers, the families and small business owners who are already being \nasked to bear so much today or should it be BP, the company that is \nresponsible for this spill and that made $6.1 billion in profits in the \nfirst 3 months of this year alone?\n  I cosponsored the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act because, to me, the \nanswer is pretty clear.\n  I believe BP needs to be held accountable for the environmental and \neconomic damage of this spill. I am going to continue to fight to make \nsure our taxpayers do not end up losing a single dime to pay for the \nmess this big oil company created.\n  To me, this is an issue of fundamental fairness. If an oil company \ncauses a spill, they should be the ones to pay to clean it up, not the \ntaxpayers. The bill raises the cap on oil company liability from the \ncurrent limit of only $75 million--that is a pittance considering this \nspill's potential damage--to $10 billion.\n  So taxpayers will not be left holding the bag for big oil's mistakes. \nThis is straightforward common sense, and it is fair. It hits \nparticularly close for families in the Northwest--my area--who saw \nfirsthand the devastation caused by the Exxon Valdez disaster and the \nlong and arduous battle over cleanup costs.\n  Mr. President, I was disappointed when this bill was blocked by \nRepublicans last week. We are going to keep\n\n[[Page S3851]]\n\nfighting because we want this bill to pass. I am going to keep fighting \nfor our families and taxpayers in Washington State and across the \ncountry.\n  The bottom line is, if oil companies are going to make billions in \nprofits when times are good, they should not be allowed to leave \ntaxpayers hanging when times are tough. The Big Oil Bailout Prevention \nAct writes this commonsense policy into law. I urge every Senator to \nside with the taxpayers and support this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Nelson be next for 5 minutes, and then \nSenator Cardin for 4 minutes, and then Senator Lautenberg for 5 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I say to my colleagues on the \nSenate floor, my worst nightmare is becoming reality. Tar balls have \nbeen discovered, as reported by CNN, in Key West. Even if they are not \nthe tar balls from this spill, since the spill is flowing southward, it \nis getting into the Loop Current. That current goes southward into the \nGulf of Mexico, around the Florida Keys, and becomes the Gulf Stream.\n  The University of Miami oceanographer testified to us that once it \ngets into the Loop Current in the northern Gulf of Mexico, it will \ntake, maximum, 10 days to get to the Florida Keys. Eighty-five percent \nof North America's living coral reefs are in the Florida Keys. The Gulf \nStream hugs the Florida Keys going northward and the southeast coast of \nFlorida. The Gulf Stream parallels the entire eastern coast, the \nAtlantic seaboard, all the way north to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina, \nand proceeds across the Atlantic to Scotland.\n  We are looking at a gargantuan economic and environmental disaster \nfacing this Nation but particularly those States on the gulf coast and \nthe Atlantic seaboard. We have heard all the pronouncements, and we \nhave heard those pronouncements now going on 4 weeks. The oilspill has \nnot been stopped. If it continues until a rescue well reaches it in \nanother 2-plus months, this spill will eventually cover up the gulf \ncoast, the places like the sugary white beaches of northwest Florida, \nwhere I will be this Friday, where already the cancellations are coming \nright and left as their tourist season starts; and hotels that would \nnormally have 85 percent occupancy are less than 20 percent occupancy. \nYou can see the economic consequences from this disaster. You see the \neconomic consequences already to the fishing industry in Louisiana. \nWhat about the oyster industry in Apalachicola and those delicate bays \nand estuaries all along the gulf coast where so much of the marine life \nis spawned?\n  Now we hear reports that it is not just on the surface, it is at a \ndepth of 1,500 feet. Then just off the floor of the ocean at 4,500 \nfeet, almost a mile below the surface--a slick that is 10 miles long \nand 3 miles wide and 2 football fields thick. What happens when that \neventually gets to the surface? But in the meantime, what happens when \nit settles to the ocean floor?\n  For the life of me, I can't understand someone objecting, as they are \ngoing to do, to raising an artificial limit of $75 million up to at \nleast $10 billion--and it is probably going to exceed that. The \nargument you are going to hear is: Oh, it should not be this; it ought \nto be tied to profit. Is it really responsible public policy to say \nbecause a company makes less money, it should be responsible for less \ndamage? No.\n  If I seem emotional, it is because my people are scared. They are \nfrightened at what they are facing.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank Senator Menendez for his leadership on S. 3305. I \nhope his request will be granted. As the other Senators have said, \nbasically whose side are you on? Who should pay for this disaster? \nShould it be the taxpayers of this country? Should it be the small \nbusiness owners whose livelihood is now in jeopardy? Should it be the \nproperty owners who are going to suffer damage? No. It should be BP Oil \nand its affiliates.\n  That is what the Menendez bill does. It places responsibility on the \nappropriate party. BP should pay, and there are many reasons they \nshould pay. As Senator Menendez points out, their profit was $6 billion \nin the last quarter. Another reason: BP, in its exploration plan that \nit presented to the Mineral Management Service, MMS, to get an \nenvironmental waiver, stated ``unlikely event of an oil spill as having \nlittle risk of contact or impact on the coastlines and associated \nenvironmental resources.''\n  Unlikely event? Little risk of contact? They have relied upon proven \nresponse technology--these blowout preventers. They were failsafe, \naccording to BP Oil. Yet MMS showed that the blowout preventers had \nfailed or otherwise played a role in at least 14 accidents. There was \nlittle information about the blowout preventers at 5,000 feet of water. \nThat was used to avoid a full environmental review.\n  We have an environmental disaster, and BP should be held fully \naccountable for many reasons, not the least of which is they \nmisrepresented the environmental risk to the public and the regulators.\n  Let's talk about the extent of the damage. BP is continuing to \nunderestimate this damage because they don't want the public to fully \nunderstand the extent of the damage. First, they tell us 1,000 barrels \na day, and then 5,000 barrels a day. The experts tell us the \nmethodology used by BP is not reliable. They should have given us a \nrange, not a specific barrel amount.\n  We had people who were prepared to come in and do a real assessment \nwithout jeopardizing BP Oil's efforts to stop the flow, and BP doesn't \nlet them do that because they don't want the public to know the status \nof it, as Senator Nelson pointed out, using dispersants, which is a \ngood option but not the better option. The oil is going to stay in the \nocean and give us dead zones, and it is going to cause additional \ndamage.\n  It starts with the Menendez bill, with holding BP Oil responsible for \nall of the damages it has caused through its misrepresentations and the \nway it has handled the spill. I hope it will continue so we can reenact \na moratorium, particularly for the area that I represent in the Mid-\nAtlantic, which is so environmentally sensitive that if we had the \nspill in our area I would hate to see what it would do to the \nChesapeake Bay and Assateague Island.\n  I urge my colleagues to move forward today on the Menendez bill. \nLet's get the consent necessary to make sure everyone understands that \nwhat BP Oil says it will do, it will do, which is pay for all the \ndamages it has caused. I hope that will not be the last action. I hope \nwe also will reimpose the moratorium for offshore drilling--at least at \nthis point--until we know we can do it safely.\n  In my area, I hope the moratorium will be permanent.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, first, I commend my colleague from New \nJersey for developing this approach to make sure these companies pay \nfor the damage they have done.\n  We are going to see today, as we saw the other day, a response from \nthe other side. I hope they have the courage, the guts, to stand and \nsay they are with the ordinary American taxpayers or maybe they will \nsay: We like the other guys better--big oil.\n  Will the Senate stand with the fishing industries and the hard-\nworking men and women who make a living providing sustenance to our \nNation or will it continue its stand with big oil? They need all the \nhelp. You heard from our colleague from Maryland about their earnings, \nincredible earnings. BP, in a quarter, had its earnings increased by \n$3.2 billion--earnings, not revenue.\n  So the choice is an easy one: You can stand with the guys who got so \nmuch that they are gouging the public or do you want to stand with the \nworking people?\n  Will the Senate stand with the coastal communities whose families are \nleft jobless, homeless, and hopeless or will it stand steadfast with \nthe big oil companies, as it has done?\n  Last week, we got an answer. Senators Menendez and Nelson and I\n\n[[Page S3852]]\n\nasked our colleagues to join with us to end big oil bailouts by raising \nthe liability cap for oil companies from a trifling $75 million to $10 \nbillion. Our colleagues stayed true to the big oil companies. They \nwanted to make sure they blocked any attempt to pass a bill that would \nraise their liability.\n  So here we are again urging our colleagues to stand for the American \ntaxpayers who are sick and tired of bailouts. We need to hold big oil \naccountable so the gulf coast communities don't meet the same fate as \nthose families whose lives were ruined by the Exxon Valdez accident \nover 20 years ago. We have to hold them accountable because the \nAmerican taxpayers are staring down the barrel of a disaster that is \ncurrently said to exceed $1 billion in monetary damage.\n  The fact is, the amount of the monetary damages from the spill in the \ngulf is on track to surpass those from the Exxon Valdez. As the first \nSenator to visit Alaska after the Exxon Valdez went ashore, I saw the \ndestruction caused by that oilspill firsthand. But even after issuing a \nstring of apologies, Exxon fought over every penny with the communities \nand families and the fishermen whose lives were decimated.\n  We had a hearing the other day in the Environment Committee with \nthree executives from BP, Transocean, and Halliburton. I asked the \nsimple question: Is your company responsible for the leak? No, no, no. \nThey were pointing fingers at one another. Nobody was willing to say \nthey had an accident, they did this or that--no, not them. Later on I \nasked could they guarantee we would not have any more spills if there \nwas drilling in the ocean, and they said they could not do that.\n  Mr. President, they are shamefacedly trying to protect themselves \nagainst a legitimate obligation they have. And our friends on the other \nside are not willing to say to those oil companies: Listen, you did it, \nyou messed it up, pay up. Do what you have to as a corporate citizen \nand as a company that makes so much money you don't know what to do \nwith it.\n\n  Once again, I commend my colleague from New Jersey for developing \nthis program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, to summarize, this is very simple: Whose \nside are you on? Are you on the side of the taxpayers or multibillion-\ndollar oil companies? Are you on the side of fishermen, working hard to \nmake a living, or on the side of multibillion-dollar oil companies? Are \nyou on the side of the small inns that benefit from the tourism in the \ngulf region or on the side of multibillion-dollar oil companies? Are \nyou on the side of the coastal communities that are going to be \naffected by virtue of the spill or on the side of multibillion-dollar \noil companies?\n  Because of the fierce urgency now, we believe it is necessary to ask \nunanimous consent that the Environment and Public Works Committee be \ndischarged from further consideration of S. 3305, the Big Oil Bailout \nPrevention Liability Act of 2010, and that the Senate then proceed to \nits consideration; that the bill be read three times, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, I reserve the right to \nobject, and I am going to object in a minute, but I agree with a lot of \nthings that were said by the Senators from New Jersey.\n  I say to the Senator from New Jersey, I was also there 20 years ago \nat the Exxon Valdez, which was a transportation accident. We were very \nmuch concerned about the recovery. We need to increase the caps. I \nunderstand that. But I do agree with the President--he left that \nblank--because we don't know just how high that should be.\n  I disagree with the notion that you are either for or against big oil \nand all of that. Big oil would love to have these caps up there so they \ncan shut out all the independents. We have independents in my State of \nOklahoma, and right now 63 percent of the gulf's natural gas and 36 \npercent of its oil are produced by independents. What you are going to \ndo if you raise the caps right now, precipitously, this high, you are \ngoing to help the five big oil companies, including BP, giving them \nexclusive rights, and help the nationalized big oil companies, such as \nthose in China and Venezuela, and shut out the small and medium-sized \nindependents. For that reason, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Is there still a minute remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 3 minutes 50 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Look, I regret that my distinguished colleague from \nOklahoma has decided to object. I would simply say that if you are an \n``independent,''--and some of these independent companies are valued at \n$40 billion--does that mean that because you are not the BPs of the \nworld, you should have less liability? If this spill in the gulf was \ndone not by a BP or an ExxonMobil or any of those but by some other \nentity, should there be less liability for them; therefore, they can \ntake the risk and go ahead and drill, and if it works out, they get all \nthe profits, but if they spill, their liability would be limited under \nthe guise they were going to create a monopoly for the big five? I am \nfor creating that liability across the entire range. If you are \ninvolved in a dangerous activity, one that can create enormous \nenvironmental and economic damage, then you should face the liability \nfor such whether you are BP or you are some intermediate entity.\n  So I don't quite understand the nature of suggesting that we are \ngoing to try to give the big companies some form of monopoly. Actually, \nit seems to me what we are doing is using that argument--and I have \nheard this argument several times--to not create the liability that is \nnecessary for everybody, so that regardless of who creates this set of \ncircumstances and has a spill and therefore fishermen, shrimp \nfishermen, seafood processing companies, tourism, coastal communities, \nand our environment are damaged, they should be let off the hook \nbecause they are not as big as BP.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Would the Senator yield?\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I would be happy to yield to my colleague from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  Isn't it interesting how all the different companies are pointing at \neach other now? And the real question is, Is it going to be the \ntaxpayer who will pay for this or will the responsible parties? Why \nshould someone say no to raising the liability simply because they say \nit ought to be tied to the size or the profitability of the particular \ncompany? It makes no sense.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I recently saw firsthand the miles and \nmiles of oil slick in the Gulf of Mexico. The scope of the disaster is \nstaggering, and an oil rig the size of a football field shouldn't \nsuddenly explode in a massive fireball and threaten the entire coast of \nour country. But beyond that potential, if they closed the Port of New \nOrleans, think of the effect that would have on Minnesota or the effect \nit would have on other parts of our country. And I don't believe the \ntaxpayers of this country should have to pay for that.\n  That is why I support the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Liability Act, \nwhich will help ensure that the current liability gap for a single \noilspill will not apply to the gulf coast oil disaster and make sure \nthat BP--a company that just a few weeks ago flouted its record profit \nof $6 billion in the first quarter of this year alone--will pay for \nthis and that the taxpayers of this country--already burdened with the \ncost of the difficult economic times and what Wall Street has done--are \nnot stuck with the bill.\n  Mr. President, I am supportive of the work my colleagues have done, \nand I thank Senators Menendez, Nelson of Florida, and Lautenberg for \ntheir efforts.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me just make one comment. I don't very \noften agree with President Obama. Right now, he is unsure what that \nlevel should be. I am unsure what that level should be. Maybe it should \nbe the level we are talking about right now, and it may end up there, \nbut we just don't know that.\n\n[[Page S3853]]\n\n  We know that what the Senator from New Jersey and I experienced up at \nExxon Valdez some 20 years ago was not adequate, so that is why we \npassed the legislation. It should be upgraded. Certainly, we need to \nraise these limits. Where it should be raised, I don't know. I don't \nknow where the cap should be. We are going to have to find out as this \nthing moves along.\n  I would only say this: If you have it up too high, you are going to \nbe singling out BP and the other four largest majors and the \nnationalized companies, such as China and Venezuela, and shutting out \nthe independent producers. I don't want that to happen. Let's wait and \nsee where that cap should be.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would, yes.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. I thank the Senator for yielding.\n  So is it my understanding that because of your concern about these \nother independents, let's call them, you would allow them--if they were \nthe cause of this incident--to limit their liability just because they \nare small?\n  Mr. INHOFE. No. My answer to the question is, as I said, we don't \nknow where that cap should be. You are coming up with a cap that might \nend up being the appropriate cap for everyone. But my understanding now \nwould be that the only ones who would be able to live up to that cap \nwould be the five majors and the nationalized companies. If that is the \ncase, yes, I would say we need to have that opened so that we are not \njust allowing the majors as opposed to the independents. But let's wait \nand see where the cap should be. Maybe it should be that high. We don't \nknow yet, President Obama doesn't know yet, and I don't know yet. That \nis the reason I object.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. INHOFE. You can ask, but I am going to have to leave here. Go \nahead.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. If, in fact, it is--I think everybody clearly believes \nthis consequence in damages is at least $10 billion--some have \nsuggested it should be an unlimited cap. If that is the figure, your \nconcern wouldn't stop you from putting it at that figure and making \nsure all the independents----\n  Mr. INHOFE. I would repeat, it is too early to come up with a figure, \nand I think the President agrees with that. Let's see what kind of cap \nshould apply.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3853-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3853-S3855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak for a few moments this \nmorning about a subject that is on the minds of many Americans and I \nthink should still be on the minds of everybody in this Chamber because \nthe health care bill that was passed and signed into law recently is \ngoing to have impacts across this country for some time to come.\n  I am interested in the discussion that has occurred here on the floor \nof the Senate over the past several weeks, as Senator Barrasso from \nWyoming--who also happens to be an orthopedic surgeon, a physician--has \ncome to the floor to engage in a series of remarks, what he calls the \n``second opinion.'' I think his second opinion series of remarks here \non the floor has been extremely well pointed in illustrating, in many \nrespects, what is wrong with the health care bill and why this is not \nsomething that is going to improve the lives of most Americans but, in \nfact, is going to worsen the lives of most Americans because they will \nbe faced with higher health care costs, higher taxes, and probably \nhigher deficits for years and years to come.\n  There is a lot of supporting data now, validation of those arguments \nwe heard during the course of the health care debate. The Democrats, \nwho were supporting it, as was the President, said this health care \nlegislation was going to, No. 1, reduce health care costs for most \nAmericans, and No. 2, reduce the deficit. Of course, they talked a lot \nabout how it was going to extend the lifespan of Medicare as well, even \nthough they were cutting Medicare and using those funds to create a new \nentitlement program. So all those promises made by the President and \nmade by the Democrats here in the Senate when we were debating health \ncare are now all being completely rebuffed by evidence that comes out \nall the time from those who study this issue closely.\n  Frankly, as we get more and more businesses trying to figure out how \nto interact with this new health care legislation, they are coming to \nthe conclusion that it might be cheaper for them in the long run to \ndrop their coverage and put everybody in the government plan, which is \nwhat we predicted would happen all along.\n  But I think probably the biggest bombshell--certainly the most \ndamning piece of evidence--came out just a few weeks ago when the \nActuary of Health and Human Services, HHS, came out with his analysis \nof the financial impacts the new law would have once it was passed and \nimplemented. I wish to share a few things from that report because I \nthink it is very important. It does, as I said before, illustrate \nexactly what Senator Barrasso and others said throughout the course of \nthe debate in the Senate when health care was under consideration.\n  The Actuary of the Department of Health and Human Services--bear in \nmind, this agency is supposed to look at these things in a totally \nobjective, nonpolitical way--the Actuary concluded that the Federal \nGovernment and the country will spend $310 billion more under the new \nlaw than we would have without it. The Actuary's report went on to say \nthat national health expenditures would increase from 17 percent of \nGDP, which is what it is today, to 21 percent under the new law. But \nwhat is interesting about this is that the $310 billion increase in \nhealth care costs they now say will result from the passage and \nimplementation of this legislation is more than what would have \nhappened had we done nothing. Had this body done nothing in terms of \nhealth care reform, health care costs would have gone up less than they \nwill with this legislation. As I said before, this completely refutes \nany argument made by the other side during the course of this debate \nthat their legislation would, in fact, drive down health care costs.\n  The Actuary has now concluded the point that we made throughout the \ncourse of the debate; that is, that health care costs will go up, not \ndown; the cost curve will be bent up, not down; and for most Americans, \nhealth insurance premiums are going to go up as a result of this \nlegislation. That is what the Actuary is now saying.\n  What is even more interesting about that report is it goes on to say \nthat health care shortages and price increases are ``plausible and even \nprobable'' under the legislation. The report suggests there will be \nperhaps as many as 15 percent of Part A providers--Part A providers are \nhospitals--that will become unprofitable within the 10-year projection \nperiod absent further legislative action.\n  In other words, up to 15 percent of hospitals would have to close as \na result of this legislation. Because of that, the report says the law \nwill jeopardize ``access to care for seniors.'' So all these promises \nabout greater access, lower cost--the promises that were made during \nthe course of this debate--are being completely now rebutted by the \nreport that the Actuary came out with just a couple of weeks ago.\n  The other thing I think is important--we emphasized this as well \nduring the debate--the Actuary concluded that new taxes that are going \nto be imposed on medical devices, on prescription drugs and insurance \nplans, were generally passed on through to consumers in the form of \nhigher drug and device prices and higher insurance premiums.\n  Remember, during the course of the debate we said all the new taxes \nthat will be levied on medical device manufacturers, pharmaceuticals, \nhealth insurance plans, would be passed on. This is clearly what they \nare suggesting as well. So not only do we get the double whammy, we get \nthe whammy of higher insurance premiums, but we get the double whammy \nof higher taxes that are going to be borne by a lot of people across \nthe country. That also is being substantiated and supported by the \nJoint Tax Committee, which took a good look at the distribution of the \nimpacts of the tax increases in this bill. A lot of Americans are going \nto see their tax burdens go up as well.\n  With respect to the issue of the deficit--which, again, is something \nI will\n\n[[Page S3854]]\n\nget to in just a moment--the Actuary notes the bill's Medicare \nprovisions ``cannot be simultaneously used to finance other federal \noutlays--such as the coverage expansions--and to extend the [life of \nthe Medicare] trust fund, despite the appearance of this result from \nthe respective accounting conventions.''\n  Essentially what they have said is what they said in a letter in \nresponse to questions we posed about how this would impact the Medicare \ntrust fund. Basically, the Actuary is saying what the CBO said; that \nis, you are double counting revenue, you are basically spending the \nsame money twice. In other words, all the additional revenues that are \nsupposed to become available because of reductions in Medicare benefits \nor reductions in Medicare payroll taxes that were going to extend the \nlife of Medicare and also going to be used to finance the new health \ncare entitlement program--that is what we said all along, and that is \ndouble counting. You can't spend the same money twice, and as a \nconsequence of that you are going to see what they promised in terms of \ndeficit reduction can be very different from what actually happens.\n  They went on to say that the CLASS Act, which is a long-term care \nentitlement program--described, believe it or not, by one of my \nDemocratic colleagues as a Ponzi scheme of the highest order, the kind \nof thing Bernie Madoff would be proud of,--will result in net Federal \ncost in the longer term. The program is designed to someday down the \nroad to pay long-term care benefits for people who pay premiums into \nthat plan and will face significant risk of failure because of the way \nthey are counting the revenue.\n  It says it is going to be ``a net Federal cost in the longer term'' \nbecause, obviously, when you take premiums today to pay for the \nunrelated provisions in the health care reform law, and then there is a \ndemand for the CLASS Act benefits at some point in the future by the \npeople who paid those premiums, you cannot use those revenues to pay \nfor the benefits because they have already been spent. To assume \notherwise is double counting that revenue.\n  So you have all this double counting that went on in the course of \nthis bill which, again, as I said, understated the overall cost of the \nbill and also the deficit numbers I think were attached to it.\n  To me, this study, this analysis was absolutely a bombshell in terms \nof the impacts of the actual implementation of the health care bill. As \nI said, it completely refutes all the arguments that were made that it \nwould lower costs, reduce deficits, and it would improve access. All \nthree of those points are refuted by the analysis that was done by the \nActuary at the Health and Human Services Department.\n  More recently, last week about this time, the Congressional Budget \nOffice came out with a new report. They predicted that the health care \noverhaul will likely cost about $115 billion more in discretionary \nspending over 10 years than the original cost projections. So the \npromises that were made about deficit reduction as a result of this--it \nwas going to somehow save $143 billion over a 10-year period--now are \nreduced by $115 billion because, as we said throughout the course of \nthe debate, it is going to cost a lot to implement this bill both in \nthe form of cost to HHS, as well as cost of the Internal Revenue \nService, which is going to be required to now impose the individual \nmandate that will fall on a lot of people across this country and the \npenalties associated with that.\n  So we have all these implementation costs that are going to add an \nadditional $115 billion in spending over the next 10 years which reduce \ndramatically any promises about deficit reduction, not to mention what \nI just stated in terms of the double counting that goes on.\n  My view on this is, not only is it not going to reduce the deficit, \nit is going to explode the deficit, particularly in the outyears when \nthe demand for Medicare benefits comes and the demands of the trust \nfund for those people who paid into the fund and reached the retirement \nage--a lot of the baby boomers are going to require health care, the \nMedicare fund is going to be tapped for that, and there will not be any \nmoney there to pay for this program.\n  So you have the Actuary at HHS, you have the CBO coming out with new \ninformation which completely validates the argument we made during the \ncourse of this debate; that is, it is not only going to increase costs \nfor most people across this country and increase taxes, but it is also \ngoing to have a detrimental impact on the budget and the deficit over \nthe long term.\n  One of the promises that was made, the so-called good points in the \nhealth care bill, was that small businesses would benefit from a small \nbusiness tax credit. That is something administration has been trying \nto sell to small businesses, putting out notices from the IRS that \nthere are 4 million small businesses that could qualify for the small \nbusiness tax credit. That kicks in in 2010. But, even there, as is now \ncoming out, there is a lot of fine print I don't think people read very \nwell.\n  The Chamber of Commerce said of all the small businesses in this \ncountry, about 78 percent of those small businesses are self-employed \npeople. Self-employed people are not covered. Families are not covered \nunder this. More important, there is a disincentive to hire people. We \nhave an economy where we are trying to get jobs growing and come out of \nthe recession and get people back to work.\n  This small business tax credit caps it. In other words, if you get up \nto 25 employees you are no longer eligible for it. If your average wage \nis $50,000 you are no longer eligible for it. So there is a real \ndisincentive to pay people higher wages or hire more people because if \nyou do, you are not going to be eligible anymore for the small business \ntax credit. A lot of those small businesses are saying: What benefit is \nthere to me if I want to grow my business? Yes, I can take advantage of \nit for a short period of time--a very short period of time--but I am \nnot going to be able, if I am at that threshold where I start hitting--\nfirst, it says it is available for businesses with fewer than 10 \nemployees, then it phases out at 25.\n  But if you get to 24 employees and you are thinking: My gosh, I would \nlike to hire another person; I no longer will be eligible for the small \nbusiness tax credit, or I want to pay my employees higher wages but \nthen I hit the $50,000 threshold--it is a real disincentive to create \njobs.\n  One of the things that is being touted as a positive about this \nlegislation is it is, in fact, a disincentive for us to get people back \nto work and to create jobs.\n  The overall impacts of this, I think, that are still out there I \ndon't think we are going to know for some time. In fact, I don't think \nCBO has any idea about what this is going to cost in the second decade. \nThey have estimates of the cost in the second decade. They can make \nsome predictions, but they will admit there is tremendous volatility \nabout that, and unpredictability, when we get into the second decade.\n  But one thing we know in the first decade, one thing we are finding \nout now as we get more analysis being completed, is in the first \ndecade, according to the HHS Actuary, this is going to increase the \ncost of health care more than if we did nothing.\n  In other words, if we had done nothing and we still had health \ninsurance costs going up as they were about double the rate of \ninflation, if we had done nothing we would have locked that in. But now \nwe are going to continue to have health insurance costs going up, not \nonly at that rate but a significantly higher rate to the tune of $310 \nbillion in more, higher health care costs over the course of the \ndecade.\n  If we look at how that impacts individual people across the country, \nmost Americans are going to see their health insurance premiums go up. \nIn fact, some of the provisions of the bill also, as part of the--it \nwas just reported last week that this provision that would allow people \nto keep their kids on their health insurance plans until they are 26 \nyears old will, in fact, increase health insurance premiums by about 1 \npercent. That is something that was hailed as one of the benefits or \nvirtues of this legislation.\n  My point is, contrary to the assertions that were made during the \ncourse of the debate with respect to lower costs, deficit reduction, \ngreater access--none of that, according to these studies and analyses, \nis going to be the case. In fact, it will be the opposite. We will see \nhigher health care costs for\n\n[[Page S3855]]\n\nmost Americans. We will see higher taxes for a lot of Americans. We \nwill see higher taxes for sure--for certain--for a lot of small \nbusinesses. And I think we are going to see a lot of businesses that \nare going to just say--and we have already seen reports of that, as a \nlot of these businesses look at the impact this would have on their \nbottom lines--it will cost them a lot to cover their employees. It \nmight be cheaper to pay the penalty and to just shove them into one of \nthe government-run exchanges. I think that is something we have yet to \nsee the impact from.\n  My prediction would be we will see a lot of small businesses, and for \nthat matter a lot of large businesses, that will come to that \nconclusion and say it makes absolutely no sense for them to continue to \nprovide health coverage for their employees when they can have the \ngovernment do it and save their companies a lot of money.\n  So I think the unintended consequences are something we have yet to \nsee, but we do know for certain the consequences of this legislation, \nthese analyses that have been completed, and studies that have been \ndone by those who are supposed to know a lot about this subject--by \nthat I mean the Actuary at the Health and Human Services Department, as \nwell as the Congressional Budget Office--they are now seeing higher \ninsurance costs, higher premiums, and a significant reduction in the \nso-called deficit reduction that was promised by the administration.\n  Furthermore, because of the double counting that is done and the way \nin which Medicare revenues are double counted--CLASS Act revenues are \ndouble counted--even for that matter Social Security revenues, payroll \ntaxes are double counted in this--dramatically understate the deficit \nimpact and the long-term debt implications of this legislation and what \nit will mean to the next generation of Americans who are going to be \nstuck paying our bills.\n  I say all that, not to be the Grim Reaper. We tried during the course \nof this debate to illustrate as much as we could these very points. We \ntried to offer amendments that we thought made more sense in terms of \ncontrolling costs; to actually address the actual underlying drivers of \nhealth care costs in this country as opposed to just expanding \ncoverage, which is essentially what the legislation did. It will cover \nmore people. In some ways it will cover more people by putting more \npeople into Medicaid which will pass on more mandates and more costs to \nour States.\n  We have already seen a lot of Governors across the country reacting \nto that, talking about that, how we are going to pay for that. But \nthere is an additional 34 million people, additional people, who are \nsupposed to be covered in this legislation; about 16 million of those \nare already going into the Medicaid Program which already under-\nreimburses providers and also imposes huge new costs and new burdens on \nour State governments.\n  There is not a lot of good news to report about this. I think that is \ngoing to be the case. I think, regrettably, we could have gone a \ndifferent direction. We should have gone a different direction. But \nthat being said, we are where we are. I hope over time we will have an \nopportunity to revisit this issue. If we do not, it is going to have a \ndramatic impact on future generations, on our economy, both in the \nshort term and long term, as a result of higher costs built into the \ncost structure for health insurance, higher taxes that will impact \nsmall businesses and families across this country, and higher deficits \nfor which future generations are going to be assessed and have to pay.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know we are in morning business. But at \nthe conclusion of morning business I will be offering an amendment \nwhich I understand is the next one in order. Since there is nobody \ntaking the morning business time, I will take that time to begin the \ndiscussion of that amendment.\n  The amendment which I am proposing goes to this whole issue of who \nthe taxpayers of America should bail out. I personally don't think they \nshould bail out anybody, to be honest with you. They certainly should \nnot be bailing out financial institutions that have gotten too big. \nThey should not be bailing out automobile companies that have \noverextended themselves and are doing a poor job. They should not be \nbailing out other countries. They certainly should not be bailing out \nStates and local governments that are about to default on their debt.\n  It is very hard to explain to a citizen of New Hampshire or Illinois, \nConnecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, why their tax dollars should go \nto bail out a State which is about to default on the debt it has run up \nbecause it has been irresponsible in its spending. The obvious State \nthat comes to mind is the State of California, which has very serious \nproblems. But they are self-inflicted problems. These are not problems \nwhich were created as a result of some general problems across the \ncountry, and they were not problems created, for example, by an event--\nan environmental event or emergency such as Katrina.\n  They were totally self-inflicted problems. The question is, Should \nthe American taxpayer, all the rest of us in this country, be put in a \nposition where we have to bail out that State? I do not think we \nshould. That is what my amendment is going to go to.\n  But I see now the Senator from Florida has arrived.

Mr. President, I wish to thank my friend and colleague \nfrom New Hampshire for allowing me to take some time on the floor this \nmorning. If I may, I wish to speak about an issue that is of great \nimpact to Florida; that is, this oilspill. This is not the first time I \nhave come to the floor to speak about the potential impact this gulf \noilspill may have upon the coast of Florida.\n  I have called upon British Petroleum to set up a $1 billion fund, a \nreplenishing or evergreen fund, if you will, so we can get to work to \nget ready to prepare, if this oil is to come ashore, to mitigate its \neffect, to prevent, as much as possible, the oil from coming ashore.\n  So far, there has been $25 million given to Florida and other Gulf \nStates, another $25 million is coming for advertising purposes. The \ngood news is, we believe the oil is not ashore yet. But there is some \ndisturbing new information.\n  This morning, I had the opportunity to speak to RADM William \nBaumgartner of the Coast Guard. Reports yesterday afternoon tell us \nsome tar balls have washed ashore in Key West, FL. That is far ahead of \nany projections of oil from this spill being put onto the Loop Current \nin the southern part of the Gulf of Mexico and coming in contact with \nthe southernmost point of Florida. It was not expected that that would \nhappen for several days. But it could be that the oil is far more \nspread out than we anticipated. It is not unusual for there to be oil \nto come upon the shore of Florida or any other Gulf States. In fact, it \nnaturally occurs. We know from the Florida Department of Environmental \nProtection that there were at least 600 reports in the past 2 years of \ntar balls and things such as that because, as we have come to find out, \nthis is a naturally occurring phenomenon as well, that oil will seep \nfrom the ocean floor and potentially come upon our shores in the form \nof tar balls and other small things.\n  But the concern is, these 20 tar balls that came upon the shore \nyesterday in Key West are from the gulf oilspill. If that is the case, \nthe oilspill is far larger and has spread far more quickly than we \ncould have anticipated.\n  Right now those samples of those tar balls are being sent for \nresearch and evaluation to determine whether they are, in fact, from \nthe oilspill that happened now almost 1 month ago. Whether those tar \nballs are from the disaster or whether they are naturally occurring, we \nknow this oil slick is spreading. We know it is going to get into the \nLoop Current, the Loop Current which will then bring that oil down \nclose to the Keys, potentially all the way up the Atlantic side of \nFlorida.\n\n[[Page S3856]]\n\n  We cannot wait to find out what is going to happen. We cannot wait to \npay claims after damages have already been incurred by the people of \nFlorida. Florida is reliant upon the beauty of its State for its \neconomy. We have actually more than 80 million tourists who come to \nFlorida each year, more than a $65 billion tourism industry. \nRecreational saltwater fishing has a $5 billion impact on Florida and \nis responsible for more than 50,000 jobs. Recreational boating has an \n$18 billion impact. We have more registered boaters in Florida than any \nother State in the Union. Some 90 percent of Florida's population lives \nwithin 10 miles of its coast. We are the State, besides Alaska, with \nthe largest coastline and more beaches than any other State.\n  There have been a lot of problems here. One, why did this spill \nhappen; the failure of regulation by the Department of the Interior, \nthe lack of a quick response by this administration, and a lack of a \nquick response by British Petroleum, mistakes being made at the scene; \nwhy did the blowout preventers fail, all the other things we have read \nabout and heard about. We are having hearings in Congress on what \ncaused this tragic incident to happen in the first place.\n  We are going to get to the bottom of all those things. Right now we \nneed dollars in the hands of our States in the gulf, to get together \nour volunteers, our businesses, our local governments, county, city, \nand State, to try to prevent this oil from coming ashore. We need a \nflotilla of Florida boaters out there trying to scoop up these tar \nballs before they come ashore.\n  We need a volunteer effort not unlike what we had in World War II in \nEurope, where the British came to Dunkirk and rescued the military and \nbrought them ashore when they were fleeing. We need to get the Florida \nvolunteers, senior citizens and others, on the beaches getting ready to \nhelp mitigate this damage that I think, unfortunately, is going to come \nashore.\n  We need the funds to do that today. We do not need them a month from \nnow. We do not need them 6 months from now. We do not need them a year \nfrom now to pay claims. We need to do everything possible to keep that \noil from coming ashore. If we do that, we can keep our economy, our \ntourism economy strong. Right now, people need to know they should \nstill be coming to Florida to fish, still be coming to Florida for a \nbeach vacation because the oil has not washed upon the shore in west \nFlorida, on the panhandle, and we only have these 20 tar balls in the \nKeys. Let's hope that is the end of it.\n  I did not want to miss this opportunity to come to the floor to make \nthe point again that we need to make sure the money comes now. Senator \nVitter and I and others have filed legislation to make sure oil \ncompanies are responsible well beyond the $75 million cap for damages \nto communities that are impacted by these oilspills. It is focused on \nprofits, more than it is focused on a $10 billion cap, which is a \nproposal that my friends and colleagues have proposed.\n  Why does it make more sense? Well, based on profits, we know BP may \nbe liable for up to as much as $20 billion for this incident. That is \nmore money to help pay for this. Second, if you just put it on $10 \nbillion, we are only going to have two or three oil companies in this \ncountry because no other oil company will be able to get into the \nbusiness because they will not be able to afford the potential $10 \nbillion cap.\n  If you do not have enough money to pay for it, $10 billion is pretty \nillusory anyway. What we need to be focused on is making sure those \nresponsible can pay and pay enough to make sure we solve the problem. A \nlot needs to be done.\n  A lot of questions need to be asked. A lot of answers need to be \nforthcoming. But right now we need the dollars to protect our \nshorelines and our beaches.\n  I see my colleague and friend from New Hampshire is ready to speak \nagain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3856-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

Mr. President, I sort of did a trailer version of this \nbill a few minutes ago while we had some time in morning business. But \nlet me discuss the amendment again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator call up his amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I call up amendment No. 4051 and ask unanimous consent \nthat the pending amendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4051 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To prohibit taxpayer bailouts of fiscally irresponsible State \n                         and local governments)\n\n       On page 18, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO PAY STATE \n                   OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no Federal funds may be used to purchase or guarantee \n     obligations of, issue lines of credit to or provide direct or \n     indirect grants-and-aid to, any State government, municipal \n     government, local government, or county government which has \n     defaulted on its obligations, is at risk of defaulting, or is \n     likely to default, absent such assistance from the United \n     States Government.\n       (b) Limit on Use of Borrowed Funds.--The Secretary shall \n     not, directly or indirectly, use general fund revenues or \n     funds borrowed pursuant to title 31, United States Code, to \n     purchase or guarantee any asset or obligation of any State \n     government, municipal government, local government, or county \n     government or to otherwise assist such governments, in any \n     instance in which the State government, municipal government, \n     or county government has defaulted on its obligations, is at \n     risk of defaulting, or is likely to default, absent such \n     assistance from the United States Government.\n       (c) Limit on Federal Reserve Funds.--The Board of Governors \n     shall not, directly or indirectly, lend against, purchase, or \n     guarantee any asset or obligation of any State government, \n     municipal government, local government, or county government \n     or to otherwise assist such governments, in any instance in \n     which the State government, municipal government, local \n     government, or\n\n[[Page S3857]]\n\n     county government has defaulted on its obligations, is at \n     risk of defaulting, or is likely to default, absent such \n     assistance from the United States Government. Notwithstanding \n     any other provision of law, no Federal funds may be used to \n     pay the obligations of any State, or to issue a line of \n     credit to any State.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this amendment is pretty simple. It says \nAmerican taxpayers should not be put on the hook for States which have \nbeen profligate. It says, specifically, that: Federal funds cannot be \nused to purchase obligations of States or local communities that are in \ndefault or are about to default, unless those States have gone through \nsome sort of crisis such as the Katrina situation.\n  But if the default that the State or local community is about to \nexperience is the function of their failure to discipline their fiscal \nhouse, then we are not going to ask the taxpayers across this country \nto support that error in judgment and that misguided fiscal policy of \nthat State or that local government.\n  If we do not have this type of rule in play, basically we will be \nsetting up a situation where the American people will become the \nguarantor of inappropriate actions across this country by legislators \nand city governments. You will have this untoward situation where you \nwill basically create an atmosphere that there is an incentive for \nState governments and local communities to not be fiscally responsible.\n  It is this moral hazard issue. We debated it at considerable length \nwhen we discussed too big to fail in the banking system. This bill has \na lot of issues, as far as I am concerned, but one of the things it \nactually handles reasonably well is the issue of too big to fail. It \ndoes need some adjustment. But it basically handles that issue pretty \nwell.\n  We have designed language in this bill between Senator Dodd and \nSenator Shelby, which essentially says: No longer will the American \ntaxpayer be presumed or in any way expected or have any obligation at \nall to support a financial institution which has gotten too large and \nhas taken on too many risky decisions and is therefore in fiscal \ndistress. That institution will fail. Its stockholders will be wiped \nout. Unsecured bondholders will be wiped out and the American taxpayer \nwill not come in and defend that situation.\n  Too big to fail ends with this bill, hopefully. But it should apply \nalso to States and local governments. We should not create the moral \nhazard of having taxpayers in New Hampshire or taxpayers in Nebraska or \ntaxpayers in New Mexico responsible for profligate activity in other \nStates.\n  In fact, many of our States, of course, have balanced budget \nrequirements. In fact, in Nebraska, they do not even allow any debt, \nperiod. They have a constitutional amendment that says, there can be no \ndebt. So they are extremely disciplined, these States, in the way they \nhandle their budgets.\n  The taxpayers and the citizens of those States expect their leaders \nto be disciplined. So how can we ask those taxpayers and those citizens \nin those States that have been disciplined, who have elected people who \nare willing to live within their means as they govern, whether it is at \nthe community level or at the State level, how can we ask those \ncitizens across this country to go in and bail out other States and our \ncommunities that have been totally undisciplined in managing their \nfiscal house and have put themselves at huge distress and have \ndefaulted on their debt or are about to default on their debt?\n  This is not acceptable. If we are going to have a bill which \naddresses the issue of too big to fail, it should apply to this type of \na situation. So I have offered this amendment. It is very simple, as I \nsaid. It prohibits Federal funds from being used to purchase or \nguarantee obligations of States and local communities that are in \ndefault or about to go into default.\n  It is a pretty strict standard, pretty clear. If you have a State \nthat for reasons of its own making has created a fiscal mess of \ninordinate proportions and cannot pay its debt, it cannot come to \nWashington and say: We want you to bail us out.\n  That is not right. That is not appropriate. So this bill bans that \nsort of an event from occurring. Why do we need to do this? It is \npretty obvious. There are a couple States in this country that have \nbeen irresponsible in their spending, that have not disciplined \nthemselves, and that, I think, are expecting everybody else in this \ncountry to bail them out.\n  I sure do not want to be part that. I do not want my taxpayers in New \nHampshire to be part of that. It is not fair that they should be part \nof that. Those States are going to have to figure out how to straighten \nout their own fiscal house. They should have to do that within the \nterms of their own spending streams and their own revenue streams.\n  They should not expect the Federal Government to come in and take \nthem out of their distress, which was self-imposed and self-created. \nThere is an exception in this bill. There is this language so that if a \nState is put into severe distress because of an emergency situation, \nsuch as a Katrina-type situation, this would not apply. Obviously, it \nshould not apply then.\n  If it is a self-imposed event, simply resulting from the human nature \nof legislators and city councils to sometimes spend a heck of a lot \nmore money than they have and that they can take in under their \nstructure, they should have to pay for it and figure out how to deal \nwith it themselves. They should not pass that problem on to the \nAmerican people by financing it through Washington. It is consistent \nwith the theme of this bill that there should be nothing that is too \nbig to fail in this country, including State governments and local \ngovernments or financial institutions. I hope my colleagues will \nsupport the amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as I take the floor today, my colleagues \nand I are caught up in a momentous debate over the shape of our Wall \nStreet reform bill.\n  This legislation will not only help secure America's continuing \neconomic recovery, it will also help prevent this kind of economic \ncrisis from happening again in the future.\n  It would create commonsense regulations designed to keep major \ninstitutions from gambling with America's economic stability, and it \nwould extend a helping hand to the underserved populations that are \ncurrently suffering the most especially minority individuals and the \nelderly.\n  I believe when the history of this economic crisis is written, we \nwill judge that its most damaging legacy was the harm it did to \npeople's savings and investments.\n  It wiped out stock portfolios and 401(K)s. It forced many fixed-\nincome retirees to go back to work, and it undermined the hard-earned \nretirement security of an entire generation of Americans. So it is time \nto take action.\n  We need to do everything we can to protect people's savings, \ninvestments, and retirement security.\n  In a broad sense, this means limiting the risk that big firms can \npose to the economy as a whole, and shoring up our overall financial \nstability. But it also means we need to guard against fraud and abuse.\n  We need to prevent scam artists and people like Bernie Madoff from \ntaking advantage of hard-working Americans, so folks can breathe a bit \neasier, so people know that their money is safe.\n  Today, many Americans--including 39 percent of minority households--\ninvest in the financial markets.\n  Most of these folks expect their portfolio to be there for them when \nthey retire.\n  But when big companies sell risky investment packages, and then bet \nagainst those investments--when companies have no incentive to be \nhonest about high-risk opportunities--regular folks are bound to get \nthe short end of the stick.\n  That is why we need to institute basic rules of the road--to cut down \non fraud and misrepresentation, and make sure financial institutions \nare operating fairly.\n  That is why our Wall Street reform bill includes a number of key \nprotections for American investors.\n  Our legislation would create a new program at the Securities and \nExchange Commission which would mandate an annual assessment of all \ninternal supervisory controls, and encourage folks to report \nviolations.\n\n[[Page S3858]]\n\n  It would establish a new Office of Credit Rating Agencies to \nstrengthen regulation, expose hidden risks, and make sure a warning \nsystem is in place so we are never caught off guard again.\n  Our bill would also require companies that sell mortgage-backed \nsecurities to hold on to at least 5 percent of the credit risk--or meet \nunderlying loan standards--so their performance is tied to the products \nthey are distributing.\n  It would require these companies to be more transparent about the \nassets that underlie these securities, and more straightforward in \ntheir quality analysis.\n  Finally, our legislation would give a company's shareholders the \nright to a nonbinding vote on executive pay so pay can be brought in \nline with performance, and these folks can make their voices heard.\n  Together these measures would help to bring transparency and \nstability back to the financial markets.\n  This would bolster the integrity of people's investments, and would \nhelp ensure that their retirement savings are secure.\n  There will always be risk associated with making investments, and \nthat is exactly as it should be.\n  That is how our free market system is designed to work.\n  But we need to eliminate the possibility that fraud and abuse can \nundermine the security of our entire economy.\n  We need to pass rules of the road that will keep financial \ninstitutions honest, so ordinary Americans will be protected from \nserious harm at the hands of those they entrust with their savings.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time under the quorum be charged equally to both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. I joined the Senate Banking Committee about a year and a \nhalf ago, shortly after failures on Wall Street forced a taxpayer \nbailout. Bear Stearns, AIG, and other pillars of our economy had \ncollapsed, and we learned that our financial system was built on a \nfoundation of sand. The crisis on Wall Street hit Wisconsin households \nhard. Families lost their homes, workers lost their jobs, and retirees \nlost their life savings.\n  Seventy years ago Congress reacted aggressively to our gravest \neconomic crisis, and put us on the road to prosperity by creating new \nregulations and institutions that avoided a meltdown for generations. \nBy creating agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission and \nestablishing margin requirements, the Federal Government helped put the \nmarkets back on track.\n  We are now called on to set up rules to put our economy on the right \ntrack just like we did in the 1930s. For over a year, the Senate \nBanking Committee held hearings to study the financial crisis. We know \nthat the conditions that led to this mess did not occur suddenly in \n2008, and these problems cannot be fixed overnight.\n  Wall Street needs accountability and transparency to avoid future \nfinancial meltdowns. The legislation we are considering takes vital \nsteps to end ``too big to fail,'' bring unregulated shadow markets into \nthe light, and make our financial system work better for everyone.\n  This bill protects Main Street jobs by focusing on Wall Street, where \nthe crisis began. Community banks and credit unions have continued to \nact responsibly, and should not be subject to new layers of regulation \nthat will impede their business.\n  The bill also protects consumers, and I would like to thank Senator \nAkaka for working with me on the consumer protections in title XII of \nthis bill. This title will help mainstream financial institutions make \nsmall loans on affordable terms to people who are currently limited to \nriskier choices like payday loans. This title will also help Americans \nget bank accounts, and encourages banks to offer financial education to \ntheir customers.\n  I would also like to thank my friend and Chairman Chris Dodd for his \nleadership on this legislation. Fixing our financial system is a \ncomplex challenge, and Chairman Dodd has worked tirelessly to get this \ndone right. He has been called upon to do so much in this Congress, and \nhe has done it all with fairness, wisdom, and good humor. We will miss \nhis steady hand in the future.\n  I hope the Senate will continue to work in a bipartisan manner to \ncomplete this important bill. Our economy is slowly recovering from a \ndevastating shock, and we must ensure that our progress is built on a \nmore secure foundation. Continuing business as usual on Wall Street is \nnot an option.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the Gregg amendment and \nask unanimous consent to be included as an original cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. It is important we recognize what a fiscal crisis we face \nin the United States. Today, America's public debt stands at over $12.9 \ntrillion. Regrettably, that will be on our children's and \ngrandchildren's credit cards. We have, just last year, raised that debt \nby $1.4 trillion, and it will be $1.6 trillion added this year. This \nmountain of debt is going on the backs of our children and \ngrandchildren. We will have to pay the interest on it, but they are the \nones who will bear the real burden. Taxpayers are already bailing out \nWall Street and failed banks with $700 billion; GM and Chrysler, $80 \nbillion; the toxic twins, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, more than $1.2 \ntrillion. We have tried unsuccessfully to deal with Fannie and Freddie \nin this financial regulation bill. When we look at the cause of the \nfinancial crisis, it is the subprime market, the bad home loans that \nwere enabled by Fannie and Freddie being willing to purchase them. In \nmy humble estimation, we should not pass a financial regulation bill \ndesigned to prevent a reoccurrence of the crisis which we have just \ngone through without dealing with Fannie and Freddie.\n  But when you look at the budget deficit, taxpayers are on the hook \nfor $1 trillion in a failed stimulus package which only created jobs in \nthe governments. It was a government expansion, not a measure to create \njobs in the private sector.\n  The President and majorities in Congress have also recently created a \nnew taxpayer-funded entitlement for health insurance. Many of us in \nDecember were pointing out the fact that this bill would add to the \ndebt, it would drive up costs of private health insurance, it would \nlimit the ability of seniors on Medicare to get their services by \ncutting the amount of money going into Medicare, and it would lead to \nhigher taxes.\n  Funny thing, the new Actuary at the CMS has just come out and \nrepeated those same four things. The health care bill is not only going \nto drive up private insurance costs, you are not going to be able to \nkeep the same plan you had, it will continue to squeeze down the \nservices Medicare recipients can receive, and it will add to the \ndeficit and, thus, the debt.\n  But how much more debt and how many more unfunded liabilities can we \ntake on before destroying the economy? What is happening in Greece, \nregrettably, could happen here. I strongly support the Gregg amendment, \nwhich will ensure that taxpayer funds are not used to bail out States.\n  We talked about too big to fail in terms of financial institutions. \nWe ought to be talking about it in terms of governments. We adopted an \namendment saying we should not use taxpayer money to bail out Greece. \nBut we should not be in the position where we would be called upon to \nbail out States which have been unable to get their spending under \ncontrol and get their spending in line with their revenues.\n  I know a little bit about tight State budgets. When I was Governor of \nMissouri, we had to make tough decisions. I came back into office as \nGovernor in 1981, with a huge deficit in the middle of the year, and we \ncould not borrow money to cover that deficit. So we made major, drastic \ncuts in spending,\n\n[[Page S3859]]\n\nand it was not pleasant. I was picketed by people who had to be laid \noff from the State government. But we readjusted and managed to provide \nservices our State needed and put the State back on a sound financial \nfooting.\n  States all across the country are taking tough steps. There are areas \nwhere they have agreed to go without services to get their budget back \nin balance. Most States do not have the ability to run deficits. Those \nthat do have the ability to do that should not be operating on the \nfalse assumption that the Federal taxpayers and our children and our \ngrandchildren will come back in and be asked to take the irresponsible \nand unacceptable task of putting a burden on residents of the States \nthat have made the tough decisions and cut spending to pay for the \nmounting debt of other States that have spent their way into the red \nfor years.\n  In fact, a bailout of States would create a disincentive, an ongoing \ndisincentive, for State leaders to make tough decisions and implement \nnecessary reforms to get their budgets in balance and future \nliabilities under control.\n  The Missourians I hear from are very angry. They are angry every day \nat spending money on things that are too big to fail. They are angry \nthat the government continues to use their hard-earned dollars to help \ncompanies such as AIG and potentially to help a country such as Greece, \nwhich failed, instead of paying down our debt and cutting the runaway \nspending.\n  This bailout mentality must end. I thought that was one message we \nwere going to carry with this legislation. I hope this legislation \nactually does, although I am concerned there are provisions that could \nenable the Federal Government to continue bailing out and taking over \nmore businesses.\n  The Federal Government must not continue to be an enabler of those \ncompanies or those countries or States that continue to spend beyond \ntheir means. It is time for the leadership at the State, as well as the \nnational level, to make the decisions necessary to put all of us on a \nsound financial footing.\n  I thank Senator Gregg for his strong leadership on budget issues and \nfor offering this amendment, and I urge my colleagues to support his \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, first, let me thank the Senator from \nMissouri for his thoughtful and substantive discussion of this \namendment. As a former Governor, I think he appreciates how tough it is \nto maintain balances in the State budget, and you have to make the very \ndifficult decisions to make sure your State does not get its fiscal \nhouse into disarray and end up defaulting on debt. That would be the \nworst thing that could possibly happen if you were a Governor--or one \nof the worst things. In any event, he certainly did that when he was \nGovernor. I tried to do that when I was Governor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from New Hampshire has \nexpired.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nSenator from Connecticut has used up the time that was originally \nallocated to him, the remaining time between now and 12:05 be divided \nequally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak on that \nremaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I think the Senator from Missouri has made a superb case \nthat it is inappropriate to set up a structure where States can be \nprofligate or communities can be profligate and then basically throw \nthe problems they have created on the rest of the country and the \ntaxpayers of the rest of the country--whether they are from New Mexico \nor Missouri or Connecticut or New Hampshire. There is no reason why our \ntaxpayers should pay for inappropriate fiscal actions by some other \nState or some other community. Rather, those States and communities \nshould have to straighten out their own financial house and not expect \nthat they can come to the Federal Government for a bailout if their \nproblems have been self-inflicted, created by their own failure to \ndiscipline their fiscal house.\n  As I said earlier in the discussion, a lot of States have a balanced \nbudget amendment. I am not sure whether Missouri did--New Hampshire did \nnot--but we understood if we did not run fiscally responsible budgets \nin New Hampshire, we would find our debt downgraded. That is what we \nwere worried about--to get to the point where you might actually \ndefault, which would be, as I said, a totally terrible situation.\n  But in States that have balanced budget amendments, States which have \nworked very hard to keep their fiscal house in order, the taxpayers of \nthose States should not have to suddenly step up and take care of the \ntaxpayers of another State that has failed to do that. It is not fair. \nIt is not equitable. You certainly do not want to create that \natmosphere because if you have an atmosphere where one State can throw \nits problems on to every other State, then you create an incentive for \nStates to be profligate and irresponsible.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4051, as Modified\n\n  With those comments, Mr. President, I ask to modify my amendment. I \nbelieve the modification is at the desk.\n  Have we shared the modification with the Chairman?\n  Mr. DODD. I believe so.\n  I ask the Senator, this is the modification?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. As I understand it, the modification is a new paragraph:\n\n       (d) Limitation.--Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to \n     federal assistance provided in response to a natural \n     disaster.\n\n  Is that right?\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it will be so modified.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 18, between lines 17 and 18, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 5. PROHIBITION ON THE USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS TO PAY STATE \n                   OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, no Federal funds may be used to purchase or guarantee \n     obligations of, issue lines of credit to or provide direct or \n     indirect grants-and-aid to, any State government, municipal \n     government, local government, or county government which has \n     defaulted on its obligations, is at risk of defaulting, or is \n     likely to default, absent such assistance from the United \n     States Government.\n       (b) Limit on Use of Borrowed Funds.--The Secretary shall \n     not, directly or indirectly, use general fund revenues or \n     funds borrowed pursuant to title 31, United States Code, to \n     purchase or guarantee any asset or obligation of any State \n     government, municipal government, local government, or county \n     government or to otherwise assist such governments, in any \n     instance in which the State government, municipal government, \n     or county government has defaulted on its obligations, is at \n     risk of defaulting, or is likely to default, absent such \n     assistance from the United States Government.\n       (c) Limit on Federal Reserve Funds.--The Board of Governors \n     shall not, directly or indirectly, lend against, purchase, or \n     guarantee any asset or obligation of any State government, \n     municipal government, local government, or county government \n     or to otherwise assist such governments, in any instance in \n     which the State government, municipal government, local \n     government, or county government has defaulted on its \n     obligations, is at risk of defaulting, or is likely to \n     default, absent such assistance from the United States \n     Government. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     Federal funds may be used to pay the obligations of any \n     State, or to issue a line of credit to any State.\n       (d) Limitation.--Subsections (a) and (b) shall not apply to \n     Federal assistance provided in response to a natural \n     disaster.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. A parliamentary question: Mr. President, don't I have the \nright to modify without asking for unanimous consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There was a time limit on the amendment. That \ndid require unanimous consent.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n12:05 p.m. be divided for debate with respect to the Gregg amendment \nNo. 4051, and that at 12:05 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the amendment, with the provisions of the previous order \nremaining in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me address this amendment, if I can.\n\n[[Page S3860]]\n\n  First of all, let me express my admiration and respect for Judd \nGregg. He and I are good friends. We have worked together on numerous \nissues over the years, so I have developed a great deal of respect for \nhim. In fact, it was Judd Gregg and a handful of others who made it \npossible, 18 months ago, for us to develop the emergency economic \nstabilization bill. Without his leadership and support, I think our \ncountry, unarguably, and, beyond our own borders, the world would have \nbeen in much more difficult economic shape--had it not been for his \nleadership, along with others who pulled together that proposal that \npassed this body 75 to 24 on that night in late September of 2008. So \nmy admiration for Senator Gregg--and among other accomplishments he has \nhad during his service here--is strong.\n  This proposal, however, goes way beyond anything I have ever quite \nseen here, which basically says the Federal Government cannot provide \nany help to States and local governments. Then the wording of it: even \nif you might be in trouble.\n  I go back and I think of New York City, a major metropolitan area of \nour country, which was in economic difficulties. I do not remember the \nhistory, exactly, of what occurred that brought the city to that fiscal \nbrink, but it was serious enough, and there was a serious debate here \nthat occurred before I became a Member of this body over what could be \ndone to help put that city back on its feet again.\n  As a result of the efforts, both in New York, New York State, as well \nas here, New York recovered, paid back whatever it was it received in \nfinancial assistance, and, arguably, the most important metropolitan \narea of our Nation survived a fiscal disaster.\n  Again, now, through the IMF and the World Bank, we appropriate moneys \neach and every year to support international organizations that have as \none of their purposes--or their purpose is to provide financial \nassistance and stability to nations that are struggling. In many cases, \nI suspect they are struggling for exactly the same reason my colleague \nand friend from New Hampshire has identified: They made bad choices, \nbad decisions. I am not suggesting their problems were afflicted by \noutside forces, although that could happen.\n  Certainly what we are watching today in Europe is a classic example, \nwhere you have other nations now in trouble because of one Nation's I \nwill even call it fiscal irresponsibility. I am not sure that is the \nfinal conclusion, but let's call it that. Yet we find the declining \nEuro, we find debt in trouble in that country, so other nations are \nfeeling the effects of it.\n  We have all seen where events could occur in our own country: The \nautomobile industry in Michigan ends up in deep trouble. That has an \nimpact on other States. It certainly affects the economy of Michigan. \nThe idea is ``one nation,'' and we are one nation. We are not Europe \nwhere we have separate political structures and separate rules and \nregulations and one currency which pose difficulties. We are one people \nhere, whether you live in New Hampshire or Connecticut or Arizona or \nAlaska or Hawaii or Texas or Oklahoma. Wherever it is, we are one \npeople.\n  Lord knows, we do not want to reward irresponsible behavior on the \npart of a local government or a State. But the idea that we are going \nto terminate or not provide any kind of assistance because we have \ndrawn the conclusion, in the wording of this amendment, as I read it in \nthis language here:\n\n       The Board of Governors shall not, directly or indirectly, \n     lend against, purchase--\n\n  All these things we could do here--\n\n       State government, municipal government, local government, \n     or county government [that] has defaulted on its obligations, \n     is at risk of defaulting, or is likely to default. . . .\n\n  Who makes that determination: ``is likely to default'' or ``is in \ndanger of''? Is there some omnipotent force that is going to lean over \nall of this and say: I think such and such a county or such and such a \nState is ``in danger of''? That is pretty vague language here to \ndecide, all of a sudden, regardless of the reasons.\n  We have excluded natural disasters. I appreciate that addition to \nthis amendment. But there can be other factors which can contribute to \nthese circumstances in a State.\n  Again, according to the language on the first page of the amendment, \nit says:\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no Federal \n     funds may be used to purchase or guarantee obligations of, \n     issue lines of credit to or provide direct or indirect \n     grants-and-aid to, any State. . . .\n\n  I remind my colleagues that is a pretty broad, sweeping proposal.\n  Medicaid; the Children's Health Insurance Fund; the CDC's disease \ncontrol, research, and prevention programs; the Special Supplementary \nNutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children; the Unemployment \nTrust Fund; Veterans Health Administration medical services; Department \nof Justice, State, and local enforcement assistance; FEMA--FEMA, I \nguess, may be excluded because of ``a natural disaster''--but the idea \nwe would be depriving a State of these resources seems to me would only \nexacerbate the problem.\n  Again, I will acknowledge in certain circumstances local governments \nor State governments have made irresponsible choices. But you do not \nblame the entire population of that State or locality because some \nleadership has made a bad choice and then cut off Medicaid, nutrition \nassistance, and so forth. Do you blame a child living in a State \nbecause some Governor, a mayor, a county executive has made dumb \ndecisions, and all of sudden, we say: ``I am sorry, you happen to live \nin that State. You are going to have to move. Go someplace else in \norder to get help''?\n  I, for the life of me, do not understand. I understand the \nfrustration we all feel when we read about States and localities that \ncould have made better decisions. But, again, I remind my colleagues \nhere, we are one Nation--one Nation. ``E Pluribus Unum''--they are the \nwords right above the Presiding Officer's chair--``from the many, \none.'' We are many: Over 300 million in 50 States and hundreds and \nhundreds of jurisdictions across the country. Thank the Lord we are not \njust some collection of disparate entities bound together by a common \ncurrency and little else. We are bound together by much more as a \nnation.\n\n  So I hope my colleagues, at 12:05 or thereafter when we vote on this, \nwould say respectfully to our friend from New Hampshire that this \namendment ought to be rejected.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I admire the Senator from Connecticut and I \nappreciate what he has done in his efforts to stabilize the financial \nindustry in this country. At the core of what he has done, of course, \nis to say: No more bailouts. That is essentially what this bill is \nabout: No more bailouts; the taxpayers of this country will not step up \nand bail out large financial institutions which have taken actions \nwhich have put them at risk financially, and the only people who should \nbear that burden are the stockholders and the unsecured bondholders of \nthose institutions.\n  What this bill also says is no bailouts, no bailouts for States which \nare in default or about to default on their debt. They are doing it not \nas a result of some external event forcing them into dire straits but \nbecause they simply spent their way into a fiscal situation where they \ncan't pay their own debts. Why should the people of Connecticut, the \npeople of New Hampshire have to bail out the people of California--\nlet's be honest about this; this is about California, the people of \nCalifornia--because their government has been totally irresponsible in \nspending for a large number of years, has created a massive obligation, \nespecially in their public pension programs, which they can't afford to \npay? Why did they run up those obligations? So that people who were \nrunning for office in California could get elected. Just promise this, \npromise that, promise this, promise that. Then, the people in New \nHampshire are supposed to pay to help those people get elected on those \npromises which they could never fulfill and for which they created \nobligations to pay for? I don't think so. I don't think that is fair or \nright.\n  If the people of New Hampshire and the people of Connecticut and the \npeople of New Mexico have been fiscally responsible in the managing of \ntheir towns and their cities and their States\n\n[[Page S3861]]\n\nand their counties, why should they suddenly have to pay for California \nwhich hasn't been? Clearly, they shouldn't. If we are going to have a \nno bailout bill, it ought to apply to California as well as to large \nfinancial institutions that have acted inappropriately and unwisely.\n  That is all this says. It doesn't say you are not going to be able to \nget your usual Federal assistance that comes through the usual course \nof action. That is a bit of hyperbole. I appreciate the intensity and \nenergy of the Senator from Connecticut, but that is hyperbole. This is \nabout not having Federal funds be available to States that are in \ndefault or about to go into default on their debt as a result of the \nactions of the State leadership as elected by the people of that State \nand not asking the people in the rest of the country to have to pay the \ncost of those inappropriate actions and those actions which were \nfiscally irresponsible. It seems like a proposal which is totally \nconsistent with the basic purpose of this bill, which is to end \nbailouts.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will not take a long time to respond.\n  First of all, the distinction between a public company--and, again, \nmy colleague is absolutely correct; we want to end bailouts of those \ncompanies, and we certainly want to discourage the kind of behavior \nthat can put a county or a city or a community or a State in fiscal \njeopardy.\n  But the legislation also looks backward. On page 2 of the amendment \nit says: ``Municipal government, local government, or county government \nwhich has defaulted on its obligation.'' So it isn't just those that \nmay default. Orange County, CA, for instance, defaulted, and worked \nitself out of its difficulties. But now I am to understand that because \nOrange County was in default a number of years ago, got out of its \ndifficulties, yet the adoption of this amendment would preclude Orange \nCounty potentially from getting any kind of assistance. I don't \nunderstand that.\n  Again, there are a lot of reasons, aside from natural disasters, why \nthis can happen. Some of them have nothing to do--a major industry \nwhich all of a sudden finds itself departed. How many times have we \nseen a company located in a State or a locality, particularly a county, \nthat is the major employer, employs thousands of people, all of a \nsudden go offshore. There is a dramatic decline in tax revenues that \ncome in. So that community's obligations to its citizenry on education, \nhealth, highways, everything else, all of a sudden are in jeopardy. \nThat is not mismanagement of the government. It is that company made \nthe decision to leave. All of a sudden we find an area in trouble and \nthey turn to their national government for some help, and we are \nsaying: Well, because you are at risk of defaulting--not that you have \ndefaulted; the language is, ``is likely to default or at risk to \ndefault,'' you can't get any help because you might be in trouble, not \nbecause you have done anything wrong necessarily but because it has \nhappened to you. I just feel that such a step would be draconian, in \nthe extreme, when it comes to the people of our Nation who, from time \nto time, need help with that list of obligations that would have to be \ncurtailed if a community is likely to or is at risk of defaulting or \nhas defaulted on its obligations. Over what period of time? Are we \ntalking about 10 years, 20 years, over 100 years? How far do I go back \nto determine whether someone has defaulted? What were the reasons for \nit that occurred at that time? It provides none of that relief, except \nthat maybe it was a natural disaster.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Would my distinguished colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. I am happy to yield.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, I would say to our distinguished chair of the \nBanking Committee that when you describe communities where businesses \nhave collapsed and left communities struggling, certainly we have many \nof those in Michigan. Through no fault of the communities, and many \ntimes through no fault of businesses in terms of our recession right \nnow, we have many communities in this situation.\n  Would the Senator from Connecticut agree that what we are talking \nabout is not the cities or counties but the local communities and what \nhappens? It is people. It is whether they are going to have a police \nforce, police on the street or whether they are going to have the \nfirefighters being able to answer if there is a fire or whether they \nare going to be able to pick up the garbage or whether they are going \nto be able to do snow removal on the streets. Aren't we talking about \nwhether communities--people, families, and communities--if they need \nhelp, whether we would be able to respond to them? So it is not about \nthe government; it is about whom it serves and the people who would be \nhurt through something such as this; would the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, my colleague from Michigan is absolutely \ncorrect and that was the point I made earlier and she makes it even \nmore strongly. Again, I don't want to sound like I am in a civics \nclass, but we are not just sort of a collection of disparate States and \ncommunities, we are a country, we are one Nation. It has been a great \nsource of our strength. Our country has been through difficult times \nperiodically, obviously through some natural disasters, through some \nmanmade disasters. We are dealing with one as we speak. That is not a \nnatural disaster occurring in the Gulf of Mexico; that is a manmade \none. People didn't put in the proper safeguards and all of a sudden we \nare looking at the worst environmental disaster maybe in our Nation's \nhistory.\n  What do we say to the States of Louisiana or Alabama or Florida, \ndepending upon where these currents flow, and all of a sudden we find \nmajor industries--tourism, for instance, in the State of Florida. I \ndon't know what percentage of the economy of that State depends upon \ntourism, but I suspect a pretty heavy number. All of a sudden beaches \nare closed on the west coast of Florida. Maybe that current brings it \naround to the east coast. All of a sudden hotels and resort areas are \nshut down. The economy begins to falter. A manmade disaster, created \nthrough the fault of some engineers or whoever else, of an oil company: \nWhat do we say if this amendment was adopted? I am sorry, Florida. It \nis in danger of defaulting or at risk of defaulting on its obligations \nbecause the revenues that would come into that State through the normal \nexercise of its business practices was affected not by a natural \ndisaster but by one created through the fault, malfeasance or \nmisfeasance of a company that caused this kind of danger--or Louisiana, \nwhich has already been through a natural disaster and is now facing \nthis one, or Alabama as well and its coastline.\n  So, again, for all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment. I thank my colleague from Michigan for making her points.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time, yield the floor, and note the \nabsence of a quorum. I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged \nequally between the two sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3884, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Cantwell and others, I \nask unanimous consent to send a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 171. LIMITATIONS ON BANK AFFILIATIONS.\n\n       (a) Limitation on Affiliation.--Beginning 2 years after the \n     date of enactment of the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010, no member bank may be affiliated, in \n     any manner described in section 2(b), with any corporation, \n     association, business trust, or other similar organization \n     that is engaged principally in the issue, flotation, \n     underwriting, public sale, or distribution at wholesale or \n     retail or through syndicate participation stocks, bonds, \n     debenture, notes, or other securities, except that nothing in \n     this section shall apply to any such organization which shall \n     have been placed in formal liquidation and which shall \n     transact no business, except such as may be incidental to the \n     liquidation of its affairs.\n\n[[Page S3862]]\n\n       (b) Limitation on Compensation.--Beginning 2 years after \n     the date of enactment of the Restoring American Financial \n     Stability Act of 2010, no officer, director, or employee of \n     any corporation or unincorporated association, no partner or \n     employee of any partnership, and no individual, primarily \n     engaged in the issue, flotation, underwriting, public sale, \n     or distribution, at wholesale or retail, or through syndicate \n     participation, of stocks, bonds, or other similar securities, \n     shall serve simultaneously as an officer, director, or \n     employee of any member bank, except in limited classes of \n     cases in which the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System may allow such service by general regulations when, in \n     the judgment of the Board of Governors, it would not unduly \n     influence the investment policies of such member bank or the \n     advice given to customers by the member bank regarding \n     investments.\n       (c) Prohibiting Depository Institutions From Engaging in \n     Insurance-Related Activities.--\n       (1) In general.--Beginning 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, in no case may a depository \n     institution engage in the business of insurance or any \n     insurance-related activity.\n       (2) Definition.--As used in this section, the term \n     ``business of insurance'' means the writing of insurance or \n     the reinsuring of risks by an insurer, including all acts \n     necessary to such writing or reinsuring and the activities \n     relating to the writing of insurance or the reinsuring of \n     risks conducted by persons who act as, or are, officers, \n     directors, agents, or employees of insurers or who are other \n     persons authorized to act on behalf of such persons.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 \nminutes remaining on Senator Gregg's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4051\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, the argument has been made that this bill \nwould somehow limit responses to natural or manmade disasters, a \nnatural disaster such as a flood or a tornado, a manmade disaster such \nas what is occurring in the gulf.\n  I have read this language. It is very clear. It is talking about \ndefaulting on obligations. It in no way restricts the ability of the \nFederal Government to respond to disasters.\n  I used to chair the subcommittee on the Federal Emergency Management \nAct, and when there was a disaster, we provided money for those \ndisasters, to deal with those disasters. But one cannot continue to \npresent unbalanced budgets and enact them into law and continue to \ndrive up the debt and say it is because of a natural or manmade \ndisaster.\n  That is a stupid decision. I don't think the taxpayers of the United \nStates should be in a position of bailing out governments that make bad \ndecisions and that, year after year after year, spend more money than \nthey are taking in on their ongoing obligations. It has nothing to do \nwith a sudden natural disaster or even a manmade disaster such as the \nspill in the gulf, which is partly natural and partly manmade. I agree \nthat we should not stop providing assistance where there is such a \ndisaster, but that is not the focus of this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues who really believe we should not be promising to \nbail out profligate States that continue to spend more than they take \nin, we should not bail them out with taxpayer funds.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 40 seconds.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I really think the Senator from Connecticut \nis sort of reaching in his arguments here. This is really about a State \nlike California defaulting and the rest of us having to pay for it. \nThat is what this is about. This is about a State that has been \nirresponsible, to be kind, with its spending and now finds itself in a \nsituation where it cannot pay its debt. You know the legislators of \nthat State are saying: Let's go to Washington and get the money so that \nwe can get reelected on the basis of spending all this money. That is \nnot fair. That is not how a federalist system is supposed to work. You \ncannot argue that the American system was set up so that when one State \nwould be profligate, another State would have to pay for the cost of \nthat profligateness.\n  The Senator's bill uses this same language. The Senator from \nConnecticut had phraseology that claimed my language as inappropriate \non the issue of default and how he defined it, and it basically mirrors \nhis language in title II. If it works in title II, it ought to work \nhere.\n  The real issue is that we should not set up a situation where States \nand communities can expect to spend a lot more than they can take in, \nknow they are spending more than they are taking in, run up a lot of \ndebts they cannot pay, and then come to the rest of America and say: \nYou pay our debts because we want to get reelected. That is what this \nis about. It is limiting the ability of States to act in a fiscally \nirresponsible manner and expect the country will stand behind them and \nbail them out.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time run \nequally against both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Gregg amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

We will possibly \nbe able to do that. We are trying to get that written up. As soon as we \nget it written up, I will present it. But I see my colleague from Texas \nis ready to speak, so I will yield the floor and let her go ahead.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was going to speak on the amendment \nSenator Landrieu and I have, the Hutchison-Landrieu amendment. I will \nbe happy to yield any time the chairman of the committee wishes to \nclarify. Until he does, I will speak on the\n\n[[Page S3863]]\n\nHutchison-Landrieu amendment, which is an amendment that has been filed \nbut is not yet pending.\n  This is an amendment that will provide a permanent exemption for \npublicly traded small businesses with less than $150 million from the \ncostly reporting requirements mandated by section 404(b) of the \nSarbanes-Oxley Act. In removing this great burden, our amendment will \nfree small businesses to focus on the capital investment and job \ncreation that we need now to get our Nation's economy back on the right \ntrack.\n\n  In 2002, Congress passed the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in the aftermath of \nthe huge accounting frauds at Enron, Tyco, and Worldcom. This landmark \nbill was enacted to restore investor confidence in the wake of these \nshocking abuses by making it harder for companies to misrepresent \ncorporate earnings.\n  Hindsight is 20-20, though, and, while the Sarbanes-Oxley Act was \nwell intentioned, it has created unexpected and unprecedented costs for \nthe small to medium sized businesses that serve as the backbone of our \neconomy.\n  The main culprit of this immense burden on small businesses is \nsection 404 of Sarbanes-Oxley. Here a public company is required to \ninclude in its annual report an assessment of the effectiveness of its \ninternal control structure and procedures for financial reporting. The \ncompany's auditor must attest to and report on the company's \nassessment.\n  The compliance costs of section 404(b) have been far greater than \nexpected. In 2009, the SEC reported that companies paid an average of \n$2.3 million to comply with section 404. When taking into account the \nsize of a company, small businesses with less than $150 million in \npublic float, or the shares held by outside investors, are \ndisproportionately encumbered by section 404(b), facing a compliance \ncost that is seven times greater than large companies.\n  Small businesses are being forced to tie up time and money on \nburdensome amounts of paperwork. They should be directing these \nresources toward operations and capital investment that will create \njobs and spur our economy toward recovery. The Hutchison-Landrieu \namendment will fix this issue, ensuring that smaller public companies \nwill no longer be subject to the cost burden imposed by section 404(b).\n  Under current SEC rules, small public companies with less than $75 \nmillion in public float are now exempt from section 404(b). However, \nthis exemption expires in June. The Hutchison-Landrieu amendment builds \non this existing exemption and takes into account recommendations from \nthe SEC to increase the exemption. Our amendment will permanently \nexempt small businesses with less than $150 million in public float \nfrom the section 404(b).\n  I am pleased that my amendment has the strong bipartisan support of \nmy colleague, the distinguished chair of the Small Business Committee, \nSenator Landrieu. I also thank our other cosponsors, Senator Bob \nBennett, Senator Scott Brown, Senator Crapo, Senator DeMint, and \nSenator Hatch.\n  We are offering our amendment on behalf of the small businesses \nacross our country that face this disproportionate burden. We have the \nsupport of: The Biotechnology Industry Organization, The Competitive \nEnterprise Institute, TechAmerica, The Association for Competitive \nTechnologies, Advanced Medical Technology Association, and Technet.\n  These groups represent the companies that want to innovate. That want \nto grow. They want to excel. But their companies are spending vast \namounts of money on compliance costs, and, according to an SEC study, \nthis money is being misdirected. The SEC reports that 75 percent of \ncompanies believe that the attestations of auditors required by \nSarbanes-Oxley have little to no impact on investor confidence. Thus, \nrather than devoting important resources to invest and create jobs, \nsmall businesses are spending millions of dollars on paperwork that \ninvestors don't even care about.\n  Our amendment also has the support of the Independent Community \nBankers of America, and the American Bankers Association. Our community \nbanks want to lend to worthy entrepreneurs and help jump start our \neconomy. But our entrepreneurs and small businesses are hesitant to \ngrow if they are hit with the high costs associated with 404(b) \ncompliance.\n  We are also offering this amendment because of the unintended \nconsequences on our initial public offering market brought by section \n404(b). Since the enactment of Sarbanes-Oxley in 2002, IPOs in the \nUnited States have been lower each year than in every year of the \n1990s. Even in 2006, the peak year of economic growth after Sarbanes-\nOxley, the 162 U.S. IPOs were far below the 295 IPOs issued in 1991 \nwhen our economy was mired in recession. This drop-off in IPO's hit the \nmap in 2008 and 2009, when, according to a Renaissance Capital report, \nthe IPO level was lower than any period since the Vietnam war.\n  Why is this? Why are companies avoiding initial public offerings? Why \nare companies refusing to access the capital that the stock markets \nprovide? Quite frankly, companies do not want to deal with onerous \nburden of Sarbanes-Oxley. And based on the costs I mentioned, who can \nblame them?\n  This provision incentivizes small businesses to remain private to \navoid 404(b) altogether. Worse, it incentivizes small businesses to go \nabroad to markets such as the London Stock Exchange, which has \nadvertised itself as a Sarbanes-Oxley Free Zone, to encourage our \ncompanies to do their IPOs there instead of in Ameirca.\n  Small businesses should not be incentivized to stop growing or list \noverseas. The Hutchison-Landrieu amendment also has the support of the \nNew York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ, who want to see American companies \nlist here and remain home-grown. Now more than ever, we should be \nencouraging our Nation's small businesses to invest in new jobs, plants \nand markets. Our amendment will help small businesses do this by \nreducing their paperwork costs. A similar measure was included in the \nHouse financial reform language, and with immense bipartisan support. I \nask my colleagues to support the Hutchison-Landrieu amendment to \npermanently exempt small businesses under $150 million from Sarbanes \nOxley section 404(b), to ensure that small businesses can fully devote \ntheir resources toward being the engines that drive our Nation's \neconomy.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the editorial \nthat appeared today in the Wall Street Journal that is entitled ``The \nNo-Cost Stimulus.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, May 18, 2010]\n\n                          The No-Cost Stimulus\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wants a floor vote this \n     week on financial regulatory reform, and he should first add \n     at least one provision worthy of the name. Senators Kay \n     Bailey Hutchison (R., Texas) and Mary Landrieu (D., La.) have \n     offered an amendment to spare the smallest public companies \n     from the worst bureaucratic horrors of the 2002 Sarbanes-\n     Oxley law.\n       Sarbox, the Beltway's previous attempt at financial-\n     regulatory reform, was intended to improve the information \n     investors receive about public companies. The law did nothing \n     to prevent poor disclosure at companies like Lehman Brothers \n     but it did saddle the U.S. economy with billions in \n     unexpected costs. Even the Securities and Exchange \n     Commission, a Sarbox cheerleader, found in a 2009 survey that \n     the average public company pays more than $2 million per year \n     complying with the law's Section 404. The indirect costs may \n     be much greater, as initial public offerings of U.S. \n     companies have never returned to pre-Sarbox levels.\n       The SEC admits that compliance burdens fall \n     disproportionately on smaller companies. This is one reason \n     the two Senators aim to exempt companies with less than $150 \n     million of shares held by the public from ``internal-\n     controls'' audits.\n       These audits are piled on top of the traditional financial \n     audit, and on top of a company's own internal-controls \n     review. The result is that going public in the U.S., once the \n     dream of entrepreneurs world-wide, has for too many company \n     founders become something to avoid. If President Obama is \n     hoping for an unemployment rate below 9%, encouraging these \n     job creators is an obvious step.\n       Thanks to New Jersey's Republican Scott Garrett and \n     Democrat John Adler, the House has already passed a similar \n     reform. Now the Senate should allow America's most innovative \n     companies to create jobs at no cost to taxpayers.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, this editorial that appeared in the \nWall Street Journal today says we can have\n\n[[Page S3864]]\n\na stimulus that will cost taxpayers nothing by freeing our small \nbusinesses and especially our entrepreneurial and high-tech businesses \nfrom the burdens of all this paperwork and instead let them focus on \ngrowing, on listing their IPOs in America for the benefit of the \nAmerican economy. That is what we should be doing, and that is what the \neditorial says.\n  I hope very much my colleagues will listen and we will be able to \npass the Hutchison-Landrieu amendment, hopefully by voice vote. This \nshould be a unanimous amendment passage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, earlier today I, along with 67 other \nSenators, sent a letter to President Obama on an issue that has \nconcerned the Congress since the late 1980s.\n  Our letter, signed by more than two-thirds of the Senate, commends \nthe President for conducting a comprehensive review of the U.S. \nGovernment's policy on antipersonnel mines. That review has been \nunderway for some time, and I expect it will be completed later this \nsummer.\n  It has involved consultations with the Department of Defense \nincluding active and retired U.S. military officers, the Department of \nState including current and former U.S. diplomats, key military allies, \nand humanitarian and arms control organizations. The review has \nexamined the historical record, asked rigorous questions, and solicited \na wide range of views.\n  I want to thank the Senators who joined me and Senator Voinovich in \nsigning this letter, which states our belief that through a thorough, \ndeliberative review the administration can identify any obstacles to \njoining the Ottawa Treaty banning the production, use, transfer and \nstockpiling of antipersonnel mines, and develop a plan to overcome them \nas soon as possible.\n  The treaty has been signed by 158 countries, including our NATO \nallies whose troops are fighting with our forces in Afghanistan and \nIraq, and by every other country in this hemisphere except Cuba.\n  This issue has a long history, and I do not have time to recount it \nin detail today. But suffice it to say that 13 years ago the United \nStates missed an opportunity to play a leadership role in the \ninternational effort to ban antipersonnel mines, which culminated in \nthe treaty. Although our country declined to join the treaty then, as \nearly as 1994 President Clinton announced to the United Nations General \nAssembly his support for ridding the world of antipersonnel mines, and \na plan to develop alternatives to these weapons with the intent of \njoining the treaty by 2006.\n  That date came and went, alternatives were developed, and U.S. troops \nhave fought in two wars without, to the best of our knowledge, using \nthese weapons. In the meantime, most of our closest allies have \nrenounced antipersonnel mines, and their militaries long ago made the \nnecessary doctrinal and technological adjustments to meet their force \nprotection needs in accordance with the requirements of the treaty.\n  Antipersonnel landmines, which are triggered by the victim, have no \nplace in the arsenal of a modern military. They function like some of \nthe IEDs used by insurgents in Afghanistan and Iraq that have caused so \nmany casualties of innocent people, as well as U.S. and coalition \nforces. Landmines are inherently indiscriminate, and no matter how \nsophisticated the technology they do not distinguish between a \ncombatant and a civilian. They can be dropped by aircraft or disbursed \nby artillery by the thousands over wide areas. In today's fast moving \nbattlefield where mobility is a priority, they can pose as much of a \ndanger to our own forces as to the enemy.\n  Thirteen years ago the Pentagon argued that we should continue to \nstockpile antipersonnel mines. They said these weapons might be \nnecessary in Korea or in a mechanized war against enemy armor.\n  But ownership and control of the mines in the Korean DMZ have been \ntransferred to South Korea, and the United States has renounced the use \nof these types of mines, including in Korea. While there is the \npossibility that one day we may find ourselves in a conventional war \nagainst a major world power, antipersonnel landmines would have little \nif any utility or relevance in such a war. Rather than our own troops \nneeding these weapons, if our adversary were so lacking in more \neffective weapons as to use them, our troops would not need \nantipersonnel mines they would need effective countermine technology.\n  There have been other arguments made, none of which are persuasive. \nFor example:\n  Some have asked, after landmines what is the next weapon the Pentagon \nwill be asked to give up? Isn't this a slippery slope for those seeking \nto ban other types of weapons? This hypothetical question has nothing \nto do with antipersonnel landmines, which are in a unique category of \nweapons that are designed to be triggered by the victim.\n  They are not like bullets or bombs that are aimed or targeted by a \nsoldier. They are inherently indiscriminate, activated by whoever comes \ninto contact with them, whether an enemy soldier, a refugee woman \nsearching for firewood, or a child. Renouncing landmines should have no \nbearing on U.S. policy toward other weapons.\n  I have heard it asked how we can ensure that our troops can operate \nin coalitions with countries that are not parties to the treaty, for \nexample South Korea. The answer is the same way as the NATO countries \nthat have signed the treaty whose troops are fighting in coalition with \nour forces in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Why join the treaty when we are in de facto compliance already? What \nwould we gain at this point? First, this question implicitly \nacknowledges that the United States does not require antipersonnel \nlandmines. We have not used them since 1991, we have not exported them \nsince 1992, we have not produced them since 1997 and the Pentagon has \nno plan to do so in the future.\n  It is important to recognize that the United States is not causing \nthe mine problem today, although mines we exported to dozens of \ncountries, or that are left over from past wars involving U.S. forces \nespecially in Southeast Asia, continue to kill and injure civilians.\n  But most importantly, it would be a mistake to underestimate or \ndevalue the positive reaction, practical effects and depth of goodwill \ntoward the United States and our military that would result from \njoining the treaty. Other countries know the United States, the world's \nmost powerful nation, needs to be part of multilateral agreements if \nthose agreements are to achieve their goals. And they know the United \nStates needs to be part of the solution to the landmine problem,\n\n[[Page S3865]]\n\nwhich means more than conforming our policy to the treaty and it means \nmore than joining the treaty. It means actively using our influence to \npersuade other counties to join. Countries like India and Pakistan, \nChina and Russia, Israel and Egypt today make the excuse that the \nUnited States has not joined, so why should they?\n  One particularly farfetched notion is that giving up landmines while \nRussia, China and other potential adversaries keep theirs is at odds \nwith our usual arms control strategy, which seeks to use disarmament \nagreements as a means of enhancing U.S. security. This makes sense in \nthe context of long-range missiles and nuclear bombs, but antipersonnel \nlandmines? We have not used these weapons for 19 years, and no one can \ncredibly argue that they are necessary to protect the national security \nof the United States or that our security is threatened by China's and \nRussia's antipersonnel landmines which are deployed along their common \nborder.\n  Today, the United States is the largest contributor to humanitarian \ndemining, a fact I am proud of, and I have been asked if by joining the \ntreaty we would feel less obligated to support it. This question is \nnonsensical to me. Speaking as the chairman of the Appropriations \nsubcommittee that funds these programs, whether or not we are a party \nto the treaty has nothing to do with our interest and responsibility in \nhelping get rid of the millions of mines and other unexploded ordnance \nthat litter and plague dozens of countries, including allies like \nJordan, Afghanistan and Vietnam whose citizens continue to lose their \nlives and limbs from these hidden killers. Some of those mines and \nbombs were manufactured here and left behind by U.S. forces decades \nago.\n  Some might ask why bother developing a plan to join the treaty, since \nthe fact that 68 Senators signed a letter supporting it does not \nguarantee that two-thirds of the Senate will vote to ratify it. It is \ntrue that no one can guarantee what the U.S. Senate will do about \ntreaties or anything else. But that is hardly a reason not to join. The \nfact that more than two-thirds of the Senate today supports such a \npolicy, including 10 Republicans and 2 Independents, should certainly \ngive momentum to doing so, and convey to the President that the treaty \nwould find wide acceptance in the Senate.\n  Finally, I have heard it suggested that U.S. troops might need \nantipersonnel mines in Afghanistan. I find it hard to imagine that the \nUnited States, which has spent hundreds of millions of dollars to get \nrid of mines left over from past wars in Afghanistan that have killed \nand injured more civilians than in any other country, at a time when \nour military leaders are trying to minimize civilian casualties which \nhave caused so many Afghans to turn against us, would use antipersonnel \nlandmines in Afghanistan--a party to the treaty--and risk the public \noutcry that would result.\n  We could debate whether the United States should have joined the \nOttawa Convention 13 years ago, but there is no point in that. The \nquestion today is why not now? Many years have passed and we have seen \nthe benefits of the treaty. The number of antipersonnel mines produced \nand exported has plummeted, as has the number of victims.\n  But landmines remain a deadly legacy in many countries, and the world \nneeds the leadership of the United States to help universalize the \ntreaty and put an end to the time when antipersonnel landmines were an \nacceptable weapon. It will not happen overnight, but it will never \nhappen without U.S. support. As President Obama said in his acceptance \nspeech for the Nobel Peace Prize, ``I am convinced that adhering to \nstandards, international standards, strengthens those who do, and \nisolates and weakens those who don't.'' We are fortunate to have a \nPresident, and top leaders at the Pentagon and commanders on the \nbattlefield, who recognize that civilians far too often bear the brunt \nof war's misery, and who believe that we can and must do more to \nprevent it. There is no better way to begin implementing that important \nprinciple, and working toward that goal, than by joining the Ottawa \nTreaty.\n  The United States is by far the world's strongest military power. We \nalso have the moral authority that no other country has and the \nobligation to use that authority in ways that set an example for the \nrest of the world. It was 16 years ago that President Clinton embraced \nthe goal of ridding the world of these indiscriminate weapons. The \nObama administration's review of U.S. policy can finally turn that goal \ninto reality.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the letter sent to President \nObama be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President, we are writing to convey our strong \n     support for the Administration's decision to conduct a \n     comprehensive review of United States policy on landmines. \n     The Second Review Conference of the Convention on the \n     Prohibition of the Use, Stockpiling, Production and Transfer \n     of Anti-Personnel Mines and on Their Destruction, held last \n     December in Cartagena, Colombia, makes this review \n     particularly timely. It is also consistent with your \n     commitment to reaffirm U.S. leadership in solving global \n     problems and with your remarks in Oslo when you accepted the \n     Nobel Peace Prize: ``I am convinced that adhering to \n     standards, international standards, strengthens those who do, \n     and isolates and weakens those who don't.''\n       These indiscriminate weapons are triggered by the victim, \n     and even those that are designed to self-destruct after a \n     period of time (so-called ``smart'' mines) pose a risk of \n     being triggered by U.S. forces or civilians, such as a farmer \n     working in the fields or a young child. It is our \n     understanding that the United States has not exported anti-\n     personnel mines since 1992, has not produced anti-personnel \n     mines since 1997, and has not used anti-personnel mines since \n     1991. We are also proud that the United States is the world's \n     largest contributor to humanitarian demining and \n     rehabilitation programs for landmine survivors.\n       In the ten years since the Convention came into force, 158 \n     nations have signed including the United Kingdom and other \n     ISAF partners, as well as Iraq and Afghanistan which, like \n     Colombia, are parties to the Convention and have suffered \n     thousands of mine casualties. The Convention has led to a \n     dramatic decline in the use, production, and export of anti-\n     personnel mines.\n       We note that our NATO allies have addressed their force \n     protection needs in accordance with their obligations under \n     the Convention. We are also mindful that anti-personnel mines \n     pose grave dangers to civilians, and that avoiding civilian \n     casualties and the anger and resentment that result has \n     become a key priority in building public support for our \n     mission in Afghanistan. Finally, we are aware that anti-\n     personnel mines in the Korean DMZ are South Korean mines, and \n     that the U.S. has alternative munitions that are not victim-\n     activated.\n       We believe the Administration's review should include \n     consultations with the Departments of Defense and State as \n     well as retired senior U.S. military officers and diplomats, \n     allies such as Canada and the United Kingdom that played a \n     key role in the negotiations on the Convention, Members of \n     Congress, the International Committee of the Red Cross, and \n     other experts on landmines, humanitarian law and arms \n     control.\n       We are confident that through a thorough, deliberative \n     review the Administration can identify any obstacles to \n     joining the Convention and develop a plan to overcome them as \n     soon as possible.\n       Sincerely,\n         Patrick Leahy, George V.

Mr. President, I know we have two side-by-side \namendments. I know the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Carper, has an \namendment which, by the way, I hope everyone on my side of the aisle \nwill support. It has to do with Federal preemption. I think it is a \ngood amendment. I do not think it goes far enough.\n  Let me speak to the differences. First of all, both the Carper \namendment and the Corker amendment deal with the fact that if there is \na Federal law relating to our banking system, that cannot be preempted, \ngenerally speaking, by State law. I think that is a good step in the \nright direction. Certainly, I commend Senator Carper for doing that.\n  It is something that, by the way, our national banks obviously fully \nsupport. They want the ability to operate around the country and know \nthat the rules of the road are basically going to be the same. Where \nthe Carper amendment falls short, and my amendment\n\n[[Page S3868]]\n\ndeals with an issue, is the fact that there are 50 State AGs around the \ncountry who, as a result of the Dodd bill, are going to be turned loose \non our community banks.\n  What I mean by that is, the consumer protection agency, as it has \nbeen created in the Dodd bill, has no check and balance. It has a very \nlarge budget. It is renting space, if you will, at the Federal Reserve. \nSo it has no prudential regulator that is overseeing the rules that it \ncreates.\n  This consumer protection agency has the ability to write rules with \nno veto authority against the safety and soundness of financial \ninstitutions. Then it has the ability to enforce those rules. A lot of \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle, and certainly people on my \nside of the aisle, have sought to protect community banks from this \nconsumer protection agency. Let's face it. A big part of that was to \nbuild political support for this bill so that community bankers all \nacross our country would rally because they were not necessarily going \nto be directly under the enforcement of consumer protection.\n  But the Dodd bill does something else that is very detrimental. That \nis why they still are very concerned. It allows the 50 State AGs around \nthis country to take actions against credit unions, to take actions \nagainst community banks, based on the rules that this consumer \nprotection agency creates.\n  So here we are, we are going to create an organization that has no \nreal check and balance against the rules that it writes. Then when it \nwrites a rule, an AG in Tennessee or an AG in Alabama or an AG in \nDelaware or Connecticut can take action against a community bank over \nthese rules.\n  So it does not matter anymore that this consumer protection agency \ndoes not enforce directly against that. Instead, what we have is these \nAGs all around the country who now will be suing credit unions, suing \nsmall banks over rules this Federal agency is creating that has no \ncheck and balance against it.\n  I find that very cumbersome. But to add to that, the Dodd bill adds \nlanguage called ``abusive.'' In other words, there is a new standard \nthat is going to be created and be the law of the land, a new standard \ncalled ``abusive'' that is very vague. By the way, this ``abusive'' \nlanguage comes in after the fact.\n  So what it means is, if party A and party B enter into a deal and an \nAG decides that under this abusive standard one party has been \naggrieved--this is after the fact--then whatever contract they have \nentered into, if it was a loan, for instance, which is likely to be the \ncase, that loan is totally done away with. You cannot enforce against \nit.\n  I think this is one of the worst attributes of this bill. The fact \nthat community bankers all across this country in some ways may have \nthought originally that they were not going to get caught up in this \nconsumer protection agency--oh, no, that is not the case. The fact is, \nagain, 50 AGs around this country--not based on statutes, based on \nrules--in other words, you know they have the enumerated statutes in \nthis bill under which they can make rules. Then there has been some \nadded in title X--the definition of ``abusive,'' which, again, is very \nvague, added into this.\n  But this agency is an agency I believe is going to be very proactive, \nand I think that is why most people on the other side of the aisle are \nso excited about this. That is why the White House is very excited \nabout this. They know this is another one of those cases--let no crisis \ngo to waste. We have the opportunity now, because of this crisis, to \ncreate this czar, this czar that has no board, and under statutes that \nare already passed, and some that we are going to pass if this bill \npasses. This agency can then make rules.\n  I want to say this one more time. They are going to make rules, and \nthen every AG in the country is going to have the ability, after \ncontracts have been entered into, to say: No, that is abusive, and to \nbasically void those.\n  This is going to create so much uncertainty out there. Again, to have \nan organization like this, unfettered, dealing with these types of \nissues, and then for the first time, for the first time in years, \nallowing those State AGs to take actions against some of these smaller \ninstitutions, I know people in Tennessee--it is not the people on Wall \nStreet. I think we know CitiGroup and Goldman have all come out and \nsaid they support this bill.\n  Why not? The big guys always do better when we create regulations. It \nis the small guys back in my State who have great concerns. I just want \nto say, this is one of the most dangerous and problematic attributes of \nthis bill.\n  So in the name of ensuring that our community banks and credit unions \nand other small institutions across our country are not abused, are not \nabused as it relates to this bill, what I hope will happen is that \npeople will not only support the Carper amendment, which does half the \njob--when you have a bill like this, certainly I support half a loaf of \nimprovement. I hope they will support the Carper amendment, but I hope \nmy friends on the other side of the aisle will join what I believe will \nbe almost everyone on this side of the aisle to ensure that those very \npeople we talk about, talk about back home, do not have advantage taken \nof them by this consumer protection agency that is unfettered, that is \ngoing to write rules, that is going to give the ability to State AGs \naround this country to take actions against State banks, local banks, \nbut also national banks, to take actions against them based on Federal \nrules--not just Federal laws, Federal rules.\n  I will stop. I know my time is about up. This is a very commonsense \namendment. I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle: I have \noffered no messaging amendments, none. I have tried to offer a few \ncommonsense amendments to deal with frailties in this bill that I \nbelieve are real. I know there is a lot of stress on the other side of \nthe aisle with everybody trying to hold together. I know the White \nHouse and Treasury are over here meeting in backrooms trying to keep \npeople from supporting things that make common sense. I hope others \nwill join with me to ensure that we don't allow this unfettered \norganization, this czar over consumer protection, to create rules that \nthen put community banks and others at great risk and have the ability \nto break contracts after the fact based on very vague language that 50 \nAGs may interpret in very different ways on a case-by-case basis, in \nwhatever mood they are in on that day. I think that is problematic.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4071 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  (Purpose: To address the applicability and preservation of certain \n               State authorities, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 4071.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Delaware [Mr. Carper], for himself, Mr. \n     Bayh, Mr. Johnson, and Mr. Warner, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4071 to amendment No. 3739.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to state to the manager of \nthe bill, if I could ask a question of Senator Dodd, one of Senator \nReid's right-hand lieutenants asked me to ask for an additional 5 \nminutes on both the Corker and Carper amendments. I presume that has \nbeen cleared with him.\n  Mr. DODD. I have no objection.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that both on the Corker amendment \nand the amendment I have offered, we have an additional 5 minutes for a \ntotal of 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me start off by thanking Senator \nCorker for all the time and energy he and Courtney and others on his \nstaff have put into this issue, both in committee and as we come to the \nfloor.\n  Last week, Senator Corker and I and about 11 other Republicans and a \nnumber of Democrats joined to offer the amendment he is offering at \nthis time. When it became clear to me that we were not going to be able \nto muster the 60 votes to prevail on what was our amendment, we began \nworking with Senator Dodd and his staff--I hope we kept our colleagues \nin the loop, as we went through the negotiations--to come up with \nlegislation that enables us to get a half a loaf. I think we probably \ngot more than half a loaf. Time will tell. History will judge.\n  I wish to back up a little bit and say what I think the authors of \nthe legislation had in mind in the bill as it came to the floor. The \nidea is to create a new\n\n[[Page S3869]]\n\nunit I call the consumer bureau. Their job is to promulgate the rules \nand regulations with respect to consumer protections, not only for \nnational banks or State-chartered banks, not just for credit unions or \nnonbank banks but for all of the above. That is a big part of the job. \nThe job of the new consumer bureau is to promulgate rules and \nregulations going forward to protect consumers.\n  Does that entity have an enforcement responsibility as well? Yes, \nthey do. Under the bill as it came to the floor, they would have the \nobligation for enforcing, among the largest national banks--roughly \n100--the rules and regulations with respect to consumer protection \nwhich they promulgate.\n  I like to think of about three or four entities. One is nonbank \nbanks, a second is credit unions, third is State chartered banks, and \nthe fourth is the national banks. Of those four, the one for sure the \nconsumer bureau actually enforces the rules that will be promulgated is \nwith national banks and the largest ones there. Most of the banks we \nhave in this country are State chartered. Under current law and under \nthis legislation, not only would their safety and soundness regulator, \nthe FDIC, be the regulator for consumer protections, but under current \nlaw, under the law going forward, State officials can also enter into \nthose frays and again try to undertake actions to protect consumers. \nThat could be done now, and it can be done the way the bill is written.\n  With respect to nonbank banks, under current law, the FTC has the \nresponsibility going into this endeavor of enforcing consumer \nprotections. They would have the responsibility of enforcing the \nprotections of the rules promulgated by the consumer bureau. There is a \ngood chance that going forward the FTC will also have responsibility \nfor enforcing the consumer protections for the nonbank banks. Credit \nunions, correct me if I am wrong, I think the responsibility there lies \nwith the NCUA. They are the safety and soundness regulators for credit \nunions, and they are also the responsible regulator for consumer \nprotection. I am not sure that will change.\n  What will change is they will have some additional rules and \nregulations promulgated by the consumer bureau to enforce at least that \nmuch. This is where we have gotten into a big debate.\n  The question is, How about national banks that operate, in some \ncases, in all 50 States? Who is going to enforce the rules to protect \nconsumers from them?\n  The way it has worked for years, we followed the guidance of two \nSupreme Court decisions in this regard. One of them is called Barnett \nBank. It has been a part of the case law for about 14 years. The other \nis called Cuomo v. Clearinghouse. I am not sure why. That is what it is \ncalled.\n  Essentially, the first case law under Barnett attempts to say: We \nhave these national banks. They are actually supervised by the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency. For the most part, States want to \ncome in and exert their own desire and their own will and they can do \nthat, to some extent, under current law. But when they come in and try \nto exert influence over national banks, if the national banks think the \nState is out of line, they can go to court and say: No, the State can't \ndo this. This is preempted. This is something that is governed by the \nFederal Government, by our regulator, the OCC or by this new regulator. \nIf the national banks think that what a State is trying to do, under \nBarnett Bank, if they think it is out of order, inappropriate, not \npermitted, it is preempted, they can go to their primary regulator, the \nOCC. That is what they can do now. If the bank thinks the States are \nacting in an inappropriate way, inconsistent with the Barnett ruling, \nthe national banks can go to the OCC or they can go into court to have \nit cleared up. That is current law. That is the Barnett Bank ruling in \nits simplest form. What we do in this compromise is to retain that \nlanguage, essentially to retain that language or the spirit therein. \nWhere we make a change with respect to the amendment Senator Corker \noffers today and that he and I and others had offered to introduce last \nweek, we make a change with respect to who else can enforce the rules \nand regulations among national banks that are promulgated by this new \nconsumer bureau.\n  What we have said is, State officials and the AGs can enforce the \nrules and regulations of the consumer bureau. They can do that. Can \nthey conduct class action lawsuits against with respect to the rules \nand regulations? They can't do that. Can they go across State lines? \nCan the attorney general from Alabama go into Florida and try to \nenforce the rules across State lines? The AGs can't do that. But what \nthey can do under our compromise is, the State AGs in all 50 States can \nlook at the rules and regulations promulgated by the consumer bureau \nand enforce those in their own State. For us, that is probably the \nbiggest give with respect to what we introduced last week.\n  This is a confusing issue. It is arcane. I have tried to explain it \nto my colleagues with mixed success. I hope I am doing better today on \nthe floor. It is not an easily understood issue.\n  For me, the question is this: If we are going to have national \nbanks--and we have had them for 150 years--if there are going to be \nnational standards and a tough regulator, let's make sure the consumer \nbureau has the resources and authority it needs to enforce these rules \nfor national banks. When people say: What is the problem with letting \nthe AGs come in, here is the problem. I like to use Washington, DC, as \nan example. I live in Delaware. I go back and forth on the train just \nabout every day. Let's say I lived in Maryland, and let's say I worked \nin Washington, as we do. Let's say my bank is home chartered in \nVirginia. Let's say I travel all over the country, and I use ATM \nmachines in many different States. If you have a situation where the \nStates can impose their own laws or rules or regulations with respect \nto features of banking and checking accounts, with respect to my ATM \ncards and access to ATM machines, the fees I have for my debit cards, \nthat authority sort of thing, how would you apply those rules and \nregulations in this one instance, someone who lives in Maryland, works \nin Washington, their bank is in Virginia, and they access banking \nservices all over the country? That could be confusing, very confusing. \nIt is not only going to be confusing for the banks themselves, as they \ntry to comply with this patchwork quilt of 50 different rules and \nregulations, in addition to the national rules and regulations. It is \ngoing to be confusing for consumers too.\n  This is not something we are doing simply to make the banks happy. \nThey are not doing handstands over the amendment I am offering as a \nside-by-side with the previous Carper-Corker amendment.\n  I am convinced of this: What we are doing is good for consumers, and \nit is fair for the banks.\n  Again, to Senator Dodd and his staff, I thank them for working with \nus. I express my thanks to our Republican colleagues who joined us as \ncosponsors on the amendment last week and those who support us today.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, it is the goal of all of us in this body \nto address the inadequacies in bank regulation that led to the crisis, \nbut also preserve the dual banking system. After many conversations \nwith Senator Dodd and his staff, I believe we have found the right \nbalance to preserve Federal preemption for national banks but also \nallow State AG enforcement of the rules where appropriate. I want to \nthank Senator Dodd for working with us to find common ground.\n  Throughout the committee consideration and the floor process, I have \nworked to ensure that our efforts to build strong uniform standards \nthrough the new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau were not \nundermined by ending up with a patchwork of different laws for banks \nand consumers. As our Nation recovers from the economic crisis, it was \nimportant to avoid making it difficult for businesses to operate across \nState lines, and to prevent consumers already struggling with access to \ncredit from losing access to affordable products and services.\n  I believe the Carper amendment addresses these concerns while also \nensuring the State AGs a role. The Carper amendment provides that \npreemption determinations are made according to a uniform standard, \nproviding certainty to those that offer financial products and those \nwho use the products. It also codifies the Supreme\n\n[[Page S3870]]\n\nCourt's ruling in the Cuomo case by clearly stating the role State AGs \nmay play in enforcing certain laws against national banks. Last, it \nalso preserves a role for State AGs to ensure that consumers are never \nagain put at risk because Federal regulators are asleep at the switch.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Carper-Bayh-Warner-Johnson \namendment. This amendment, and the underlying bill creating a new \nconsumer agency, will set strong national standards for consumers, and \nimprove our abilities to detect problems and vastly improve consumer \nprotection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I will be brief. I commend both the \nSenator from Delaware and the Senator from Tennessee for their hard \nwork in this area. This is very arcane. It is difficult, but it is very \nimportant. I was hoping we could bake a whole loaf of bread, not a \nhalf. One-half is better than nothing--but a whole loaf. What we are \ndoing thus far is Main Street. We are not worried about Wall Street. \nWall Street will take care of themselves, as Senator Corker and others \nhave said on this floor. They always have, always will. But it is Main \nStreet, the smaller banks in our communities, in our towns all across \nthe country. If we could, in the wisdom of the chairman of the \ncommittee, if we could move to a whole loaf of bread, that would be \ncommendable. I feel like we are not going to do a whole loaf here today \nbecause we don't have the votes. But gosh, a whole loaf is always \nbetter than half.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut has 9 minutes 50 \nseconds.\n  Mr. DODD. I will take 5 minutes, if the Chair will advise me.\n  Mr. President, this is striking a balance. If I were king for a day, \nI might write a different approach than either the Corker or the Carper \namendments. But I am 1 of 100 people in this Chamber. Our goal is to \ntry to find common ground on a very difficult issue. This is a \ncomplicated question. It isn't just about Main Street and Wall Street; \nit is about how we enforce laws, how to make sure we don't overreach \nand create unnecessary duplication and raise costs. We are trying to \nbalance what should not be necessarily competing goals. One is to have \nstronger consumer protections. I hope I don't have to make that case \nagain. What got us into this mess to begin with was the lack of \nconsumer protection. It was bad mortgages, no documentation, luring \npeople into deals they could never afford, people making decisions to \njump into deals they couldn't handle.\n  For all those reasons, this problem mushroomed out of a mortgage \nproblem into a large, now almost global, problem we are \nconfronting. So, clearly, as to consumer protection, we are doing that \nin this bill. For the first time in the history of our country, we will \nnow have an agency exclusively dedicated to protecting the average \nconsumer in this country when it comes to financial services. We have \nit for products you buy. We have it for the food you eat. But Lord \nforbid you end up in potential ruin because of a financial product. \nWhere do you go? There is no recall. There is no place to get that \nfinancial product recalled if you are running into problems. So we do \nthat in this bill.\n\n  Let me be the first to admit there are people who are vehemently \nopposed to have anything like a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \nanywhere in our government at all, and I know that. My colleagues know \nthat. I understand, from time to time, attempts to try and undermine \nthis in whatever way you can has been a part of this.\n  The second goal is the one my colleague from Delaware has mentioned: \npreserving our national banking system, which has been around for 150 \nyears. It is clearly in our interest to do that. So how do we strike \nthis in a way that strikes that balance?\n  The Carper amendment preserves the States' attorneys general role in \nprotecting their citizens from abusive practices. That is about as Main \nStreet as you can get. As I said, the alternative is to have someone \nfrom Washington, I suppose, being able to show up to protect those \ninterests. Why not preserve the right of an attorney general at the \nState level to protect those interests?\n  But it also makes clear--the Carper amendment does--that the Office \nof the Comptroller of the Currency can preempt a State consumer law, \nwhile preseving our national banking system. So it strikes that \nbalance, which is so critical.\n  The Carper amendment does three things: It preserves the State's role \nin enforcing the Federal consumer financial laws. That is No. 1. \nSecondly, it returns to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency \nthe preemption of State consumer financial laws to the 1996 Barnett \nstandard, which is the Supreme Court case, and provides for transparent \ndetermination procedures for preemption decisions. Thirdly, the Carper \namendment makes clear that the States' attorneys general have the \nauthority to enforce certain laws against national banks in their home \nStates.\n  That is the balance the Carper amendment provides.\n  The Corker amendment--if we adopted just the Corker amendment--does \ntwo things. One, it completely eliminates the State attorney general \nfrom enforcement of the Consumer Financial Protection Act. It \neliminates it altogether. I do not think you want that. That does not \nmake sense to me. That is where you get confusion. Secondly, it would \nconfuse the Federal preemption standard under the Barnett case that the \nOCC should apply when preempting State consumer laws.\n  We are trying to get clarity, and we get clarity with the Carper \namendment. That is what we are looking for: National banking gets \npreserved. Yet the attorneys general can enforce the laws rather than \nrelying on something at the national level to do the job.\n  So I urge my colleagues--and I say this respectfully because Bob \nCorker and I have worked together on a lot of issues over the last \nnumber of months--on this one, I respectfully suggest it goes too far. \nThat is why I urge Senator Carper, who has a strong interest in this \nsubject matter, to sit down and see if we could fashion a compromise \nthat would maintain the balance of allowing State AGs to do their jobs \nwhen it comes to enforcing the rules under our Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, while preserving the national banking system, where \nthe OCC has the right to preempt. That is what we have done with the \nCarper amendment. That is the balance that gets struck here. I say \nrespectfully, the adoption of the Corker amendment throws that balance \noff whack, and that is what I think would be a step backward when it \ncomes to this provision.\n  So for those reasons, I would urge a ``no'' vote on the Corker \namendment and a ``yes'' vote on the Carper amendment, which I think \nstrengthens this bill overall.\n  With that, I see my colleague from Virginia, who may want to be heard \non this amendment as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I just wish to briefly add to the \ndiscussion and thank both the chairman and Senator Carper and my good \nfriend Senator Corker as well. We are breaking new ground. We are \ncreating a new national Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  I share, I think, actually the goals of both Senator Corker and \nSenator Carper that the bureau ought to have a chance to enforce its \nrules on an orderly national basis. I know my good friend, Senator \nCorker, has a slightly different variation, but I think Senator \nCarper's amendment has struck that right balance: ensuring there are \nopportunities for Federal preemption but, at the same time, recognizing \nthat the balance of the attorneys general role ought to be to focus on \nthe regulations--regulations that it will have had an appropriate \nperiod to have been commented on by industry, to have gone through an \norderly process, rather than simply what the initial draft would have \nhad, which would have allowed the attorneys general to actually focus \non the statute itself, that might have allowed them to run a little \nmore without as many restraints.\n  So I realize this is a new area. We are trying to strike a balance. I \nagree with\n\n[[Page S3871]]\n\nthe chairman that the Carper amendment strikes that right balance, and \nI look forward to supporting his amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I do hope the Senator from Virginia and \nthe Senator from Delaware will support my amendment, since they both \ncosponsored it originally. I know Treasury has been over and has had a \ntalk with people back in these backrooms. I realize the White House has \ndone that. While there may be discussions about ``striking the \nappropriate balance,'' the fact is, this was an amendment that had \nbipartisan support until that occurred.\n  Let me just say----\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield on that point he made?\n  Mr. CORKER. OK.\n  Mr. DODD. There is nothing ``in the backroom'' about this. This is an \nhonest, open discussion about how to deal with preemption. The \nsuggestion my colleague makes about a backroom arrangement is not the \ncase.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Well, it was these rooms back here.\n  Mr. DODD. No, it is not a backroom.\n  Mr. CORKER. OK. Well, these front rooms back here.\n  Let me just say, if I could: Look, the fact is, we had a bipartisan \nagreement that has been throttled back. There is a chance--I \nunderstand. That is what I am saying. I hope the cosponsors of this \namendment will at least support it on the floor. I do not think there \nhas been anything enlightening that has occurred--just the fact that, \nlook, the White House has expressed opposition to this. I understand \nthat, and that is the way things are when the White House is the White \nHouse.\n  But what I would say is, the Senator from Connecticut specifically \ntried to get support for this consumer protection agency by saying that \ninstitutions under $10 billion in assets would not be enforced upon \ndirectly by this consumer protection agency. But what has happened as a \nresult of the bill is the fact that now, instead of that, we now have \nState AGs--they are going to enforce against these very institutions on \nrules that emanate from these Federal statutes.\n\n  So I would say that is a far worse situation for these community \nbanks and credit unions. I know they view that as far worse from that \nstandpoint. Then, on top of that, we have added language that is vague, \nlanguage such as ``abusive'', where the AG has the ability to come in \nafter the fact and basically break contracts if, in their view, they \ndecide that something may have been abusive. Again, that is a very \nvague term.\n  So what I would say to you is that, yes, you are embarking on new \nterritory. You, in essence, are creating a consumer protection agency \nthat has no board. It reports to one person, the President. It has a 5-\nyear term. There is no veto--no veto--authority by the prudential \nregulators as it relates to the rules. Now you have State AGs all \nacross the country who have the ability to enforce. I think that is a \nhuge step in the wrong direction.\n  I had hoped earlier--a couple months ago it seemed like we had a \nplace that was far more middle of the road than this, that kept the \nState AGs in place, that allowed them to do the things with State laws \nthey already have the power to do. But I think this is vastly \nexpansive.\n  I realize that with the people talking against my amendment who \nactually supported my amendment in the past, it is very unlikely my \namendment is going to pass. I have heard people on my side of the aisle \nsaying: Look, should we support Carper or not? It is just really not \nwhat ought to happen.\n  I would say to my friends on this side: Yes, support the Senator's \nefforts. It is better than what exists.\n  But there is no question in my mind--and let's face it, the issue \nthat has divided this floor more than anything else is the fact that \nthis consumer protection agency has been created the way it has been \ncreated. I think this rulemaking authority it has is the issue that has \ndivided most of us. Now, without my amendment passing, again, what \nhappens is, State AGs, interpreting these in different ways all across \nthe country, will now be taking actions against these institutions on \nvague language such as ``abusive.'' I think that is inappropriate. I \nguess I have trouble understanding what that has to do with what we \nhave just gone through.\n  If underwriting is a problem, let's deal with underwriting. We tried \nto offer language that dealt with loans. That is the core of this \ncrisis. But, no, we do not want to deal with that. We do not want any \ncrisis to go to waste. We want to create another unfettered \norganization to get into the lives of Americans, to sort of take over, \ntake over and deal with these kinds of things because we do not want \nany crisis to go to waste.\n  So maybe the Senator from Connecticut was a little arisen a minute \nago by me saying what I am saying. Look, the fact is, the White House \nis, I see, going to have its way probably. I still hope as many people \nas possible will vote for the Corker amendment. I certainly support the \nCarper amendment. I wish we had done a more balanced job on this issue. \nI think we would have far more bipartisan support.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. I wish to withhold the \nremainder of my time in case there are other comments that are made. \nBut I do hope the people who originally cosponsored my amendment would \nat least support it on the floor today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes 27 seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, let me try to be clear on one point, as we \ncome to the close of this discussion.\n  For States or their national banks, under what is proposed and what \nwould occur under our amendment, if a State AG wants to try to enforce \na State law on a national bank, the bank can go in and say to the \ncourts, they can go in and say to the regulator, the Office of the \nComptroller of the Currency, that State law is preempted. That cannot \nbe enforced against a national bank.\n  The question here--and this is a point where I gave on and our side \ngave on in negotiations--how about if the State AG or State officials \nwant to come in and enforce the rules that have been developed by the \nnew consumer bureau? Under the compromise we have reached, while they \ncannot come in and enforce their own State laws, or, really, come in \nand enforce the Federal law we are debating today, the State AG can \ncome in and enforce the rules, which have been worked out over a period \nof months--draft regulations, proposed regulations, common periods, \nrevised regulations with guidance, and finally adopted regulations with \nguidance.\n  In those instances, when the regulations are adopted in their final \nform--gone through that whole process--then the AGs can come in and not \nselectively enforce them, but they have the right to enforce those, \nalong with--for big banks, big national banks--the bureau, and if they \nare not so big national banks, the Office of the Comptroller of the \nCurrency.\n  That is where I think we have ended up here. I do not think it is a \nbad compromise. As our colleague from Tennessee and certainly the \nPresiding Officer and our two floor managers, Senator Dodd and Senator \nShelby, know, we have been sent to govern, and sometimes I cannot get \nwhat I want. But what we try to do is to be willing to give, and in an \norderly fashion we have a final compromise that I think meets muster.\n  Let me say, as a former Governor--I think there are five former \nGovernors on our original amendment--I do not think anyone can accuse \nme or any of the other former Governors of not being for States rights. \nBut sometimes we need a strong Federal regulator with strong \nenforcement authority, particularly when we are dealing with issues of \ninterstate commerce and our national banking system, which we seek to \npreserve.\n  In closing, I wish to assure my colleagues that I believe the \namendment I offer with a number of my colleagues preserves the ability \nof States' attorneys general to provide a backstop to the new Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau. While the new bureau will be the main \nenforcer of its new rules, we have preserved the role for the\n\n[[Page S3872]]\n\nState AGs to ensure that the consumers are not put at risk because \nFederal regulators are asleep at the switch.\n  Again, I wish to thank Senator Corker for all his work on not just \nthis issue but on others to try to get us to a better place.\n  With that, I believe our time is just about expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4 minutes 10 seconds.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank the Senator from \nDelaware, who is one of those Senators whom I truly enjoy working with. \nHe truly does try to do responsible things in this body. I thank him \nfor that. I enjoy working with him. I do think the Senator is trying to \nput an amendment in place that will pass, and I thank him for that.\n  Again, I think a half a loaf is a half a loaf; it is not a whole \nloaf. But I hope everybody on my side of the aisle will support the \nCarper amendment. I hope everybody on this side of the aisle, \nobviously, will support the Corker amendment.\n  I do wish to say that the Chamber of Commerce has just sent out a \nletter. I thought I would make everybody aware they are urging people \nto vote for both amendments also. As a matter of fact, they are key \nvoting this. This is one of those issues they think is very important. \nThe Chamber of Commerce, as you know, represents all kinds of small \nbusinesses across this country that are very concerned about this \nexpansive bill, especially as it relates to consumer protection.\n  Again, I wish to say one more time, an activist, if it turned out to \nbe--my guess is, it will be; everything else in this administration \nleads me to believe this is going to be a fairly activist organization, \nOK--can write rules after the fact--after the fact--declaring a \npractice abusive.\n\n  I don't know how many people think that is good practice, to write a \nrule after the fact determining that it is abusive--again, a very vague \nbenchmark.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for the time. I thank the Senator from \nConnecticut for the way he has conducted business here on the floor. I \ncertainly wish this was a 50-vote threshold instead of 60, but I \nrealize those things have to take place. I thank him for the way he has \nconducted himself on the floor. I look forward to both of these \namendments being voted on. I urge people on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport both amendments, as the Chamber of Commerce has said it does.\n  Thank you very much. I yield my time.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me just clarify. No. 1, there is no 60-vote \nrequirement.\n  Mr. CORKER. Very good. Thank you.\n  Mr. DODD. No. 2, I know people want to vote for everything around \nhere, but occasionally we run into conflicts, and there is a conflict \nbetween the Corker amendment and Carper amendment, and that is the role \nof the attorneys general. The Corker amendment excludes the attorneys \ngeneral from enforcing the regulations of the consumer protection \nagency. The Carper amendment includes it. With all due respect, I know \nwe would like to vote for all amendments, but somehow we do end up with \na conflict. It is a legitimate point. I am not suggesting that my \nfriend from Tennessee doesn't have an argument, but I just think the \nCarper amendment makes more sense.\n  So I urge my colleagues, out of respect for each other--I know we \nlike to please each other, but the fact is, we end up with a \ncontradictory conclusion when we are trying to come to some clarity. \nThat is the only point I wish to make.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. If I could, I haven't really noticed that much desire to \nplease each other around here, but I do thank you for the fact that it \nis a 50-vote threshold. I had been told prior to coming down that it \nwas 60, so thank you for that. But I do hope people will try to please \nboth sides of the aisle by voting for both amendments. Thank you very \nmuch.\n  Mr. DODD. Have the yeas and nays been ordered, Mr. President?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. They have not.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak on amendment No. 3744.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, payday lending institutions prey on people \nwho find themselves in need of quick cash often for things like a \nnecessary car repair or a medical problem. The lenders charge \nastronomical interest rates and expect immediate repayment.\n  By marketing payday loans as short-term advances, predatory lenders \ngouge borrowers into a cycle of debt. With repayment due in just days, \ninterest rates that reach 400 percent, and because repayments are due \nin full, borrowers are often forced to take out new loans to repay the \nold loan.\n  The lenders themselves recognize that the loans are not for borrowers \nwho intend to use them repeatedly. For example, one lender notes on its \nwebsite that, ``Since a payday advance is a short-term solution to an \nimmediate need, it is not intended for repeated use in carrying an \nindividual from payday to payday. When an immediate need arises, we're \nhere to help. But a payday advance is not a long-term solution for \nongoing budget management. Repeated or frequent use can create serious \nfinancial hardship.''\n  But the statistics do not add up. Over 60 percent of payday loans go \nto borrowers with 12 or more transactions per year and 24 percent of \npayday loans go to borrowers with 21 or more transactions per year.\n  This startling statistic illustrates just how devastating this \nproblem can be for families.\n  Take the story of Sandra Harris from Wilmington, NC. She had a job at \nHead Start and always paid her bills on time. When her husband lost his \njob, Sandra got a $200 payday loan to pay the couple's car insurance. \nWhen she went to repay the loan, she was told she could renew. Sandra \nultimately found herself indebted to six different payday lenders, paid \nsome $8,000 in fees.\n  Now, the payday lending industry will argue that they provide a \nvaluable service. I would simply point out that, whether or not you \nbelieve that to be true, my amendment does not prohibit payday loans.\n\n  In fact, it allows up to six payday loans to the same borrower. If \nyour business model relies on your ability to rope borrowers into \nrolling these loans over again and again, even though you are charging \n400 percent per loan, I would have some serious questions about your \nbusiness model.\n  By reining in payday lenders, we will protect consumers from racking \nup endless, long-term debt that can ultimately cause a family to \ndeclare bankruptcy.\n  This amendment protects consumers by ensuring that short-term cash \nadvances remain short-term.\n  It has three parts to accomplish this goal:\n  First, it limits rollovers by prohibiting creditors from issuing new \npayday loans to borrowers with six loans in the previous 12 months or \n90 days aggregate indebtedness.\n  Second, it would require lenders to give borrowers the option to \nrepay their loan over a longer time period. Creditors would need to \noffer an extended repayment plan for borrowers who are unable to meet \nrepayment obligations.\n  Finally, the bill gives the Federal Reserve Board the authority to \nrequire licensing and bonding of payday lenders.\n  Leading consumer advocates such as the Center for Responsible Lending \nstrongly support this legislation.\n  This is a commonsense amendment, it will help protect Main Street \nborrowers from predatory lenders, and I would urge all of my colleagues \nto join me in supporting it.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \nletter of support from Michael Calhoun, the president of the Center for \nResponsible Lending.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Center for Responsible Lending,\n\n                                                      May 4, 2010.\n     Hon. Kay Hagan,\n     United States Senator, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hagan: We are writing to express our support \n     for your bill, the ``Payday Limitation Act of 2010,'' which \n     would help end the cycle of long-term borrowing that traps so \n     many payday borrowers in high-cost debt.\n       The payday lending debt trap causes families financial \n     harm, with borrowers more likely to become delinquent on \n     their credit cards, face difficulty in paying other bills, \n     delay medical care, and, ultimately, file for bankruptcy. The \n     average borrower has 9 payday loan transactions each year, \n     typically on a back-to-back basis. This results in borrowers \n     paying more in fees than they are extended in credit.\n       Your bill would codify the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation's standard, which prohibits new loans to \n     borrowers who have already been indebted 90 days in a given \n     year, the equivalent of six two-week payday loans. This would \n     ensure that these short-term small loans are used as \n     intended, rather than becoming a long-term financial burden \n     for families already living paycheck-to-paycheck.\n       If enacted, this legislation would represent a key step \n     forward toward our long-term goal of protecting consumers \n     through a 36 percent annual percentage rate cap on small \n     loans. We commend you on your efforts to reduce the \n     incredible damage caused by this industry to low- and \n     moderate-income families and look forward to working with you \n     to pass this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Michael P. Calhoun,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I wish to thank the Senator from North Carolina for her \nleadership on this issue involving title loans and payday loans. I know \nshe led the fight in her home State of North Carolina before she came \nhere to the Senate.\n  I wish to ask the Senator from North Carolina, is it not true we \npassed a law a few years ago to protect military families from being \nexploited by these same lenders, arguing that, here we are, investing \nall this money in training and preparing men and women to serve in our \nmilitary, and then they are ensnared by these payday loan operations, \nthey find themselves at their wit's end, they cannot make their \npayments, they are facing bankruptcy, and many of them had to take \nleave or be discharged from the military because of these miserable \npayday loan operations? Is it not true we passed a law protecting \nmilitary families from this kind of predatory lending a few years ago?\n  Mrs. HAGAN. The Senator from Illinois is certainly correct. I \nbelieve, instead of anywhere near a 400-percent rate, there are \nlimitations of 36 percent. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So I further ask, through the Chair, the Senator from \nNorth Carolina is saying, if we want to protect military families from \nthis outrageous conduct by these lenders, then should not we protect \nall American families who might be in similar circumstances, ensnared \nby these people who will continue to roll these loans over and over to \nthe point where a person cannot possibly pay it off?\n  Does not the Senator's amendment say there has to be a limit to the \nnumber of rollovers on the loans, and is not the limit somewhere in the \nrange of six rollovers, six times rolled over as a maximum?\n  Mrs. HAGAN. The Senator is exactly right. This amendment allows, if a \nfamily does need to have a short-term advance, for a short-term \nadvance, renewable six times. They can have six of them within a 1-year \nperiod of time. If at that point they cannot repay it, the institution \nhas to give them a longer repayment schedule.\n  We are not saying these loans cannot be given. But that recurring \ndebt over and over and over again is what should be stopped by limiting \nit to six a year.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from North Carolina for her \nleadership. These are truly the bottom feeders of the credit industry \nin America.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending\n\n[[Page S3874]]\n\namendment be laid aside, and that I be allowed to call up amendment No. \n3744.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and on behalf \nof--would the Chair please restate the request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich.) The Senator seeks permission to \ncall up amendment No. 3744.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am about to make a unanimous consent \nrequest, and I will describe what I am going to request first so \nMembers are aware of this.\n  Senators Merkley and Levin, along with many others, over the past \nnumber of weeks have worked very hard to develop an amendment dealing \nwith proprietary trading; that is, to ban the use of depositors' monies \nfor excessive risk taking on the part of financial institutions.\n  This is a complicated area, we all admit and acknowledge. It takes a \nlot of work. The Treasury Department has been involved, and many others \nin this Chamber, who have had a strong interest in supporting the \nefforts of Senator Merkley and Senator Levin, have crafted and worked \non this.\n  We wish to have a vote on that amendment, even, in fact, just a 50 \nvote, up and down. Over the last 3 or 4 weeks, I have been happy to \nhave more amendments. I think some 40 or 45 amendments have been \nconsidered in this Chamber, the overwhelming majority on a simple 50-\nvote margin. Some have required 60 votes, I acknowledge that. But I am \nbeing told that even a 60-vote requirement on this amendment would be \nobjected to. I think that is terribly unfortunate. This is a critical \npiece of financial reform. To exclude it, or even the ability to vote \non it, I think would be wrong.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be laid aside and \nthat amendment No. 4101 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, although I don't necessarily believe I \nwill vote against the Levin-Merkley amendment, if it is brought up and \ndebated, a number of my colleagues are not here on the floor and have \nasked me to lodge an objection. So on their behalf, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next \namendments in order be the following: Grassley-McCaskill amendment No. \n4072 and Bingaman amendment No. 3892; that the Bingaman amendment be \nmodified with the changes at the desk; that a Lincoln amendment as a \nside-by-side to the Bingaman amendment also be in order; and that \nSenators Grassley and McCaskill each be recognized for a period of 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object--and I will \nnot object--I want to ask the Senator from Connecticut if he might add \nto that unanimous-consent request that following that, amendment No. \n4109, which I have filed, be considered at that point.\n  Let me explain. I had filed an amendment. We have modified it. The \namendment, properly filed, as I had modified it, is amendment No. 4109. \nIt is the amendment that deals with the issue of naked credit default \nswaps. As my colleague knows, I have been here for 2 weeks attempting \nto get it pending.\n  I ask that the unanimous consent request be modified to include \nmaking amendment 4109 pending following the disposition of the other \ntwo amendments.\n  Mr. DODD. I have no objection to that.\n  First of all, can we get the first unanimous consent agreed to, to \ndeal with those two amendments; that is, Grassley and Bingaman?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I am OK on the first one.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no objection to the first part, it \nis so ordered. There is no objection on the first part.\n  Is there objection to the request of the Senator from North Dakota?\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is that there is a \nquestion now about how to proceed with respect to which amendments \nmight be allowed to be offered by the two sides. It appears to me, at \nleast from my perspective, that some have decided we will only allow \namendments we prefer to be allowed and others who have amendments will \nnot be allowed to offer amendments from this point on.\n  My colleagues know I have been here I guess a couple of weeks with an \namendment. It is filed, No. 4109. It deals with trillions and trillions \nof dollars of what are called naked credit default swaps--one of the \nsignificant problems that caused part of the near collapse of our \neconomy. I have been here now attempting to get this amendment pending \nbecause if there is a cloture vote tomorrow, those amendments that are \nnot pending will not be allowed to be offered and voted upon. I am \nattempting to get this pending.\n  What we have appears to me to be gatekeepers who decide we will only \nallow these amendments through the gate, and someone else, unnamed, \nunknown, will decide that we have to have somebody else object for \nthem. So the result is that an amendment such as this--and I assume \nthere are others as well--would not be able to be considered. To have \nthe negotiations between the manager and the ranking member now come \ntogether and decide, well, only amendments they will allow us to offer \nwill be offered--if that were the standard, maybe we could go back and \nI could think of half a dozen or a dozen amendments that we already had \noffered and had to vote on that probably we should have said: Let's not \noffer those. Those are inconvenient, uncomfortable. I don't want to \nvote on that. But we have not done that. None of us have done that.\n  Now, all of a sudden, we have been told: Someone else wants us to \nobject, so therefore you can't offer your amendment. That is just, in \nmy judgment, not an acceptable way to proceed.\n  While I guess we are waiting, I encourage somebody, if they wonder \nwhether the amendment I have filed, No. 4109, dealing with naked credit \ndefault swaps--if they are wondering whether there is an urgency to \nthis issue, read the book ``The Big Short'' by Michael Lewis. When you \nare finished, come back to the floor and ask if you can support this \namendment or how quickly you can support this amendment. It is \nunbelievably necessary to do if, in fact, we are going to finish \nfinancial reform and claim we have reformed the financial system.\n  It is pretty hard for me to understand how we proceed if the point is \nthat someone else has decided exactly which amendments will be \ntolerable to be considered and those of us who have amendments that are \na little more difficult, perhaps a little more aggressive in trying to \nfix those things, shut the door on the kinds of practices that\n\n[[Page S3875]]\n\ncaused the near collapse of the American economy, if our amendments are \ninconvenient to someone, we are told: You will not have an opportunity \nto do this. We will just pick other amendments that we think are fine, \namendments that don't have quite as much bark or bite to them. We will \nconsider those amendments along the way, and when we get to the end, if \nyour amendment is not considered, that is just tough luck.\n  It is much more than tough luck, it seems to me, for the American \npeople.\n  I have a series of charts. I would like to offer the amendment and \nhave it pending. I have previously been here asking unanimous consent. \nIt was objected to. I have spoken earlier on the floor and was told it \nwould be considered.\n  If I may have the attention of my colleague from Connecticut, we \ndidn't get to that second portion of the previous UC. Let me ask \nunanimous consent that following whatever other business has previously \nbeen agreed to, amendment No. 4109, which I have properly filed, be \nconsidered pending and that we would be able to consider amendment No. \n4109.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me say to my colleague, we have been on this bill now \nfor 3 or 4 weeks. We have considered almost 50 amendments. I have a \nlist of about 49 amendments I sent to the minority several days ago, \nincluding amendments offered by Democrats, Republicans, some of them \nbipartisan amendments, that I would be more than willing to accept. I \nknow the minority is looking at them, and they may accept some and \nreject others. There is that group of amendments. We have a list of \nabout 20 different amendments here, some of which are, like my friend's \nfrom North Dakota, controversial amendments that I would like the \nopportunity to debate and bring up.\n  The difficulty of managing from this seat is that, obviously, once \nconsent is given for an amendment to be pending, it takes consent then \nto lay it aside and move forward. Then we turn over to any one Member \nof this Chamber the ability to veto virtually all other amendments \nbecause it takes unanimous consent by this Chamber to agree to proceed \nto something else. So what it does is allow one Senator to tie up----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Has that happened at this point? I don't know of a \ncircumstance where someone, during debate on this bill, has objected to \nsetting the pending amendment aside. I have seen it happen, but that is \nnot what has happened on this bill.\n  Mr. DODD. As my colleague knows, I happen to be supportive of trying \nto get to his amendment, trying to negotiate so we can get his \namendment up at this point. There are also other amendments we might be \nable to clear out of the way before we do that. If we stop everything \nfrom moving before we get this matter resolved, of course, it deprives \nothers of having a chance to have an amendment considered. That is the \neffect of it.\n  Again, the Senator has the right to do it, obviously, objecting to \nanything going forward. Any one Senator can do that. My colleague has \nas much right as anyone else to do it, but there is an effect on a lot \nof other amendments to that. I certainly would not argue about the \nSenator's right to do it, but the consequence of it is such that other \namendments then do not go forward.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a further \nquestion?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota has the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It is not just me. It is my understanding that the Levin-\nMerkley amendment is in the same position. So it is a circumstance, it \nappears to me, where someone said: Well, now, it is inconvenient for us \nto vote on things that are a little bit controversial or have a little \nmore bite to address these issues. Because it is inconvenient, we are \ngoing to object, so you are not going to be able to offer those \namendments. I do not know how we got to this cliff, but falling off \nthat cliff is not acceptable to me. We have been voting for 2 weeks and \npeople have been able to offer amendments. I voted on amendments I did \nnot want to vote on from the other side. They had a right to offer \nthem, and I voted on them. That is fine.\n  Was there a moment when we decided, all of a sudden, that the other \nside will have a veto authority over our ability to offer amendments of \nany consequence? I do not know when that happened, but that is totally \ninappropriate, given the couple weeks we have been through here.\n  Mr. DODD. Again, my colleague has a right to object if he decides to \ndo so. I just explained what the consequences are of that decision. \nThat is all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota still has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Mr. President, listen, my objective is not to \nobstruct or to try to slow anything down. My objective is to allow \npeople to offer amendments, especially those who have been here for \nsome long while, to offer amendments that are consequential relative to \nthe issue of financial reform.\n  If from this day forward, we have decided--or from today forward we \nhave decided that if someone on the other side--who is at this point \nunknown--is going to object to amendments that are uncomfortable, \namendments that I think will strengthen the bill, this is not much of a \nprocess anymore. We will, I guess, pick out the amendments that deal \nwith tourism or babies or whatever it is that is uncontroversial to \neverybody and pass those and then go on to final passage. Those who had \nother amendments of consequence are told: Someone objected. We are not \nquite sure who.\n  So I guess what I can do is say that I will object to having people \ndecide we will only deal with noncontroversial amendments and that \nthose amendments of substantial consequence to this bill are not \nrelevant enough to be considered.\n  So I wish that were not the case. But I am not going to sit here and \nsay: Yes, go ahead and just pass over these amendments and pick out \nsome amendments you like. If everybody can agree on amendments we like, \nyou can offer them and we will have votes and no one will have concern \nover it. But if there are amendments that somebody does not like, you \nare not going to be able to offer them because someone is going to \nobject.\n  It does not make much sense to me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, is there still a unanimous-consent \nrequest pending that the Senator from Connecticut made some while back \nthat there was never an objection heard on?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That consent request was granted.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. OK. So based on that consent request, I would like to \ntalk about amendment No. 4072, the Grassley-McCaskill IG amendment. \nThis amendment is about having a cop on the beat. We have talked a lot \nabout a cop on the beat as it relates to a consumer agency. But in \ninternal workings of these agencies, there are people who are very \nspecial in our government who have eyes and ears inside agencies who \ncan find problems, who in fact are our inspectors general.\n  This amendment will strengthen the independence and the working role \nof the inspectors general in these agencies that have such an important \npower over our financial sector. In fact, it was the failure, in some \nways, of appropriate oversight that got us into this mess in the first \nplace.\n  Senator Grassley has been a champion of inspectors general for many \nyears, and since I came to the Senate, I have tried to focus on this \nbecause I came here from being a government auditor. For 8 years, I did \nnothing but government auditing, and I have deep and abiding respect \nfor the professional auditors in our Federal Government who are the \nwatchdogs for taxpayers inside the halls of our government.\n  This amendment will do a couple of important things.\n  One, it is going to create a council of inspectors general in the \nfinancial sector, the SEC and the CFTC and the FDIC, and they will have \nto meet four times a year. At that meeting, they are going to have a \nforced opportunity to compare notes, to talk about the investigations \nthey are doing, to make sure\n\n[[Page S3876]]\n\nthey are not duplicating each other's work, and, most importantly, to \ntalk about systemic risk and are they getting at it in a collective \nway. It does not cost anything. It is just smart. That is one part of \nthis amendment.\n  The other part of the amendment has to do with how these inspectors \ngeneral are selected. There are different kinds of inspectors general \nin our government. Some are appointed by the President. Some are \nappointed by the agencies. I will say that anybody who thinks those \nappointed by the President are the most independent is wrong. Anybody \nwho thinks those appointed by the agencies is the most independent is \nwrong.\n  I believe the independence of inspectors general has everything to do \nwith whether someone is selected who is professional and who is going \nto be independent of any influence.\n  Here is my reason for supporting this amendment so fully. It is a bad \nidea to change right now how these inspectors general are selected. We \nneed continuity right now. We need consistency. What we have done in \nthis amendment is change it so these inspectors general will now report \nto the entire boards they serve and not to just the head of the agency. \nThat is where you can get the cozy relationship and get into trouble. \nThat is why, in fact, this amendment is needed.\n  It also requires that two-thirds of these boards will be required to \nfire an inspector general. So this amendment will, in fact, make sure \nwe have continuity, we have a cop on the beat in terms of these \ninspectors general right now and going forward, and it strengthens \ntheir independence and their ability to work with each other.\n  I will say we have lots of nominations pending, and the notion that \nwe would decide we need five more nominations pending with, I am \nafraid, secret holds that might come about--we have one inspector \ngeneral who has a secret hold now--I certainly do not want the \ninspectors general for these agencies to be held up with secret holds \nover the next couple years and us have a lack of continuity and \ncertainty in terms of leadership at these important organizations as we \nmove forward to clean up this mess that has occurred in our financial \nsector.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support the Grassley-McCaskill amendment, \namendment No. 4072.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri, my friend, \nhas given a very good explanation of this bill. Before I give my \nversion of it, which will be similar to hers, I wish to compliment her \nbecause she is in a position of jurisdiction over IGs. She has done a \nvery good job of strengthening these positions in other legislation she \nhas sponsored. So I feel very good to be in the company of the Senator \nfrom Missouri on this amendment.\n  Our amendment would correct serious problems in section 989B of the \nDodd-Lincoln substitute. This section of the bill would change the way \nthat five inspectors general are hired and fired.\n  Currently, these five inspectors general are hired and fired by the \nagency that they oversee, but section 989B would put the President in \ncharge of hiring and firing them. This provision was included because \nthe sponsors of the legislation believe that making inspectors general \nPresidentially appointed will make them more independent.\n  However, rather than strengthening oversight over our financial \ninstitutions with more independent watchdogs, section 989B could \nintroduce politics into what have traditionally been career, \nnonpolitical positions.\n  Under the Inspector General Act of 1978, there are two types of \ninspectors general, presidentially appointed IGs and designated Federal \nentity IGs, DFE IGs. Both types of inspectors general are tasked with \nhunting down waste, fraud, and abuse at Federal agencies. However, \nthere are some major differences in how they are appointed and removed \nfrom office and how they operate.\n  DFE IGs are appointed by the agency rather than the President. The \nInspector General Act created 30 of them, not just the 5 addressed in \nthis bill. The agency-appointed IGs typically run smaller offices than \nPresidential appointees, often with just a handful of employees. Almost \nall of them oversee agencies that are headed by a bipartisan board or \ncommission.\n  By contrast, Presidentially appointed IG's generally run much larger \noffices and employ dozens or hundreds of employees to oversee \nDepartments such as the Department of Defense, the Department of \nJustice, Health and Human Services, and so on. They are nominated by \nthe President and confirmed by the Senate. They are subject to removal \nat any time by the President. However, the President must provide \nCongress 30 days notice and a written list of reasons for dismissing \nthe inspector general.\n  Agency-appointed IGs have a similar protection requiring that the \nagency notify Congress in advance of the reasons for any removal.\n  The sponsors of section 989B argue that because agency-appointed IGs \nare hired and fired by the agency they oversee, they might be tempted \nto pull their punches more than someone who could only be fired by the \nPresident. I actually agree that this is a potential problem. However, \nthe solution in this bill misses the mark.\n  Unfortunately, section 989B only attempts to address this \nindependence issue at five of the 30 agency-appointed IGs. In my view, \nthis fix is too narrow. In addition, it attempts to ensure independence \nby replacing these five IGs with Presidential appointees.\n  There is no evidence that Presidential appointees will be more \nindependent than their predecessors. There have been problems in the \npast with Presidential appointees being too cozy with the agency they \nare supposed to oversee or pulling punches for political reasons.\n  There is strong evidence that agency-appointed IGs can be fiercely \nindependent despite the possibility of being removed by the agency \nhead. It all depends on the quality of the appointment.\n  For example, David Kotz, the Securities Exchange Commission inspector \ngeneral has exposed the SEC's failures in the Madoff and Stanford \ncases, and is currently looking into the timing of the government suit \nagainst Goldman Sachs. Similarly, the Pension Benefit Guarantee \nCorporation's, PBGC, inspector general aggressively investigated the \nformer head of the agency, Charles Millard, and has challenged the \nacting director about providing inaccurate information to Congress. \nDespite the potential risks of being replaced, these IGs have not been \ntimid about challenging their agencies to improve.\n  Because of the way section 989B is currently drafted, these IGs could \nbe summarily dismissed soon after the bill is signed into law. Under \nthis provision, each IG could continue to serve but only until the \nPresident nominates a replacement. Once the President makes a \nnomination, the IGs would no longer enjoy legal protections for their \nindependence and would become instant lame ducks. In fact, SEC \nInspector General Kotz recently stated that if this provision becomes \nlaw it will effectively end some of the ongoing investigations his \noffice has at the SEC.\n\n  There is a practical problem with Presidential appointments as well. \nThis administration does not have a great track record in filling \nvacancies in an expeditious manner. Having no watchdog on duty is a \nconcern for all Americans.\n  There are over a dozen IG positions where there is a vacancy, an \nacting, or an interim IG. The administration waited 18 months to \nappoint an IG at the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees \nFreddie Mac and Fannie Mae. That is 18 months without strong leadership \nable to direct audits, investigations or examinations of agency policy. \nThat's 18 months without a cop on the beat. Maybe that is the way the \nadministration likes it. I am sure the bureaucrats at these agencies \nwould enjoy life more without an inspector general asking questions. \nImagine if the SEC were not held accountable for their failures in \nstopping the Madoff or Sanford Ponzi schemes.\n  This bill would create five lame ducks in the IG community and the \npotential for more extended vacancies unless we fix it. There would be \nfar less oversight during the lengthy transition process under the \ncurrent bill with no guarantee of vigorous oversight by the new \nappointees. Essentially, this provision could politicize the positions \nthat\n\n[[Page S3877]]\n\nhave historically been filled by career public servants.\n  I know the goal of this provision is to enhance IG independence, but \nthere are better ways to protect the independence of these IGs than by \nreplacing them with Presidential appointees.\n  We should do it more effectively and make sure that all agency-\nappointed IGs are more independent, not just the five singled out in \nthe bill. That is why I am offering this amendment. The Grassley-\nMcCaskill amendment simply applies the same sort of protections that \nhave worked for one of the 30 agency appointed IGs to the other 29 \nagency-appointed IGs. The Postal Service inspector general enjoys \nenhanced protections and my amendment would extend those protections \nmore broadly.\n  Our amendment would strike section 989B of the bill and replace it \nwith a system that will bring true reform, independence, and \naccountability.\n  It would make the IGs report to the entire bipartisan board or \ncommission heading their agency, and the IG could only be removed for \ncause by a \\2/3\\ majority vote of the bipartisan board or commission. \nThis would ensure that should an agency make a political attempt to \nremove an IG, there would be the possibility of dissent among the board \nor commission members.\n  These are serious protections from political interference currently \nenjoyed by the Postal Service IG, but it also allows an IG to be held \naccountable when necessary. These same provisions have worked for the \nPostal Service inspector general and it is time to extend them to all \nthe agency-appointed IGs.\n  It also holds IG's accountable by requiring that they disclose the \nresults of all their peer reviews in the semi-annual reports to \nCongress, thereby making them public.\n  This amendment strikes the right balance, improving both independence \nand accountability of all DFE-IGs. In fact, even the White House has \ngone on the record telling the Center for Public Integrity, ``the \nadministration does not support in any way politicizing the function of \nthe Inspector General and we have not proposed these changes'' in the \nDodd-Lincoln substitute.\n  The amendment is supported by the nonpartisan Project on Government \nOversight and has bipartisan support from members on the committee with \njurisdiction over the IG Act. This important amendment deserves an up-\nor-down vote at the appropriate time.\n  In summary, our amendment would correct serious problems in section \n989B of the Dodd-Lincoln substitute. This section of the bill would \nchange the way that five inspectors general are hired and fired. \nCurrently, these five inspectors general are hired and fired by the \nagency they oversee, but this section of the bill would put the \nPresident in charge of hiring and firing them. This provision was \nincluded because sponsors of the legislation believed that making \ninspectors general presidentially appointed would make them more \nindependent.\n  However, rather than strengthening oversight over our financial \ninstitutions with more independent watchdogs, this section could \nintroduce politics into what has traditionally been career, \nnonpolitical positions. It is important to ensure that this bill does \nnot then hurt the oversight of these designated Federal regulatory \nagencies by the inspectors general.\n  I think our amendment corrects the potential to create long-term \nvacancies at five important regulatory agencies that, quite frankly, \ncannot afford to have these sorts of vacancies and not have the proper \noversight.\n  The amendment provides true transparency, and with transparency you \nget accountability among inspectors general. We are going to bring \nabout real independence--or maybe it would be better for me to say \nmaintain the independence these folks have shown already.\n  We should take steps to make all agency-appointed IGs more \nindependent, not just the five addressed in the bill. These five should \nnot be singled out. The amendment before us makes the IGs report to the \nentire bipartisan board or commission heading their agency and requires \na two-thirds vote to remove an inspector general.\n  I will not speak about the peer review Senator McCaskill has already \nspoken about. But I think it is important we have semiannual reports to \nCongress on the effectiveness of the people in their various positions. \nBy reporting to the entire bipartisan board or commission rather than \njust the chairs, these IGs will be further insulated from political \ninfluence. As a consequence, they will be more independent. So in the \nfinal analysis, I think this brings the right balance to the \nindependence of it.\n  As I said, this amendment is supported by the nonpartisan Project On \nGovernment Oversight. Because it comes from another committee of \njurisdiction, I am glad that through Senator McCaskill and other people \non the committee, we have bipartisan support from the committee of \njurisdiction.\n  This is an important amendment and deserves an up-or-down vote at the \nappropriate time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, first, let me commend my colleagues from \nIowa and Missouri for raising an issue of this importance. Senator \nMenendez of our committee, the Senator from New Jersey, has an interest \nin the subject matter, I explain to my good friends and colleagues from \nIowa and Missouri, and he may want to be heard on this amendment.\n  I understand the purpose and the intent, and in many respects I agree \nwith my colleagues from Iowa and Missouri. But in fairness to my \ncolleague from New Jersey, I wish to give him a chance to respond, as a \nmember of our Banking Committee. So if we could just pause for a few \nminutes and give him an opportunity to come to the floor and say why he \nbelieves the existing language in the bill has merit, I would \nappreciate that.\n  So I wish to suggest the absence of a quorum and give him a chance to \ncome on over and make his case. Then, hopefully, we can get to a vote. \nIn the meantime, I do not know if Senator Bingaman is here or others \nare here who would like to be heard on the Bingaman amendment and the \nside-by-side I think being offered as well. That would certainly be a \nuseful use of the time. People could go and discuss that particular \nproposition while we are waiting to hear from Senator Menendez.\n  So I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am going to speak for a few moments \nabout the amendment I just referenced, amendment No. 4109, which was \nfiled and to which there has now been an objection. As I have indicated \nto my colleague, objections run both ways. I could sit here and object \nas well to most things that are going to go on here, if we have a \ngatekeeper or several gatekeepers who decide that two amendments that \nwould get a little tougher on Wall Street are amendments they don't \nwant to vote on; if they don't want to countenance an amendment that \nwould tighten the strings just a little bit.\n  Let me speak about what this amendment is because it sounds like a \nforeign language, ``naked credit default swaps.'' ``Credit default \nswaps'' by itself sounds like a foreign language. The reason is they \nhaven't been around all that long. This is an exotic financial \ninstrument that was created to allow certain things to happen on Wall \nStreet between banks and big hedge funds and so on. If we have not yet \nat this point understood the danger of this unbelievable orgy of \nspeculation in credit default swaps--and especially what are called \nnaked credit default swaps--then I guess we are destined to never fully \nunderstand what happened, and that is fine. Maybe some people don't \nwant to know what happened.\n  A naked credit default swap is pretty simple. Someone out there needs \nsome money, so they issue bonds. Someone else buys the bonds. Now they \nhold the bonds and the person who issued them has the money. The person \nwho bought the bonds wants to make sure the person who issued the bonds \nwon't default, so they want to buy an insurance policy from someone \nelse, a credit default\n\n[[Page S3878]]\n\nswap. So for a small amount of money, they buy an insurance policy \nagainst the bonds defaulting. It is a relatively recent phenomenon \nwhere all of this has been created.\n  Normally speaking, if someone issued bonds, the other people bought \nthe bonds and they did due diligence on the other side to decide if \nthis is a good risk, and that is the way it worked. Now they buy \ninsurance called credit default swaps.\n  The difficulty is credit default swaps are now called naked credit \ndefault swaps if, in fact, they have no insurable interest at all. That \nis a credit default swap that bets that someone who issued bonds is \ngoing to default, despite the fact that neither party to this \ntransaction ever has purchased any of those bonds. They don't have an \ninsurable interest in the bonds; they just made a bet. They have said: \nWe have not bought those bonds over there. But those bonds were issued, \nand we would like to make a wager. We think those bonds are probably \ngoing to default. Someone else says: I don't think they will. So you \nhave a naked credit default swap with no insurable interest in \nanything.\n  Why is that troublesome? Well, I can't buy fire insurance on the \nhouse of the Presiding Officer in Alaska. Why would they not allow me \nto buy fire insurance on his house? Because I don't have an interest in \nhis house, and they don't want about 10 or 15 people having a fire \ninsurance policy on his house. The only way you can get fire insurance \nis if you have an insurable interest. I can't buy a life insurance \npolicy on someone else's life because I don't have an insurable \ninterest.\n  Those are rules most of us understand. You can't buy fire insurance \nagainst somebody else's house; you can't buy a life insurance policy \nagainst somebody else's life. But Wall Street has discovered there is a \nnew way to allow someone to buy insurance policies or speculate in \ncertain kinds of insurance without ever having an interest; that is, \nallowing two parties to speculate on whether a third party might \ndefault on a bond issue they placed with a fourth party, despite the \nfact that the first two parties have no interest in that at all. It is \njust as if they went to Las Vegas and one bet on red and the other bet \nagainst red on the roulette wheel. It is just a flatout bet. It is not \nan investment; it is just a bet.\n  Let me talk about how prevalent this is, just because I think it is \nimportant. There was about $10.9 trillion in naked credit default swaps \nheld by commercial banks in the fourth quarter of last year; $10.9 \ntrillion held by commercial banks. Those are institutions, by the way, \nwhose deposits are insured by us, by the American taxpayer, by the \nFDIC. Up to $19.9 trillion of naked credit default swaps are held by \nthe top 25 holding companies.\n  It is estimated by one expert that as much as 80 percent of the \ncredit default swap market is traded by firms that don't own the \nunderlying debt. There is also a United Kingdom report shared by the \nCongressional Research Service that says only 20 percent of the credit \ndefault swaps are estimated to be covered. That means 80 percent of all \nof this paper that is put out there in credit default swaps is so-\ncalled naked. It has no insurable interest. It is a bet rather than an \ninvestment.\n  Let me just show what some of the experts are saying about this. One \nof the editors of the Financial Times says: I can't understand why we \nare still allowing the trade in credit default swaps--he meant naked \nswaps--without ownership of the underlying securities. A generalized \nban on so-called naked CDS's should be a no-brainer.\n  It ought to be a no-brainer. It is not a no-brainer in this Chamber, \napparently. A naked CDS purchase means someone takes out insurance on \nbonds without actually owning them. It is a purely speculative gamble. \nThere is not one social or economic benefit.\n  My amendment is trying to shut this down, but I am being blocked by \nthose who don't want us to get tough on Wall Street.\n  Charlie Munger, who is the partner of Warren Buffett and who has \nspoken a lot about these issues, said:\n\n       If I were the governor of the world I would eliminate \n     credit default swaps entirely, 100 percent. That's the best \n     solution. It isn't as though the economic world didn't \n     function quite well without it and it isn't as though what \n     has happened has been so wonderfully desirable that we should \n     logically want more of it.\n\n  Do we need to go to the edge of a cliff again with this economy, with \ntens of trillions of dollars of notional value of credit default swaps \nbefore we decide this is a problem for our country and for our future?\n  Again, the associated editor of the Financial Times:\n\n       Another argument I have heard from a lobbyist is that naked \n     CDS's allow investors to hedge more effectively. That is like \n     saying that a bank robbery brings benefits to the robber.\n\n  Well, I guess so.\n  George Soros, a pretty good investor I might say, made $3 billion \nlast year, I am told in the reports:\n\n       CDS's are toxic instruments whose use ought to be strictly \n     regulated: Only those who own the underlying bonds ought to \n     be allowed to buy them.\n\n  Well, those are a few thoughts from some people of consequence: \neditor of the Financial Times, Charlie Munger; George Soros; and \nothers. But it describes a very significant problem. It describes, in \nmy judgment, a fairly large portion of what caused this country's \neconomy to teeter on the edge of a cliff.\n  The Treasury Secretary one day comes and leans across a lectern on a \nFriday and says to us: You need to ante up $700 billion and pass a \nthree-page bill in 3 days or the economy might collapse. Now, a year \nand a half has passed, a little more, and some, I think, have too \nquickly forgotten the lessons.\n  So the question is, Are we going to do something about naked credit \ndefault swaps, about the unbelievable orgy of speculation, the bubble \nof speculation that exists to the tune of tens of trillions of dollars?\n  Let me read it again:\n\n       Up to $10.9 trillion in naked credit default swaps were \n     held by commercial banks in this country in the fourth \n     quarter of 2009.\n\n  I am talking about up to $10.9 trillion of naked credit default swaps \nin the bowels of commercial banks. These are institutions that we \nguarantee, we underwrite.\n  I don't understand at all the notion that we should be prevented from \naddressing this issue. It may be that we have people here willing to \nshake the pompoms and be cheerleaders for naked credit default swaps. \nGood for you, if that is the way you feel. It is just you have missed a \nsignificant chapter of American financial history. But if you feel that \nway, vote against my legislation. My legislation would ban the use of \nnaked credit default swaps.\n\n       After the phase-in period, they are gone. If you don't have \n     an insurable interest, they are gone. It is a simple enough \n     proposition to say: Why should we have 5 or 10 times the \n     number of insurance policies against bonds than there are \n     bonds to insure? Why should we allow that? We don't allow it \n     in other circumstances.\n\n  I understand the offering of this amendment and the shutting down of \nnaked credit default swaps will cost Wall Street a substantial amount \nof money. They will not get fees on these things. I understand that. \nThis is all about churning and getting fees and making a lot of money. \nI understand all that. I also understand sometimes this notion of \nmaking a lot of money in a short period of time by cutting corners and \nby doing things that aren't appropriate is the wrong thing.\n  My colleagues know and I know that we saw banks being robbed in this \ncountry. Yes, we saw banks being robbed in the last several years. In \nthe old days, when I used to watch the western movies, you could tell \nwho the bank robber was. They usually had a bandana, they brandished a \ncouple of six-guns. Often they stopped a train or they ran into a bank, \nand that is the way they robbed things.\n  In the last several years, there have been some bank robberies going \non in this country, and I can refer you to a lot of contemporary \nwriting that describes the way those banks were robbed. Two people \ndriving home from work, each making $20 million, one supervising the \nother in one of the biggest investment banks, loading that bank up with \nunbelievably risky investments because they know at the end of the day, \nsomebody is going to lean over a lectern and say: Oh, by the way, we \nneed to bail all these folks out.\n  The folks who went to the basement of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, I believe, in the year 2004--\n\n[[Page S3879]]\n\nsaid: We need you to allow us, the biggest investment banks in the \ncountry, to extend our leverage from 12 times to 30 times and more. You \nneed to give us the opportunity to free up some money by exacerbating \nthe leverage capabilities we have. The Securities and Exchange \nCommission, ever the compliant regulatory agency, said: Yes, sir--\nsaluting handily in the basement of their building--absolutely, go \nright ahead.\n  By the way, one of those companies was run by Mr. Paulson who, 2 \nyears later, came back as Treasury Secretary and leaned across the \nlectern and said: I need $700 billion to bail out these companies.\n  What was part and parcel of that which caused these companies to \nalmost ruin this economy? Naked credit default swaps, just flatout \ngaming. Not investing, just betting. The question is, Do we want to \ncontinue to do that?\n  I fear we are going to pass a piece of legislation that does not \naddress too big to fail. At the end of the day, we will have \ninstitutions that are still too big to fail. I have an amendment on \nthat, but I haven't bothered because we already did one amendment on \ntoo big to fail, the Brown-Kaufman amendment. That got 33 votes, too \nbig to fail. Banning these unbelievable speculative instruments like \nnaked credit default swaps, if we can't do that, it is very hard, it \nseems to me, to climb on the high step and say we have taken on this \nsubject. We have really made sure this isn't going to happen again. So \nI have an amendment that is filed, and now I am told that, no; it is \ninconvenient and uncomfortable for me to offer this amendment and, \ntherefore, someone has objected.\n  To my colleague from Alabama, I would say I understand. He is \nrequired--when people in the caucus say there is an objection, his job \nis to reflect the objection of someone in his caucus. So my beef is not \nwith him. But I would just say that it is not acceptable to me to, at 5 \no'clock on Tuesday, have a process by which we have now decided that if \namendments are inconvenient--getting a little too tough on Wall Street; \ntrying to draw the strings a little tighter on things that have to be \nfixed in this bill--if that is the case, well, then, you know what. We \nare not going to allow those things to be offered. We will just sit \nhere and offer amendments on tourism or something else equally benign.\n  If that is the case, then I will just sit here as well and say that \nis not a process I respect. It seems to me we ought to have the right \nto bring to this Chamber at this point, given the shadow of what we \nhave been through as a country, the right to bring amendments to this \nbill that try to address some very significant problems; the right to \nbring them to the floor, to have a debate, and to offer them for a \nvote. If that is not going to be the case, then I am going to sit here \nand object to proceeding until it is the case.\n  So my colleague, Senator Bingaman, I know is here. I have more to \nsay, but I will save it because I fully expect either to get to this \namendment or to be sitting here for some long while, and I will have an \nopportunity again to talk about naked credit default swaps, their \ndanger to this economy, and why, when this bill is done, it ought to \ninclude the provisions of amendment No. 4109 which bans the use of \nnaked credit default swaps and says there is a place to gamble in \nAmerica and it is not in a bank lobby.\n  If you want to put a Keno table or a blackjack table in a bank lobby, \nshame on you. We ought to pass this amendment, and, most importantly, \nwe ought to allow amendments to be offered. I will sit here until that \nis the case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 3892, as Modified, to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3892, as \nmodified, for consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Mexico [Mr. Bingaman], for himself, \n     Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Reid, Mr. Brownback, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. \n     Cornyn, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Corker, Mr. Inouye, Mrs. Murray, and \n     Mrs. Shaheen, proposes an amendment numbered 3892 to \n     amendment No. 3739.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To preserve the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission to ensure just and reasonable electric and natural gas rates \n                  and to protect the public interest)\n\n       On page 565, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (e) Just and Reasonable Rates.--Section 2(a)(1)(C) of the \n     Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 2(a)(1)(C)) (as amended by \n     section 717(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(vi) Notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the \n     Commission with respect to accounts, agreements, and \n     transactions involving swaps or contracts of sale of a \n     commodity for future delivery under this Act, no provision of \n     this Act shall be construed--\n\n       ``(I) to supersede or limit the authority of the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 791a et seq.) or the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(II) to restrict the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     from carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure just and \n     reasonable rates and protect the public interest under the \n     Acts described in subclause (I); or\n       ``(III) to supersede or limit the authority of a State \n     regulatory authority (as defined in section 3(21) of the \n     Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(21)) that has jurisdiction \n     to regulate rates and charges for the sale of electric energy \n     within the State, or restrict that State regulatory authority \n     from carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the \n     State regulatory authority pursuant to the jurisdiction of \n     the State regulatory authority to regulate rates and charges \n     for the transmission or sale of electric energy.''.\n\n       (f) Public Interest Waiver.--Section 4(c) of the Commodity \n     Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6(c)) (as amended by section 721(d)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) If the Commission determines that the exemption would \n     be consistent with the public interest and the purposes of \n     this Act, the Commission shall, in accordance with paragraphs \n     (1) and (2), exempt from the requirements of this Act an \n     agreement, contract, or transaction that is entered into--\n       ``(A) pursuant to a tariff or rate schedule approved or \n     permitted to take effect by the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission;\n       ``(B) pursuant to a tariff or rate schedule establishing \n     rates or charges for, or protocols governing, the sale of \n     electric energy approved or permitted to take effect by the \n     regulatory authority of the State or municipality having \n     jurisdiction to regulate rates and charges for the sale of \n     electric energy within the State or municipality; or\n       ``(C) between entities described in section 201(f) of the \n     Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824(f)).''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, the amendment that is before the \nSenate, No. 3892, as modified, is one I talked about at length a week \nago last Friday, so it has now been about 11 days ago. I will summarize \nit again and make some comments about some of the things that have \nhappened since then.\n  First, let me ask unanimous consent to add Senators Shaheen, Murray, \nand Inouye as cosponsors.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, with the addition of those three \nSenators, the other cosponsors on the amendment are Senators Murkowski, \nReid from Nevada, Brownback, Cantwell, Wyden, Cornyn, and Corker.\n  The amendment preserves the existing authority of the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission and the authority of the States to be sure that \nelectricity and natural gas rates are just and reasonable, while at the \nsame time leaving the Commodity Futures Trading Commission its full \nauthority to police derivatives and futures markets.\n  First, I applaud the good work Senator Dodd and Senator Shelby have \ndone on this bill. I particularly applaud the provisions that have come \nfrom Senators Lincoln and Chambliss and the Agriculture Committee in \nsetting up a system to get control of derivatives markets.\n  I am, however, concerned that without this amendment, the law could \nbe interpreted to allow the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to \noverride the jurisdiction the Congress has given to the FERC and that \nthe new provisions included here could make this problem worse.\n  There is probably not a sector of the economy that is more tightly \nregulated than the electricity industry. The natural gas industry is \nnot far behind for a claim to that title. FERC regulates wholesale \nrates and transportation in\n\n[[Page S3880]]\n\ninterstate commerce for both electricity and gas and must approve \nmergers of utilities. FERC also has authority to police the \nmanipulation of electricity and gas markets, granted by the Congress in \n2005 as a response to Enron's manipulation of electricity markets in \nthe West. The States have that same authority for retail sales both \nwith regard to electricity and natural gas. There are tight rules for \ntransactions among affiliates of holding companies in these industries. \nThere are extensive transparency and reporting requirements for \ncontracts and transactions. This is all intended to be sure that the \ncustomers of utilities are getting what they are paying for and that \nthey are paying rates that, in fact, are just and reasonable.\n  The concern has been that the exclusive jurisdiction of the CFTC \nunder the Commodities Exchange Act could be interpreted to supersede \nthe regulation by FERC of important aspects of these industries.\n  The amendment I am offering with my cosponsors is a proposed solution \nthat I believe is consistent with the philosophy of consumer protection \nthat underlies other parts of the bill we are considering. The effect \nis simple. This amendment preserves the authority of both the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission and the individual States to ensure that \nelectricity and natural gas rates are just and reasonable, and in the \ncase of FERC, to prevent market manipulation that could affect prices.\n  Direct examination of prices is central to each agency's mission. In \nFERC's case, this authority is longstanding; it was established over 70 \nyears ago. Without this amendment, a critical check on energy prices \ncould be lost, and this is so for two obvious reasons: First, the \nCFTC's so-called ``exclusive jurisdiction'' could be interpreted to \noperate to prevent FERC and State public utility commissions from \nacting, where their jurisdictions intersect the CFTC's jurisdiction. \nSecond, the CFTC's regulatory mission differs significantly from that \nof the FERC and the State public utility commissions. The Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission's mission is to protect market participants \nand promote fair and orderly trading. It doesn't directly examine \ncommodity prices in its markets, nor does it consider the \nreasonableness of rates. While properly functioning futures markets are \nimportant, the CFTC cannot duplicate the direct ratepayer protections \nprovided by the FERC and by the State public utility commissions.\n  There are some things this amendment does not do that it has been \ncharged with doing. First, it doesn't give FERC jurisdiction over \nfutures, swaps, or options. FERC has jurisdiction over rates for the \nsale of electricity and gas and contracts that are associated with \nthose sales. Derivatives that are related are still jurisdictional to \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission. Nothing changes in that \nregard. We are merely preserving that authority that the Federal Power \nAct and the Natural Gas Act gave to FERC decades ago and in the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005. Second, the amendment doesn't give FERC \njurisdiction over NYMEX or ICE or any other futures exchanges. They are \nnot public utilities. They do not sell electricity or natural gas.\n  As I have said, I support this bill generally. I believe it is \nessential in ensuring that consumers are protected. However, both I and \nmy cosponsors strongly believe it is necessary to preserve enduring \nconsumer protections that might otherwise be lost.\n  It is a simple, tailored amendment that doesn't create any loopholes \nin jurisdiction. It also does nothing to diminish the ability of the \nCFTC to regulate commodity exchanges such as NYMEX or to require public \ndisclosure of swaps or any other public authority they have to regulate \nthe mechanics of commodity markets, including those who trade energy \ncommodities.\n  We have received letters of support for this amendment from the \nNational Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, the FERC, \nutility industry companies and associations, including Edison Electric \nInstitute, the American Public Power Association, the American Public \nGas Association, the Electric Power Supply Association, the American \nWind Energy Association, the California Independent System Operator, \nthe American Gas Association, the Large Public Power Council, the \nNatural Gas Supply Association, Compete, and PJM Interconnection.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letters of \nsupport I have referred to following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have also been informed that the \nadministration supports this amendment. I advise my colleagues that is \nthe case as well.\n  Once again, I thank my cosponsors and urge my colleagues to support \nthe amendment. I gather that a time will be found during our \ndeliberations of the bill to consider the amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n                                                     May 11, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski, \n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid, Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member \n     Murkowski: We are writing in support of your amendment to S. \n     3217, the Restoring American Financial Stability Act, which \n     would preserve the authority of the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC) and the states to ensure just and \n     reasonable rates for electricity and natural gas consumers. \n     The undersigned associations represent most of the \n     electricity and natural gas consumers in the United States.\n       FERC and the states already regulate transactions, \n     products, services and agreements in wholesale and retail \n     electricity and natural gas markets, respectively. In \n     addition, FERC regulates regional transmission organizations \n     (RTOs) and independent system operators (ISOs), which are \n     responsible for the planning and operation of the \n     transmission grid in many areas of the country. There is no \n     regulatory gap that needs to be filled with respect to the \n     transactions, agreements, contracts, products and services \n     that regulated energy companies provide.\n       The underlying derivatives language in the Senate financial \n     reform bill could cause the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission to assert jurisdiction to regulate products \n     offered in wholesale electricity markets, such as financial \n     transmission rights (FTRs), which are used to manage the cost \n     of transmission congestion. This could affect the ability of \n     our member companies and utilities to have continued access \n     to FTRs and other products on reasonable terms and \n     conditions, which is essential to their ability to reliably \n     serve their retail consumers at reasonable rates and with \n     less price volatility.\n       We thank you and the other co-sponsors of this amendment \n     for recognizing and addressing this issue. While a more clear \n     delineation of FERC's authority would be helpful, we believe \n     this amendment is a significant step in the right direction, \n     and we look forward to passage of the amendment and \n     continuing dialogue on this issue as financial regulatory \n     reform legislation moves forward in Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Gas Association; American Public Power \n           Association; American Wind Energy Association; \n           California ISO; COMPETE; Edison Electric Institute; \n           Electric Power Supply Association; Large Public Power \n           Council; Natural Gas Supply Association; PJM \n           Interconnection, L.L.C.\n                                  ____\n\n         Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Office of the \n           Chairman,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 12, 2010.\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Murkowski: I \n     write in support of your bipartisan amendment No. 3892 to \n     amendment No. 3739 to. S. 3217, the financial regulatory \n     reform legislation currently being debated by the Senate.\n       Your amendment preserves existing Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission (FERC) authority to protect energy consumers from \n     rate increases and in no way allows FERC to supersede the \n     regulatory jurisdiction of the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC) with respect to the markets or instruments \n     the CFTC now regulates, especially futures markets. Any \n     suggestion to the contrary flies in the face of the plain \n     language of your amendment.\n       As you know, FERC is the only federal agency charged with \n     regulating physical electricity and natural gas markets for \n     ``just and reasonable rates''. But the broad jurisdiction the \n     underlying legislation grants to the CFTC over ``swaps'' \n     could undermine FERC's ability to regulate the electricity \n     and natural gas markets and thus lead to increased costs to \n     consumers, because CFTC has no ratemaking authority. Your \n     amendment rightly maintains FERC's ratemaking\n\n[[Page S3881]]\n\n     authority within the physical electricity and natural gas \n     markets while preserving CFTC's role to ensure that the \n     futures markets operate in a fair and orderly manner.\n       FERC also has an obligation to police the physical \n     electricity and natural gas markets for fraud and \n     manipulation and punish any wrongdoing. In the aftermath of \n     the California energy crisis and the schemes perpetrated by \n     Enron and others, Congress gave FERC under EPAct 2005 more \n     robust authorities to prevent fraud and market manipulation \n     by allowing a penalty of up to $1 million per violation per \n     day. In Fiscal Year 2009, FERC's policing efforts yielded \n     approximately $38.3 million in civil penalties and recovered \n     $38.7 million in ill-gotten gains. We are concerned that the \n     underlying bill could inadvertently undermine those \n     authorities, but your amendment will preserve them.\n       Finally, I note that the American Gas Association, the \n     American Public Power Association, the American Wind Energy \n     Association, the Edison Electric Institute, the Electric \n     Power Supply Association, the Large Public Power Council, the \n     National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners, the \n     Natural Gas Supply Association, California ISO, PJM \n     Interconnection, L.L.C., and COMPETE support your amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jon Wellinghoff,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                             Regulatory Utility Commissioners,\n\n                                                     May 10, 2010.\n     Re Bingaman, Murkowski, Reid Amendment to the ``Restoring \n         American Financial Stability Act'' (S. 3217).\n\n     Hon. Jeff Bingaman,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy & Nat. Resources, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Lisa Murkowski,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy & Nat. Resources, U.S. \n         Senate.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate.\n       Dear Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member Murkowski, and \n     Majority Leader Reid: On behalf of the National Association \n     of Regulatory Utility Commissioners (NARUC), I write to you \n     today to express NARUC's strong support for your amendment to \n     the ``Restoring American Financial Stability Act'' (S. 3217) \n     addressing federal and State electric and gas utility rate \n     jurisdiction. Your Amendment correctly confirms State and \n     federal regulatory authority to ensure that retail and \n     wholesale energy consumers pay just and reasonable rates for \n     utility service.\n       The FERC and the States are the regulatory agencies with \n     the necessary expertise and statutory mandates to oversee \n     electricity and natural gas markets to protect the public \n     interest and consumers. S. 3217 should not preempt FERC and \n     the States from continuing to exercise their authority under \n     existing law to ensure consumers pay just and reasonable \n     rates for reliable utility service. These markets that are \n     already regulated by FERC and the States under accepted \n     tariffs or rate schedules should remain subject to this \n     existing regulation, which includes jurisdiction over \n     physical and financial transmission rights and market \n     oversight.\n       NARUC thanks you and your colleagues for offering this \n     important amendment. By continuing FERC and State authority, \n     under S. 3217, to oversee any agreement, contract, \n     transaction, product, market mechanism or service offered or \n     provided pursuant to a tariff or rate schedule filed and \n     accepted by the FERC and/or the States, we believe this \n     amendment ensures that the consumers and the public interest \n     will be protected.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Charles D. Gray,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On May 13, the American Farm Bureau \n     Federation (AFBF) wrote you in opposition to Senate Amendment \n     #3892 to be offered by Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) to S. \n     3217, the Senate financial markets reform package. Sen. \n     Bingaman has modified the amendment since that time and we \n     wish to notify you that we can now support it.\n       The amendment acknowledges and protects continued Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) jurisdiction over \n     physical natural gas and electricity transactions. In \n     addition, the amendment acknowledges continued Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) jurisdiction over energy \n     futures and options contracts traded on CFTC-regulated \n     exchanges. The CFTC has long had regulatory authority over \n     exchange-traded futures and options transactions, and this \n     has worked well to maintain the price discovery function of \n     these markets.\n       Finally, the amendment provides that the new CFTC \n     jurisdiction over ``swaps'' (contained in S. 3217) does not \n     change this status quo allocation of jurisdiction between \n     FERC and the CFTC. Rather, the amendment now sets forth an \n     expedited and cooperative exemption process to allow both \n     regulatory agencies to fulfill their obligations to the \n     American public.\n       We appreciate your work on this important legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bob Stallman,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4072 to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside \nthe pending amendment for the purpose of calling up amendment No. 4072.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak on the pending \namendment, the amendment by Senator Grassley. I have a great deal of \nrespect for the Senator from Iowa. Actually, there is a series of \nthings I propose that are in the underlying bill that go to the heart \nof much of what that amendment is going to do.\n  I would start off by saying I agree with most of what my colleagues \nare proposing. I agree we need to make sure we have a strong regulatory \nagency to act as cops on the beat. We need to make sure those cops on \nthe beat are doing their job.\n  I agree we should require financial regulators to respond when \ninspectors general identify deficiencies in their agencies--either by \ntaking corrective action or explaining to Congress why they are not \ntaking those actions.\n  I agree we should require inspectors general to report to the board \nof the organization rather than the head of the organization.\n  I agree we should require publication of any negative recommendations \nfrom the inspector general's peer review of the work of other \ninspectors general.\n  I also agree inspectors general should not suffer any reduction in \npay and that current inspectors general should keep their jobs until \nthe new Presidential appointment system I included in the legislation \nkicks in.\n  I think those are great ideas and I proposed them myself. But here is \nwhere we have a disagreement. That is that this amendment takes away \nsomething I think is incredibly important in the underlying bill. It \ntakes away making these inspectors general at these financial \ninstitutions Presidential appointments with Senate confirmation of \ninspectors general at financial regulatory agencies. In its place, it \nwants to let the heads of the agencies appoint their own inspectors \ngeneral.\n  I think that inures to the possibility of conflicts of interest. \nLook, if I am the head of an agency and I am going to put in the cop on \nthe beat who is going to supervise me, the inclination is to pick \nsomeone who is going to give me a lot of flexibility at the end of the \nday.\n  I want a robust cop on the beat. The way I ensure there is a robust \ncop on the beat, in terms of the inspector general, is having a \nPresidentially appointed one, one confirmed by the Senate, to know that \nin fact this person is worthy of pursuing all of the actions of that \nparticular agency in a robust way so they are independent of the \nagency, not appointed by the very head of the agency they are now going \nto supervise and review.\n  I think that is a fundamental weakness, which is why the Banking \nCommittee agreed with me and put the Presidential appointment there and \nSenate confirmation of inspectors general at financial regulatory \nagencies.\n  It seems to me what we want an inspector general to do is make sure \nthe agency is doing its job. Being appointed by the head of the very \nagency I have to criticize, that I have to critique, that I may raise \nactions about, means it is a lot less likely the inspector general is \ntruly independent. It is like going to court and saying let me pick the \njudge who is going to decide on my case. We wouldn't tolerate that in a \ncourtroom and I do not see this as being any different.\n  I have so much with which I am in agreement with my distinguished \ncolleague, as I mentioned at the beginning--all of those elements. I \nthink we need to make sure when an inspector general identifies \nefficiencies, either by taking corrective action or explaining to \nCongress why they are not, that needs to be responded to by the \nregulators. I agree we should require inspectors general to report to \nthe boards of organizations rather than the head of the organization. I \nagree we should require publication of any negative recommendation from \nthe IG peer review of any other inspector general's work. I agree the \ninspectors general should not suffer any reduction in pay and that \nthose who are there should be able to keep their job until the new \nPresidential appointment system kicks in.\n  But at the end of the day, if we want a true cop on the beat who is \nindependent of the very agency he or she has to review, I would not \nwant them appointed by the head of the agency and say to themselves, \nwho am I appointing? Am I appointing a robust cop on the beat or am I \nappointing someone who is far less than robust?\n  We have forum shopping in the court. Trial lawyers try to pick the \nbest judge from their perspective as to who can best look at their \ncase. I want to be honest. I don't think we should be having the agency \nheads picking the IG and looking at who is going to treat them most \nlightly.\n  I think that is what is at stake. The underlying bill permits the \nPresidentially appointed, Senate confirmed. I think we should have that \nright. I think we need a robust cop on the beat and that is why in that \none respect I oppose the Grassley amendment.\n  I hope we can work something out so we can keep the Presidential \nappointment and Senate confirmation and have all of the other \nsafeguards, many of which I already offered in the bill to be included, \nand we would have a harmony of view and a robust inspector general \nregime.\n\n[[Page S3883]]\n\n  If we are going to have an up-or-down vote on the existing amendment \nwithout any changes, then I urge a ``no'' vote. But I do hope we can \nmake a change that permits the inspector general to be Presidentially \nappointed, confirmed by the Senate. That confers the ultimate \nindependence, the ultimate vigilance, the ultimate vigor in pursuing \nthe very same things my colleague from Iowa and I want to see happen.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I appreciate very much the words of my \ncolleague from New Jersey. He is a very thoughtful Senator. He is a \nmember of the Finance Committee so I have a lot of relationships with \nhim. I am glad he spoke highly of some of the changes we have suggested \nin the IG system generally through our amendment. But I think the real \ndifference for Senator McCaskill and this Senator is the fact of \nwhether they should be Presidentially appointed. That is probably a \ndifference that is going to be hard to bridge. So I will speak to that \npoint and also say I hope Senator McCaskill will be able to come over \nhere and rebut Senator Menendez because she is on the committee that \nhas jurisdiction over IGs, and she has been very much involved over her \nrecent tenure in the Senate on strengthening the system of IGs.\n  She will probably speak with more authority on this issue than I can, \nfrom the standpoint that I am not on that committee--even though I am \ninvolved very deeply in strengthening IGs because I think they are an \nextension of the checks and balances of government, particularly the \nextent to which they work with those of us involved in the \nconstitutional responsibility of oversight performed by the Congress.\n  I wish to say flat out I do not accept the argument that \nPresidentially appointed IGs are always more independent. I think \nSenator McCaskill spoke on this point earlier when she was presenting \nour amendment. In fact, Presidential appointments raise another \nproblem. President Obama has had a problem with filling IG vacancies. \nIt took the President 18 months to appoint the IG at the Federal \nHousing Finance Agency. That is one example. Eighteen months without a \ncop on the beat would be a disaster at these financial agencies. Just \nthink, if the SEC, Securities and Exchange Commission, did not have an \nIG for 18 months, how many more Madoffs would there be, how many more \nSanford Ponzi schemes would there be.\n  Our amendment provides flexibility with accountability and \ntransparency by reporting to the entire board or commission. The IG is \nnot beholden to one person.\n  That brings up the point, for 80 years now, since independent \nagencies have been set up--well, I suppose for 130 years, going back to \nthe setting up of the Interstate Commerce Commission, as an example--\nthey have been meant to be a fourth branch of government, pretty much \nimmune to any one President due to the fact they are appointed to \noverlapping terms and there has to be representation of both political \nparties on a commission. Just from the history and purpose of \nindependent agencies, you would also want to make sure that inspector \ngeneral was independent from the chief executive; not totally \nindependent--because the President appoints them--but at least more \nindependent than inspectors general in Treasury and State and the \nJustice Department--name any of the Cabinet positions you want.\n  Also, it provides for accountability by requiring a two-thirds vote \nto remove an inspector general. If the inspector general were appointed \nby the President, the IG could be removed, then, by one person. This \ntakes politics out of the equation. Our amendment takes politics out of \nthe equation. It strengthens the IG's independence and obviously that \nis why we are offering the amendment.\n  I suppose we are offering the amendment from the standpoint that we \nwant that independence to be there because it has accountability with \nindependence; also, because we think there can be a lapse in the work \nof an inspector general when a President takes a long time to appoint \nsomebody.\n  In further response to the reasons Senator Menendez has given, I wish \nto say that the underlying language in the bill would allow the IGs to \nserve, yes, until the President appoints someone.\n  But this means once the President nominates someone, the current IG \nis removed because there is a long lapse between appointment and Senate \nconfirmation. This means the entire time the Senate debates the \nnominee, the agency does not have an IG. This is an invitation to allow \nwaste, fraud, and abuse and mismanagement in agencies.\n  So we come to you--when I say ``we,'' I mean Senator McCaskill and \nmyself--with a sincere desire that if something is not broken, do not \nfix it. We come with a desire to say these agencies are so important \nthere should not be any lapse in time between what they are doing now \nand some new process of bringing somebody aboard.\n  I have seen the independence of these IGs to do their job and to help \nus uncover a lot of things that are wrong, particularly, as I think I \nhave been able to point out with the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, not only under this administration but under the previous \nadministration.\n  Probably in the last couple of years of the Bush administration, we \nwere able to, working with IGs, make sure the job was done right and \nexposed a lot of things that were wrong.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I appreciate the statement of my \ncolleague from Iowa. I will just make one or two observations. First, \nif we are talking about someone being beholden to one person, well, \nunder the Senator's view that person is going to be beholden to the \ndepartment authority that appoints him, the very same department \nauthority that person is going to supervise and review. So it seems to \nme to the extent that there is always going to be an appointing \nauthority, I would rather have the President of the United States, with \nthe interests of the American people, whatever President that might be, \nbe the appointing authority over an agency where the IG is not going to \nbe beholden to the agency that appointed them.\n  I think that is a much more compelling issue. As it relates to the \ntime, the lapse of time, I would just simply say, well, first of all, \nif we do not have filibusters and have up-or-down votes on people, then \nwe will not have much of a lapse in time in terms of having an IG come \nbefore the Senate for confirmation.\n  I do not know why Senators would want to give up the right they would \nhave under the bill to confirm inspectors general and make sure that \nperson has a robust quality to them, the integrity and the background \nand the history to make sure they are going to go after this agency \nwhen it is appropriate to do so.\n  I would say, to the extent that any lapse of time versus the robust \nnature of how this person gets appointed is worthy of consideration. So \nI do not find, while I agree with my colleague on so many of the other \npoints I have already mentioned, this one fundamental issue is one that \nI find difficult to understand how, when it is like--sort of like \nhaving the fox be appointed to watch the chicken coop. If I appoint \nsomeone to watch over me, I would like to believe I am going to have \nthe most robust, tough cop on the beat do it. But human nature being \nwhat it is, I am not so sure that agency heads are going to do that. I \nam not so sure they are going to pick the toughest cop on the beat \nversus actually someone who might have a less vigilant view. I think \nmaybe we can agree that inspectors general have to come for an \nimmediate vote on the Senate floor and not be subject to being \nfilibustered, and this way we could have an up-or-down vote on them and \nthe issue of lapsing time would be taken care of.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, this will be the last time I will \nspeak on it, and just for a couple of minutes. I hope the Senate would \ngive some discretion to the fact that when Senator McCaskill comes \nover, that she would be able to speak for 2 or 3 minutes on this issue \nso that people can hear from the other side of the aisle on the \nimportance of this amendment.\n  We appear to have a fundamental difference regarding how independent\n\n[[Page S3884]]\n\nPresidential appointees are. If I were an inspector general, I would \nfeel more independent with a two-thirds vote of a bipartisan panel, \nmeaning commission appointees, as opposed to one person. Our amendment \nassures IGs, if they are terminated, it will be in a public forum and \nnot the back room of the White House, if they are Presidentially \nappointed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4114 to Amendment No. 4072\n\n  (Purpose: To ban naked credit default swaps and for other purposes.)\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I send a second-degree amendment to the \ndesk to the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4114 to amendment No. 4072.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the second-degree amendment that I have \njust sent to the desk to the Grassley amendment is the amendment that \nthere has been an objection to my offering. So it is the only way, \napparently, I can offer the amendment. It is the amendment dealing with \nnaked credit default swaps.\n  We cannot possibly end this discussion without addressing the central \nissues that caused the near collapse of our economy, one of which is \nthe unbearable speculation, the speculation in exotic financial \ninstruments such as credit default swaps that, by the way, now is on \nthe rise. It is not receding, it is on the rise.\n  The fourth quarter of last year the credit default swaps were up by 8 \npercent, $14 trillion in notional value, up 8 percent in the fourth \nquarter of last year alone. I also feel very strongly that the issue of \ntoo big to fail is a real issue. We cannot just brush it away saying: I \nwish it was not an issue.\n  The too-big-to-fail companies have gotten bigger, much bigger. Well, \nthat is not a solution for this country's economy. The issue of betting \nin the lobby of our banks, as I have said, they might as well put in a \nKeno table or a blackjack table and wager that way. These are bets, not \ninvestments.\n  There are tens of trillions of dollars' worth of these bets. Because \nwe want to tighten the laces a little on this, this amendment would ban \nnaked credit default swaps over a period of time. Because we want to \ntighten the laces a bit, we have folks who object to even offering this \nbecause it would take on Wall Street. Well, you know what. That is what \nthis legislation is about. If we go back to 2008 when Wall Street \nlost--I think, $36 billion net loss--and they paid out bonuses of $17 \nor $18 billion. They were having a carnival.\n  What was it all about? It was about big fees, trading all of these \nunbelievably speculative instruments, things that we had never heard of \nbefore--and, by the way, instruments in which they had no insurable \ninterest. I said before you cannot buy fire insurance on someone else's \nhouse. You cannot buy life insurance on someone else's life. But what \nis happening is the biggest financial institutions in this country are \nbuying and selling credit default swaps, are selling insurance policies \nagainst bonds that they will never own and have never owned.\n  It is like buying things they will never get from people who never \nhad it and making fees on both sides of the transaction, except it is \nbuilding a pyramid of speculation. At some point that pyramid came down \nand nearly took the entire American economy with it. So we now do \nsomething called financial reform.\n  The central question is, are we going to do it right? Are we going to \nbe tough? Are we going to make sure we get rid of these things, the \nunbelievable speculation that injured this country's economy? There are \ntrillions of dollars of them out there. And, by the way, the five \nlargest commercial banks in this country hold 90 percent of the total \ncredit derivatives, the $13.2 trillion of credit derivatives. They are \nowned by the five largest commercial banks.\n  Somebody said: Well, you cannot ban these things. The banking \nindustry needs them. Oh, really? Well, if that is the case, why are \nonly five companies doing 90 percent of the business in what are called \nnaked credit default swaps?\n  I will speak about this at another time. I promised my colleague from \nMaine I would be a minute. I have gone well over the minute. But I will \nspeak about the second-degree amendment at much greater length. It is \nthe only way, apparently, I can offer an amendment.\n  So I believe that method, using a parliamentary technique that is \nperfectly legitimate, gives me an opportunity to force a vote on this \namendment at some point.\n  It is an amendment that should have been able to have been offered as \na result of an agreement on both sides to deal with real issues, in \nreal time, on one of the most significant challenges that confront our \ncountry: how to put this financial system back together again in which \nthe financial industry plays a very important role in the expansion of \nthis country, as opposed to building more and more and more speculation \nand seeing that too-big-to-fail institutions get builder and bigger and \nbigger.\n  I yield the floor, and I will come back and speak on the second-\ndegree at some point later.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3883\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise again to speak on the amendment \nthat is pending that I had offered last week, No. 3883, which I have \nintroduced with my good friend and colleague, Senator Pryor.\n  Our amendment would ensure fairness and regulatory transparency for \nsmall business in the financial regulatory reform measure that we are \nnow considering. This bipartisan amendment was also cosponsored by my \ncolleagues, Senator Graham, Senator Menendez, Senator Franken, Senator \nBond, Senator Burris and Senator Thune.\n  Our amendment would ensure that this newly created bureau in the \nbill, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, would, before it \npromulgates proposed rules, fully consider the economic effect that \nthose rules and regulations would impose on our Nation's approximately \n30 million small businesses that create 64 percent of all of the net \nnew jobs in America. That certainly has been the case over the last 15 \nyears, and they are the ones that we are depending on to lead us out of \nthis jobless recovery.\n  Our amendment would designate the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau as a ``covered agency'' under the Regulatory Flexibility Act--so \nthat small business review panels would apply to the Bureau's \nrulemaking process. Now, it is critically important to have these \nadvisory small panels that currently only apply to EPA and to OSHA. \nThey have been extremely successful in helping to shape more workable \nregulations at those agencies for small businesses to be much more \nattentive to the impact that these statutes are going to have on the \nwell-being of small businesses.\n  Since 1996, when these small business panel provisions were passed--\nunanimously, I might add, in the Senate as part of the Small Business \nRegulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA--and signed into law by \nthen-President Clinton, the EPA has convened 35 panels and OSHA has \nconvened 9 panels. The findings of these panel reports have helped EPA \nand OSHA improve their proposed rules by tailoring regulatory \napproaches and alternatives to the unique situations of small \nbusinesses. And that is very important.\n  As we look over the number of panels that have been convened over the \nlast 14 years, we have seen there have been rules regarding \ngroundwater, radon in drinking water, arsenic in drinking water, \ntuberculosis, ergonomics, and the list goes on and on. It has worked \nexceptionally well in this process for those agencies that obviously \ncould have a tremendous effect on small businesses by creating \nunintended consequences.\n  So is it not better to know potential small business effects at the \nforefront of the regulatory process, not afterwards, in which the small \nbusinesses are consumed not only with time but\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nenergy and money in order to fight the regulatory process once it has \ntaken effect?\n  So our amendment would specify very clearly the same process that has \napplied to EPA and OSHA for the last 14 years has been supported by the \nSenate unanimously when SBREFA was adopted; that the bureau must \nconsider the economic effect that these rules will have on the cost of \ncredit for small businesses. This is critical because, as we know, and \naccording to the National Federation of Independent of Business, NFIB, \nwhich is the largest voice for small business in this country, 42 \npercent of small business owners use a personal credit card for \nbusiness purposes.\n  So it is absolutely vital that small business interests are fully \nconsidered before the bureau issues regulations on consumer credit \ncards, so that however well intentioned those rules and regulations \nare, we want to make sure the bureau does not inadvertently cut off or \nsuspend vital small business credit sources, especially during these \nfragile economic times when, as a recent Federal Deposit Insurance \nCompany survey noted, banks posted their sharpest decline in lending \nsince 1942.\n  I want to add that there are some fundamental misconceptions about \nthe pending amendment. I would like to address them because I think it \nis critically important that we sort through the misperceptions and \nmischaracterizations and get to the truth of what this amendment is all \nabout.\n  First and foremost, this is a tried-and-true proposal. It has been \nthe law for the last 14 years for EPA and OSHA.\n  Some, including the Treasury Department, have argued that my \namendment would compromise the independence of the new bureau by \nholding it captive the very businesses it is set to regulate. This \nargument is flawed for many reasons. Given how many months--in most \ncases, years--it takes Federal agencies to promulgate new rules under \nthe notice and comment process, how does 60 days built into the process \nundermine key consumer protections the underlying legislation seeks to \nachieve? I really don't understand exactly what the Treasury Department \nis so concerned about, let alone afraid of.\n  If there are going to be adverse economic effects on small firms, our \nNation's primary job creators--at this key juncture when unemployment \nis at virtually 10 percent and 15 million Americans are unemployed, and \nwe are depending on small businesses to be the job generators--wouldn't \nwe want to know what effect any rules and regulations this bureau is \nabout to promulgate would have on small businesses? Why not know that \nahead of time, set up a small business review panel, which has been \ndone in so many instances in the past and worked effectively and \nsuccessfully, to ascertain exactly what might affect small businesses' \nwell-being so that we can address it at the forefront of the regulatory \nprocess and not afterward? That is what this is all about. Wouldn't we \nwant to know before an agency proposes a rule as opposed to afterward? \nThat is what we do with EPA as well as OSHA.\n  Secondly, it is the bureau itself--not SBA, not OMB or any other \nagency within government--that is overseeing the small business \nadvisory panel process as well as the report and recommendations. The \nbureau does this with the input of small business stakeholders that the \nbureau, in consultation with the independent SBA Office of Advocacy, \nchooses to include. So the bureau has flexibility in this process.\n  The bureau gets to choose what small businesses participate, what \ninformation it shares with the panel, and it overseas the process and \nthe writing of the report. I ask my colleagues again, how would the \nbureau be controlled by the regulating community, unless the bureau \nallows itself to be controlled?\n  I went back to look at the SBA Office of Advocacy to determine how \nthey view this process and how well it has worked. They said: \nInvariably, the participation of these panels provides extremely \nvaluable information on the real-world impacts and compliance costs of \nagency proposals.\n  The purpose of the panel process is threefold. This is from the \nindependent office within the Small Business Administration. The Office \nof Advocacy has authored their own independent assessment, separate and \napart from the SBA, to determine what works and what does not work. \nFirst, the panel process ensures that small entities that would be \naffected by a regulatory proposal are consulted about the pending \naction and offered an opportunity to provide information on its \npotential effects. Secondly, a panel can develop, consider, and \nrecommend less burdensome alternatives to a regulatory proposal when \nwarranted. Finally, the rulemaking agency has the benefit of input from \nboth real-world small entities and analysis prior to publication. \nWouldn't we want to know the real-world effect? Certainly, we would. We \ncan act theoretically when we pass legislation that becomes law, but \nultimately, how is it going to affect the real world? What is it going \nto do to small businesses on Main Street?\n  Now I am hearing from the Treasury Department that they simply don't \nwant to know the truth. It is too invasive. It is taking too much time. \nThey want to put all these regulations by this new bureau within the \nact, this Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that essentially \ncomprises more than 300 pages out of this 1,500-page bill, that is \nobviously going to have a host of rules and regulations. They are \nsaying: No, it is too invasive. We can't take that kind of time. It \nmight hold us up.\n  We are saying a 60-day process. It is a 60-day review process. This \npanel would be convened if the bureau itself determines that, yes, in \nfact, some of the rules they may propose will have an effect on small \nbusinesses. So then they convene a panel. They choose the particular \nstakeholders across the board within the agencies and with the small \nbusiness community. They convene for 60 days. Within 60 days, the \nbureau completes the report and submits it to the bureau. It contains \nrecommendations that are advisory, not mandatory. Then the bureau \nconsiders these recommendations as it proposes its rules and \nregulations. I think that is a pretty logical process. I can't \nunderstand why the Treasury Department would be so adamantly opposed to \nthis very logical, straightforward approach that has already been \nutilized time and again for EPA and OSHA. It is mystifying to me.\n  The attorneys at the Treasury Department say it could take 6 months \nto do these panels. Our amendment would adhere to the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act requirements that specify 60 days. How the bureau \nhandles that 60-day report is obviously up to them. There is list after \nlist of panels where these review panels have been used time and again \nunder OSHA and EPA. It has been very effective--understandably so. We \nwant to make sure these rules work.\n  Why wouldn't the Treasury Department want to know whether these rules \nand regulations will work for small businesses? Thirty million small \nbusinesses in this country generate two-thirds of all the net new jobs \neach year. We are surely depending on them to create the jobs in this \njobless recovery. I've said it before and I will say it agin: A jobless \nrecovery is not a true recovery. We need jobs. But we are saying: No, \nwe don't want to bother with this 60-day review panel. We don't want to \nbother with that because it could interfere with our process. We want \nto put everything on a fast track. We will figure out later whether it \nworks for small businesses.\n  That is unacceptable and objectionable. That is why there is so much \nanger and frustration across America. Go up and down Main Streets and \nsee what is happening to small businesses. Now we are saying, with this \nnew Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, that we don't want to take \nthe time to consider anything that would have an effect on small \nbusinesses. We will find out about it later. Let them pay the price of \nwhether they can survive. Let them pay the price as to whether they can \nafford these regulations, that it makes sense, that it is workable, or \nto fight the regulatory process.\n  Anybody been through that process? We know what it is all about. It \nis time-consuming, complex, and bureaucratic. It is simply unaffordable \nfor most small businesses. Ultimately, they will have to close their \ndoors or they will not hire or they are going to lay off people. That \nis what the net result of all this will be. Yet we have had a \ndemonstrable approach with this by\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\nvirtue of what has happened to EPA and OSHA.\n  According to the independent SBA Office of Advocacy report:\n\n     [t]he panel process does not replace, but enhances, the \n     regular notice-and-comment process.\n\n  The Office of Advocacy has also found that these small business \nreview panels have facilitated ``revisions or adjustments to be made to \nan agency draft rule that mitigated its potentially adverse effects on \nsmall entities, but did not compromise the rule's public policy \nobjective.''\n  It makes good sense that they would be able to consider less \nburdensome alternatives in the event this 60-day review process by a \nsmall business panel, which would be established and appointed by the \nbureau itself, would determine they would be more preferable than the \nones that originally were being considered.\n  I understand the majority intends to offer a side-by-side amendment \nthat astoundingly does not have the support of the small business \ncommunity. An abundance of organizations support this amendment offered \nby Senator Pryor and others, along with myself. We have more than 23 \norganizations that have supported this legislation.\n  Let's look at the alternative that may be offered. And I truly hope \nit isn't offered. As this chart reveals, the side-by-side my colleagues \nare proposing on behalf of the Treasury Department would be a diluted \nversion of the amendment I am offering.\n  My amendment with Senator Pryor would permit the small business voice \nto be heard before a rule is actually proposed. It certainly makes \nsense to know the consequences of any potential rules before they take \neffect, before they go through the rulemaking process.\n\n  The side-by-side that my colleagues may be offering includes a \nloophole under which the bureau could evade entirely its small business \npanel requirements, so the small business voice would never be heard if \ntheir amendment is adopted.\n  Mind you, the language in their amendment would take 90 days for the \nsmall business panel to make its report. My amendment would take 60 \ndays. Their process would take 90 days, and it would be a permanent \npanel. I am not asking for a permanent panel. I am saying that whenever \nthe bureau determines they will be proposing rules that would have a \nsignificant impact on a substantial number of small businesses, that \nthe Bureau convene a small business panel in which they would have to \ncomplete their work within 60 days, the bureau would submit their \nreport for consideration, and the bureau would have to consider the \nsmall business panel report as they develop their proposed rule, before \nthey promulgate it.\n  The difference between my amendment and the side-by-side that could \npotentially be offered is they create a permanent board and it is not \neven tied to rulemaking. They create a board that will meet four times \na year. Now it is a bureaucracy within a bureaucracy. That is \nessentially what it is all about. It would create a bureaucracy within \nthe bureau to meet four times a year for no particular purpose. Maybe \nthey could consider small business economic effects from a potential \nrulemaking but maybe not, under this amendment. It clearly doesn't make \nany sense. And then it is an additional cost to the taxpayers. And it \ndoesn't require, most importantly, the panel recommendations before the \nrules are actually proposed in the federal register. But even worse \nthan that, they are not even required to consider any of the panel's \nrecommendations, if they have any, before the final rule is issued. So \nthat is a fairly major loophole in their amendment.\n  So here we are. We have the amendment Senator Pryor and I have \noffered that would create a 60-day process that has been utilized time \nand again for the last 14 years and worked exceptionally well. They \nsubmit their proposal to the bureau. It is a panel established by the \nbureau. They can determine who will be represented in that panel. They \ncan consider the recommendations as they draft their rules for the \nrulemaking process, at the outset before a rule is proposed.\n  In this case, on the other hand, the amendment my colleagues intend \nto offer--I know it is the Senator from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu \ncontains a loophole under which the Bureau would never have to consider \nthe recommendations of the small business panel. They will meet four \ntimes a year for no particular purpose. It is not even tied to a \nrulemaking process.\n  I hope our amendment will be adopted. It really has already been \nestablished in precedent, in practice, not in theory. It is not \nconceptual; it is very real. Certainly, it will be real to small \nbusinesses in terms of whether it is going to have a major effect on \ntheir ability to conduct their business.\n  Our amendment builds on the current requirements under the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act. Since the Regulatory Flexibility Act was amended by \nthe Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, SBREFA, back in \n1996, to include these small business review panels, EPA has convened \n35 panels and OSHA has convened 9 panels. It has worked very well.\n  Our amendment will ensure transparency in the regulatory process \nbecause the small business panel reports would be included in those \nproposed rules. It will allow the voice of small businesses to be heard \nat the front end of a regulation, before the proposed regulation has \nbeen published in the Federal Register. In contrast, the side-by-side \namendment that potentially will be offered would expedite the bureau's \nrulemaking process and allow it to finalize onerous regulations that \ncould crush small businesses without considering first the small \nbusiness effects either during the proposed or the final rule stage of \nthe regulatory process.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the side-by-side amendment. It would \nestablish a dangerous precedent of diluting not only current law in the \nway it now functions with respect to EPA and OSHA but also how it has \nbeen extremely successful. My amendment is an extension of current law \nas it applied to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n  As you will see on the next chart, we have strong support from a \nbroad cross section of 23 stakeholders, representing millions and \nmillions of small businesses across the spectrum--of course, the \nNational Federation of Independent Business, known as NFIB; the \nAssociated Building and Contractors; the National Restaurant \nAssociation; the National Lumber and Building Material Dealers \nAssociation; S Corporation Association; the U.S. Chamber of Commerce; \nthe United States Black Chamber; the United States Hispanic Chamber of \nCommerce; Women Impacting Public Policy; the International Franchise \nAssociation, the Independent Electrical Contractors; the Hispanic \nLeadership Fund.\n  The list goes on, and rightfully so, because they understand what is \nat stake. They understand the effects it will have on small business. \nWe want to make sure we have a very practical, real process that is \ngoing to work for small businesses.\n  I hope we are not going to disregard the invaluable voices of small \nbusinesses to have the ability to have input at the forefront of the \nregulatory process, and utilizing a process that has worked so well. I \nhope we would reject any other watered-down, side-by-side amendment \nbecause, as I have already pointed out, it has a number of weaknesses \nand a loophole. It establishes a permanent panel for no apparent reason \nand that is not necessarily tied to the rulemaking. But more critical \nis the fact that, under the side-by-side amendment, the Bureau can \ntotally ignore and disregard the input. Even if they created one of \nthese panels for a rule-making process, they do not have to consider \nit, either before the proposed rule is published or before the final \nrule is promulgated in the Federal Register.\n  Something does not make sense. The bottom line is, the side-by-side \namendment would be a job killer for small business. So if we are \ntalking about jobs, jobs, jobs--and I hope we are going to get to a \nsmall business tax relief bill. I have been hoping since January we are \ngoing to get to it because it is so critically important. I know there \nare a lot of things to consider here on the floor of the Senate, but \nprimary of which should be about creating jobs. So while we are saying \nwe want to create jobs on the one hand, and we are concerned about \nsmall businesses' economic well-being on the other hand, we\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nare doing things that are going to undermine the status of small \nbusinesses in America, as they are struggling to survive. They are \nstruggling to survive. We know that. We have had an abundance of \nhearings in the Small Business Committee. As ranking member of the \nSmall Business Committee, I can tell you, we hear it time and again \nrepeatedly. They are desperate. They need our support. We cannot hinder \ntheir ability to survive in this very tough, unprecedented environment.\n  So if we are depending on them to create jobs, then I think we better \nthink very seriously about whether to support my amendment. I hope it \nwould not be rejected. I hope it will be supported. There is no reason, \nthere is no rationale, there is no logical explanation as to why the \nTreasury Department--of all the Departments, frankly, we are here \nbecause the Treasury Department did not provide the necessary and \neffective oversight of financial institutions--we are dealing with a \nfinancial regulatory reform bill, so I cannot imagine rejecting \nsomething that has been tried before and has worked so effectively.\n  That is what I am asking, that we would allow my amendment to be \nadopted. Because, as you can see, this amendment is supported \noverwhelmingly by critical small business organizations, because they \nunderstand the reality. They understand the net effect of what is going \nto happen. They need this support. This is not a minimalist amendment. \nIt has real consequences, if we fail to adopt it. That is the fact. \nThat is reality that small businesses are facing all across America.\n  So when we are creating this new entity, this Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau, that literally consumes hundreds of pages in the \npending legislation, are we not saying we want to make sure, when they \nare drafting those rules, we are going to consider how it will affect \nsmall businesses on a day-to-day basis? Because that is what they are \ngoing to live with.\n  By the way, I think we all know who pays more for regulatory \ncompliance. It is not the large corporations. It is the small business.\n  In the past, we think about Sarbanes-Oxley. I know there is an \namendment that has been filed that has been offered by the Senator from \nTexas and the Senator from Louisiana that will ``spare,'' as it says in \nthis Wall Street Journal editorial, ``the smallest public companies \nfrom the worst bureaucratic horrors of the 2002 Sarbanes-Oxley law.'' \nThey said:\n\n       This is one reason the two Senators aim to exempt companies \n     with less than $150 million of shares held by the public from \n     ``internal-controls'' audits.\n\n  Because of the indirect costs, as well as the direct costs, they said \nthat:\n\n       [T]he average public company pays more than $2 million per \n     year complying with the law's Section 404. The indirect costs \n     may be much greater . . .\n\n  The indirect costs are even greater from Sarbanes-Oxley. Small firms \npay 45 percent more in regulatory compliance costs than larger firms, \naccording to the Office of Advocacy within the Small Business \nAdministration.\n  That is the point. So on one hand, we are saying: Well, in financial \nregulatory reform, we should exempt small public companies because of \nthe bureaucratic hindrance that Sarbanes-Oxley has provided. So there \nis another example of what the effects are, the unintended \nconsequences, when rules have a disproportionate effect on small \nbusinesses. That is what has happened in that instance.\n  So these are legitimate and valid issues based on reality, based on \nthe experiences of small businesses, what they have had to already \nendure. So why compel them to have to further endure another regulatory \nnightmare and quagmire that might ensue as a result of this bureau? We \nare asking to take an intermediate step: 60 days. Somebody is saying 60 \ndays is too much time to give consideration to the well-being of small \nbusinesses in America?\n  Well, we are offering amendments that say: Gee, we ought to exempt \nthe smallest companies because of what occurred under Sarbanes-Oxley, \nwhat it has done with the unintentional effects. We all know the \nadverse consequences that can emanate and result from legislation that \nbecomes law. So let's be attentive and sensitive to those issues at the \nforefront of this process. That is what this amendment is all about. I \nwould hope there would be strong support for my amendment because there \ntruly is overwhelming support from all of these organizations and more \nthat are represented on these charts.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a list of \norganizations in support of my amendment, as well as a number of \nletters that have been sent from small business organizations declaring \nthat it is an imperative that this amendment be accepted because of the \nconcern, the abiding concern, of the small businesses community across \nthis country that they are going to suffocate under this rule-making \nprocess if they do not have a voice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Organizations in Support\n\n       Associated Builders and Contractors; Association of \n     Kentucky Fried Chicken Franchisees; Hearth, Patio & Barbecue \n     Association; Hispanic Leadership Fund; Independent Electrical \n     Contractors; Institute for Liberty; International Franchise \n     Association; National Association for the Self-Employed; \n     National Federation of Independent Business, which is ``key-\n     voting'' in support of our amendment and opposing the \n     majority's side-by-side; National Lumber and Building \n     Material Dealers Association; National Restaurant \n     Association; National Roofing Contractors Association; \n     National Small Business Association; Printing Industries of \n     America; S Corporation Association; Small Business & \n     Entrepreneurship Council; Society of American Florists; \n     Society of Chemical Manufacturers & Affiliates; Tire Industry \n     Association; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; United States Black \n     Chamber; United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; and \n     Women Impacting Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 12, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Chris Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban Affairs, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing & Urban \n         Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader, Minority Leader, Chairman Dodd, and \n     Ranking Member Shelby: The undersigned organizations \n     representing millions of American small business owners are \n     writing to urge that the Senate consider the Small Business \n     Fairness and Regulatory Transparency Amendment (S. Amdt. \n     3883) sponsored by Senator Pryor and Senator Snowe as part of \n     the Senate's deliberations on S. 3217, Restoring American \n     Financial Stability Act of 2010.\n       As you know, new jobs primarily come from the small \n     business sector of our economy. Small business has created \n     about two of every three net new jobs in the United States \n     since at least the early 1970s. And nearly all job creation \n     since 1980 has occurred in firms less than five years old. In \n     fact, data from the 1990's show small business are the only \n     sector producing jobs coming out of a recession. The \n     amendment offered by Senators Pryor and Snowe is an effort to \n     prevent unintended consequences by a new agency that could \n     harm the small business sector.\n       According to the U.S. Small Business Administration, small \n     firms shoulder a 45 percent higher burden to comply with \n     federal regulations than their larger business competitors. \n     This economic distortion can be eased when agencies carefully \n     consider how their regulations will impact small firms, which \n     is why delegates to the 1995 White House Conference on Small \n     Business called for direct small business participation in \n     the rulemaking process. That recommendation from the White \n     House Conference was a key provision in the Small Business \n     Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA), signed by \n     President Clinton in 1996. The amendment offered by Senators \n     Pryor and Snowe applies the same standards of transparency \n     and small business consultation found in SBREFA to the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (hereinafter referred to \n     as the ``Bureau'').\n       Additionally, S. Amdt. 3883 calls upon the Bureau to \n     consider how its rules will impact small business access to \n     credit. Almost 90 percent of the nation's 26 million small \n     businesses use some form of credit. And, economists have \n     raised concerns that actions by the Bureau will tighten the \n     credit squeeze, raising interest rates and curbing job \n     growth. The amendment offered by Senators Pryor and Snowe \n     provides assurance that small business access to credit is a \n     top consideration by Bureau officials as they take on the \n     important task of overseeing our financial sector.\n       Small business is a critically important sector. America \n     needs their job creation strength to bring down unemployment \n     and their innovative strength in a global marketplace. We \n     know you share our desire to take every step necessary to \n     protect Main Street while you are trying to fix the practices \n     on\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\n     Wall Street and we urge you to include S. Amdt. 3883, the \n     Small Business Fairness and Regulatory Transparency \n     amendment, as part of the Senate's debate on S. 3217. Once \n     the amendment is under consideration, we urge your support \n     for its passage.\n         Associated Builders and Contractors; Association of \n           Kentucky Fried Chicken Franchisees; Hearth, Patio & \n           Barbecue Association; Hispanic Leadership Fund; \n           Independent Electrical Contractors; Institute for \n           Liberty; International Franchise Association; National \n           Association for the Self-Employed; National Federation \n           of Independent Business; National Lumber and Building \n           Material Dealers Association; National Restaurant \n           Association; National Roofing Contractors Association; \n           National Small Business Association; Printing \n           Industries of America; S Corporation Association; Small \n           Business & Entrepreneurship Council; Society of \n           American Florists; Society of Chemical Manufacturers & \n           Affiliates; Tire Industry Association; U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce; United States Black Chamber, Inc.; United \n           States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce; Women Impacting \n           Public Policy.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Small Business\n\n\n                                                  Association,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Christopher J. Dodd,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Dodd: The National Small Business Association \n     (NSBA) is urging you to support the Ensuring Small Business \n     Fairness and Regulatory Transparency Amendment (S. Amdt. \n     3883)--or the Snowe/Pryor amendment--to the Restoring \n     American Financial Stability Act (S. 3217). This critical \n     amendment, supported by a very broad, bipartisan group of \n     Senators, will ensure that the Consumer Financial Protection \n     Bureau considers how its rulemakings affect America's small \n     businesses. Reaching 150,000 small firms across the nation, \n     NSBA is the country's oldest small-business advocacy \n     organization.\n       As the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau likely is to be \n     established as an independent agency with rulemaking \n     authority, it should be required to consider the unique needs \n     and constraints of small firms as it promulgates its rules.\n       NSBA strongly supports requiring the Bureau to conduct \n     Regulatory Flexibility Analyses in conjunction with its \n     rulemaking. It is critical that the Bureau provide the public \n     with transparent information on how its proposed rules would \n     affect small firms. NSBA also supports requiring the Bureau \n     to consult with a Small Business Advocacy Review Panel prior \n     to the publication of any proposed rule, with the Review \n     Panel's recommendations published in any eventual proposal.\n       Small businesses bear a disproportionate burden of federal \n     regulations. In fact, the smallest firms--those with fewer \n     than 20 employees spend 45 percent more per employee than \n     larger firms to comply with federal regulations. \n     Incorporating the Snowe/Pryor amendment in S. 3217 will take \n     the important steps toward alleviating this gross inequity.\n       Increased transparency is a stated goal of the current \n     administration and Congress. This is a perfect opportunity to \n     achieve progress towards that objective. This amendment will \n     ensure a public exchange of data, analysis, and \n     recommendations, detailing the potential benefits and costs \n     to small businesses of any proposed regulations. This is a \n     welcome achievement.\n       I urge you to consider the many pitfalls caused by the \n     absence of such language in other sweeping pieces of \n     legislation, namely Sarbanes/Oxley, which has constituted a \n     major burden for America's small businesses. On behalf of the \n     many struggling small businesses in the U.S. today, I am \n     calling upon you to do everything in your power to prevent \n     any roadblocks for future entrepreneurs, and urge your \n     support of the Snowe/Pryor amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Todd O. McCracken,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     U.S. Black Chamber, Inc.,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2010.\n       The US Black Chamber, Inc. represents over 30% of all the \n     Black owned business nationwide. We have united to ensure \n     that our voice is heard. Black business owners are a strong \n     economic force in the United States, and increasingly \n     throughout the world. Their contributions extend beyond the \n     number of firms they own, the people they employ and the \n     revenues they generate. Their economic influence is \n     multiplied many times through the direct and indirect \n     economic impact they generate through their business \n     ownership.\n       We are writing you to urge that the Senate consider the \n     Small Business Fairness and Regulatory Transparency Amendment \n     (S. Amdt. 3883). Small business develop the majority of the \n     jobs that have been created in the United States. The \n     recession has shown that small businesses are in fact the \n     only sector that is creating new jobs.\n       S. Amdt. 3883 calls upon the Bureau to consider how its \n     rules will impact small business access to credit. Black-\n     owned firms are less likely to receive loans than non-white \n     firms (23% of non-minority firms receive loans compared to \n     17% of minority firms.) Black owned firms receive lower loan \n     amounts than white firms. Black-owned firms are more likely \n     to be denied loans (42% denial rate for Black and 16% denial \n     rate for whites). We feel actions by the Bureau will tighten \n     the credit squeeze, raise interest and slow job growth.\n       S. Amdt. 3883 provides assurance that our members and small \n     business access to credit is a top consideration. We urge \n     your support for its passage.\n       Thank you, and we look forward to working together with you \n     and our membership, to bring this plan into reality.\n           In the Spirit of Success,\n                                                        Ron Busby,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nDelaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am on the floor here incredibly \ndisappointed by the decision by my friends across the aisle to block a \nvote on the Merkley-Levin Volcker rule amendment and the Dorgan \namendment to ban naked credit default swaps.\n  We have had good comity on this bill. I think both sides have taken \namendments for a vote they did not like based on how the vote turned \nout, where you have votes where a majority of the Republicans voted for \nan amendment they put forward and a majority of the Democrats voted \nagainst it or a vast majority of Democrats voted against it, but we \nallowed it to come to a vote.\n  I think we are getting late in the processing of the bill. It would \nhave been nice if we could have gone through the whole process the way \nwe started and the way we were in the middle and allowed these \nimportant issues to come up, especially issues as important as this \none.\n  I want to praise Chairman Dodd--and I mean it--for an incredible \npiece of work and all my colleagues who have worked diligently on this \nbill. It has been incredible in holding this together. There are many \nprovisions in this bill I strongly support.\n  However, there is one portion of the bill that many of my colleagues \nand I have discussed on the floor extensively, and that is the question \nof how we prevent systemic risks from manifesting themselves among our \nlargest Wall Street banks--those that have been deemed too big, too \nbig, too big to fail due to their tendency to engage in highly \nleveraged and extremely risky speculative trading activities.\n  As my colleagues know, Senator Brown and I, along with others, \noffered an amendment to tackle this problem directly and preemptively. \nThe Brown-Kaufman amendment would have scaled down the size and risk of \nour megabanks through limits on leverage and on unstable nondeposit \nliabilities. While I am disappointed the amendment did not pass, I know \nthe debate will persist as long as too-big-to-fail banks continue to \nexist. For as long as we still have banks so large they are too big to \nfail, they will pose mortal risks--mortal risks--to the American \neconomy.\n  Within days of the Senate's consideration of Brown-Kaufman, we saw \nthe EU and IMF scramble to put together an almost $1 trillion emergency \npackage to forestall a full-blown series of sovereign debt crises \nthroughout the continent. While ostensibly reported in the press as a \nrescue package for overleveraged and embattled sovereign nations such \nas Greece and Spain, it was actually a bailout of Europe's megabanks, \nnot to mention our own. That is what it was about. It was about bailing \nout Europe's megabanks. German and French banks alone have more than \n$900 billion in exposure to Greece and other vulnerable Euro countries, \nincluding Ireland, Portugal, and Spain.\n  Meanwhile, our top five banks have an estimated $2.5 trillion in \nexposure to Europe. That is $2.5 trillion in exposure to Europe.\n  So long as we have too-big-to-fail institutions, we will continue to \ngo through the ``doomsday'' cycles of booms, busts, and bailouts. There \nare two amendments left that address this critical question directly, \ntwo others that would help. I believe at least one of the two \nrepresents a critical test of whether we as a body are serious about \ncurbing systemic risk. While I would prefer we pass the Cantwell-McCain\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\namendment, which would restore the Glass-Steagall Act's 60-years-long \nseparation between commercial and investment banking activities--which \nI have spoken on the floor many times about--I believe very strongly \nthat, at a minimum, we must pass the Merkley-Levin amendment that would \nban proprietary trading activities by commercial banks.\n  This is not a radical amendment. After all, it is President Obama's \nproposal, which he has named the Volcker rule, after the most respected \nbank regulator in the last half century, former Federal Reserve \nChairman Paul Volcker. It has been represented to us for many weeks \nthat even the current version of the bill includes a mandatory \nimposition of the Volcker rule after a 6-month study. The Merkley-Levin \namendment would remove any doubt about whether the new council could, \nafter its review, recommend modifications to the rule.\n  Merkley-Levin, in my view, is where the rubber hits the road. It is a \ntrue test of whether the administration and the Congress are serious \nabout imposing limitations on the activities of the government-\nguaranteed part of our financial system--in short, so that casino-like \nactivities can no longer remain centered at the heart of too-big-to-\nfail institutions.\n  I also believe that a strong financial reform bill must retain the \nkey provisions on too big to fail that are already in the bill, \nparticularly Senator Lincoln's provision to prohibit banks with swap \ndealers from receiving emergency Federal loans, and an amendment to the \nbill, Senator Dorgan's amendment, which bans naked credit default \nswaps.\n  As I said, I am proud to support Senator Merkley's and Senator \nLevin's amendment to include a more robust version of the Volcker rule \nban on proprietary trading within commercial banks in the bill.\n  Specifically, the amendment would bar banks and their affiliates from \nengaging in proprietary trading and from owning a hedge fund or private \nequity fund. To avoid regulatory arbitrage, it would also increase \ncapital requirements on large nonbank financial institutions engaged in \nproprietary trading.\n  The Merkley-Levin amendment would minimize the potential procedural \nroadblocks to the Volcker rule contained in the current bill by \nspecifically directing the regulators to develop rules to implement the \nVolcker rule restrictions. It would not give unnecessary discretion to \nthe same regulators who have long had the authority to prohibit \nspeculative activities at banks but never opted to do so.\n  I have heard some proposals call for so-called de minimis exceptions \nand other loopholes to a ban on proprietary trading at banks. Loopholes \nof this kind, however, undermine the very spirit of the Volcker rule \nand would allow banks that benefit from federally insured deposits and \naccess to the Fed window to continue to engage in activities that are \nspeculative in nature. Importantly, this amendment would also build \nupon the work of Senator Levin's Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations to address conflicts of interest within the modern \ninvestment banking model. The PSI subcommittee hearings, in which I had \nthe privilege to participate, demonstrated how Wall Street firms sold \nclients securities without disclosing their financial interests in \nseeing such securities fail or perform poorly--basically betting \nagainst the very securities they were selling to their clients. Talk \nabout a conflict of interest. This amendment would address this problem \nby prohibiting underwriters of an asset-backed security from engaging \nin transactions that create material conflicts of interest with respect \nto the securities being sold--something I think everyone, on \nobservation, agrees should be the case.\n\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support Merkley-Levin so we can say \nto the American people we have acted in Congress to prevent another \ncrisis. I do not want to put my faith in a stability council of \nregulators detecting ``early warning signals'' of financial \ninstability. I would rather we move our largest banks off of the San \nAndreas Fault of leverage and speculation on which they now sit.\n  I also support strongly Senators Cantwell's and McCain's amendment to \nbreak up the largest banks by reimposing the Glass-Steagall Act. Unless \nwe break the megabanks apart, they will remain too large and \ninterconnected for regulators effectively to control. Once the next \ninevitable financial crisis occurs and the contagion spreads too \nquickly for the government to believe that a failing firm won't take \ndown others as well, the American taxpayer--the good old American \ntaxpayer--will again be forced into the breach.\n  By statutorily splitting apart massive financial institutions that \nhouse both banking and security operations, we will both cut our \nmegabanks down to reasonable and manageable sizes and rightfully limit \ngovernment support to traditional banks. This worked for nearly 60 \nyears and once again will ensure the soundness of commercial banks \nwhile placing risky bank investment activities far beyond any \ngovernment safety net check.\n  If Congress fails to impose needed structural changes like Glass-\nSteagall, the same systemic risks to our financial system remain and \ngrow bigger and bigger and bigger. When the next crisis occurs, \nhowever, the legislative pendulum will suddenly shift direction and \nwill fall hard on Wall Street in the form of Glass-Steagall and far \nmore Draconian reforms.\n  I also believe we must preserve section 716 of the current Senate \nbill. The provision included in the bill by Senate Agriculture \nCommittee Chairman Lincoln would prohibit banks with swap dealers from \nreceiving emergency assistance from the Federal Reserve or FDIC. By \nforcing megabanks to spin off their swap dealers into an affiliate or \nseparate company, this section would help restore the wall between the \ngovernment-guaranteed part of the financial system and those financial \nentities that remain free to take on greater risk.\n  It would also help address the enormous concentration of power among \na few too-big-to-fail institutions. As has been quoted many times on \nthis Senate floor over the last several weeks, the five largest banks--\nGoldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of \nAmerica--control over 90 percent of the over-the-counter derivatives \nmarket. That is nine zero, 90 percent, our 5 largest banks. Yet there \nare those who say that forcing these megabanks to spin off their swap \ndealers to affiliates in only a few years' time would disrupt the \nderivatives market. The historical record shows repeatedly that \nfinancial institutions can adapt to regulatory changes quite quickly. \nLook at Goldman Sachs. Goldman Sachs has been a bank holding company \nfor fewer than 2 years. Within that time, it has used its newly formed \nbank, which is just one-tenth the size of the overall holding company, \nto source the vast majority of its derivatives transactions. That is \njust in the last 2 years. Amazingly, Goldman Sachs has a $41 trillion \nderivatives book attached to a $91 billion bank. Do you have that? A \n$91 billion bank with a $41 trillion derivatives book attached to it.\n  Unfortunately, allowing massive derivatives dealers to be housed \nwithin banks creates moral hazard, a term often invoked by my \nconservative colleagues. This was true of AIG, which rented out its AAA \nrating and the financial strength of its insurance subsidiaries, to \nwrite credit default swap contracts that systemically underpriced risk. \nIt is also true of dealer banks whose access to federally insured \ndeposits and the government backstop of emergency lending allows them \nto underprice risk on swap contracts. Notably, this government subsidy \nallows these institutions to be lax in their collateral and margin \nrequirements on derivatives transactions.\n  Some complain that requiring the megabanks to spin off their \nderivatives dealers would require these dealers to raise extra capital \nas affiliates. I say that is precisely the point. Housing a large \nderivatives dealer book in a bank, even a small one, allows these \ninstitutions to arbitrage capital requirements. Requiring them to spin \noff their dealer to a separate broker-dealer affiliate would \nappropriately require them to raise more capital based upon the \nriskiness of their derivatives book. This is good. Currently, these \ninstitutions are undercapitalized.\n  Yet Fed Chairman Bernanke claims:\n\n       Forcing these activities out of insured depository \n     institutions would weaken both financial stability and strong \n     prudential regulation derivative activities.\n\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\n\n  I beg to differ. Spinning off large derivatives dealers would force \nthese institutions to adequately price and capitalize the risks \nassociated with these activities. By ending the aforementioned moral \nhazard, we are only strengthening financial institutions. By requiring \nderivative dealers to hold capital commensurate with the risk of their \nbusiness, we are only strengthening prudential regulation.\n  Meanwhile, FDIC Chair Bair states that derivatives:\n\n       do have legitimate and important functions as risk \n     management tools and ensure banks play an essential role in \n     providing market-making functions for these products.\n\n  Requiring banks to spin off their derivatives, however, would not \npreclude them from using derivatives as risk management tools or as \nproducts to service client needs. For example, if a client wanted to \nhedge the interest rate risk on a floating loan through a swap, the \nbank would still be able to execute that transaction. Senator Lincoln's \nprovision doesn't ban banks from using derivatives. Instead, it says \nthat it is inappropriate for a commercial bank to have an almost $80 \ntrillion derivatives book, as some do.\n  Of course, anyone can come up with a reason for maintaining the \nstatus quo--of saying, for example, that Senator Lincoln's inspired \nsolution simply goes too far. But after the crisis we just suffered, I \nwould ask my colleagues to support these proposals which represent real \nreform and change. I would ask my colleagues to see the wisdom of \nbuilding an enduring structure of laws instead of investing our hopes \nin unelected regulatory discretion. We have seen the effects of \nregulators neglecting their duties and banks left to self-regulation.\n  Instead of trusting our financial stability solely to unelected \nfinancial guardians, these amendments and provisions would all address \npreemptively the persistent problem of too big to fail. They all say \nspeculative securities activity should not be covered by the \ngovernment's deposit safety net. By reducing the size and scope of our \nlargest banks, we will limit their risky behavior and minimize the \npossibility of one institution's failure causing an industrywide panic \nand a subsequent bailout of several failing megabanks.\n  By adopting these commonsense proposals, we can go a long way toward \nstabilizing our economy, restoring confidence in our market, and \nprotecting the American people from a future bailout. America cannot \nafford another financial meltdown. The American people are looking to \nCongress to assure that it does not happen. We have a precious few \nremaining days on this bill to follow through on that commitment.\n  As I started out, I wish to commend Chairman Dodd and the committee \nfor the excellent work they have done on this bill. I also commend \nChairman Dodd for the fact that we have had such good comity and such \ngood relations between both sides of the aisle on this bill. That is \nwhy I am so concerned about the decision by the other side to block the \nMerkley-Levin amendment. This is at the heart of this bill. If you had \nto look at one of the things that is very important and that everyone \ncommends, it would be this amendment. We have voted for a lot of \nRepublican amendments and accepted a lot of Republican amendments that \nDemocrats were not in favor of. This seems like the wrong time in the \nprocess toward the end to do this.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will rethink what we \nare doing and that we get a chance to vote, because it is absolutely \nessential to this bill that we have a vote on the Merkley-Levin \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n     Amendment No. 3892, as Further Modified, to Amendment No. 3739\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I have an amendment No. 3892, as \nmodified, and I ask unanimous consent to further modify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The amendment is further \nmodified.\n  The amendment, as further modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 565, between lines 2 and 3, insert the following:\n       (e) Just and Reasonable Rates.--Section 2(a)(1)(C) of the \n     Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 2(a)(1)(C)) (as amended by \n     section 717(a)) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(vi) Notwithstanding the exclusive jurisdiction of the \n     Commission with respect to accounts, agreements, and \n     transactions involving swaps or contracts of sale of a \n     commodity for future delivery under this Act, no provision of \n     this Act shall be construed--\n\n       ``(I) to supersede or limit the authority of the Federal \n     Energy Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 791a et seq.) or the Natural Gas Act (15 U.S.C. 717 et \n     seq.);\n       ``(II) to restrict the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission \n     from carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the \n     Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to ensure just and \n     reasonable rates and protect the public interest under the \n     Acts described in subclause (I); or\n       ``(III) to supersede or limit the authority of a State \n     regulatory authority (as defined in section 3(21) of the \n     Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 796(21)) that has jurisdiction \n     to regulate rates and charges for the sale of electric energy \n     within the State, or restrict that State regulatory authority \n     from carrying out the duties and responsibilities of the \n     State regulatory authority pursuant to the jurisdiction of \n     the State regulatory authority to regulate rates and charges \n     for the transmission or sale of electric energy.\n\n       ``(vii) Nothing in clause (vi) shall affect the \n     Commission's authority with respect to the trading, \n     execution, or clearing of any agreement, contract, or \n     transaction on or subject to the rules of a registered \n     entity, including a designated contract market, derivatives \n     clearing organization, or swaps execution facility.''.\n       (f) Public Interest Waiver.--Section 4(c) of the Commodity \n     Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 6(c)) (as amended by section 721(d)) \n     is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(6) If the Commission determines that the exemption would \n     be consistent with the public interest and the purposes of \n     this Act, the Commission shall, in accordance with paragraphs \n     (1) and (2), exempt from the requirements of this Act an \n     agreement, contract, or transaction that is entered into--\n       ``(A) pursuant to a tariff or rate schedule approved or \n     permitted to take effect by the Federal Energy Regulatory \n     Commission;\n       ``(B) pursuant to a tariff or rate schedule establishing \n     rates or charges for, or protocols governing, the sale of \n     electric energy approved or permitted to take effect by the \n     regulatory authority of the State or municipality having \n     jurisdiction to regulate rates and charges for the sale of \n     electric energy within the State or municipality; or\n       ``(C) between entities described in section 201(f) of the \n     Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 824(f)).''.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the further modification clarifies that \neach agency--that is, the FERC and the CFTC--will retain its legitimate \nauthority, whether to review derivatives or to review rates and charges \nand prevent manipulation, without one agency knocking the other agency \nout of the box of its respective mission. It is a good improvement.\n  I believe this amendment is now without substantial objection. I ask \nthat we proceed to a voice vote on the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate on the \namendment, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 3892), as further modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and I move to \nlay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, our colleague from North Dakota is going to \nspeak over the next several minutes. At the conclusion of that, I will \nmake some remarks, and then there will be a tabling motion of the \nDorgan amendment. To make colleagues aware, that is what will happen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have spoken on this amendment previously \nand have waited patiently for several weeks to be able to have an \nopportunity to vote on it. We have not been able to get it pending. I \nnow have it pending because I offered it as a second-degree amendment \nto the Grassley amendment.\n  This is an amendment that would ban the use of naked credit default \nswaps. You ask, how does a credit default swap get naked? It is an \nexotic, new financial instrument that has been developed over recent \nyears to be traded back and forth by the big financial\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\ninstitutions. In fact, 90 percent of them are traded by the five \nbiggest financial institutions. When people say you need these--banks \nneed these--just a handful of banks trade most of these.\n  What is a naked credit default swap? It means someone is buying \ninsurance against some other instrument that they have no interest in, \nexcept they want to make a wager. I have said before that I can't buy \nfire insurance on the house that the Presiding Officer owns in \nColorado. Why? Because I don't have an insurable interest in that \nhouse. If I went to somebody and said: I would like to buy some \ninsurance against fire for that house, they would say: You don't own \nthat house, so I cannot possibly sell you that policy. Also, I cannot \nbuy a life insurance policy against my colleague from Connecticut \nbecause I don't have an insurable interest either.\n  But I can go buy $100 million worth of insurance, right this second, \non a bond issue that was issued by some company yesterday, even though \nI never, ever intend to own the bond, have no interest in the bond, and \ndon't know much about the company. I just want to bet someone who will \ntake the opposite side of the wager. I believe the bonds will not be \nrepaid, and the counterparty says: No, you are wrong about that. I \nthink that company will repay its bonds. So we make a friendly wager--\nkind of like one of those Saturday sports wagers. We bet. I am betting \nthis person about the question of whether the bonds will default. It is \ncalled synthetic when it is not real or naked when it has no interest. \nSo this would be a synthetic or a naked credit default swap.\n  It is a different story if I have an interest, where I actually \nbought those bonds--some company let the bonds and I bought them, so I \nam the investor in the bonds. But I want to make sure the default \ndoesn't take me down with it, so I buy an insurance policy. That is a \ncredit default swap that is covered. Naked means you have no interest, \njust a bet. Covered means it is an investment you made to try to hedge \nyour risk on the default of the bonds.\n  Here is what is interesting. We expect, based on what we know to be \nthe case, that about 80 percent of all credit default swaps are not \ncovered or what are called naked swaps--80 percent. Some people say to \nus: Well, we can't get rid of these financial instruments. These are \nvery important for normal hedging. That is absolutely absurd, total \nrubbish.\n  My amendment would say that at some point we have to ban naked credit \ndefault swaps. Mr. Pearlstein, who writes for the Washington Post, \nasked the question many months ago:\n\n       Why should there be more insurance policies sold on a bond \n     issue than there are bonds to be insured?\n\n  Why should you have 20 times more insurance policies than you do \nbonds? Because it is wagering, not investing.\n  I find myself fairly disappointed by what is happening. This is a \nmoment of substantial consequence for our country. We came very close, \nthey say, to a meltdown of our economy. Trillions of dollars were lost. \nI guess there was about $14 trillion or $15 trillion in lost value for \nthe American people. Millions of people lost their jobs. Millions of \npeople have lost their homes. By the way, at graduation time, when \ncolleges all across the country are graduating these bright, young men \nand women who have now gotten their college diploma--they are out \nlooking for work, and way too many of them cannot find a job because of \nwhat happened to this economy in recent years.\n  What happened? We created a casino economy. You didn't have to read \nthe newspapers very much to understand what was going on. This \nunbelievable speculation, a bubble of speculation, occurred in \nvirtually every single area, and there were new financial products on \nsteroids--securitizing everything. Are you loaning somebody some money? \nWell, put it into a security, wrap it up and sell it to a hedge fund or \nan investment bank. Securitize everything. By the way, you can get some \nvery bad stuff that is rated AAA. So sell it up. By the way, once you \nstart selling things, you don't ever have to worry about whom you are \nissuing credit cards to or that you are wallpapering the room of people \nwho don't have jobs with more credit cards. You don't have to do normal \nunderwriting or sit across from somebody who wants to buy a house and \nlook into their eyes and say: Tell us your income. How are you going to \nrepay the loan if we loan you the money? You can put out liars' loans, \nno-doc loans. Don't document your income because we don't care. Don't \npay any interest or principal now; we will put that on the back side. \nWe will make the first 12 months of payments for you. If you have no \ncredit or low credit, come to us--I will show you the advertisements \nthat were on the radio, television, and newspapers: Slow credit, no \ncredit, bad credit? We want to loan you money.\n  They said: Let's securitize it and we will ship it upstream and we \nwill all make big profits and fees and we will create credit default \nswaps and CDOs and we will all have a great time. When the whole thing \ncrashes down, ``Wall Street'' will have lost about $36 billion in 1 \nyear and paid $17 billion in bonuses at the very same time.\n  Do you think this wasn't a carnival of greed? Of course it was. There \nare a number of things we ought to do and too many that we will not do \nin this legislation. Too big to fail ought to have meant to all of us \nthat you are simply too big. By the way, those who were judged too big \nto fail and would cause a grave risk to this entire economy if that \nfirm should fail, they have now become much larger by the actions of \nthe Federal Government arranging marriages of companies that weren't \nmaking it. So the too-big-to-fail companies are actually much larger \nnow, and the underlying legislation doesn't do a thing about too big to \nfail in terms of paring it away and deciding if you are too big to \nfail, you are too big and you must divest until you don't cause a grave \nrisk to the entire economy.\n  In addition to the issue of too big to fail, there is the Glass-\nSteagall reconnection. My colleague has an amendment on that. There is \nthis issue I am raising on naked credit default swaps. If we have \ndecided we are not going to get rid of these financial curveballs--\nfinancial instruments on steroids that took this country for a huge \nride and stuck the American people with trillions and trillions of \ndollars of loss and bad debt--if we don't do that, let's not crow about \nwhat we did because this is essential, in my judgment.\n  This is what I think happens, as is always the case when it comes to \nWall Street versus the rest of us; it is let's pretend time. This is a \ncase of whose side are you on? Are you going to try to see if you can \nshut the door and deal with those issues that helped cause this near \ncollapse of our economy or are we just going to buff it up a little bit \naround the edges? I am trying to tighten this bill.\n  I have not been able to get this amendment up, except by offering it \nas a second-degree amendment. My understanding is, there will be a \ntabling motion. Those who decide they want to table it don't want to \ntighten this bill, don't want to take on Wall Street on these issues. \nThey say: No, let's let Wall Street prance around and trade naked \ncredit default swaps. They were up 8 percent in the fourth quarter of \nlast year. You would think somebody would learn a lesson. They had a \n$700 billion bailout fund and so on, so you would think they would tone \nit down. No. In the fourth quarter of 2009, the use of credit default \nswaps was up 8 percent. If one wonders how much money is involved in \nall these things--I have spoken before about John Paulson, whose name \ncame up recently with Goldman in the scandal that was the subject of a \ncongressional hearing. In 2007, he was the highest income earner on \nWall Street, earning $3.6 billion--one person. When he came home and \nhis spouse said: Honey, how are we doing? If she wanted it by the \nmonth, he could say that this month we made $300 million. If she wanted \nit by the day, he could say: Pretty good. It is Saturday and I made $10 \nmillion--$10 million a day, $3.6 billion a year.\n  There was so much money involved in all these issues, and the reason \nthere was so much was this unbelievable binge of speculation. We can \npass financial reform, and we can call it whatever we want, but if we \npass it and don't put a cork in this bottle, and we fail to deal with \nthis issue, I will tell you, we will be back and we will find a way to \nhave to confront, once again, the creation of these unbelievable \nspeculative issues--naked credit default\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\nswaps--that have no insurable interest. We will regret the day we \ndidn't address this issue head on.\n  I understand why there is pushback from Wall Street and why some will \nbe nervous about voting for this. They will want to table it because \nthey are getting pushback from Wall Street. Wall Street is wrong--dead \nwrong. They don't need, nor do American banks need, to be trading \ncredit default swaps in order to make money. Yet, as I indicated to \nyou, five of the largest financial institutions in this country have 90 \npercent of the credit default swaps. We think about 80 percent of them \nare without any insurable interest in anything. That is wagering, not \ninvesting.\n  This country deserves better, and the American people deserve for the \nCongress to stand up to Wall Street and say: You know what, the \ncreation of these instruments exacerbated the economic troubles of this \ncountry in a significant way, and at long last it is time to put an end \nto it. This amendment simply bans the use of naked credit default \nswaps. It has a provision that says, if such a ban in a certain \ntimeframe would cause undue--Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  There is a provision in this legislation that, as opposed to a ban on \na date certain, if that would prove to be troublesome, it would stretch \nout for an 18-month period by which such a ban could take effect.\n  Let me say this. I understand the tabling motion will be made. My \nhope is that colleagues who believe we ought to take on Wall Street on \nthese issues will stand up for the American people on these issues and \ndo the right thing on these issues, especially since we are living in \nthe shadow of a near collapse of this economy.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will vote against tabling this \namendment and, thereby, express their support for the amendment I am \noffering.\n  I am offering this amendment on behalf of colleagues which I will \nsubmit for the Record as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak a couple of minutes. This is \nthe first opportunity we have had, with all the other amendments we \ntalked about, to even talk about this very critically important part of \nthe legislation, and that is the section dealing with derivatives, \nwhich is a source of major interest.\n  I wish to spend a couple of minutes describing to my colleagues what \nis in this bill that is before us dealing with derivatives, and then I \nwill express some concerns about the amendment of my good friend and \ncolleague from North Dakota. Then at the conclusion of that, unless \nothers would like to be quickly heard on this matter, I will move to \ntable the Dorgan amendment.\n  That is normally not what we have done. There have been no tabling \nmotions made over these 2\\1/2\\ weeks. Let me express my regret that \nSenator Dorgan was unable to get a straight up-or-down vote on his \namendment. Even though I have concerns about it, I tried over the last \n2 weeks to have everyone have their amendments raised so we could have \na good, vibrant, full-throated debate on matters and let Members \ndecide. In some cases, we had a 60-vote margin; in most cases a 50-vote \nmargin. No one has said to anyone yet: Your amendment can't come up.\n  I say to the Senator from North Dakota, I tried to see to it that \neverybody has the opportunity to be heard. As he knows and others know, \nwe have had a stalemate this afternoon on whether matters can be heard.\n  As I said, derivatives, as most of my colleagues and many in the \ncountry understand, are essentially hedges or bets whose worth rises \nand falls with the price of something in the marketplace. They can be \nvery commonsense financial tools to help businesses manage their costs. \nThe word is taken on a pejorative, but actually derivatives are \ncritically important in our economy.\n  For instance, let's say you make candy for a living; you are a candy \nmanufacturer. The price of sugar is an incredibly important factor in \ndetermining your bottom line, and the cost of sugar can fluctuate \ndramatically. All sorts of factors can raise or lower the price of \nsugar, which is a critical component in your production of candy, but \nit is a factor you cannot control. You do not necessarily control what \nhappens to the price of sugar as a candy manufacturer. Derivatives can \nhelp you manage volatility, and that is why they are so valuable in our \neconomy.\n  If it sounds like insurance, that is because if used properly, that \nis exactly what it is.\n  Let's say you are an investor and you will not be able to afford the \nloss if your company or government whose bonds you bought defaults. \nAgain, you do not have control over that company's or government's \nability to pay you back. So a form of insurance has sprung up in the \nform of derivatives that would protect you against that kind of \ndefault. It is called a credit default swap, or CDS.\n  Just like a derivatives contract on the price of sugar, it is not \nnecessarily a bad thing. In fact, it could be very helpful in terms of \nmanaging volatility and protecting against losses totally unconnected \nwith your activity.\n  Credit default swaps played a huge role, as we now know, in the lead-\nup to the financial crisis that has cost our country so much.\n  For instance, take what happened to AIG, the former insurance giant. \nBefore the crisis, institutions around the world bought credit \nprotection against mortgage-backed securities from AIG, just like you \nor I might have bought some other, more pedestrian insurance policy. \nWhen those mortgage-backed securities failed, AIG owed money to all of \nthose protection buyers around the world. But AIG, as a seller of CDSs, \nhad no regulatory requirement that it actually have the capital on hand \nthat it would need to pay those parties if, in fact, it was called.\n  Guess who ended up having to make those counterparties whole. We, the \ntaxpayers, the taxpayers across the country because AIG lacked the \ncapital behind those derivatives. Even worse, because there was no \nreporting requirement, regulators did not even know where the risks \nwere in the financial system. Because there was no requirement that \nthese transactions run through a clearinghouse, even people in the \nfinancial sector could not figure out for sure who was exposed to AIG's \npotential failure.\n  The result, of course, was a total freeze in our markets and our \nfinancial system because financial sector actors no longer trusted that \ntheir counterparties would be creditworthy. And who could blame them? \nIt is like if you did not trust your bank to be around the next day, \nyou would get your money out in a hurry, as many did back 80 years ago \nwhen there were no protections. When the word went out, people took to \nthe streets. That is why the bill drawn up in our Banking Committee and \nAgriculture Committee contains some very tough new rules for CDSs and \nthe rest of the derivatives market.\n  Under the terms of our bill, CDSs must centrally be cleared and \ntraded on regulated exchanges in order to reduce counterparty risks and \nto promote transparency and stability in our financial system.\n  The central clearinghouse will set margin requirements and position \nlimits. Those ideas have been around for decades, by the way, within \nthe commodities markets, going back to the 1870s or 1880s. Margin \nrequirements and collateral requirements have been required; hence, \nthere are very few problems in the commodities markets because of \nmargin requirements and collateral requirements.\n  The bill before us includes tough new rules for protection sellers, \nsuch as AIG and dealers such as Goldman Sachs, that will be registered \nand regulated by the SEC and CFTC. They will have to face tough new \nrules to curb excessive risk taking, and all CDSs will be reported \nthrough a central clearinghouse, data repository, or directly to \nregulators.\n  For the very first time, financial advisers working with \nmunicipalities--the people helping to ensure that our communities \ninvest wisely--will have to register and be subject to rules and \nregulations.\n  Our colleague from North Dakota, Senator Dorgan, has offered an \nimportant amendment to tackle yet another problem, as he sees it, with \nCDSs. If you owned a house and bought a policy that would pay you money \nif the house burned down, we would call that insurance. But if you \nbought that policy on\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\nsomeone else's house, a house you did not even own, you probably would \nnot get invited to spend the weekend there because you were betting the \nhouse would catch on fire.\n  At best, we call that a cynical bet. Unfortunately, it happens a lot \nin our financial system. It is called a naked CDS. It is a CDS in which \nthe entity buying protection does not even own the underlying credit.\n\n  During the crisis, traders bought protection hoping that borrowers \nwould fail to pay back their loans--borrowers such as the government of \nGreece or the State of California, for that matter.\n  Betting on failure, of course, is dangerous, as we know. That is why \nSenator Dorgan has offered an important amendment, in his mind, to \ndefine the problem. In addition to requiring all CDSs to be cleared, it \noutright bans naked CDSs and synthetic asset-backed securities.\n  I have described the serious steps we have taken in our underlying \nbill to reduce the dangers in the CDS market. Senator Dorgan's \namendment goes a step further and, in my view, too far at this \nparticular juncture. Let me explain why.\n  I don't know, nor can anyone say with absolute clarity, what are the \nimplications and the unintended consequences if we have a total ban on \nthe naked synthetic credit default swaps.\n  Here is my concern. You can have, for instance, people hedging \nagainst where they have uninsured interests. In fact Greece--a country \nthat may fall, an entity in which there is no particular financial \ninterest but there is a concern that economy may not be there--they \nlack insurable interests, necessarily, but it is not illegitimate to \nwant to protect yourself against an event such as the collapse of \nanother country that could cause financial disruptions.\n  My concern about the Dorgan amendment, and had we been dealing with \nit in another means--that is, we had offered the Dorgan amendment--I \nintended to offer a side-by-side amendment that would have allowed this \nto go forward but asking the security risk management operation we set \nup in this bill to make valuation to determine how this could work.\n  I happen to believe in certain instances what Senator Dorgan offers \nmakes sense. My concern is I cannot tell you with certainty what the \nunintended consequences are. I cannot say with absolute certainty what \nSenator Dorgan is proposing actually will be doing what it claims or if \nthere are broader implications to it.\n  This is a very important matter. I do not minimize it at all. But as \nchairman of this committee responsible for advising colleagues and \ndrafting legislation, I need to talk with some certainty about what I \nthink the implications will be of certain proposals. I cannot tell you \nwhat the outcome of this will be. There may be serious consequences \nnegatively to our economy if we adopt this amendment as is.\n  For those reasons this evening, I feel compelled to disagree with \nthis amendment. The only alternative I have to disagreeing to it is to \nvote to table because of the procedural position in which we find \nourselves. I would have preferred a side-by-side which would have given \nsome room for the Dorgan amendment to move forward with further \nconsideration as to how it is applied.\n  Lacking that ability, do we accept or reject the amendment? Because \nof the concerns I have about accepting the amendment without knowing \nwhat the consequences may be, I have to recommend the amendment be \ndefeated. Without necessary protections for commercial end users, \nfinancial stability, and governments and corporations that depend on \ncredit in which to operate and any alternative, we risk shutting down a \n$25 trillion credit default swap market--a $25 trillion credit default \nswap market. We need thorough examination and study before taking this \nkind of dramatic action. That much is at risk if this amendment were to \nbe adopted.\n  I urge my colleagues, given the circumstances, to support the tabling \nmotion.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota. I withhold making the tabling \nmotion and give him a chance to respond.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of my colleague \nfrom Connecticut. My colleague talks about unintended consequences. We \nalready know the real consequences of what are called naked credit \ndefault swaps. That is all we are talking about with this amendment.\n  My colleague started out by talking about normal hedging by a candy \nmanufacturer with respect to the price of sugar. That is not what this \nis about at all, and I am not prepared to lose a debate in which I am \nnot involved. That is not what this is about. This is about naked \ncredit default swaps.\n  My colleague says there is $25 trillion of notional value of credit \ndefault swaps. I have cited two sources--the best two of which I am \naware--that says 80 percent of them--think of this--as much as 80 \npercent of them have no insurable interest. They are just flatout \nnaked, just gambling, betting, not investing.\n  This is not a case of unintended consequences. We know the real \nconsequences. We have already lived it and experienced it and we ought \nto understand that we cannot accept it any longer.\n  This bill allows us to decide what kind of financial system we want \ngoing forward. Do we want to leave here saying we want a financial \nsystem in which the big shots on Wall Street decide they want to trade \n$25 trillion worth of credit default swaps, 90 percent of them in the \nfive biggest banks?\n  If that is what they want to do and it is betting rather than \ninvesting, God bless them; let them do it. Who are we to tell them? Who \nare we to tell them? We lost about $15 trillion, that is who we are.\n  My question is: Are we going to see if we can sober up this system to \nsay this is not the kind of financial system with which we grew up? \nOnly in the last decade and a half did we decide to securitize \neverything and create these new exotic instruments--CDOs, naked credit \ndefault swaps and the like. That has happened recently. It was not \nbecause my colleagues from Connecticut and Alabama came to the floor of \nthe Senate and said: Let's decide to create a whole series of new \nfinancial instruments in this country that are hard to pronounce and \nunderstand. They can all make a lot of money in fees, pay big bonuses, \nand it will work out just fine. That is not how it happened. It \nhappened because we had a bunch of brain-dead regulators, among other \nthings, who said: Go play. And they all went to play and made a lot of \nmoney, and this economy nearly pancaked.\n\n  So this amendment, I would say to the Senator from Connecticut, is \nvery simple. It would ban the use of naked credit default swaps in \nwhich no one has any insurable interest.\n  By the way, with respect to unintended consequences, under this \nmodified amendment I have offered, the appropriate Federal regulators, \nincluding the chair of the Financial Stability Oversight Board, may \nphase in the effective date for up to 18 months if they determine the \nphase-in of the prohibitions and limitations in the amendment is \nnecessary to avoid undue market disruptions.\n  Having said that, I respect the view of my colleague. I profoundly \ndisagree with it. I hope very much that my colleagues will decide not \nto table this amendment and to stand on the side of people who say: \nLet's really make a change here. We understand what happened. It was \nawful for this country. Let's make sure it doesn't happen again. The \nonly way we will do that is to effect the kind of change that exists in \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, again very briefly, obviously much of what \nwe have included under our bill, of course, is designed specifically to \navoid the kinds of losses that occurred. There are provisions in the \nbill dealing with those kinds of safeguards--the clearinghouses, the \nregulators, the mandatory exchanges, and the like. That is in the bill.\n  Again, I have to say to my colleagues here that there are potentially \nserious consequences to this. There are no protections for commercial \nend users if this amendment is adopted. We run the risk of financial \ninstability in governments and corporations that depend upon credit to \noperate--$25 trillion.\n  Again, I would have offered a side-by-side which would have taken \nsome of the good aspects of the Dorgan amendment, but my concern is \nabout exactly\n\n[[Page S3894]]\n\nthe provisions I have mentioned, and there is too much at risk, in my \nview.\n  If this is the only choice we are given, I have to provide my \nrecommendation. My recommendation is, given the choice we are given, \nthe choice I have to make in this particular case is that we table this \namendment.\n  For those reasons, Mr. President, I move to table the Dorgan \namendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if the Dorgan \namendment No. 4114 is disposed of, then the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Grassley amendment No. 4072, with no intervening \namendment in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the unanimous consent \nrequest is agreed to.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Arkansas (Mrs. Lincoln), the Senator from New \nYork (Mr. Schumer), and the Senator from Pennsylvania (Mr. Specter) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 57, nays 38, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 156 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--57\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Brown (MA)\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Carper\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dodd\n     Enzi\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Kyl\n     Landrieu\n     LeMieux\n     Lieberman\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Reed\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Warner\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--38\n\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Boxer\n     Brown (OH)\n     Bunning\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Harkin\n     Kaufman\n     Klobuchar\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Shaheen\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--5\n\n     Byrd\n     Lincoln\n     Schumer\n     Specter\n     Voinovich\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4072\n\n  Mr. DODD. I inquire of the Chair, the pending business is now the \nGrassley amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is the Grassley \namendment.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand there will be a request for a rollcall vote on \nthe Grassley amendment. After that, we are still anxious--we have \nadditional amendments. I say to my colleagues, many of you have \nsubmitted amendments you would like to have considered this evening \nbefore we get to a cloture vote tomorrow. I am willing to stay and try \nto accommodate as many as possible. I know Members would like to have \nclarity on whether we will have any more votes. There are a number of \nother amendments we would take up in relatively short order.\n  I have submitted some 49 amendments to my good friend, Richard \nShelby, the ranking member of the committee, that we could accept, both \nDemocratic and Republican amendments. Some are bipartisan amendments. I \nam not expecting to accept every one of them, but there are many that \ncould be part of a managers' amendment that could take care of a lot of \nconcerns others have raised. We will have to wait to determine whether \nthey have been cleared.\n  Tomorrow, there will be a cloture motion. In the meantime, there is \nstill time this evening to consider amendments that otherwise would \nprobably fail in a postcloture environment. I am willing to stay and \ndeal with as many of these amendments as we can before we get to that \ncloture motion tomorrow, but the pending matter is the Grassley \namendment.\n  There has been a request for the yeas and nays on those votes. That \nis the immediate business. After that, I cannot tell you with absolute \ncertainty there will be additional rollcall votes. If others ask for \nthem, we may ask you to come back and cast a ballot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we are trying to have more votes, but we \nwill have to see if we do. We will have this vote. I think it is fair \nto say it may be difficult to have more votes tonight.\n  We are going to work--we are scheduled to have the vote an hour after \nwe come in. I will work with the Republican leader to find out exactly \nwhat time we need that to be. I know there are some problems with \nattendance. We will have it at either 10 o'clock or 11 o'clock, \nwhatever is convenient for everyone. We may be able to dispose of some \namendments, even in the morning.\n  Mr. DODD. While all Members are here, this has been a remarkable 3 \nweeks. I realize not every amendment has been adopted, but for many of \nus, we were able to get back to the business where we actually have \namendments offered, debates occurring, a good-throated discussion of a \nvery important set of issues.\n  My hope would be that tomorrow--it is coming to the point where we \ncan go on indefinitely on the subject matter. We need to get to closure \nat some point. My plea to colleagues, as you are thinking about this \nevening, amendments tonight, a few amendments tomorrow, some amendments \nin postcloture, we need to come to closure on this legislation. It is a \ngood bill. The country is expecting us to answer the issue of whether \nwe are going to protect our people from future bailouts, give them some \nprotection against the kinds of problems that occurred in the past.\n  I urge you, as the chairman of this committee, to be supportive of \nour motion tomorrow and begin to reach closure on this bill so we can \nmove on to other matters.\n  Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Grassley amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to reconsider the vote and to lay that on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I call up amendment No. 4085 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Mr. ENZI. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. What is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending amendment is amendment No. 4050, \noffered by the Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to be heard on this amendment. We \nwere told to stay here tonight so we could offer amendments. I have had \nan amendment pending since this bill was brought to the floor. I have \nnot been able to bring it up. We were told we could stay here tonight \nand offer amendments. In good faith, I stayed here to offer an \namendment. Now I am told we can't offer amendments because of the \npending amendment, and we can't set it aside. What kind of games are \nbeing played around here? I had this amendment pending ever since the \nbeginning, and I have not been allowed to bring it up. With cloture \ntomorrow, it would fall. What does it mean that we should stay around \nhere to offer amendments tonight, when there is a pending amendment we \ncan't set aside?\n  If that is the game we are going to play, I am going to put in a \nquorum call and we will not call it off.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield without losing his right to the floor?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Without losing my right to the floor, I yield to the \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. REID. In the conversations we just continued over here, I tried \nto work something out. It was my understanding that the minority, the \nRepublicans, agreed to allow the Senator's amendment dealing with \nannuities to come up.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I can't hear.\n  Mr. REID. In a conversation we had over here a few minutes ago, the \nRepublicans and Senator Dodd and his staff thought it would be \nappropriate to bring up your amendment dealing with annuities. That was \npart of the general agreement we had worked out over here.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Well, I have my ATM amendment, and then there is an \nannuities amendment.\n  Mr. REID. The annuities amendment is what the conversation was about.\n  Mr. HARKIN. This is the ATM amendment that I have had filed since the \nbeginning. I have had it filed since this bill was brought to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. REID. So what about the annuity amendment?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I have that amendment too. I didn't know there was a \nlimit. I have two amendments. I have an annuities amendment and an ATM \namendment.\n  Mr. REID. I guess my question through the Chair to my friend from \nIowa is, rather than going into a quorum call tonight, you could always \ndo that some other time. I think it would be more productive if your \namendment, which is dealing with annuities, was lumped into a number of \nother amendments that have been agreed to on both sides. See if we can \ndispose of those. Then if you still feel aggrieved at a later time, you \ncould still do whatever you want.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I will not be able to because there will be a cloture \nvote tomorrow, and I will have been precluded for 3 weeks from offering \nmy amendment. That is not quite fair ball around here. I said I would \ndo my amendment in 5 minutes. I don't need to take much time.\n  Mr. REID. I say again through the Chair to my friend, it seems that \nit would be better that you would have the opportunity at least to get \nthe annuity amendment, which a number of us believe is a very important \namendment. I think it would be better if we were able to at least get \nrid of that amendment in a positive way. I think that is a very \nimportant amendment. If I had to choose between the ATM amendment or \nthe amendment dealing with annuities, it would be hard for me to make a \nchoice which one is the most important amendment. It is not a question \nof not having two amendments. It is a question of couldn't we at least \ndispose of one of them which is an important amendment; otherwise, the \nway this train is going, we may never get to the annuity amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I say to my friend, the leader, that we seem to have an \nimpasse. I have an annuities amendment. I don't know what is going to \nhappen to that. I don't know if they are going to bring it up, vote on \nit or not vote on it. No one has said to me what they are going to do \nwith it. I have an ATM amendment I have been trying to bring up. I \nheard my friend from Connecticut--and he is my friend; I respect him \nhighly--say: Stay around here tonight and offer amendments. I just \noffered an amendment, and now I can't offer the amendment because they \nwill not set aside the pending amendment.\n  Mr. REID. I am not going to belabor the point, other than to say to \nmy friend, there has been a tentative agreement between the two \nmanagers of the bill, including offering your amendment dealing with \nannuities. That is an important amendment. I support it a lot. I think \nthe other amendment is good too. But we don't have agreement on both of \nthem. We do on one of them.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, until we find some way to work something \nout, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The bill clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to vacate the \nquorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, the quorum call is lifted.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 4019, the bipartisan \namendment Senator Grassley and I have worked on for years to end secret \nholds here in the Senate, and permit 10 minutes of debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I object on behalf of Senator DeMint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Parliamentary inquiry: Could the Senator who objected to \nmy request identify on whose behalf the objection was made?\n  Mr. SHELBY. I objected on behalf of Senator DeMint.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, if I could be heard on this very briefly, \nmy friend Senator Grassley is here, and perhaps we could take 3 minutes \nor so each to discuss this.\n  We have worked on this now for more than a decade. The American \npeople are furious at the way business is done in Washington, DC, and \nif ever there were a concrete reason why, we have seen it in the \nhandling of this bipartisan effort to once and for all take business in \nthe Senate out of the shadows and do public business in public. This \nhas widespread, bipartisan support. It is designed to ensure that when \na Senator uses one of the most powerful tools at their disposal to \nactually block the public from seeing public business, that Senator \nwould be publicly accountable. That hasn't been the case, and again and \nagain we have seen colleagues over the last decade abuse this process.\n\n[[Page S3896]]\n\n  It used to be years ago something that was a courtesy. Now it has \ncome to rule life here in the Senate. Scores and scores of instances of \nholds have been used by both political parties. There is one Senator in \nthis body--just one--who has objected to this coming up, and that \nSenator has been unwilling on multiple occasions to come to the floor \nof the Senate and actually state why he insists on defending secret \nholds. So the effort to derail secret holds is, in effect, something \nthat is also being done in secret.\n  We wish to open the Senate to the kind of transparency and \naccountability the American people deserve, but we can't even get to a \ndebate because the person who wants to derail this effort for new \nopenness and new transparency won't even come to the floor and say it \nto our face. That is what this is all about. One can have their own \nviews with respect to holds. Colleagues will differ on this, but what \nwe ought to insist on is what Senator Grassley has said over this \ndecade and that is if you are going to object, you ought to have the \nguts to come forward and do it publicly.\n  I will tell my colleagues, I believe the secret hold here in the \nSenate is an absolutely indefensible violation of the public's right to \nknow. Having an office here in the Senate, honored by the people of \nyour State, in my view is a sacred trust. I believe if you told the \npeople of your home State that you are going to go to Washington and \nkeep the public from even getting a peek at a critical nomination or a \nbill, they wouldn't stand for it for a moment. They certainly wouldn't \nsend you back to the Senate.\n  I intend to come back to this floor again and again and again. I see \nmy friend Senator Grassley here, who has in my view been a leader in \nthe fight for open and transparent government. I will tell my \ncolleagues, I think the idea that one Senator--because we got this to a \nvote and we asked for 10 minutes tonight for a debate, this would pass \noverwhelmingly--but one Senator objects to our even getting a vote for \nmore sunshine in government. Again, that Senator has been unwilling on \nmultiple occasions to come to the floor and say why he favors secrecy.\n  In fact, yesterday--I say this to my friend, the Senator from \nAlabama, my good friend--the objector said, Well, he was interested in \nthe Senator from South Carolina having the opportunity to come and talk \nto Senator Grassley and me about our amendment. He has done nothing of \nthe sort. So he objected the first time without notice when we were \nminutes away from a victory that would have transformed Senate \nprocedure for new openness. He has objected through colleagues. He has \nbeen unwilling to come and talk to us about why he insists on secrecy--\nand, by the way, what he apparently wants to do is something I have \nactually voted for.\n  This strikes me as an absolutely indefensible way to do business. It \nis a concrete case, in my view, of why the American people are so \nfurious about the way business is done in Washington, DC.\n  I wish to have my friend from Iowa have a few minutes, and then, with \nthe indulgence of the Chair, we will wrap up. This is our third such \neffort, and I don't care how many times we have to come back to the \nfloor to win this fight for open, transparent, and accountable \ngovernment. I think it goes right to the core of our duties in the \nSenate.\n  I yield the floor, and I particularly express my appreciation to the \nSenator from Iowa for his patience. We now have well over 10 years into \nthis cause and we are going to prosecute this issue of openness and \naccountability until the public interest prevails.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, my friend from Oregon has adequately \nspoken about the rationale behind what we are trying to do as well as \nthe substance of it, so there is no point in my repeating that. But I \nthink people ought to wake up to what is inevitable around here. When 3 \nor 4 years ago we had exactly the same substance up, it passed the \nSenate 84 to 13, I think, and through subterfuge, it was taken out in \nconference. The House doesn't conference a Senate procedure, so that is \nwhy I use the word ``subterfuge.'' So we ended up with something that \nhas not worked in the last 3 or 4 years.\n  Then we hear, particularly from the other side, about the holds, \nblaming this side for it. Every side has some guilt of misuse of holds. \nThe fact is there is nothing in our amendment that changes the power of \nan individual Senator to hold up something. It is not as though we are \ntrying to compromise this very significant power that an individual \nSenator has, but we are taking the adjective ``secret'' away from \nsecret hold so that you know who the person is; so you can have \ndialogue with that person; so you can find out what their objections \nare; so you can reach compromises. That is the purpose of it. When \nthings are secret, it is not only obnoxious to our principle of \nrepresentative government; it violates the opportunity for an \ninstitution such as this to actually work. We should want to enhance \nthe respect of this institution and one way to do that is to take the \nadjective out of secret hold, not to change anything else. It will \nenhance so much public understanding of what we are doing, because the \npublic's business ought to be public. In our democracy, 99 percent of \nwhat we do--and maybe the only exception would be privacy of an \nindividual or national security--of the public's business ought to be \npublic, and that is what the people expect. But this word ``secret'' \nkeeps from the public knowledge a lot of information that ought to be \nthere to make this body work and to make sure we reduce the cynicism of \nthe public toward government operation.\n  As I said, first, it is inevitable that this is going to happen. \nSenator Wyden and I are going to pursue this, because this is the time \nto do it. The abuse of this power has gone on way too long.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that my amendment No. 4101 be brought up, \nconsidered as read, and that a vote be held at 9 p.m. this evening.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SHELBY. Objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, earlier this evening, my colleague noted \nthat philosophically he shared some interest in this amendment. Others \nwere objecting to it. I wonder whether he would share, in the interest \nof the debate--and Senator Wyden was just speaking to it, and Senator \nGrassley was also--who is objecting to this amendment being debated \ntonight.\n  Mr. SHELBY. I was objecting on behalf of myself and a lot of other \nMembers.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator. I think it would be useful if the \ncitizens of our Nation were to know who was objecting and that the \nnames be read into the Record. I think the citizens have a right to \nknow where their Senators stand on this issue. It is an ideal time to \nlet the citizens know who is putting the secret holds on this \namendment.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, if I can respond, there is no secret hold \nhere. I am objecting on behalf of myself to his unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I know I put my colleague in a terrible \nspot by asking that question. But I do think the citizens of our Nation \ndeserve an explanation as to why we are here tonight and not currently \ndebating any of a whole list of amendments that Members of this body \nwanted to bring forward about how we improve our financial system.\n  The amendment, No. 4101, is an amendment that is cosponsored by Carl \nLevin and myself and about 20 other Senators in this body. There are \nnot that many amendments that have 20-plus cosponsors. I will tell you \nthat it is not the number of cosponsors, although that indicates a \ngenuine interest among colleagues in debating this; it is the substance \nthat goes to the heart of the conversation between Wall Street and Main \nStreet.\n  This amendment is about how we aggregate capital in our country and \nhow\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\nwe allocate it. How do we get money where it does the most good to \nbuild our economy and build the success of our families? We have a \ncouple of different ways of doing that in our Nation. One is that we \nmake a deposit in a bank, and the bank also has access to the Federal \nReserve window, where they get very low cost loans. The intent of us \nproviding both access to the Fed window and the low-cost loan and \nproviding a government insurance on deposits is that this money is \ngoing to go into loans to our families and our small businesses. That \naccess to capital is absolutely essential for building our small \nbusinesses.\n  Right now, our businesses are having a difficult time accessing \ncapital. I bet every Member of this body has gone around their States \nand heard the stories I hear in Oregon. I hear about credit lines being \ncut in half or eliminated. I hear about projects where they are ready \nto seize a business opportunity but that opportunity is blocked because \nthey cannot get a loan they would have gotten in a heartbeat last year \nor 2 years ago or 3 years ago. Those opportunities are not just about \nthe success of the business; they are about the success of our families \nbecause when those small businesses expand, they put people to work.\n  Right now, access to capital is frozen through much of our economy, \ninaccessible to our families and small businesses to be able to seize \nthose opportunities to expand. Why is that? It is because we put in the \nsame house both our lending system and our high-risk investing system. \nBoth of these work very well.\n  Let me explain the high-risk investing side. If you are so fortunate \nas to have a big chunk of capital, you may say: I am going to put this \ninto this private equity fund or venture capital fund or this hedge \nfund, and they are going to have some very capable managers who are \ngoing to look for investments--often high-risk opportunities. They will \nscour the United States, and they are going to find opportunities to \ninvest. A lot of the time those investments pay off handsomely. Those \nwho are fortunate enough to have the funds to be able to put them into \nsuch investment vehicles often do very well.\n  Occasionally, the bets that are made go awry. Why is that? Well, a \nfund says: You know what, there is a huge new opportunity in Russia, \nfor example, because the price of oil is going up and they have a lot \nof oil they want to develop. They are changing their rules and there \nare new opportunities for business to thrive and take advantage of \nthose new rules. So they invest in Russia, but something goes wrong and \nthe price of oil drops and their investments blow up--suddenly, the \ninvestment fund blows up.\n  If that investment fund is by itself, it doesn't really hurt the rest \nof the economy. As long as it is by itself and not systemically so \nlarge that it poses a huge risk to the rest of the economy, and it goes \nbust, the investors simply lose their money. No harm done. But if it is \ninside of a bank, now you have a problem because when that goes bust, \nthe bank is responsible for the responsibilities of that fund, and the \nresult is that the bank goes down.\n  We saw that Citibank went down. We saw so many other big banks--when \nI say ``went down,'' I mean they had huge losses. Citibank is still \nalive. I know the folks in South Dakota will be happy to know that. \nThey had huge losses, and the former chair of Citibank believes we need \nto separate the high-risk investing and the function of depositing, \naccessing money through the Fed, and making those loans to our families \nand small businesses so they can thrive. It is a separation between two \nfunctions.\n  I would be happy to yield to my colleague if he wants to explain why \nhe is objecting to having a debate on the floor of the Senate that is a \ndebate that is so important to the success of our small businesses, so \nimportant to the success of our families, that is so important because \nwe should have learned over what happened in the last 2 years that if \nthese two functions are combined, they hurt each other. Why would we \nnot want to debate the diversion of money out of the hands of our small \nbusinesses and into Wall Street? I would yield if my colleague across \nthe aisle would like to say why he is objecting to having this debate \ntonight. If he would like to jump up later and explain it, I will take \nthat comment at that time.\n\n  We cannot do our job here in the Senate if a Senator blocks the \ndebate of issues that are important to the success of our Republic. We \ncannot do our job here in the Senate if a Senator blocks the debate of \nissues that are important to our families. We cannot do our job if \nfolks, on behalf of Wall Street giants, come to the floor and object to \nthe debate of fixing our financial system so our small businesses can \nthrive.\n  I can tell you this: Back home, people know that this body helped out \nthe biggest corporations in America last year in a very difficult time \nfor them, when many of them would have gone bust. They want to know why \nthis body, tonight, is unwilling to debate changes in the law that will \nhelp the small businesses of America, changes that will help the \nfamilies of America, debate that will enable us to discuss improving \nour system so that we can have decades of solid growth in the years \nahead. Why should Wall Street veto a debate in this body tonight for \nMain Street? I can't explain that to the folks back home.\n  I can't explain to the folks back home that we have an amendment that \nhas been carefully worked on for months; that there are colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle who wanted to have this debate; that we have an \namendment that was worked on very carefully with experts from Wall \nStreet to make sure we got it right; that we have an amendment about \nwhich the Treasury Department called in experts, brought them in \nthrough meetings and said: Here is the challenge, here is what you need \ndo and how you can fix it. How do I explain to them that, with all that \nwork, we could have a rational debate. But it isn't going to happen \nbecause Wall Street is asking colleagues to block the debate for the \nAmerican people. Why is Wall Street winning and Main Street losing \ntonight? I would like an explanation. The American people would like an \nexplanation.\n  Another piece of this bill says that nonbank financial \norganizations--by this, you can simply say hedge funds and equity \nfunds, funds that pool money and make risky investments--that if they \nare so large, they pose a risk to the economy as a whole, then the \nregulators can add additional capital requirements, so they have to set \naside more dollars for every dollar they invest.\n  Two years ago, the SEC lifted the capital requirements on the largest \nfive investment banks in America. Bear Stearns went from 20-to-1 \nleverage to 40-to-1 leverage in 1 year. What do I mean by that? For \nevery dollar they set aside in case investments went bad, they invested \n$20. So you only had to have a 5-percent drop in value to wipe out what \nthey set aside. At the end of the year, they got 40-to-1 leverage, and \nthat meant for every $100 invested, they only had $2.50 set aside, and \nyou only needed 2.5 percent reduction in investments to go bust. What \nkind of regulation system would allow 40-to-1 leverage?\n  Should we not have a debate on the second main piece of this \namendment, which says that regulators, when you have a systemically \nsignificant firm, can increase the leverage requirement, increase the \ncapital set aside, so that firm is not operating in a way that it can \nbring down our economy or punch a huge hole in our economy?\n  So the first part of the amendment says that high-risk investing is \nwonderful for allocating capital but do it away from our lending system \nso that our small businesses and our families can have access to a \nsteady flow of capital, so that capital will not be frozen when \ninvestments go bad.\n  The second part of the amendment says: Give the regulators the power \nto increase the capital requirement when they are large and can tear a \nbig hole, so if they do crazy, risky things and they lose, they do not \nhurt the rest of the economy. I think it is common sense. Why is that \ndebate so scary to my colleagues who are objecting to it tonight?\n  This is not about whether the amendment wins. We offered tonight to \nhave this vote with our arms tied behind our back and one leg. What do \nI mean by that? We offered to have this vote tonight with a 60-vote \nrequirement, even though a number of Democratic Senators are missing--a \nsupermajority requirement so that we can have a debate\n\n[[Page S3898]]\n\non Main Street about Main Street, about Main Street working better. But \nWall Street asked colleagues to block this debate. That is wrong.\n  The third part of this amendment says we need integrity in writing \nsecurities. This is the superb work of my colleague, Senator Levin. I \nknow he will expand on it in due course. But here is the thing. A \nsystem with integrity is good for allocating capital efficiently \nbecause people want to invest in a system that has integrity. When we \nestablished the Securities and Exchange Commission to oversee the stock \nworld, people gained more faith that the system was not rigged. They \nwere more willing to buy stocks and, by that fashion, invest their \nmoneys in the companies of America, build those companies. The success \nof those companies was good for our families--our working families--and \nthe jobs that went with them.\n  But now in securities, we have a very opaque, a very dark market \nwhere only a few companies have control of the information and people \ndo not know what the price point is, and they do not know what the \ndetails are. We have swaps being written where if you participate in \nit, you do not even know who is on the other side of the deal. There \nwere folks doing deals with middlemen on Wall Street, and they did not \nknow who the insurer was. They did not know it was AIG on the other \nside of the deal. When you buy insurance, you want to know who the \ninsurer is. They could not get access to that information.\n  In securities, here is the thing. Right now, we have companies that \nwhile they are designing and selling securities also are betting \nagainst the success of those securities. I must say, that does not \ninstill much confidence in the integrity of the system.\n  I ask my colleagues, and I ask the citizens of this country: Would \nyou like to buy a car from someone who would not tell you whether they \ninstalled brakes and who was taking out an insurance policy on your \nlife; they are betting you are going to get in a wreck? You would say: \nNo, I would not want to buy a car from someone who is not telling me if \nthey put in the brakes and is taking out a life insurance policy on my \nlife. I would be scared to death to buy that car.\n  The story goes on. Would you buy a loaf of bread from someone who \nwould not tell you what the ingredients were and you do not know if it \nis a good loaf of bread, and they are taking an insurance policy out on \nyour life? You would be worried about the ingredients in that bread.\n  That is the problem we have in the securities world. It is a very \nsimple approach that Senator Levin has laid out in which it calls for \nintegrity in securities. If you are designing and selling them, you do \nnot bet against them.\n  There are all kinds of details that have been put into these three \nparts of the amendment to make them work. Actually, there is nothing in \nthis amendment that is very far outside a core set of issues being \nconsidered. Modern bank holding companies do a lot of things. They do \nwealth management. They do broker dealers in securities and other \nfinancial products. They do market making where they help bring \ntogether this group that wants to buy and this group that wants to \nsell. They make loans to power up our families and our small \nbusinesses. All those functions continue in our bill.\n  But amidst that set, there is one thing that is being carved out, and \nthat one thing is high-risk investing. When Merrill Lynch blows up, you \ndo not want it to take down Bank of America. Two years ago, Merrill \nLynch blew up. It would not have taken down Bank of America because it \nwas not in Bank of America. But it is today. It is a riskier system we \nhave today than 2 years ago.\n  We should have a debate about this on the floor of the Senate. Bear \nStearns, 2 years ago, was by itself. But now it is part of JPMorgan \nChase. If Bear Stearns, 10 years from now, makes investments that go \nawry and it goes down, it blows up a major lender. These types of \nbankruptcies need to not be a situation where they send shock waves and \nparalyze our economy. So common sense: more collateral, if you are a \nhuge investor, set by regulators at a rational level with appropriate \nhearings. That high-risk investing, do it under a different roof so if \nit blows up, it does not affect lending, and those securities--a little \nbit of integrity in the marketing of securities.\n  These are simple ideas. These are commonsense ideas that will make \nour financial system work better for everyone, making it more feasible \nfor our small businesses to gain access to credit, making it more \nfeasible for our families to gain access to credit, making it less \nlikely that a major disruption in investing is going to freeze up those \nloans and the result is that credit lines are being cut so they cannot \nexpand business and cannot hire.\n  That is where we are now. We are frozen. In mortgages, we do not have \na functioning securities market right now. It is important because \nbanks make loans and then they sell them on to the market. But they can \nonly sell them if the market has somebody to sell to. Right now \ninvestors are leery, and they should be leery when there are these \nconflicts of interest that the good work my friend from Michigan has \ndone addresses.\n  This debate should happen. It is wrong for a Senator to object to the \npeople of the United States having their day to talk about a financial \nsystem that works for small businesses and works for families.\n  I know my colleague from Michigan is prepared to expand on the work \nhe has been doing. At the close of my remarks, I wish to thank many of \nmy colleagues who have been immersed in this effort to design a better \nfinancial system. Senator Dodd and his team on Banking have been \nworking night and day looking at every angle to get this amendment \nright. My friends at Treasury--I cannot tell you how many nights they \nhave been up working, consulting with folks who are deep in the \nindustry, to understand what works and does not to get this right. \nSenator Levin's team and my team have been working so hard in \nconsulting and facilitating and writing and rewriting so we could have \nthis debate in a responsible way tonight. We did not want to have a \ndebate where we had an amendment that was illogical or had rough edges \nthat had not been sanded off. We wanted to have a responsible debate.\n  We may not have had the votes necessary to adopt the amendment. We do \nnot know. That is a mystery. But what we know for sure is that the \npeople of America have been shortchanged tonight by some colleagues at \nthe request of Wall Street blocking consideration of this amendment, \nand that is not right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the Dodd-Lincoln substitute amendment No. 3739 occur at 2 p.m., \nWednesday, May 19; and that Members have until 1 p.m. to file germane \nsecond-degree amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Under a previous order, a Shelby amendment No. 4010 and a \nVitter amendment No. 4003 were ordered to be called up. I would like to \nstate for the record that those amendments are still in order to be \ncalled up and hope that the Record will so reflect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Record will so reflect.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, months ago, one of the most respected names \nin finance, Paul Volcker, the former Chairman of the Federal Reserve \nBoard, made a commonsense proposal to protect taxpayers from the risk- \ntaking on Wall Street.\n  The essence of the proposal was this: Banks that have an explicit or \nimplicit backing from taxpayers, through deposit insurance or \notherwise, should not be allowed to make investments for their own \nprofits. Banks can do one or the other, but not both.\n  The goal of the proposal is clear: We will not let Wall Street \nbankers take advantage of taxpayers to make themselves rich.\n  Wall Street should be free to serve their clients, help investors \nsave and allow entrepreneurs to raise the money they need to grow their \nbusinesses. But big banks should not be taking exaggerated risks that \nbenefit only themselves and their own pocketbooks.\n  Our Wall Street reform bill has a provision that reflects this \nprinciple. Senators Levin and Merkley have been working for weeks on a \nproposal that\n\n[[Page S3899]]\n\nmakes the tough underlying bill even tougher by giving taxpayers \nadditional safeguards.\n  Their amendment would stop big banks from high-risk speculation and \nstop them from investing in hedge funds or private-equity funds. It \nwould impose tough capital requirements on the biggest firms that pose \nthe biggest risks to the financial system.\n  And it prohibits the conflicts of interest that allow Wall Street \nfirms to bet against the very products they sell to their clients.\n  Mr. President, financial instruments and securities trading are \ncomplex. But this amendment is nothing more than simple common sense.\n  It stops Wall Street from gambling away other people's money with \nlittle risk and large reward. It rejects the rules in place today--\nwhich are the same rules that were in place when our economy nearly \ncollapsed--rules that let big banks take home their winnings but ask \nfor all us to cover the loses. And it says to those who game the \nsystem: the game is over.\n  If Republicans are serious about learning from the mistakes of the \npast, they'll join us. If they agree that protecting middle-class \nconsumers, safeguarding families' savings and protecting seniors' \npensions is more important than carrying water for Wall Street \nmillionaires, they'll join us. If they don't, it will be clear to the \nAmerican people who's on their side, and who isn't.\n  And even if--in spite of all the evidence to the contrary--they still \ndisagree that taxpayers shouldn't be on the hook for big banks' bad \nbets, I ask them to at least let us have a vote on this amendment, and \nlet the majority rule.\n  The Levin-Merkley amendment and this larger bill will help prevent \nfuture financial crises. They will guarantee taxpayers that they won't \never again be asked to bail out a out bank that doesn't want to take \nresponsibility for its own mistakes. And they will make sure the \ndisastrous recession our families and businesses have endured for the \nlast several years does not get worse, and never happens again.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the financial reform bill before the \nSenate includes a section, subtitle J, section 991, that would permit \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, to be ``self-funded,'' \nmeaning that the SEC would set its own budget and collect the \nsubsequent fees from the companies the agency regulates. The effect of \nthis action would be to remove a critical oversight role for the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Currently, Congress sets the amount to be collected and the SEC \nadjusts their fees during the year accordingly. The provision included \nin S. 3217 allows the SEC to both set the fee level and adjust the fees \naccordingly, basically creating a carte blanche approach to SEC \nbudgeting.\n  I, along with eight of my colleagues, including the vice chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, Senator Cochran, the chairman and ranking \nmember of the subcommittee with oversight responsibilities for the SEC, \nSenators Durbin and Collins, along with Senators Byrd, Harkin, \nVoinovich, Murkowski, and Brownback, have introduced a bipartisan \namendment to strike the provision from the underlying bill.\n  No one disputes the fine job Chairperson Mary Schapiro has done since \ntaking the helm of the SEC. But the foundation of our government is \nbased on checks and balances, not personalities. Agencies should not be \ngiven sole authority to negotiate the fees that support their \noperations with the very institutions over which they regulate. Such a \nsituation allows for absolutely no meaningful oversight by Congress.\n  However, if Congress is going to concede to the SEC absolute control \nof its billion-dollar budget, then the agency must have effective \ninternal controls in place. Unfortunately, that is not the case. The \nGovernment Accountability Office has faulted the SEC several times in \nthe past for weaknesses in this very area.\n  So the underlying provision will exempt an agency from the \nappropriations process and its annual congressional oversight without \nensuring that any internal controls are in place for revenue and budget \nmanagement. While it may not be the intent of the underlying provision, \nwhat is clear is that spending for the SEC would go unmonitored.\n  The amendment I and my colleagues introduced would strike section 991 \nfrom the bill, and thus restore the existing fee-based system for the \nSEC. The existing fee-based system is a successful model that has the \nannual appropriations bill both trigger the collection of the fees and \ndetermine the amount that can be spent. This model is used for other \nfee-based agencies such as the Federal Communications Commission, the \nFederal Trade Commission, the Patents and Trademark Office, and parts \nof the Federal Drug Administration.\n  It is clear that the House of Representatives does not support the \napproach included in the underlying Senate bill as they did not include \na provision for the SEC to be self-funded in their legislation. I have \nspoken with my fellow cosponsors of this amendment, and we have agreed \nnot to offer this amendment during the current debate. We take this \naction in support of the managers' and leaderships' interest in \nwrapping up floor consideration of the measure and because it is clear \nthat this issue will be resolved appropriately during the conference \nnegotiations on this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3899-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REED.

Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I have several \namendments that have been filed. At this moment, it is not possible to \ncall up all the amendments, but I wish to speak to one of them and hope \nthat prior to the conclusion of our debate, I will have the \nopportunity, and I hope my colleagues do have an opportunity, to call \nup amendments that are still important to the legislation and deserve \nconsideration by the body.\n  My amendment would require registration with the Securities and \nExchange Commission for private equity funds, hedge funds, and venture \ncapital funds that are larger than $100 million. It recognizes that \nlarge pools of capital without any connection to regulatory authority \ncould pose a systemic risk. It is a function, as we found out, in some \ncases, that if they make erroneous judgments, that could cause a \nsystemic problem.\n  This proposal has been embraced by a wide cross-section of interested \nand knowledgeable parties. It has the support of the Obama \nAdministration. It has the support of the North American Securities \nAdministrators Association, who represent State securities regulators. \nIt has the support of the Private Equity Council, the Managed Funds \nAssociation, Americans for Financial Reform, the AFL-CIO, and AFSCME. \nIt has broad-based support, and I think it is part of the major effort \nof this legislation to increase transparency and, as a result, to \npreclude and prevent fraud, particularly when we are dealing with these \nlarge pools of private capital.\n  Private equity firms' activities can often make or break companies, \nresulting in a significant loss of jobs. We have seen of the 163 \nnonfinancial companies that went bankrupt last year, nearly half were \nbacked by leveraged buyout firms.\n  There are startling examples of companies, going concerns that employ \nthousands of Americans, that are acquired by private equity companies. \nTheir business model, in many cases, is to leverage that company by \nborrowing extensively and by using these proceeds to purchase the \ncompany and then hopefully to repay themselves handsomely. If they are \nat a point in which the company is burdened with too much debt, they \nwill either attempt to sell it off or they are forced into bankruptcy. \nThe result, unfortunately, in many cases, is thousands of working men \nand women in this country lose their jobs. The company goes bust. There \nis nothing left.\n  This behavior has to, at least, be on the radar screen, if you will, \nof the regulators. They have to know that these\n\n[[Page S3900]]\n\nfunds above $100 million are operating. There are many other examples \nwe can cite.\n  The bill before us has one category. That is hedge funds. We have to \nrecognize there are other major private pools of capital, venture \ncapital funds and private equity funds that should also have to \nregister. The other thing we have to recognize is that the regulatory \ncapacity of any agency is limited. What we have seen over the last \nseveral years is a situation where regulators may have had the \nauthority, but they did not have the resources, or they saw situations \nwhere certain activity was regulated and other activity was not.\n  What this amendment argues for is to ensure that we recognize both \nthe potential dangers of large pools of private capital and the \nlimitations of regulations to really differentiate between the pools. \nThat is why the amendment I propose provides no categorical exemptions \nfor these private pools. The rationale is that I do not think, frankly, \nthe regulators can keep up with private funds that can describe their \nbusiness plan in a way to qualify for an exemption but very well might \nbe conducting the same type of behavior that causes concerns. So I have \nsuggested, and it has been supported by a wide number of individuals \nand institutions, that we provide this broad-based registration \nrequirement--firms above $100 million would be required to have Federal \nregistration. That is something, I think, that is important. Therefore, \nwe have proposed the amendment.\n\n  The investors in these firms deserve, I think, our protection as \nwell. The benefits to the financial system outweigh, in my view, the \nmodest associated costs, and as a result I think we could and should \nmove forward. Many of these firms, frankly, if you have $100 million \nunder management or for investment, and if you don't have good \nfinancial controls, I think we have to ask ourselves: Should these \nfirms be operating? Should they be allowed to continue to operate?\n  The second aspect of this, too, is that the infrastructure of \ncompliance--the infrastructure of risk management--is built into these \nfirms. If it is not, frankly, we should ask: Why are they still doing \nbusiness? The cost of registration--and this is simply registration; \nsimply telling the Federal regulators, the SEC, that we are doing \nbusiness like this; we have a certain amount of assets under management \nor investments that we are managing, and several other items of basic \ninformation--has been estimated to be rather modest compared to the \nmoney under management and the other operational expenses of these \nfirms.\n  So again, I think this is a valuable amendment. It is a valuable \namendment that reinforces the basic tenets of this legislation--\ntransparency, accountability, and giving our regulators an overall view \nof the financial situation--the money that is there, the types of \nbusiness activities that are there--so that they can develop \nappropriate information for their regulatory endeavors.\n  The other point I would make is that if we were to stop the camera \ntoday and look at the financial scene, we might make judgments that, \nwell, this entity is not very large, this particular entity doesn't do \nthe type of business, et cetera. With the dynamism of our economy, \nwhich is a value, going forward 2 or 3 years, those firms could change \ndramatically, and something that seemed innocuous today could be \nsystematically risky in the future. It might be called the same thing, \nbut its functions are different.\n  I make a final point in this regard. In some respects, legislation \nthat was considered here in the 1990s looked at derivatives, looked at \nsecuritization as a phenomenon that would be static and that wouldn't \nchange. But we know it changed, and it changed in a way the regulators \ndidn't anticipate and weren't prepared to anticipate. So mortgage funds \nin the 1990s were based on those old-fashioned 20 percent down, a FICO \nscore of 680, income sufficient to amortize the mortgage over the \nlifetime. The mortgages they were securitizing in 2005-2006--no money \ndown, no income statement, liar loans, et cetera--was a different \nproduct. And yet we legislated for products and for business entities \nthat transformed dramatically in the subsequent years.\n  We have to provide our regulators with the flexibility to not only \ndeal with the problems of today but to fairly anticipate a dynamic and \nchanging financial situation. That is at the heart of this legislation \nalso. So I hope we have an opportunity to further debate this and to \noffer it and to ask colleagues for their consideration.\n  With that, I yield the floor to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to briefly come to the floor to talk \nabout what happened here today. We saw the long arm of Wall Street come \nto the Senate and reach right into this Chamber. It should not have \nhappened. We all should have learned the lesson as to what Wall Street \nplunged us into. And the idea that Wall Street could do this, through a \nnumber of Republican Senators who objected to our even coming to a vote \non the so-called Merkley-Levin amendment, is nothing less than \nshameful. But that is what happened.\n  We have been going back and forth, a Democrat and a Republican \namendment, and it came time for Senator Dodd, who is a cosponsor of \nMerkley-Levin, to offer this amendment, to bring this up to the floor, \nand it was rejected. It was rejected by the Republican leadership \nacting through the manager of the bill.\n  This amendment has been worked for many days. We have attempted very \nhard, and succeeded in addressing a number of concerns which were \nraised, but what we insisted upon and will continue to insist upon and \nwill not yield on is our determination that banks not engage in risky \nbets. Our commercial banks have access to the Fed window. That is \ntaxpayer money. Our commercial banks have access to the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation. It guarantees that the accounts will be paid. We \ncannot permit--we cannot allow--banks to engage in risky bets and then \nexpect to be bailed out by taxpayers. That happened to us. It got us \ninto big trouble. We are in a deep recession as a result of what the \nWall Street banks did.\n  There were a lot of other contributors. They were not alone. Our \nsubcommittee hearings were prepared over many months. In fact, the \ninvestigation lasted about a year and a half, with millions of \ndocuments that were subpoenaed and brought into the subcommittee's \noffices. What our hearings showed is that upstream we had a number of \nbanks and mortgage companies that were willing to package bad loans, in \nmany cases loans that they knew were fraudulent, and in some very \nserious cases loans that they knew were likely to go into default. \nNonetheless--and the e-mails show this--those upstream banks decided \nthey were going to bundle these mortgages--these dubious risky \nmortgages, many of which were likely to default--they were going to \nsecuritize these mortgages and ship them downstream, where Wall Street \nwas panting for these bundled securitized mortgages because then they \nwere going to slice them and dice them and cut them up into these \ncollateralized deals, which were so complicated and very difficult to \nexplain to the public.\n  Nonetheless, what happened is the public took a bath, and a number of \nfirms on Wall Street did very well, including Goldman Sachs. It did \nextremely well through their dealings. Some of the e-mails from Goldman \nSachs show how well they did, while everybody else was losing their \nhomes, losing their jobs, and most banks were losing money. In one of \ntheir e-mails Goldman Sachs said:\n\n       Much of the plan began working by February as the market \n     dropped by 25 points and our very profitable year was \n     underway.\n\n  So the market dropped 25 points and the profitable year at Goldman \nSachs was underway. Why? Because they bet against their own clients.\n  As Senator Merkley pointed out--and he has been a real pleasure to \nwork with as a partner--we had a situation here where Goldman Sachs was \nselling billions of dollars of securities--many of which they knew \ncontained bad assets, and their own e-mails show it--selling to their \nclients with their right hand and with their left hand betting heavily \nagainst those same securities. The way they bet against them is a \ncomplicated story--going short, betting short, the big short, using \nthose\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\ndefault swaps, which were described earlier on the floor of the Senate. \nBut they were making a lot of money out of the losses of their clients.\n  What added insult to injury--the injury was the conflict of interest \nand betting against something they were selling, and not even \ndisclosing that fact, by the way, to their clients and customers. But \nthe insult that was added was when their own e-mails, over and over \nagain, show that their own salespeople were describing these securities \nthat they were selling to our pension funds and our educational \ninstitutions as junk and worse. That is the insult. The underlying \ninjury is the conflict of interest.\n  Our amendment, as the Senator from Oregon described, goes after the \nproprietary trading, which is highly risky, in one part of the \namendment. Another part of the amendment goes directly at the conflicts \nof interest which were exemplified by what Goldman Sachs did. Then they \ntell us in the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations: Well, that is \nthe way Wall Street does business. You just don't understand.\n  Well, Main Street understands. We understand the values that Wall \nStreet exemplified in these last years by selling junk to clients and \nthen betting against them. We understand very well what went on, \nbecause we, the people of the United States, ended up paying for those \nbets. When they won the bets, they made out like bandits. Wall Street--\nGoldman Sachs--won many of those bets because they bet against the very \nsecurities that they thought were dubious. But there were also a lot of \nbanks that lost bets, that didn't do what Goldman Sachs did, but \nnonetheless got stuck with these bad securities. And what happened \nthen? Because of the proprietary trading of those banks and risky \nsecurities, they ended up losing a lot of money and the taxpayers had \nto bail them out.\n  So the taxpayers of this country lose either way. Our pension funds, \nour educational institutions lose out to a Goldman Sachs, with their \nconflicts of interest against their own clients--essentially dealing \nwith themselves as a client against the interest of the person they \nwere selling securities to. You have the Goldman Sachs on the one hand \nmaking a lot of money that way. You have the banks, which lost money \nbecause of those risky bets on the other side of the bet, ending up \nbeing at the public trough and having to be bailed out because they \nwere too big to fail and would have plunged us even more deeply into a \ndeeper recession or a depression had they not been bailed out.\n  We are trying to prevent that from happening again. The Merkley-Levin \namendment is trying to go right to the heart of that problem, and that \nproblem is a very deep one, involving the examples which the Senator \nfrom Oregon I believe cited but, if not, let me very briefly summarize. \nWall Street has attempted to argue that proprietary trading, which our \namendment would seek to end in a very thoughtful way, without hitting \nthe kind of activities that are client oriented, that should be \nallowed--Wall Street has attempted to argue that proprietary trading \nwas not a significant factor in the downfall of our financial system. \nThe numbers here tell a very different story.\n  By April of 2008, the Nation's largest financial firms had suffered \n$230 billion in losses based on their proprietary trading. So by the \nend of 2008, taxpayers put up hundreds of billions of dollars in so-\ncalled TARP funds to avoid the collapse of our economy. One example of \nthe damage here: In 1998, Lehman Brothers had $28 billion in \nproprietary holdings. Less than 10 years later--2007--its proprietary \nholdings had soared more than 10 times to $313 billion in those kind of \nhigh-risk bets. When the values of the holdings declined in 2007 and \n2008, Lehman Brothers then lost $32 billion. Those losses exceeded \nLehman Brothers' net worth. By September of 2008, the firm collapsed in \nthe largest bankruptcy in our history.\n  That is what we are trying to prevent a recurrence of in our \namendment. And what happened? Because the Republican leadership decided \nthey would use a parliamentary approach here to stop Merkley-Levin from \neven being offered, we have been unable to get the remedy for that kind \nof a catastrophe happening again to the floor of the Senate for a vote.\n  That is a tragedy which is lying in wait, if we allow it to exist. So \nSenator Merkley and I--the Presiding Officer now and I--are going to do \neverything we possibly can in the few hours that remain before the \ncloture vote to prevent the Republican obstruction from succeeding. We \nare going to continue to try tomorrow morning to see if we can't get \nour amendment considered by the Senate. We simply cannot stand by and \ndo nothing. We have seen too many massive costs to the taxpayers.\n  Another example was with Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns lost more than $3 \nbillion, thanks to an investment of about $30 million in two hedge \nfunds. So the losses at Bear Stearns, because of the leverage they used \nand were allowed to use under existing law, which we would not allow \nthem to use--their losses were 100 times greater than the original \ninvestment that crippled the bank and led to an emergency sale to \nJPMorgan Chase.\n  We have to protect depositors and taxpayers from the risk of this \nhigh-risk proprietary trading at the commercial banks. We have to \nprotect taxpayers from the dilemma of having to pay for Wall Street's \nrisky bets or watch our financial system disintegrate. We have to \nprotect investors and the financial system at large from the conflicts \nof interest that too often represent business as usual on Wall Street.\n  We worked with Senator Dodd. As Senator Merkley pointed out, Senator \nDodd and his staff worked very closely with us. Senator Dodd supports \nour amendment. So the chairman of the Banking Committee wants our \namendment to be considered, and even he cannot persuade the Republican \nleadership to not use a parliamentary gimmick to stop us, to thwart us, \nto stymie us from bringing this remedy to the floor of the Senate.\n  I thank Senator Dodd, Senator Merkley, and his staff for working so \nclosely with us. We have worked with the Treasury Department very \nclosely, with the Securities and Exchange Commission closely, to make \nsure we would fix the problems we target without endangering legitimate \nmarket activity or activity that is on behalf of clients instead of on \nbehalf of the banks. A number of our colleagues worked with us to make \nsure there would not inadvertently be restriction of activities that \ndid not cause and would not cause this kind of financial crisis again. \nFederal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker endorsed our amendment, as did \nbusiness leaders such as John Reed, former chairman and CEO of \nCitibank, and major organizations for Wall Street reform.\n  But as we stand here and sit here at 9:30, we are stymied. Unless we \ncan unlock this tomorrow morning, there is going to be a cloture vote \nlater on that day which, unless we can figure out a way to make our \namendment germane postcloture, will prevent us from getting a vote on \nthis amendment.\n  Are we serious about reforming the worst excesses of Wall Street? On \nthis side of the aisle, we are. On the Republican side of the aisle, \nwhat we have seen now is obstruction, a decision that has been made \nthat they are going to protect Wall Street instead of Main Street. Wall \nStreet has a long arm and hundreds of lobbyists swarming around this \nSenate. They are determined to stop us from taking up the Merkley-Levin \namendment.\n  There is going to be a dramatic opportunity tomorrow. There is going \nto be another effort made to have our amendment considered. At least \none effort will be made tomorrow, and maybe more, because it is \nabsolutely essential that the average American out there, the average \nfamily, that average business on Main Street that we are trying to make \nsure has funds available to it for its needs--they are going to be \nlooking, hopefully, at this body tomorrow when a decision is going to \nbe made as to whether the reforms that are so critically important to \npreventing a reoccurrence of this disaster, this economic disaster, \nwill prevail.\n  Again, I thank Senator Merkley for all he has done, for the huge \nenergy he has put in, he and his staff working so closely with us, with \nthe Treasury Department. I am proud to have the name ``Levin'' come \nafter the name ``Merkley'' in Merkley-Levin. Someday--hopefully it will \nbe tomorrow--we are going to get Merkley-Levin considered by the \nSenate.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. Richard Moe on \nthe occasion of his retirement for the outstanding contributions he has \nmade during his half-century career in American politics and the \npreservation of our Nation's rich heritage. On May 31st, he will retire \nas the National Trust for Historic Preservation's seventh president \nafter 17 years of distinguished work and achievement. He will have been \nthe longest serving president since Congress chartered that \norganization back in 1949 to protect some of the country's most \nimportant historic places.\n  His legacy, however, is not just limited to a litany of successes in \nthe preservation of our most treasured historic and cultural resources. \nThat stewardship alone is an accomplishment beyond measure because of \nthe priceless value these places and objects provide us and subsequent \ngenerations of Americans into posterity. In honoring Richard Moe's \ndecades of work, though, I would be remiss if I did not call attention \nto his great devotion to public service as well. Some of those years \nwere spent right here in the Halls of the Senate when he worked for our \nesteemed former colleague, Walter Mondale. It would be difficult to \nunderstand his deep commitment to the Nation and its heritage, a \nhallmark of his presidency at the National Trust, without mentioning \nhis dedication to serving the American people through those whom our \nvoters have elected.\n  A native of Duluth, MN, Richard Moe graduated with a bachelor of arts \ndegree in political science from Williams College in Massachusetts. He \nbegan his career in politics as administrative assistant to Minneapolis \nMayor Arthur Naftalin in 1961 and then as administrative assistant to \nMinnesota Lieutenant Governor A. M. Keith until 1966. He studied law at \nthe University of Minnesota and passed the Minnesota State bar in 1967. \nThat same year, he became financial director of the Minnesota \nDemocratic-Farmer-Labor Party, eventually rising to chairman, the \nsecond youngest in DFL's history. He held that post until 1972, when he \njoined the Washington office of Senator Mondale and served as his \nadministrative assistant. In 1977, Richard Moe became Vice President \nMondale's chief of staff and a member of President Carter's senior \nstaff where he undertook a number of special assignments on behalf of \nthat administration. Following those years at the White House, he \njoined the Washington office of the New York law firm Davis, Polk & \nWardwell and became a partner.\n  In 1993, he was selected president of the National Trust and forever \nchanged the face of that important organization. Richard Moe's \nleadership there has taken the organization and the historic \npreservation movement into the 21st century. His first goal was to make \nit financially independent and strong. A major portion of the National \nTrust's funding used to come from the Federal Government. This is no \nlonger the case. The National Trust now adheres to his more \nentrepreneurial focus on building relationships with private funders. \nAs a result, and through two capital campaigns, the organization's \nendowment increased by $200 million during his Presidency.\n  He has broadened the National Trust's original congressional mandate \nfar beyond the red velvet cords of house museums and brought historic \npreservation into the full and diverse spectrum of the national public \npolicy arena. When in 1993 the Manassas National Battlefield Park and \nthe surrounding countryside were threatened by an incompatible theme \npark and commercial development, he rallied such opposition to sprawl, \npoor planning, and the loss of our country's open spaces that the \nproposal was defeated.\n  He has focused his organization's attention beyond the importance of \njust protecting the historic America we know that was built after \nJamestown, and called attention to the earlier cultural and historic \ntreasures of the first Americans on our great public lands. And as our \nnational consciousness has turned increasingly toward protecting our \nenvironment and conserving precious resources, Richard Moe has led his \norganization's role in fostering a more sustainable country under the \nsimple but powerful message that preserving and reusing historic \nbuildings is the greatest form of recycling.\n  His passionate interest in history and especially the events of the \nCivil War led to a deep and personal commitment to the restoration of \nPresident Lincoln's Cottage just 3 miles north of this Chamber. Now, \nsolely as a result of Richard Moe's vision, this once forgotten ``Camp \nDavid'' of President Lincoln, where one of our most respected and \ncelebrated Presidents lived and worked, is open to the public for the \nfirst time.\n  In the midst of all these accomplishments, Richard Moe wrote a Civil \nWar history in 1993, ``The Last Full Measure: The Life and Death of the \nFirst Minnesota Volunteers,'' and coauthored ``Changing Places: \nRebuilding Community in the Age of Sprawl'' in 1997.\n  In 2007, he was awarded the National Building Museum's Vincent Scully \nPrize, which recognized his leadership in moving historic preservation \ninto the mainstream of public policy and expanding the public's \nawareness of our heritage's stewardship. That same year he also \nreceived the American Historical Association's Theodore Roosevelt-\nWoodrow Wilson Award for Public Service. Let me add to the many \nacknowledgements such as these my gratitude to Richard Moe and that of \nthe entire Senate for his indelible contributions to our American \npolitical life and for his unceasing care for our national heritage. I \nknow that even in retirement, he will continue to serve the people of \nthe United States and I wish him well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3902-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                     Lance Corporal Joshua M.

Josh's loss will be felt very deeply \nin his hometown of Perry, IA, where his drive and leadership skills \nwere recognized early on as a member of the football and wrestling \nteams and SkillsUSA. He was determined to serve his country and joined \nthe Marine Corps right after high school, even graduating a trimester \nearly to start basic training. Accounts describe Lance Corporal Davis \nas humble, but his sense of patriotism and service humbles me and makes \nme proud to be an Iowan. Learning about the life of this remarkable \nyoung man makes the knowledge of his tremendous sacrifice all the more \npoignant. My thoughts and prayers will be with his family at this time, \nincluding his father Dave, his mother Beverly, and all those touched by \nhis loss. I cannot adequately express the debt of gratitude we owe, but \nI ask all Senators to reflect on, and pay tribute to, the life of a \ngreat American, LCpl Joshua Davis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3902-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3902-S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    IN SUPPORT OF JUDGE EDWARD CHEN\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of Edward Chen, \nnominee for Federal judgeship in the United States District Court for \nthe Northern District of California. Judge Chen has been a respected \nFederal magistrate judge for over 8 years. He is held in high regard by \nhis judicial colleagues and by the attorneys, litigants, and witnesses \nwho have appeared before him, including non partisan prosecutors and \nlaw enforcement officials. Judge Chen has issued hundreds of rulings in \naccordance with the rule of law, and without bias or unfairness. He has \nfacilitated the fair settlement of hundreds of cases, ranging from \ncomplex business disputes to civil rights claims. For these reasons, \nJudge Chen received\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\nthe highest possible rating of ``well qualified'' from the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Given his wide support from the legal community, and his record of \nfairness, what could prevent the U.S. Senate from confirming this \noutstanding jurist's appointment to the District Court of the Northern \nDistrict of California?\n  I am in the opinion that nothing should prevent it. But elements of \nthe extremist media have launched cynical attacks against Judge Chen. \nUnarmed by facts, accusers resort to tired smears that Judge Chen is a \n``radical leftist,'' someone ``who doesn't appear to love America.''\n  But these charges are completely without basis. Those interested in \nthe true picture of Judge Chen's work and outlook need only look at his \nactual 8-year record on the Federal bench. I believe that this record \nis exactly where discussions of his nomination should focus in our \nSenate Chambers, where good judgment should prevail. Judge Chen has \nwritten over 300 published opinions, and what those opinions show is a \njudge who is committed to the rule of law. He follows case precedent. \nHe checks any personal views at the courthouse door, and rules \nimpartially in each and every case. His decisions reveal a belief in \nfairness to all.\n  Judge Chen, like so many others, values diversity in the Federal \njudiciary. Judges from different backgrounds bring varied life \nexperiences to the court, and this diversity of background and \nexperience helps foster balanced and accurate decisionmaking according \nto the rule of law.\n  Judge Chen's belief in the value of diversity is joined also by \nSupreme Court Justice Samuel Alito. During his 2006 confirmation \nhearing, Justice Alito stated, ``When I get a case about \ndiscrimination, I have to think about people in my own family who \nsuffered discrimination because of their ethnic background or because \nof religion or because of gender. And I do take that into account'' in \nreaching balanced and accurate decisions. Justice Clarence Thomas \nunderscored this very point in his statement about the importance of \nbroad representation in the judiciary: ``My goal is to have a court \nthat is fair, and I think it's fair when we are fair in selecting \npeople from all parts of the country, from all walks of life.''\n  I believe Judge Chen brings valuable experience and a solid record of \njudicial fairness to the Federal court. He is faithful to the rule of \nlaw. He is committed to impartiality and equality for all. I believe \nthat upon fair and honest consideration by my Senate colleagues, Judge \nChen and his judicial record will earn approval. Judge Chen has my full \nsupport and deserves to be confirmed by the Senate without delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3903-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REQUEST FOR CONSULTATION\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my letter to \nSenator McConnell dated May 18, 2010, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                                     May 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding H.R. 1741, the \n     Witness Security and Protection Grant Program Act of 2009. In \n     short, although I support the goals of this legislation and \n     believe that witness security and protection is essential to \n     the effective administration of justice, I do not believe \n     that the federal government bears responsibility for \n     witnesses in state and local courts. My concerns about H.R. \n     1741 include, but are not necessarily limited to, those \n     outlined in this letter.\n       As you know, I am extremely concerned about the Nation's \n     fiscal well-being. The national debt is nearly $13 trillion \n     and rising, which amounts to almost $42,000 owed by each U.S. \n     citizen. Moreover, Congress recently raised the national debt \n     ceiling by nearly $2 trillion, and the federal government \n     borrows 41 cents for every dollar that it spends. This dire \n     situation demands that Congress address its spending \n     addiction and adhere strictly to the enumerated powers \n     defined by Article I, Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution.\n       Providing basic services such as witness security and \n     protection in state courts is the obligation of the states. \n     Budgets everywhere are tight, but state and local \n     governments--like the federal government--must set priorities \n     and eliminate wasteful spending in order to ensure that the \n     highest responsibilities are fulfilled.\n       Although the Nation's debt crisis demonstrates that \n     Congress no longer has the luxury of funding anything other \n     than the highest federal priorities, I would note that \n     federal dollars are already available for the same purposes \n     contained in H.R. 1741. Those funding sources are as follows:\n       Edward Byrne Memorial Grant Programs--One of the seven \n     permissible purposes of Byrne/JAG funds is ``crime victim and \n     witness programs'' (P.L. 109162). Significant amounts of \n     federal dollars are available through this program. In \n     FY2009, Congress provided more than $2.5 billion in JAG \n     funding, and in FY2010, Congress provided $519 million for \n     the same programs. In addition to this JAG funding, which is \n     awarded on a formula basis, Congress provided a total of \n     $178.5 million in FY2009 and $185.3 million in FY2010 in \n     Byrne ``discretionary'' funding. This money, totaling $363.8 \n     million, was awarded in the form of congressional earmarks. \n     Competitive funding was limited to $30 million in FY2009 and \n     $40 million in FY2010. In total, the federal government sent \n     approximately $3.4 billion to state and local law enforcement \n     through Byrne grant programs in the last two fiscal years \n     alone. To the extent that states need federal funding for \n     witness protection and security, it would seem that there is \n     ample funding available and that they should consider \n     prioritizing such projects in their requests and budgets.\n       U.S. Marshals--Current law, 18 U.S.C. Sec. 3521, authorizes \n     the Attorney General to provide for relocation and other \n     protection of state witnesses, as well as their family \n     members or close associates, in certain circumstances. That \n     law allows the Attorney General to provide relocation and \n     other protection for state witnesses, as well as their family \n     members or close associates, where there is concern for a \n     witnesses' safety. It allows for, but does not require, \n     reimbursement by the State (18 U.S.C. 3526(b)(1)).\n       Community-Based Justice Grants for Prosecutors Program--\n     Existing law, 42 U.S.C. Sec. 13862, already authorizes \n     federal grants for state and local governments to ``create \n     and expand witness and victim protection programs to prevent \n     threats, intimidation, and retaliation against victims of, \n     and witnesses to, violent crimes.'' This authorization, \n     enacted in 2008, has never been appropriated. Although it \n     remains my belief that Congress lacks both the resources and \n     the responsibility for funding such programs, it should be \n     noted that the statutory authority to provide for state \n     witness protection already exists.\n       I regret that I am unable to support H.R. 1741. Again, I \n     share concerns for the safety of citizens who participate in \n     our justice system. I believe, however, that the Nation's \n     skyrocketing debt demands that Congress make tough spending \n     choices. Where responsibility lies with state and local \n     governments to provide a service, and especially where \n     federal money is already available, I cannot consent to \n     spending additional taxpayer dollars for the same purpose.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A.

Mr. President, I rise today in recognition of National \nHepatitis Awareness Month to raise awareness of this public health \nthreat and encourage greater prevention, diagnosis and treatment \nefforts.\n  Viral hepatitis is a highly infectious disease that directly attacks \nthe liver and, if left untreated, can lead to life-threatening \ncirrhosis of the liver, liver failure and liver cancer. The Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention--CDC--estimate that roughly 5 to 6 \nmillion Americans are infected with viral hepatitis. Yet these chronic \ninfections are silent killers, as those who are infected experience no \nobvious symptoms until advanced liver damage has occurred after years \nwithout treatment. Consequently, up to 50 percent of Americans infected \nwith hepatitis B and 75 percent of Americans infected with hepatitis C \nare unaware of their disease. Without appropriate screening and \nmanagement of the disease, viral hepatitis carriers can pass on the \ninfection to others before suffering a premature death from liver \ncancer or liver disease.\n  Similar to the human immunodeficiency virus--HIV--hepatitis B and C \nare spread through infected blood and needles. Despite awareness \ncampaign efforts from advocacy groups and the CDC, there continues to \nbe nearly 50,000 new infections each year in the United States, \nresulting in 15,000 deaths from chronic viral hepatitis-related \ndiseases. While continued education and outreach is vital to discourage \nrisky behaviors that expose individuals, it is only one part of \npreventing further spread of hepatitis.\n  Perhaps most disturbing is the incidence of hepatitis B and C \ntransmission\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\noccurring in healthcare settings from exposure to infected blood or the \nreuse of contaminated syringes. According to the CDC, unsafe injection \npractices are one of the leading causes of infections in healthcare \nsettings. Although most healthcare workers are aware of the dangers and \nstrictly follow safety guidelines when administering injections, \noutbreaks of hepatitis in recent years have shown the continued need \nfor awareness, education, and stringent safety practices in healthcare \nsettings.\n  Chronic liver disease is among the top ten killers of Americans and \nhepatitis C accounts for 40 to 60 percent of all cases. While there is \na safe vaccine for several types of viral hepatitis, no vaccine exists \nfor hepatitis C. It has been identified as one of the most significant \npreventable and treatable public health problems facing the United \nStates. Clearly we must continue to increase awareness of the disease \nto prevent new infections, encourage screening and tests, and link \nthose that are infected with the care they need.\n  It is my hope that awareness efforts throughout the month of May will \nbring to light the significant and silent health threat of hepatitis, \nencourage appropriate screening and management of the disease, promote \nvigilant safety practices in healthcare settings and prevent further \ntransmissions of the disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3904-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3904-S3905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HIV VACCINE AWARENESS DAY\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to express grave concern \nregarding the misplaced priority of annually deeming this day, May 18, \nHIV Vaccine Awareness Day. This year marks the 13th annual observance \nof a day that epitomizes our government's inability to set priorities \nwith the Federal dollars this body is entrusted.\n  According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious \nDiseases, NIAID, Web site:\n\n       This annual observance is a day to recognize and thank the \n     thousands of volunteers, community members, health \n     professionals, and scientists who are working together to \n     find a safe and effective HIV vaccine. It is also a day to \n     educate our communities about the importance of preventive \n     HIV vaccine research.\n\n  As a practicing physician and former cochair of the Presidential \nAdvisory Council on HIV and AIDS, I believe the development of a safe \nand effective HIV vaccine should be among our Nation's highest health \ncare priorities. HIV/AIDS continues to devastate communities in the \nUnited States and around the world. In the United States, more than \n50,000 people become infected with HIV each year. Approximately 40 \nmillion people are living with HIV around the world, with more than 5 \nmillion new infections each year. To date, more than 25 million men, \nwomen and children are believed to have died from AIDS worldwide.\n  Unfortunately, we have not yet developed an effective HIV/AIDS \nvaccine--nor are we close. At a time when our national debt is \napproaching $13 trillion and patients suffering from HIV/AIDS are being \nput on waiting lists for life-saving drug treatments, we simply cannot \nafford to misspend $1 million a year to make people aware of a \nnonexistent vaccine.\n  Furthermore, this well-intentioned propaganda campaign is being \nfunded at the expense of HIV vaccine research itself. Regardless of the \nintentions, the unfortunate fact is that finite resources intended for \nHIV vaccine research are being siphoned away for a project without any \npotential scientific benefit. With no effective vaccine likely anytime \nsoon, it seems silly, or worse, to waste funding that could be much \nbetter spent on research or scientific investments that could one day \nlead to a vaccine.\n  The discovery of a vaccine or cure, after all, would be the best way \nto thank the researchers and volunteers. As every cent counts in this \nendeavor, it is unconscionable that precious dollars are being \nsquandered by NIAID's well intentioned but unnecessary public relations \ncampaign.\n  Between 2001 and 2005, NIH spent more than $5.2 million on this ``HIV \nvaccine awareness'' campaign, not including staff time or travel \nexpenses. It is reasonable to assume that the federal government \ncontinues to waste over $1 million annually on HIV vaccine awareness, \ndespite the fact that no vaccine exists and scientists believe that it \nis unlikely that a HIV vaccine will be developed anytime soon.\n  Some of the HIV Vaccine Awareness Day events supported in the past \ninclude various lunch and dinner receptions, a fashion show in \nMassachusetts, a bar night in Tennessee, a bar event and entertainment \ncontest in Washington, and other gatherings and media events. Clearly, \nthis awareness campaign serves no obvious public health or scientific \nvalue.\n  There is no doubt, however, that development of an HIV/AIDS vaccine \nshould be a national priority. HIV/AIDS continues to devastate \ncommunities in the United States and around the world. At least 56,000 \nAmericans become infected with HIV each year. More than 33 million \npeople are living with HIV around the world, with more than 2.5 million \nnew infections each year. To date, more than 20 million men, women and \nchildren are believed to have died from AIDS worldwide.\n  The development of a safe and effective HIV vaccine should be among \nour Nation's highest health care priorities. It imperative that not a \nsingle dollar of the Federal funds set aside for the development of an \neffective HIV vaccine is wasted.\n  This year, Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases, NIAID, highlighted what he called \n``significant progress in HIV vaccine research during the past year.'' \nThe study he referred to was a clinical trial in Thailand finding a \nvaccine to be 31 percent effective at preventing HIV infection. \nUnfortunately, the results of this study have been found to be \nstatistically insignificant and the findings of the study have received \nmuch skepticism. This latest clinical trial is the latest in a long \nline of promising but unsuccessful attempts at creating an HIV/AIDS \nvaccine.\n  Dr. Fauci in recent years has conceded publicly that no one has been \nvery close to developing a vaccine that would prevent infection. Over \nthe past 5 years, in fact, two large clinical trials of HIV vaccines \nhave failed to demonstrate efficacy of the candidate being tested. The \ndisputed Thailand trial aside, this is still the case today.\n  Most scientists involved in AIDS research believe that an HIV vaccine \nis further away than ever and some have admitted that effective \nimmunization against the virus may never be possible, according to a \nsurvey conducted released in 2008.\n  A poll of scientists reflects the declaration made at a NIH ``summit \nmeeting'' in 2008 that was ``tantamount to an admission that almost no \nprogress has been made in the search for an AIDS vaccine in the past 25 \nyears and that something close to new start is necessary.'' The \ngovernment scientists announced that ``more of their budget needs to be \nspent on basic lab research and less on testing the current crop of \nvaccines, none of which has proved useful in human trials.'' In light \nof these failures and daunting prospects, Dr. Fauci pledged to re-\nevaluate the use of all $1.5 billion his agency spends on AIDS noting \nthat ``we are going to have to justify what we are doing.''\n  Dr. Anthony Fauci has noted that while Federal funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, continues to increase, it will not \nincrease as quickly as it has the past decade, and as a result, NIH \nmust concentrate on more promising research. Fauci said the heads of \nNIH institutes such as his had been told to reexamine the entire \nresearch portfolio to ensure ``the most bang for the buck.'' The AIDS \nvaccine candidates that don't show early results in clinical trials \ncould be shut down, he said.\n  That may mean cutting back some AIDS vaccine research even though \nvirtually all health experts agree a vaccine will be the only way to \nstop the pandemic of a virus that is incurable, always fatal and that \ncontinues to spread worldwide and in the U.S.\n  As I have done in the past, I am sending a letter today to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to inquire about this misuse of \nfunds. It is my sincere hope that the Department of Health and Human \nServices will cease spending Federal dollars on this misplaced priority \nand reinvest these HIV/AIDS dollars into actual research or care.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy letter dated May 18, 2010, to Secretary Kathleen Sebelius.\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   U.S. Senate\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 18, 2010.\n     Hon. Kathleen Sebelius,\n     Secretary, Department of Health and Human Services, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Sebelius: As a practicing physician and \n     former co-chair of the Presidential Advisory Council on HIV \n     and AIDS, I believe the development of a safe and effective \n     HIV vaccine should be among our nation's highest health care \n     priorities. HIV/AIDS continues to devastate communities in \n     the United States and around the world. In the United States, \n     more than 50,000 people become infected with HIV each year. \n     To date, more than 25 million men, women and children are \n     believed to have died from AIDS worldwide.\n       During this time of fiscal restraint when our nation is \n     faced with an approximately $13 trillion national debt and \n     over 1,000 individuals on waiting lists for life-saving HIV/\n     AIDS drug treatments, we must be careful that not a single \n     dollar that could pay off this debt or serve some other vital \n     service--such as developing an HIV vaccine--is diverted for \n     less important purposes.\n       According to the National Institute of Allergy and \n     Infectious Diseases (NIAID) website, May 18, 2010 marks the \n     thirteenth annual HIV Vaccine Awareness Day: ``This annual \n     observance is a day to recognize and thank the thousands of \n     volunteers, community members, health professionals, and \n     scientists who are working together to find a safe and \n     effective HIV vaccine. It is also a day to educate our \n     communities about the importance of preventive HIV vaccine \n     research.''\n       In addition to my concern that these funds are diverted \n     from the more important goals of developing a vaccine or \n     providing care to patients in need, HIV Vaccine Awareness Day \n     has been marked by specific examples of wasteful spending. In \n     the past, related expenditures have included various lunch \n     and dinner receptions, a fashion show in Massachusetts, a bar \n     night in Tennessee, a bar event and entertainment contest in \n     Washington, and other gatherings and media events.\n       Would you please provide:\n       (1) The total amount of federal funding that was spent to \n     promote ``HIV Awareness Day'' in 2010 and for each fiscal \n     year since its inception in 2001, including staff time and \n     travel costs;\n       (2) If this event is planned for next year please, an \n     estimate of its likely cost;\n       (3) A list of all organizations that received funding from \n     NIAID as part of ``HIV Vaccine Awareness Day'' since its \n     inception and a description of the activities performed with \n     these funds; and\n       (4) The total amount NIH has spent on actual HIV vaccine \n     research in each year from fiscal year 2001 through 2010.\n       Thank you for your attention to this request. I look \n     forward to a prompt reply.\n           Sincerely,\n     Senator Tom Coburn, MD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3905-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 REMEMBERING MARGARET JOAN MORGAN FOLEY\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Margaret Joan Morgan Foley. Mrs. Foley passed \naway on May 9 at her home in Visalia. She was 87 years old.\n  Margaret Foley was born in Dawson Springs, KY, on November 5, 1922. \nAfter obtaining her registered nursing license at the age of 21 from \nthe Salem School of Nursing, she enlisted in the U.S. Army in the fall \nof 1943. During World War II, she would serve in the Philippines and \nNagasaki, Japan.\n  Upon her return home, Mrs. Foley settled in Los Angeles where she \nworked as a surgical nurse at Saint Luke's Hospital. During this \nperiod, she met and married James Foley. A person of remarkable \ncharacter and determination, Mrs. Foley was undeterred by a bout with \ntuberculosis that required a 23-month stay at a sanitarium in Altadena, \nas she fought valiantly to full recovery and continued her education at \nthe University of Southern California.\n  In 1955, the Foleys moved north to Tulare, where Mr. Foley accepted a \njob as a reporter for the Tulare Advance-Register. Spurred on by a \nlifelong passion to improve the education, health and welfare of \nchildren and the poor, Mrs. Foley generously lent her time and \nconsiderable talents to a number of important community causes; the \nParent Teacher Association, the Tulare Mental Health Advisory Board, \nTulare County Legal Services, Tulare County Health System Agency, and \nthe Porterville State Board Hospital.\n  In 1969, Mrs. Foley resumed working as a part-time nurse at Kaweah \nDelta District Hospital. For the next 21 years, she successfully served \nas a nursing supervisor for neonatal care and eventually becoming the \nperinatal manager for the hospital until her retirement in 1990.\n  Mrs. Foley continued her commitment to help those who are less \nfortunate during her retirement. In 1990, she was elected to the Kaweah \nDelta Health Care District Board of Directors. For the next 20 years, \nshe would leave an indelible impact on the board through her tenures as \nits secretary, vice president, and president. As someone who was always \nwilling to lend a helping hand, she also served on the College of the \nSequoias Nursing Advisory Committee, the Good Samaritan Board, and as a \nstaff nurse at the Good News Clinic. Mrs. Foley embodied the best \nideals of volunteerism and public service.\n  A person of great warmth and humility, Mrs. Foley was admired by \nthose who knew her for her kindness, compassion and decency. She was \nthe inaugural recipient of the Tulare County Bar Association Liberty \nBell Award in 1976, the 1980 Visalia Chamber of Commerce Woman of the \nYear, 1983 College of the Sequoias Nursing Faculty's Nurse of the Year \nand, most recently, the 2006 Rose Ann Vuich Ethical Leadership Award, a \nwell-deserved and prestigious award that celebrates excellence and \nintegrity in public service.\n  Margaret Foley devoted most of her life to making a positive impact \non the lives of others. Mrs. Foley's generously gave her boundless \ncompassion and precious humanity to uplifting and empowering those who \nare most often neglected in our society: the young and the poor. Mrs. \nFoley has left behind a legacy of service and the admiration of those \nwhose lives she touched over the years. She will be dearly missed.\n  Mrs. Foley was preceded in death by her husband Jim; her parents \nWilliam Roderick and Florence Pugh Morgan; two brothers, Roderick \nWilliam and John Paul Morgan; and a sister Ann Trader Schweiger. She is \nsurvived by her children, James and his wife Penelope Applegarth; John \nand his wife Anne Bird; Morgan and his wife Sandra Platt; Sara Foley \nFox and her husband Michael; and Patricia Foley Teaford and her husband \nElliott; seven grandchildren; and two brothers, William Radtke and \nJames Trader.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3905-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3905-S3906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TRIBUTE TO UNDERSHERIFF VALERIE HILL\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am honored to recognize \nundersheriff Valerie Hill as she retires from the Riverside County \nSheriff's Department. Undersheriff Hill, the highest ranking female in \nlaw enforcement in Riverside County, has served the people and the \ncounty of Riverside for over 30 years.\n  When Undersheriff Hill joined the Riverside County Sheriff's \nDepartment in 1977, she was assigned patrol duties in Lake Elsinore and \nlater worked in the Riverside and Moreno Valley stations. As a \nsergeant, she served in Corrections and also at the Moreno Valley \nstation. Over the course of her career she has had many other \nassignments within the Sheriff's Department. As assistant sheriff she \nwas responsible for Corrections Division, Court Services and CAL-ID. \nHer numerous assignments over the past 30 years have given her the \nopportunity to become actively involved in the changes occurring in \nRiverside County.\n  Undersheriff Hill was the department's first female hostage \nnegotiator, first female field training officer, first female assistant \nsheriff, and first female undersheriff. She was also one of two \nindividuals instrumental in the development of the Special Enforcement \nTeam (S.E.T.), which is a highly successful enforcement team in Moreno \nValley.\n  Believing that community service extends beyond her duties in the \ndepartment, Undersheriff Hill serves on numerous boards and committees, \nwhich include: Operation SafeHouse (board president), Riverside Area \nRape Crisis Center (2006 and 2007 board president), Southern California \nJail Managers Association (2006 president), YWCA (Evening of \nAchievement chairperson), and is an active member of the Kiwanis Club \nof Riverside. She volunteers two Sunday evenings a month through her \nchurch at a ``hot meal'' program that feeds the needy. She believes \n``We make a living by what we get but, we make a life by what we \ngive.''\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\n  Undersheriff Hill was honored by the YWCA in 2002 as a Woman of \nAchievement and in 2004 by the Inland Empire Magazine as a ``Woman Who \nMakes a Difference.'' In 2005 she was presented the Gold Key Award by \nSoroptimist International and in 2007 she was presented the Lifetime \nAchievement Award by the Law Enforcement Appreciation Committee (LEAC).\n  It is my pleasure to recognize Undersheriff Valerie Hill as she \nprepares to retire from the Riverside County Sheriff's Department, \nthough I hope she continues her fine service to her community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3906-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ADMIRAL THAD W. ALLEN\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to talk about the \nU.S. Coast Guard and to recognize the 39 years of exemplary service, \ndedication and leadership that ADM Thad W. Allen has given to the U.S. \nCoast Guard and the Nation.\n  Since 1790, the U.S. Coast Guard has been America's Maritime \nGuardian; the sentinel of the sea, determined to protect the safety and \nsecurity of the maritime industry. As a multimission military service, \nthe U.S. Coast Guard is unlike any other military branch in the world. \nThe Coast Guard is the fifth branch of the U.S. Armed Forces, the \nlargest component of the Department of Homeland Security, a member of \nthe National Intelligence Community, and the lead U.S. representative \nat the International Maritime Organization. The Coast Guard is the \nNation's oldest, continuous seagoing service and has fought in every \nmajor armed conflict the Nation has faced. The service embodies their \nmotto--Semper Paratus--Always Ready. Here to protect and serve; ready \nto rescue, the Coast Guard routinely is at its best when weather \nconditions are at their worst. Coast Guard servicemen and women \nthroughout the Nation routinely exhibit selfless sacrifice and enduring \nservice, traits that are exuded by their Commandant, ADM Thad Allen.\n  Throughout his long and distinguished career, those who have been \nable to observe and admire Admiral Allen's devotion to the Coast Guard, \nhave been nothing short of inspired by his honesty, integrity, \ndetermination, and calming influence even in the face of an impending \ndisaster. We all remember the leadership that Admiral Allen \ndemonstrated as he led the Coast Guard in efforts to secure ports along \nthe Atlantic seaboard after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. \nSeveral years later, Admiral Allen was again in the national spotlight \nwhile serving as the principal Federal official for the response and \nrecovery efforts in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Through \nhis leadership and the heroic efforts of the men and women of the Coast \nGuard, over 33,500 gulf coast residents were rescued from their \nrooftops and flood homes, which included the rescuing of 24,135 people \nthat were saved from eminent peril and the evacuation of 9,409 medical \npatients to safety. Most recently, Admiral Allen was selected by the \nObama administration to be the national incident coordinator, a role \nthat makes him responsible to oversee the Federal response to the \nDeepwater Horizon oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I have been fortunate enough to work with Admiral Allen on so many \nissues, including one we are both passionate about, the Arctic. Through \nhis leadership and direction, the Coast Guard is evaluating their role \nin the Arctic and providing the strongest voice for the strategic and \ngeopolitical importance of the region. Through his astute mind and \nunrelenting commitment to the betterment of this Nation, Admiral Allen \nhas been an unwavering champion for an expanded U.S. role and presence \nin the Arctic. While many will argue that as ice recedes in the Arctic, \nso do the dangers and a Coast Guard presence in the region is not \nneeded. Unfortunately the opposite is true. As the Arctic ice recedes, \nmore commercial shipping, cruise ships and energy companies are \nincreasing their presence, and as a larger contiguous zone and \nexclusive economic zone are revealed as the ice recedes, the more the \njurisdiction of the Coast Guard expands. Admiral Allen, while not \nengaging in the debate surrounding climate change, clearly understands \nthat more ice-free ocean in the Arctic region means more area that the \nCoast Guard is responsible for in the Arctic. By championing the \nNational Security Presidential Directive on the Arctic, Admiral Allen \nwas able to host a trip of Bush administration officials to the Arctic \nso that they were able to see and understand first-hand the conditions \nand operational challenges that exist in this vast and remote region.\n  It has been a great honor to have served alongside Admiral Allen and \nthe Coast Guard during his time as Commandant. I have no doubt that he \nwill continue to serve this Nation as a private citizen after his \nretirement from the service. He has left the Coast Guard on more sound \nand stable footing than he found it and has been the reassuring face of \nso many historic events. I, along with the Coast Guard and the Nation, \nwill surely miss him. In the fine tradition of the sea-going services, \nI wish him ``Fair Winds and Following Seas.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3906-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3906-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3906]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/18/senate-section/article/S3906-4", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3906-S3907]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-5866.

                   \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 63--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \n TAIWAN SHOULD BE ACCORDED OBSERVER STATUS IN THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL \n                      AVIATION ORGANIZATION (ICAO)\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 63\n\n       Whereas the Convention on International Civil Aviation, \n     signed in Chicago, Illinois, on December 7, 1944, and entered \n     into force April 4, 1947, approved the establishment of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), stating \n     ``The aims and objectives of the Organization are to develop \n     the principles and techniques of international air navigation \n     and to foster the planning and development of international \n     air transport so as to . . . meet the needs of the peoples of \n     the world for safe, regular, efficient and economical air \n     transport'';\n       Whereas, following the terrorist attacks of September 11, \n     2001, the ICAO convened a High-level Ministerial Conference \n     on Aviation Security that endorsed a global strategy for \n     strengthening aviation security worldwide and issued a public \n     declaration that ``a uniform approach in a global system is \n     essential to ensure aviation security throughout the world \n     and that deficiencies in any part of the system constitute a \n     threat to the entire global system,'' and that there should \n     be a commitment to ``foster international cooperation in the \n     field of aviation security and harmonize the implementation \n     of security measures'';\n       Whereas, on January 22, 2010, the Secretary General of the \n     ICAO stated, ``The attempted sabotage of Northwest Airlines \n     Flight 253 on December 25, 2009 is a vivid reminder that \n     security threats transcend national boundaries and can only \n     be properly addressed through a global strategy based on \n     effective international cooperation.'';\n       Whereas the Taipei Flight Information Region, under the \n     jurisdiction of the Republic of China (Taiwan), covers an \n     airspace of 176,000 square nautical miles and provides air \n     traffic control services to over 1,350,000 flights annually \n     along 12 international and 4 domestic air routes;\n       Whereas over 174,000 international flights carrying more \n     than 35,000,000 passengers travel to and from Taiwan \n     annually, reflecting its importance as an air transport hub \n     linking Northeast and Southeast Asia;\n       Whereas a total of 30 airlines, 23 of which are foreign-\n     owned, provide scheduled flights to Taiwan;\n       Whereas airports in Taiwan handle more than 1,580,000 \n     metric tons of air cargo annually;\n       Whereas Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport was ranked in \n     2009 by the Airports Council International as the world's 8th \n     and 18th largest airport by international cargo volume and \n     number of International passengers, respectively;\n       Whereas exclusion from the ICAO since 1971 has impeded the \n     efforts of the Government of Taiwan to maintain civil \n     aviation practices that comport with evolving international \n     standards, due to its inability to contact the ICAO for up-\n     to-date information on aviation standards and norms, secure \n     amendments to the organization's regulations in a timely \n     manner, obtain sufficient and timely information needed to \n     prepare for the implementation of new systems and procedures \n     set forth by the ICAO, receive technical assistance in \n     implementing new regulations, and participate in technical \n     and academic seminars hosted by the ICAO;\n       Whereas, despite these impediments and irrespective of its \n     inability to participate in the ICAO, the Government of \n     Taiwan has made every effort to comply with the operating \n     procedures and guidelines set forth by the organization;\n       Whereas, despite this effort, the exclusion of Taiwan from \n     the ICAO has prevented the organization from developing a \n     truly global strategy to address security threats based on \n     effective international cooperation, thereby hindering the \n     fulfillment of its overarching mission to ``meet the needs of \n     the peoples of the world for safe, regular, efficient and \n     economical air transport'';\n       Whereas the United States, in the 1994 Taiwan Policy \n     Review, clearly declared its support for the participation of \n     Taiwan in appropriate international organizations, in \n     particular, on September 27, 1994, with the announcement by \n     the Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific \n     Affairs that, pursuant to the Review and recognizing Taiwan's \n     important role in transnational issues, the United States \n     ``will support its membership in organizations where \n     statehood is not a prerequisite, and [the United States] will \n     support opportunities for Taiwan's voice to be heard in \n     organizations where its membership is not possible'';\n       Whereas section 4(d) of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. \n     3303(d)) declares, ``Nothing in this Act may be construed as \n     a basis for supporting the exclusion or expulsion of Taiwan \n     from continued membership in any international financial \n     institution or any other international organization.''; and\n       Whereas ICAO rules and existing practices have allowed for \n     the meaningful participation of noncontracting countries as \n     well as other bodies in its meetings and activities through \n     granting of observer status: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) meaningful participation by the Government of Taiwan as \n     an observer in the meetings and activities of the \n     International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) will \n     contribute both to the fulfillment of the ICAO's overarching \n     mission and to the success of a global strategy to address \n     aviation security threats based on effective international \n     cooperation;\n       (2) the United States Government should take a leading role \n     in gaining international support for the granting of observer \n     status to Taiwan in the ICAO for the purpose of such \n     participation; and\n       (3) the Department of State should provide briefings to or \n     consult with Congress on any efforts conducted by the United \n     States Government in support of Taiwan's progress toward \n     observer status in the ICAO.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url":

activity may request, in writing, \n     an opportunity for a written or oral hearing before the \n     Council to demonstrate that the proposed designation or \n     rescission of designation is not

request, unless extended at the request of the \n     financial market utility or financial institution, and place \n     at which the financial market utility or financial \n     institution may

than \\2/3\\ of all members then serving, including an \n     affirmative vote by the Chairperson, that the waiver or \n     modification is necessary to prevent or mitigate an immediate \n     threat to the financial system posed by the financial market \n     utility or the payment, clearing, or settlement activity.\n       (B) Notice of waiver or modification.--The Council shall \n     provide
