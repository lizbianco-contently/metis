Madam President, from the very outset of the debate \nover\n\n[[Page S10444]]\n\nhealth care, Americans have made it known that they support reform. But \nover the course of the past several months, Americans have come to \nrealize that not all reforms are created equal.\n  And while they still support reform, very few of them support the \nspecific proposals they have seen from Democrats in Washington. \nAmericans want reform. But higher premiums, higher taxes, and cutting \nMedicare is not reform.\n  Somewhere along the way, the terms of the debate shifted.\n  At the outset, nobody expected that reform would lead to higher \npremiums. In fact, most people thought the whole point was to reduce \ncosts, not raise them.\n  At the outset of this debate, nobody expected they would be paying \nhigher taxes, particularly in the midst of the worst recession in \ngenerations. Yet that is what they are now being told, that middle \nclass Americans will take the brunt of a whole slew of new taxes to pay \nfor a trillion-dollar experiment with our health care system.\n  And at the outset of this debate, seniors had no idea they would be \nasked to help foot the bill for this massive experiment in government \nhealth care through cuts to Medicare. Yet that is precisely what \nthey're now being told--that Medicare will be cut by half a trillion \ndollars, whether the 40 million seniors who depend on it like it or \nnot.\n  Let us focus for a moment on those Medicare cuts.\n  For months, Americans have been hearing that if they like the health \ncare plans they have, they will be able to keep them. Evidently, that \npledge didn't apply to the millions of seniors currently enrolled in \nthe popular Medicare Advantage program, because the Finance Committee \nbill explicitly calls for more than $130 billion in cuts to Medicare \nAdvantage, cuts that will undoubtedly alter the plans that more than 11 \nmillion seniors on Medicare Advantage now enjoy.\n  These cuts might lead to fewer benefits; or they might force seniors \noff their plans altogether. But under either scenario, seniors would no \nlonger enjoy the plans they have and like. No one expected that at the \noutset of this debate.\n  And this is just a fraction of the Medicare cuts that the Finance \nCommittee calls for as the cost of reform. Other cuts include more than \n$120 billion in cuts to hospitals that care for seniors. The Kentucky \nHospital Association warned earlier this year that these kinds of cuts \nwould affect the services hospitals provide in my State. I am sure if \nmy colleagues talked to doctors and hospitals back home, they would \nhear the same.\n  Then there is more than $40 billion in cuts to home health agencies \nwhich give seniors the option of receiving care in their homes.\n  The bill also takes another $15 billion in cuts to nursing home which \ncare for seniors who can no longer be cared for at home.\n  And then there is nearly $8 billion in cuts to hospice care.\n  Nobody expected a free lunch when it came to health care reform. But \nno one expected this either. Americans are doing the cost-benefit \nanalysis, and they don't think half a trillion dollars in cuts to \nMedicare is an acceptable tradeoff, especially since none of these cuts \nwould do anything to strengthen and protect Medicare.\n  It would be one thing if Medicare reforms were used to ensure its \nsolvency for future generations. But the proposals we have seen do \nnothing of the sort. Instead, they use Medicare as a piggy bank to \ncreate another government program that will undoubtedly face the same \nfinancial stresses that we see in Medicare and in just about every \nother entitlement program.\n  The President thought this was a bad idea on the campaign trail. It \nis still a bad idea today.\n  Americans know the dangers of holding off on Medicare reform. When \nMedicare Part A was created in 1965, it was projected to spend out $9.1 \nbillion on hospital services and related administration in 1990. As it \nturned out, costs that year were more than seven times the original \nestimates. Forty-four years after its creation, Medicare is already \npaying out more money than it is taking in. It is already committed to \nspend nearly $40 trillion it doesn't have, and current forecasts \nindicate that Medicare will face bankruptcy in less than a decade.\n  It is time to restore this vital program for the sake of our seniors, \nnot raid it to pay for a massive government-driven experiment that \ncould make our health care worse.\n  The American people want reform. But higher premiums, higher taxes, \nand cutting Medicare, that is not reform. That is why they \noverwhelmingly oppose this proposal, and they shouldn't have to \napologize for it. They should expect Congress to listen to them, and \nkeep up the pressure until Congress listens.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10444-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10444]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to take 10 minutes this morning to \nrespond to some comments made by my friend from Illinois, my \ncounterpart, the Democratic whip, comments made in response to Minority \nLeader McConnell's remarks earlier this week.\n  Yesterday, Senator Durbin made a couple of points. One I specifically \nwant to focus on has to do with the national debt. Senator McConnell \nhad talked about the fact that spending by the Democrats, especially \nwith regard to proposals for new health care legislation, was going to \nincrease the national debt. The Senator from Illinois came back and \nsaid he agreed the debt is too high, but he said we need to understand \nthat the reason it is too high is the Bush administration--that, in \neffect, President Obama inherited the debt. That is not exactly \naccurate. Here are the actual facts regarding the debt today. On \nTuesday, 2 days ago, the Treasury Department reported that the deficit \nthis past fiscal year totaled $1.4 trillion. That is a figure higher \nthan the previous 4 years combined. The previous 4 years were Bush \nyears. Last year was primarily the Obama administration.\n  The Republican leader said:\n\n       Since January 20 of this year, the Federal Government has \n     borrowed $1.2 trillion or more than $10,500 for every \n     household in the United States.\n\n  What is the significance of January 20? That is the day President \nObama was sworn in as President.\n  Under the President's budget that every Democrat voted for this year, \nwe will have budget shortfalls or deficits averaging $1 trillion each \nyear for the next 10 years. We can't blame this on the Bush \nadministration if spending was as much as the last 4 years combined and \nthe budget shortfall is going to be $1 trillion for the next 10 years. \nIt was never $1 trillion. It wasn't even half that much ever under \nPresident Bush.\n  Let me put this in perspective. The President's budget, supported by \nevery Democrat, will double the national debt in 5 years, increasing it \nfrom $5.8 trillion to $11.7 trillion. It would almost triple the debt \nin 10 years. These are estimates from the Congressional Budget Office. \nBy contrast, look at the last 219 years in the history of the country. \nFrom 1789 to 2008, Americans amassed a $5.8 trillion national debt. In \nother words, in 5 years, this President will have a debt equal to all \nof the previous Presidents from George Washington all the way through \nGeorge W. Bush. We cannot claim that is inherited from the past.\n\n  This President's deficit spending is not sustainable. By the end of \nthe budget period, the debt will have skyrocketed to 82 percent of the \ngross domestic product, which everyone agrees, including the \nPresident's advisers, is not sustainable. Think about the interest \npayments. Think about your own credit card interest payments for \ninterest payments on debt. These will soon\n\n[[Page S10445]]\n\nbe the single largest item in the Federal budget.\n  What if debt interest payments were the single largest item in your \nown family budget? More than $800 billion a year in 10 years will be \nspent on interest alone--$800 billion a year. That eclipses what we \nspend on national security. It is four times as much as we spend on \neducation, energy, and transportation combined. These are not abstract \nnumbers. This will have an effect on every American.\n  In 2019, under the President's plan, each U.S. household's share of \nthe Federal debt will be more than $130,000. That is more than most of \nus owe on our mortgages. Notably, since the Democrats have taken over \nthe Congress--we are not talking about ``inherited'' now--the Congress \nhas increased the debt limit four times, and the administration has \nmade a request for a fifth increase that we anticipate occurring this \nNovember.\n  So should we be worried about the debt? I believe so. Was it a \nproblem inherited from the Bush administration? No. The real problem is \nwhat we have done since January 20, since President Obama came into \noffice, since Democrats have been in control of the Congress and the \nadoption of a budget which is going to triple our debt in just 10 \nyears. And in 5 years we will have more debt than every single \nPresident and Congress in the entire history of the country right up \nthrough George W. Bush accumulated--in one budget of this \nadministration.\n  The other thing I would like to speak to is comments the Senator from \nIllinois made on Tuesday. Again, he was critical of Senator McConnell, \nwho noted that all of these bills passed in the House and in the Senate \nwere passed on essentially partisan votes, and that Republican ideas \nhad been ignored. My colleague said: Well, in the HELP Committee there \nwere 150 amendments adopted that had been offered by Republicans. The \nvast majority of those were purely technical corrections, misspellings, \ntypos, and things of that sort. I do not think anybody can contend that \nRepublicans have had a fair voice in the creation of the health reform \nlegislation around here.\n  Then there was an attack on the messengers. There have been several \nreports that demonstrate that insurance premiums are going to go up, \nnot down, in this legislation. The attack was not to contend that the \nfigures were wrong but, rather, to attack the messengers--in two \ncases--to say: Well, the insurance industry actually paid for some of \nthose reports. Does that make the reports wrong? It might raise a \nquestion in our minds as to whether they are appropriate, but how about \nanalyzing them to see whether they are wrong.\n  The majority whip then went on to say that the Congressional Budget \nOffice even disagrees with the Republican leader and predicted that the \nhealth care premiums would actually not go up. Specifically, he said: \n``They predicted if health care reform went through, health care \ninsurance premiums would go up'' on American families.\n  The Senator from Illinois said:\n\n       Well, there are those who disagree, people with the \n     Congressional Budget Office and others. . . .\n\n  Let me quote the Congressional Budget Office. It does not disagree. \nThe Congressional Budget Office specifically supports what Senator \nMcConnell said:\n\n       Premiums in the new insurance exchanges would tend to be \n     higher than the average premiums in the current-law \n     individual market.\n\n  CBO was very clear in conversations we have had with them that \nspecifically with regard to American families premiums will be higher.\n  So the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, was correct and \nthe Democratic whip was incorrect. CBO says premiums will be higher.\n  This report issued yesterday from Oliver Wyman said premiums will \nincrease in the individual market approximately $1,500 for single \ncoverage and $3,300 for family coverage every year.\n  In my State and some other States it is even worse. For Arizona, \nIdaho, Kentucky, Virginia, and the District of Columbia, we will have \nthe highest premium increases, where premiums could increase by as much \nas $2,619 for individuals and--think about this--$7,426 for families. \nThink about that as a premium increase under a bill that is supposed to \nhelp us afford our health care, but we get socked with a $7,000 \nincrease in the health care premium for our families.\n  Part of this is because of the minimum benefit requirements the bill \nprovides for. They note this will increase costs about 10 percent in \nthe individual market and 3 percent in the small group market. This is \nunder the Baucus bill. Small employers purchasing new policies in this \nnew market will experience premiums that are up to 19 percent higher in \nyear 5 of the reform. Premiums are going up.\n  Milliman, another independent actuarial firm, found that the average \nactuarial value of a high deductible plan is 48 percent. In Arizona, \nincidentally, it is 61 percent. What does this mean? Under the \nlegislation, the lowest insurance plan value is defined by the Federal \nGovernment. It has to be 65 percent. That means there will be an \nincrease in health insurance premiums by 35 percent for those with high \ndeductible plans. Individuals enrolled in individual health plans with \na lower actuarial value than 65 percent will see their premiums \nincrease by 18 percent. So to the allegation that somehow Republicans \nare wrong when we criticize the Baucus bill for raising individual and \nfamily insurance premiums, the reality is, all the experts agree, \nincluding the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Then there was another question that had to do with medical devices. \nThe reality is, because of taxes imposed in the Baucus bill, there are \ngoing to be a lot of increased expenses, including expenses that are \ngoing to be passed on to individuals. One of those is in the medical \ndevice industry.\n  Let me quote a letter that some Democratic colleagues of ours--\nSenators Klobuchar, Bayh, and Franken and then Senator Lugar on the \nRepublican side sent to Chairman Baucus. I am quoting from it:\n\n       [T]he provision would harm economic development and health \n     care innovation nationwide.\n       [W]e are concerned that this tax will stifle technological \n     innovations that can improve patient outcomes and lower \n     health care costs.\n\n  It is also a fact, as I said, that these expenses are passed through. \nThere are several studies that demonstrate that--as well as the \ncomments of the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax \nCommittee--all of whom say it is virtually a dollar-for-dollar \npassthrough. So if we raise taxes on the medical device industry by $40 \nbillion, then people are going to be paying $40 billion more in \ninsurance premiums because the cost of those medical devices will be \nreflected in the cost to the insurer and, therefore, the cost to the \npeople who are paying the premiums.\n  There was a concern expressed by my colleague from Illinois that \ninsurance companies will raise their premiums--the point I have been \nmaking--but they will do it in a collusive fashion and maybe we should \nlook at the antitrust laws in that regard.\n  Well, they do not have to collude to raise their premiums. Every one \nof them has an incentive--as the Congressional Budget Office and these \nother reports demonstrate--for them to be able to stay in business; \nthey have to be able to raise their premiums to reflect their cost of \ndoing business. They do not have to collude to do that.\n  Then the Democratic whip made what I would say is a rather odd \nargument: Republicans have been critical of the concept of government-\nrun insurance. The Democratic whip said: Well, we have government-run \ninsurance--Federal employees and Members of Congress--and we think it \nis a good program. And he said under the program, there are nine \ndifferent health plans to choose from, and we pick the best one for us, \nand the employer pays part of it and we pay part of it, and so on.\n  That certainly is all true, except for one thing: It is not \ngovernment run. As he noted, there are nine private plans. This is no \ndifferent than any other employer. Most large employers, such as the \nFederal Government, give their employees a choice of two, three, four, \nmaybe sometimes as many as nine or ten plans if they are a big enough \nemployer. The Federal Government is a huge employer, so we can offer \nnine different plans. But there is no Federal insurance. This is not \nfederally run.\n  This is the Federal Government as the employer doing the same thing\n\n[[Page S10446]]\n\nthat Honeywell as an employer would do for its employees. It gets three \nor four insurance companies with different kinds of plans and says to \nits employees: We will pay for part of the cost. You get to pay for the \nrest of it. That is not federally run or government-run insurance. So \nthe Democratic whip is simply wrong when he says the plan Members of \nCongress and Federal employees have is government run. That is simply \nnot true.\n  I mentioned the medical device issue. I would note Senator Kerry is \nanother one of our colleagues who, like me and like others, has \nexpressed concerns about this issue because of the fact that the taxes \npaid by the medical device industry will, in fact, be passed on to \nconsumers.\n  Finally, the Democratic whip asked where the Republican health care \nplan is. I do not know how many times we have to repeat this, but let \nme do it one more time. Time and time again, we have said: Here are \nthings we believe will reduce the cost of health care, will help people \nget coverage who do not have it now, and will reform the system.\n\n  What are some of the ideas we have proposed? By the way, each of \nthese were offered as amendments in the HELP Committee and in the \nFinance Committee and in the House of Representatives, and Democrats \nvoted against every one of them every time. So it is not as if we do \nnot have ideas and alternatives that would solve specific problems, it \nis that the Democrats do not like the ideas and, therefore, have \nrejected them. But I will repeat a couple of them one more time.\n  Republicans lead with medical malpractice reform, to try to do \nsomething about this jackpot justice system where lawyers end up \ngetting most of the money, and doctors and hospitals have to practice \ndefensive medicine to anticipate litigation and to be able to protect \nthemselves against it. There are estimates: as much as 10 cent out of \nevery health care dollar spent is on premiums that doctors have to pay \nfor their liability insurance. There is over $100 billion a year that \ncan be saved from defensive medicine practices if we are able to have \nmedical malpractice reform. The CBO even scored it--in a very narrow \nway--at $54 billion just in savings to the Federal Government.\n  As my colleague, Senator Ensign, pointed out in an exchange with the \nCBO Director in the Finance Committee, one could anticipate that about \ntwice that much savings would occur if we add in all of the savings to \nthe private sector as well. So we could be talking about well over $100 \nbillion in savings. This is a huge amount of money. It does not cost \nthe Federal Government a dime. It makes the system more fair, and it is \na savings that can be passed on in the form of lower premiums and lower \nhealth care costs.\n  Another idea we have talked about a lot--you have heard it--the sale \nof insurance across State lines. Let's make the insurance companies \nhave to compete with each other. Sometimes they have little monopolies; \nthere are only two or three companies in a particular State. Well, if \nwe could buy our health insurance like we can buy our casualty \ninsurance, our homes or our car insurance, from any company anywhere in \nthe country, those insurance companies in our States would have to be \nbetter competitors. My guess is they would lower our rates and they \nwould give us better benefits. That competition would help us. Again, \nit does not cost a dime.\n  How about association health plans, letting small businesses and \ngroups band together to create larger risk pools? Risk pools help \ndefine the coverage. If we have a big risk pool, chances are we can get \ncheaper coverage. If we have a small risk pool, it is hard. That is why \nsmall businesses find it so hard. So we talk about larger risk pools \nthrough association health plans.\n  Madam President, I think I have exceeded my 10 minutes. We could go \non and on with Republican ideas that have been proposed but get shot \ndown by the Democrats. So it is not a matter of looking for a \nRepublican proposal.\n  Let me conclude with this: It is true that Republicans will probably \nnot propose a massive trillion-dollar bill as the Democrats have. That \nis true. We are not going to because we do not do 1,000-page bills in \nthe Congress very well. We do not know the consequences of them. The \ncost is always enormous.\n  Republicans have a better approach. We believe we should do this step \nby step: First, regain the trust of the American people that we can do \nit right, and that we are listening to them about what they want rather \nthan coming up with some grand scheme that a bunch of staffers and \nconsultants in Washington, DC, came up with.\n  Let's listen to the American people, hear what it is they want. They \ndo not want a massive, big spending bill that is going to add to our \ndeficit, that is going to raise their taxes and raise their insurance \npremiums, and, in the end, not insure very many more Americans. That is \nnot reform.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague from Tennessee is in the Chamber. \nHe has been an eloquent spokesman on this issue, and I am pleased to \nyield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from \nArizona for identifying so well, among other things, how Republicans \nwould like to approach the health care reform costs. We want to reduce \ncosts for individuals who are buying insurance, and we want to reduce \nthe cost of our government. Rather than a comprehensive 1,000-page, \ntrillion-dollar bill filled with surprises, we prefer to go step by \nstep in the right direction; that is, reducing costs.\n  The Senator from Arizona has mentioned ways to do that. Whether it is \nallowing small businesses to pool their resources, which could add \nmillions of people to the rolls of the insured in the country, whether \nit is reducing junk lawsuits against doctors, whether it is allowing \nfor the buying of insurance across State lines or health insurance \nexchanges or using health information technology, we can take steps in \nthe right direction to regain the trust of the American people and move \ntoward reducing costs.\n  The Senator also did a very clear job of pointing out how the Baucus \nbill may actually increase costs. There has been a lot of squirming \naround on the other side because it has been suggested that instead of \npremiums going down--which is the whole point of this exercise, \nreducing costs--they might go up. I would like to talk about that a \nlittle bit today.\n\n  Premiums, your premiums--and let's talk about who the ``you'' is. We \nhave about 170 million Americans who have employer-based insurance, and \nwe have a total of about 250 million Americans--that is most of us--who \nhave some kind of insurance premium that either we pay or is paid for \nus. I think our goal is to make it easier to afford those premiums; in \nother words, to reduce costs. But the Baucus bill, in at least four \nways, increases costs, and raises premiums.\n  One way is it reduces the penalty for individuals and families who \nare required to buy insurance so they might not buy insurance, and if \nthe young and healthy go out of the insurance pool, premiums of \neverybody who is in the insurance pool go up.\n  No. 2, the Baucus bill will say--and so do the other bills the \nDemocrats have presented--that my children, who pay lower premiums than \nI do, will have higher premiums because under the law there can't be as \nmuch difference between what an older person pays and what a younger \nperson pays. So for most young Americans who buy insurance--and in this \ncase they will be required to buy insurance or pay a penalty, so their \npremiums go up.\n  There is a third reason premiums go up. Premiums will go up because, \nwhen you buy insurance, you don't just get to buy any kind of \ninsurance; you buy a government-approved, basic policy. It sounds like \na little more Washington takeover to me. When you go out to buy your \ngovernment-approved, basic policy, what you will find under this bill \nis that for millions of Americans, it will cost you more. Your premiums \nwill go up. There are a great many Americans who make the sensible \ndecision of buying a high deductible policy. They say: I will pay most \nof my health care costs up to a point, but I will buy the insurance for \nthe catastrophe in my life that I could never afford. Well, those \npolicies will not be as available.\n  Then, finally, there are going to be $955 billion in new taxes. The \nbill is very careful about not placing them directly on you; it puts \nthem on everybody you buy things from. It puts them\n\n[[Page S10447]]\n\non people from whom you buy your medical devices; it puts them on \npeople from whom you buy your health insurance. We all know what will \nhappen when we put taxes on people from whom we buy things. If we put \ntaxes on oil companies, what happens? They pass it on to us at the gas \npump. If you put taxes on all these health care services, what happens? \nOur insurance premiums go up.\n  So one does not have to be an actuary to figure this out. If the \nindividual mandate penalty is weaker, premiums go up. If young people \ncan't buy cheaper policies--cheaper than mine if there is a rule--their \npremiums go up. If we all have to buy government-approved policies, or \nmost of us do, that are richer than what many of us want to buy today, \nour premiums go up. If we have $955 billion in new taxes when the bill \nis fully implemented, most of which are passed along to us, our \npremiums go up.\n  So I would ask this question: What is this exercise all about? I \nthought it was about reducing costs. I thought it was about lowering \nthe cost of our insurance premiums. But it looks as though it will \nincrease the cost of our insurance premiums and, if that is true, we \nought to reject this bill for that one reason alone. Of course, we \nhaven't even seen the bill. It is not written yet. It has to be \ncombined by the majority leader in a dark office somewhere and then we \nwill see it. But that is what we should be looking for.\n  It is often said that--that is another reason why the Republican idea \nof a step-by-step approach to reduce costs makes a lot more sense than \nthese big, comprehensive, 1,000-page, $1 trillion bills. We want to \nreduce the cost of insurance, but we don't want to pass a bill that \nraises premiums to do that.\n  It has been said there is not much bipartisanship.\n  Madam President, I hope you will please let me know when I have \nconsumed 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will notify the Senator.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Again, it has been said there is not much \nbipartisanship in this debate. That is not true. There has been a \npartisan rejection of a bipartisan bill. Fourteen of us signed up on \nthe bill which Senator Wyden, a Democrat, and Senator Bennett, a \nRepublican, offered.\n  There is another option the various committees had. It didn't \nincrease the debt a penny. It gave people more choices. It didn't have \na new government program. It had a lot of good principles in it, but \nthat was rejected. That didn't get the time of day, no more than the \nRepublican step-by-step proposals, but there are other bipartisan \nefforts other than Wyden-Bennett. There is the Reid amendment offered \nby the majority leader. He became concerned about how the Baucus bill \nwas going to transfer to the State of Nevada big, new Medicaid costs \nthat might result in new taxes. Every single Governor in the country is \nconcerned about that, Democratic or Republican. So the majority leader \nfixed the problem for Nevada and three other States. We will call that \nthe Reid amendment and when this bill comes to the floor we are going \nto introduce a Reid amendment and we are all going to support it \nbecause we want it for Texas, we want it for South Dakota, we want it \nfor New York, we want it for California. If the Federal Government is \ngoing to expand Medicaid, the Federal Government needs to pay for the \nMedicaid expansion and not send it to the States. So that will be a \nbipartisan step.\n  Then there is another bipartisan step, and that was from eight \nDemocratic Senators who wrote in and said: We want to be able to read \nthe bill and know what it costs before we start voting on it. All 40 of \nus agree with that on the Republican side and we believe that is the \nright thing to do: Put it on the Internet for 72 hours. Senator Bunning \nhas offered an amendment for that. That now has bipartisan support.\n  That means, when this bill is finally written--it is not a bill yet--\nwhen it comes out of the back rooms, it will at least be on the \nInternet for 72 hours. Then we will need to have a complete fiscal \nestimate. That ought to take a couple or 3 weeks. Then we need to come \nto the floor and debate it because we need to know: Are your premiums \ngoing up or down? Are taxes going up or down? What about these Medicare \ncuts: $500 billion in Medicare cuts not spent to restore Medicare but \nfor a new government program, I think. My point is, there are a number \nof questions that need to be answered.\n  Let me conclude in this way: We have a bipartisan approach. We want \nto read the bill and know what it costs. Enough of us do that, so I \nthink we will do that, and we will have at least as good a debate as we \ndid on the farm bill. That took a month. The Energy bill took 2 or 3 \nmonths. This is one-sixth of the economy, and we will need several \nweeks to talk. What will we be talking about? We will be talking \nabout--at least I will be talking about--whether this bill is reform; \nwhether it will reduce costs, and whether it will raise your premiums \nor lower your premiums. If it weakens the individual mandate; if it \nsays young people can't buy inexpensive policies anymore; if it says \nmillions of us have to buy government-approved, richer policies instead \nof policies with high deductibles; and if it imposes $955 billion of \ntaxes that will be passed on, raising our premiums; if it raises our \npremiums instead of lowering our premiums, then why are we doing this?\n  That is not health care reform. That is not reducing costs. We should \ninstead take the Republican approach and go step by step to reduce \ncosts starting with small business health care plans, reducing junk \nlawsuits, allowing insurance to be sold across State lines, creating \nhealth insurance exchanges, implementing health information technology, \nand changing tax incentives.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to pick up where my colleague from \nTennessee left off and talk a little bit about this issue that is \nbefore us and before the country right now, the issue of health care \nreform. I would submit to my colleagues in the Senate that the purpose \nof reform, as has been stated now for many years as reform has been \ntalked about, is that we have to do something to get health care costs \nunder control. We have to rein in these increasing, double-digit, every \nyear inflationary increases people are seeing in their health care \ncosts. So the purpose of health care reform, as stated, is to lower the \ncosts of health care for people in this country, as well as to extend \ncoverage, provide access to coverage for those who don't normally have \nit, which, as has been noted in the past, is about 15 percent of the \npopulation. About 85 percent of the people in this country do have \nhealth care, and their concern is: What are we going to do to drive \ndown the costs of health care? What are we going to do to make my \nhealth insurance cost less and my health care coverage cost less?\n  In that vain, I wish to point out an article from yesterday in the \nWall Street Journal, which I would recommend to my colleagues and which \nwas written by former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have that article printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 13, 2009]\n\n                     The Baucus Bill Is a Tax Bill\n\n                        (By Douglas Holtz-Eakin)\n\n       Remember when health-care reform was supposed to make life \n     better for the middle class? That dream began to unravel this \n     past summer when Congress proposed a bill that failed to \n     include any competition-based reforms that would actually \n     bend the curve of health-care costs. It fell apart completely \n     when Democrats began papering over the gaping holes their \n     plan would rip in the federal budget.\n       As it now stands, the plan proposed by Democrats and the \n     Obama administration would not only fail to reduce the cost \n     burden on middle-class families, it would make that burden \n     significantly worse.\n       Consider the bill put forward by the Senate Finance \n     Committee. From a budgetary perspective, it is \n     straightforward. The bill creates a new health entitlement \n     program that the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates \n     will grow over the longer term at a rate of 8% annually, \n     which is much faster than the growth rate of the economy or \n     tax revenues. This is the same growth rate as the House bill \n     that Sen. Kent Conrad (D., N.D.) deep-sixed by asking the CBO \n     to tell the truth about its impact on health-care costs.\n       To avoid the fate of the House bill and achieve a veneer of \n     fiscal sensibility, the\n\n[[Page S10448]]\n\n     Senate did three things: It omitted inconvenient truths, it \n     promised that future Congresses will make tough choices to \n     slow entitlement spending, and it dropped the hammer on the \n     middle class.\n       One inconvenient truth is the fact that Congress will not \n     allow doctors to suffer a 24% cut in their Medicare \n     reimbursements. Senate Democrats chose to ignore this reality \n     and rely on the promise of a cut to make their bill add up. \n     Taking note of this fact pushes the total cost of the bill \n     well over $1 trillion and destroys any pretense of budget \n     balance.\n       It is beyond fantastic to promise that future Congresses, \n     for 10 straight years, will allow planned cuts in \n     reimbursements to hospitals, other providers, and Medicare \n     Advantage (thereby reducing the benefits of 25% of seniors in \n     Medicare). The 1997 Balanced Budget Act pursued this strategy \n     and successive Congresses steadily unwound its provisions. \n     The very fact that this Congress is pursuing an expensive new \n     entitlement belies the notion that members would be willing \n     to cut existing ones.\n       Most astounding of all is what this Congress is willing to \n     do to struggling middle-class families. The bill would impose \n     nearly $400 billion in new taxes and fees. Nearly 90% of that \n     burden will be shouldered by those making $200,000 or less.\n       It might not appear that way at first, because the dollars \n     are collected via a 40% tax on sales by insurers of \n     ``Cadillac'' policies, fees on health insurers, drug \n     companies and device manufacturers, and an assortment of odds \n     and ends.\n       But the economics are clear. These costs will be passed on \n     to consumers by either directly raising insurance premiums, \n     or by fueling higher health-care costs that inevitably lead \n     to higher premiums. Consumers will pay the excise tax on \n     high-cost plans. The Joint Committee on Taxation indicates \n     that 87% of the burden would fall on Americans making less \n     than $200,000, and more than half on those earning under \n     $100,000.\n       Industry fees are even worse because Democrats chose to \n     make these fees nondeductible. This means that insurance \n     companies will have to raise premiums significantly just to \n     break even. American families will bear a burden even greater \n     than the $130 billion in fees that the bill intends to \n     collect. According to my analysis, premiums will rise by as \n     much as $200 billion over the next 10 years and 90% will \n     again fall on the middle class.\n       Senate Democrats are also erecting new barriers to middle-\n     class ascent. A family of four making $54,000 would pay \n     $4,800 for health insurance, with the remainder coming from \n     subsidies. If they work harder and raise their income to \n     $66,000, their cost of insurance rises by $2,800. In other \n     words, earning another $12,000 raises their bill by $2,800--a \n     marginal tax rate of 23%. Double-digit increases in effective \n     tax rates will have detrimental effects on the incentives of \n     millions of Americans.\n       Why does it make sense to double down on the kinds of \n     entitlements already in crisis, instead of passing medical \n     malpractice reform and allowing greater competition among \n     insurers? Why should middle-class families pay more than \n     $2,000 on average, by my estimate, in taxes in the process?\n       Middle-class families have it tough enough. There is little \n     reason to believe that the pain of the current recession, \n     housing downturn, and financial crisis will quickly fade \n     away--especially with the administration planning to triple \n     the national debt over the next decade.\n       The promise of real reform remains. But the reality of the \n     Democrats' current effort is starkly less benign. It will \n     create a dangerous new entitlement that will be paid for by \n     the middle class and their children.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I wish to highlight a few sentences from \nthat article regarding the bill that was reported out of the Finance \nCommittee earlier this week. In that article he says this:\n\n       The bill would impose nearly $400 billion in new taxes and \n     fees. Nearly 90 percent of that burden will be shouldered by \n     those making $200,000 or less. It might not appear that way \n     at first because the dollars are collected via a 40-percent \n     tax on sales by insurers of ``Cadillac'' policies, fees on \n     health insurers, drug companies, and device manufacturers. \n     But the economics are clear. These costs will be passed on to \n     consumers by either directly raising insurance premiums or by \n     fueling higher health care costs that inevitably lead to \n     higher premiums.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I am happy to yield to my colleague from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. It is my understanding of the proposal that this reform \nwill begin to be implemented in what year?\n  Mr. THUNE. I believe the answer to that question, I might state \nthrough the Chair, is 2013, 2014.\n  Mr. McCAIN. 2013, 2014. But when do the taxes that would supposedly \nimplement this proposal kick in?\n  Mr. THUNE. The taxes, I would say to my colleague, again through the \nChair, kick in immediately. You get the revenues starting to come in \nright away. So the revenues are front-loaded, the costs of the program \nare back-loaded, so it understates and distorts what this new proposal \nwill cost.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we have 10 years' worth of tax increases to pay for \n5\\1/2\\ years of the implementation of this so-called reform, and then \nwhat are the implications in the future?\n  Mr. THUNE. Well, that is clearly the case. If you look at the 10-year \ncost of this, because the revenues--the tax increases--are front-\nloaded, and we get to see basically 10 years of tax increases and only \nabout 5\\1/2\\ years of actual implementation of the program, what you \nhave to do to get a full picture of what the cost of this program will \nbe is take the fully implemented cost. When you take the fully \nimplemented cost, I would say to my colleague from Arizona, you are \nlooking not at the $829 billion that was reported by the CBO; because \nof this distortion and this creation of a revenue source before the \nactual costs kick in, you are looking at a $1.8 trillion new \nentitlement program fully implemented over a 10-year period.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I have one more question for my colleague. Is there any \nprovision in the legislation, as you have seen it, that has any \napproach whatsoever to medical malpractice reform or medical liability \nreform which, in the view of many experts, could be as much as $100 \nbillion to $200 billion a year?\n  Mr. THUNE. There is not.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't that incredible?\n  Mr. THUNE. I think it is incredible because it is now validated by \nthe Congressional Budget Office that if you were to incorporate that, \nyou would drive down the cost of health care in this country by \nliterally billions and billions of dollars. Yet there is no mention or \nreference to medical malpractice reform in this bill.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true, as much as we respect the Congressional \nBudget Office and their figures as to the amount of money that can be \nsaved by implementing meaningful medical malpractice reform, such as is \nthe case in the State of Texas, that it doesn't reduce the costs as far \nas litigation is concerned? Not only that, but I don't believe it is \ncalculated using the way they calculate costs: The incredible increase \nin health care costs associated with the practice of defensive \nmedicine, with doctors prescribing unneeded, unnecessary and, many \ntimes, because of the nature of the procedure, unwanted additional \ntests and procedures because that physician is practicing what we call \ndefensive medicine, which is the fear of finding themselves in court; \nand not only because of the increasing premiums for medical malpractice \nbut also obviously the time, the effort, the energy, including damage \nto reputation that could accrue from a lawsuit brought against that \nphysician.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, my understanding is that the \nCongressional Budget Office does not only contemplate the cost of \nlitigation, it does not take into consideration the cost of the \npractice of defensive medicine, which, as the Senator from Arizona \nnoted, is an enormous additional cost, and many independent estimates \nsuggest $100 billion to $200 billion annually. The CBO study only took \ninto consideration government health care, so it didn't include the \nprivate health care delivery in this country. But many physicians, as \nthe Senator noted, practice defensive medicine because they are worried \nabout being sued. All these duplicative tests and additional practices \nthat are undertaken by doctors in this country to avoid the lawsuit \npotential or the risk they incur when they practice medicine adds \nsignificantly--as I said, as independent estimates suggest, to the tune \nof $100 billion to $200 billion annually.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, isn't it absolutely incredible that in \nthe name of reducing health care costs, and with the burden that rising \nhealth care costs impose on every American family, that there should \nnot be one provision--one meaningful provision--for medical liability \nreform, which is, in the judgment of any objective observer--except \nmaybe the trial lawyers--something that must be implemented if you are \ngoing to have a serious effort at reducing the cost of health care in \nAmerica?\n  Mr. THUNE. Absolutely. I think that in a moment of honesty Howard \nDean\n\n[[Page S10449]]\n\nrecently said that the reason medical malpractice reform is not \nincluded in this legislation is because they didn't want to take on the \ntrial lawyers. It seems to me that you cannot have a meaningful \ndiscussion about lowering health care costs in this country absent the \ninclusion of this issue--an important issue--of the practice of \ndefensive medicine, which is tied directly to medical malpractice \nlawsuits in this country, and the desperate need we have for reform in \nthat area.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, as the Senator from Arizona noted, an \nimportant component of the debate is the cost curve, which leads to \nhigher premiums and health care costs both in government-held care--\nMedicare and Medicaid--and in private health care delivery.\n  Despite all of the promises the President has made to the contrary, \nthere isn't anything in these bills to date, according to the CBO, that \ndrives the cost curve down. In fact, what we are looking at is higher \nhealth care costs attributable to many of the provisions in these \nbills. It is interesting to know, because during the hearing, the \nDirector of CBO, Doug Elmendorf--and earlier I mentioned Douglas Holtz-\nEakin, a former CBO Director, but the current Director has repeatedly \nadmitted that he did not have the opportunity to find answers to some \nof the important questions in this debate. CBO told us increased taxes \nwill be passed on in the form of higher premiums, general dollar for \ndollar. When he was asked if CBO calculated how much insurance premiums \nwill rise for Americans who already have coverage, he said no. When he \nwas asked whether they calculated whether total spending on health care \nwould go up or down, he said no. When he was asked if they calculated \nhow the bill would affect access to health care, he said no. Because of \nthe way the bill has so many holes and no real legislative language, \nand the way it has been rushed through, there has simply not been time, \nevidently, for CBO to look at this and to know for certain what some of \nthe impact will be. I have to ask, would Americans buy a health care \nplan without knowing how much it costs? Does anybody in this country \nlook at buying a plan without knowing its cost? That is exactly what \nthe Democrats are doing with this bill--buying a national health care \nplan without any idea about how much it is going to cost the Nation or \nindividual taxpayers.\n  We do know that the plan is going to bring us higher taxes, higher \npremiums, and cuts in Medicare. I think that is a fair assessment. Two \nstudies last week--independent analyses--verified that premiums are \ngoing to go up. I will point out that one of those studies which came \nout yesterday--the Oliver Wyman study--said premiums will increase in \nthe individual market approximately $1,500 for single coverage and \n$3,300 for family coverage annually. That is exclusive of inflation. So \nthe annual inflationary increases we are seeing in medical expenses are \nnot included in that estimate, but it is $1,500 for an individual and \n$3,300 for a family annually, the increase in cost for coverage.\n  Small employers purchasing new policies in the reform market are \ngoing to experience premium increases that are up to 19 percent higher. \nThis is in year 5 of reform. The other study--the \nPricewaterhouseCoopers study--which came out a couple days ago, also \nhad some statistics that were revealing. It illustrated, too, that \nthese premium costs that are going to be borne by the American people \nwill go up significantly. So you have two independent analyses that \nhave been done in the last week, talking about how much premiums are \ngoing to go up. We know now, with the Joint Tax Committee's assessment \nand CBO's assessment, that taxes will go up. We have said how the \nimpact of that is going to fall. If you look at the biggest impact of \nthe tax increases, families earning 150 percent of the Federal poverty \nline, $32,200, will face an effective marginal tax rate of 59 percent. \nAnd 89 percent, according to the CBO, of the tax increases will fall on \nearners making less than $200,000 a year. Fifty percent would fall on \nthose making less than $100,000 a year.\n  You have average Americans out there trying to cope with the cost of \nhealth care, along with the cost of everything else, who are going to \nbe hit with higher taxes and premiums, and our senior population will \nbe hit with higher Medicare premiums because Medicare will be cut, and \nit is going to impact the Medicare Advantage Program, and it will \nimpact providers across this country.\n  What we know for certain about this bill is that it is going to spend \n$1.8 trillion, when fully implemented over a 10-year timeframe; it is \ngoing to leave 25 million people without coverage; it is going to raise \npremiums for people in this country; it is going to raise taxes on \npeople in this country, particularly those who make under $100,000 a \nyear--half of the tax burden will fall on them, according to the CBO \nand the Joint Committee on Taxation. That is what we are looking at \nwith this legislation.\n  As much as is talked about in health care reform and covering more \npeople and lowering costs, at the end of the day we are looking at \nhigher premiums, higher taxes, and cuts in Medicare. That is the bottom \nline. That is why we, as Republicans, are looking for real solutions \nthat bend the cost curve down. As the Senator from Arizona noted, one \nof those solutions certainly would be throwing into this mix the issue \nof medical malpractice reform.\n  I want to point out a couple of statistics before I conclude about \nhow this would impact people in South Dakota, according to one of the \nstudies. In the South Dakota market, the individual market, if you are \nbuying in that market, you are going to see your premiums go up by 47 \npercent. If you are a family, it will go up by 50 percent; and if you \nare in the small group market, you will see a 14-percent increase in \npremiums; and if you are an individual and for a family, it is 15 \npercent.\n  My State of South Dakota isn't going to fare very well when it comes \nto the costs associated with this plan. I argue that most Americans, as \nthey evaluate the personal impacts of this health care reform proposal, \nare going to give it a thumbs down and, hopefully, we can go back to \nthe drawing board and address this in the way we should have in the \nfirst place, and that is step by step, not rushing to jam through this \nmassive expansion, this $1.8 trillion program, with higher taxes, \nhigher premiums, and cuts in Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from South \nDakota on a very important statement. I see the Senator from New \nHampshire and others on the floor waiting to speak on this issue. I \nwill be brief.\n  As the majority leader begins discussions behind closed doors to \ncreate the Senate bill that he is going to bring to the floor, I think \nit is important for the American people to understand the impact these \npolicies will have on the cost of health insurance premiums, tax rates, \nand our economy for generations to come.\n  I think we should understand the smoke and mirrors used to make the \nDemocrat proposal appear to improve the budget over the next 10 years. \nThe following taxes start next year. If you have insurance, $201 \nbillion is raised in excise taxes on health plans. If you don't buy a \nplan, or you buy one that the government doesn't think is good enough, \nthe concept proposal raises $4 billion in fines on the uninsured. If \nyou are an employer who today cannot afford to provide health insurance \nto your employees, which is the case with small business, the ones \nhurting the most--not Goldman Sachs or JPMorgan but the small \nbusinesses--the concept proposal raises $23 billion in employer \npenalties and contributions. If you use medical devices, such as \nhearing aids or artificial hearts, the concept proposal raises taxes by \n$38 billion on medical device manufacturers. Who will pay for that in \nthe long run? The user. If you take prescription drugs, the concept \nproposal raises $22 billion in new taxes on medicines.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that Americans will face \nhigher health insurance premiums, while waiting 4 years for the reform \nproposal to begin. This gimmickry is incredible. The President and \nSenate Democrats claim the proposal is under $1 trillion and slightly \nreduces the deficit over 10 years. That is a joke--ten years of taxes \nbut only 5\\1/2\\ years of implementation. To get the true 10-year cost \nof implementation, you should look at the\n\n[[Page S10450]]\n\n10 years beginning in 2013. Using the CBO numbers, we are told that the \nproposal spends $1.8 trillion. That is the real cost of this proposal.\n  You might be justified in wondering what Americans get for that $1.8 \ntrillion. The answer is more government, with 13 million more people \nplaced into the failed Medicaid Program. Medicaid is a program that is \nbusting the Federal budget and State budgets all over America. Medicaid \nis a program that fails in patients having access to physicians. Forty \npercent of doctors will not see Medicaid patients. Medicaid is a \nprogram that fails in health outcomes for low-income Americans. We are \nnot going to give low-income Americans more options for better health \ncoverage; we are just giving them the status quo.\n  It is bad enough that the proposal massively increases government \nregulation of health care and insurance, massively expands the \ngovernment-sponsored Medicaid Program--which the States cannot afford \nto pay for, as we all know--massively cuts Medicare and drives up \ninsurance premiums in the process. But the proposal ignores what \nAmericans want: less government, less taxes, more freedom, and more \nchoices.\n  The concept paper in the Senate Finance Committee--it is not even a \nbill--slams Americans with an entitlement program that will grow \nfaster, according to the CBO, than the economy, while at the same time \ndramatically increasing the tax burden on all Americans.\n  Let's restate the obvious about the Senate Finance Committee concept \nproposal. As the majority leader conducts his closed-door process to \ncreate the Senate bill he will bring to the floor, it is important for \nthe American people to understand what impact these policies will have \non the cost of health insurance premiums, on tax rates, and on our \neconomy for generations to come.\n  I have seen recent information that the Medicare Part D Program, \nwhich is touted as a success--which I voted against because it wasn't \npaid for--is now having--guess what--increased costs. The problem is \nthat we are not addressing the fundamental problems that cause a \ndramatic increase in health care costs in America. In fact, we are \ncontinuing a process that we have done, which is new entitlement \nprograms, without ways to pay for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from South Dakota for framing this debate on health \ncare with very specific and excellent points.\n  The simple fact is that the cost of this program is grossly \nunderstated, but the cost is extraordinary, even when understated--\nalmost a trillion dollars. The real cost is $1.8 trillion, when it is \nfully phased in. In fact, if you include in it the doctor fix, which \nwas taken off the table so the cost would look better, which is $200 \nbillion-plus, the cost of this proposal, when fully phased in, is over \n$2 trillion over a 10-year period.\n  And the offsets that are going to be used to pay for this? Their plan \nis basically to cut Medicare Advantage, eliminate that program for \nseniors--a lot of seniors like Medicare Advantage--and try to save \nabout $400 billion doing that and take that money and create a brand \nnew entitlement to benefit people who do not have insurance or people \nwho do not have enough insurance, as defined by this bill. In addition, \nthey will raise taxes and raise fees. Most of the fees will be coming \nin from the hospital associations, the doctors, the drug companies, and \nthe insurers, all of which will be passed through, of course, to \nconsumers in the form of higher premiums or higher costs. Again, it is \ngoing to be the consumers of America, Middle America, the people who \nuse health care in this country, who are going to pay the cost.\n  It is a huge gap even between the stated amount that is going to be \nraised in this bill, and the real expenditure in this bill. And that \ngap goes directly onto the debt of our children--the debt of this \ncountry, which has to be paid for by our children.\n  This is in the context of an administration which has exploded the \nsize of government in the first 10 months of its term--exploded the \nsize of government. They have proposed a budget which over the next 10 \nyears will run on the average $1 trillion of deficit every year, which \nwill take the Federal debt from about 41 percent of gross domestic \nproduct up to 80 percent of gross domestic product, which will take \nFederal spending from about 20 percent of gross domestic product up to \nabout 25 percent of gross domestic product.\n  What do all those numbers mean? They mean quite simply that our \nchildren are going to be passed a country which will have so much debt \nand such a large government that it simply cannot afford it; that the \nquality of life of our children, as they move into their earning years, \nis going to be fundamentally undermined--their ability to buy a home, \ntheir ability to send their kids to college, their ability to just live \nthe quality of lifestyle our generation has had is going to be \nfundamentally harmed by this administration's decisions to spend today \nas if there is no tomorrow or to spend today and pass the bills on to \ntomorrow. It is a true affront to the traditions of this country.\n  Let me quote from Thomas Jefferson because Thomas Jefferson is deemed \nto be the founder of the Democratic Party. Thomas Jefferson got a lot \nof things right, of course. He wrote the Declaration of Independence, \nthe most brilliant document in the history of mankind stating freedoms \nto which we subscribe. He played a major role in defining our Nation \nand what makes our Nation special.\n  He said this about debt. This was a letter to John Taylor in 1816:\n\n       I sincerely believe . . . that the principle of spending \n     money to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is \n     but swindling futurity on a large scale.\n\n  That is a pretty strong word, ``swindling,'' used by the founder of \nthe Democratic Party relative to the use of debt.\n  Then he wrote to William Plumer, who, coincidentally, was the \nGovernor of New Hampshire, in a letter. He said:\n\n       I, however, place economy among the first and most \n     important republican virtues, and public debt as the greatest \n     of the dangers to be feared.\n\n  The proposals which are coming out of this administration do swindle \nour children's future, just as Thomas Jefferson said. To run debts of \nthis size, to run deficits of this size, to put in place a program that \nis going to cost almost $2 trillion when it is fully implemented is \nbasically to guarantee that this Nation is going to have such a burden \nof government that we will be unable to sustain our government in the \nform it is today.\n  What does that lead to when you run up those types of deficits and \ndebt, when you run up that type of spending? It leads to two options: \nOur children are either going to inherit a nation where we have to \ndevalue the dollar, and basically create a situation where everybody's \nsavings and everybody's net worth is dramatically impacted by lessening \nthe value of that through inflation or, alternatively, you are going to \nhave to dramatically increase the tax burden of this country to a point \nwhere you will undermine the fundamental productivity of our Nation and \nput job creation and the capacity to have prosperity through job \ncreation at risk because the tax burden will become so high.\n  In fact, it was pointed out, studies have shown that the tax burden \nwill go up to 59 percent of income under some of the proposals that are \npending just on this bill, to say nothing of when you start totaling up \nall the other bills, all the spending that will occur. Even today, the \nadministration announced they want to spend $14.5 billion more without \noffsetting it in any way to fund an interest group they feel needs to \nbe funded.\n  This raises the fundamental question: Why do you proceed in this way? \nWhy would you create a program that is going to have such a devastating \nimpact on the economic future of our Nation? You do it because it gets \nyou votes in the next election, I guess. I guess that is why you do it.\n  Certainly there are ways to reform health care, to improve health \ncare that do not require this massive expansion in the size of \ngovernment. There are a lot of ways to do that. Let me give a few.\n\n[[Page S10451]]\n\n  For example, we could focus on the chronic diseases which are the \ndrivers of health care costs in this country, diseases such as obesity \nand Alzheimer's. We could try to get those under control. That would \nhelp control costs.\n  We could give employers the incentive through monetary payments--\nactual cash--to say to their employees: Listen, if you go out and live \na healthy lifestyle, we will give a reward in cash. If you stop \nsmoking, if you get yourself into a workout situation where you drop \nweight, if you take tests such as having a colonoscopy, if you have a \nmammogram, we are going to reward you with money. That is a step which \nwould significantly improve health care delivery and costs in this \ncountry.\n  We can say to the delivery systems: Listen, rather than doing a lot \nof quantity for the purposes of generating revenue, why don't you do a \nlittle quality with value tied to it? There are health care delivery \nsystems in this country today which accomplish that. Rochester, MN; \nSalt Lake City, UT; Pittsburgh, PA--there are a whole series of these \ncenters which have shown you can deliver better quality at lower costs \nif you are intelligent about it and reduce overutilization.\n  We could, as was discussed at length by the Senator from South Dakota \nand the Senator from Arizona, do something about abusive lawsuits. The \nsimple fact is, abusive lawsuits are driving huge costs in the health \ncare system. Thirty percent of health care is deemed to be defensive \nmedicine. There is no reason doctors should have to give tests they \ndon't believe they have to give, but they have to give in order to \ndefend themselves from lawsuits. Those are foolish and expensive. Madam \nPresident, $54 billion is the cost estimate from CBO of savings just \nfrom that one item, and that is an understated cost because it doesn't, \nas was pointed out, calculate the defensive medicine side.\n  Those are a few good ideas, but there are a lot more good ideas. It \ncan be done on a step-by-step approach which gives us better health \ncare without this attempt to basically take over the entire system.\n  Let's not play any more games around here. What is this about? This \nis about creating a system, putting in place an alleged comprehensive \nreform, the purpose of which is to drive private activity out of the \nmarket because there are a lot of people on the other side of the aisle \nwho believe profit is bad and the marketplace does not work in health \ncare, and that we should move towards a single-payer system. That is \nwhat this is about. Raise premiums to a level where employers will be \nforced to drop their insurance and push people into what is called this \nexchange. There will be a public plan in the exchange when it comes \nfrom the conference committee, should it get that far--hopefully it \nwill not but if it does--and then basically push everybody into the \npublic plan and create an atmosphere where the playing field is so \ntilted against any sort of private activity that people who have their \ninsurance today will lose it and you will have to choose a public plan, \nfor all intents and purposes. That will be your choice 4 or 5 years \nfrom now.\n  The effect of that, of course, of moving toward a single-payer \nsystem, which is the stated goal of many of my colleagues on the other \nside and a majority of the people in the House of Representatives, the \neffect of moving to a single-payer system or a nationalized system is \nvery destructive to our health care generally. Primarily, it means \npeople will end up with delays. There will be price controls put in \nplace relative to certain types of medicines you can receive. \nInnovation will be stifled because people will not be able to invest \nmoney and get a reasonable return, especially in the area of \ndevelopment of new pharmaceuticals and new biologics, which are so \ncritical to the health care system today. We will have people standing \nin line. We will have people basically being subject to delays. We will \nhave people, I absolutely guarantee you, finding their health care \nrationed depending on their age, as occurs in England under its system. \nAnd we will simply see a significant lessening of innovation and, most \nimportant, people will not have choices. You will basically be forced \noff the private system into a public system.\n\n  This is the ultimate goal here--not stated but clearly intended of \nwhat is going to happen if you move toward a system as has been \noutlined at least in the Kennedy-Dodd bill, as it came out of the HELP \nCommittee and is now somewhere in this building--we don't know where--\nbeing merged into a new piece of legislation with the Finance Committee \nbill. So when Thomas Jefferson makes this point that you should not \nswindle the next generation by radically expanding your debt, we should \nlive by that because it is a pretty good point. When a bill is brought \nforward on this floor which alleges to be fiscally responsible and it \nclaims it meets the obligation, it meets its costs, but it understates \nthe costs by almost $1.2 trillion and overstates how much it is going \nto generate in revenues and you don't get these Medicare cuts unless--I \nhave never seen Medicare reductions occur in this Congress. Then \nbasically you are loading up the debt of our children. It is that \nsimple. That is the inevitable response of this piece of legislation, \nthat the debt will expand.\n  As Thomas Jefferson said, he believed in ``the principle of spending \nmoney to be paid by posterity under the name of funding is but \nswindling futurity on a large scale.'' And this may be the largest \nscale of swindling that has ever occurred in America's history.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10451-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10451-S10457]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I am pleased to be here today, as we were \nlast week and the week before that, with other freshman colleagues to \ntalk about the need for health care reform in this Congress. Today, \nwhat we want to focus on is the effect of health care reform on small \nbusiness.\n  When I am in Colorado, what we always start with is a conversation \nabout what problem is it we are trying to solve. When it comes to small \nbusinesses, they are the biggest losers in the current health care \nsystem we have today and, by extension, the people who work for small \nbusinesses.\n  Today in my State, small business pays 18 percent more to cover their \nemployees than large business does. Some people say to me: Michael, \nthat is obviously because they have a smaller pool of people; it is \nharder to spread the risk. And that is true, but from a business \nperspective, that is ridiculous. From a small business perspective, if \nyou are going to spend 18 percent more on something, you ought to \nexpect to get 18 percent more productivity out of your company or you \nought to at least expect to get 18 percent better coverage for your \nemployees. Of course, every small business owner in this country knows \nthe reverse is true--coverage is worse, deductibles are higher. It is \njust an illustration of how challenging the status quo is for small \nbusinesses that, after all, employ most of the people in our economy \nand are going to be responsible for carrying us out of this recession.\n  One can see on this chart the extraordinary effect this has had on my \nState. Even before this current recession, we saw a huge drop in the \nnumber of people who were getting coverage at work and many fewer small \nbusinesses. Now we are almost at 40 percent--I guarantee that number is \nwell below 40 percent today after this recession has occurred. Even \nfewer smaller businesses are able to offer their employees coverage, \nwhich is heartbreaking for small business owners all over my State and \nall over the other States represented here today. Many of these \nbusinesses are family-owned businesses. The businesses feel like a \nfamily. People feel responsibility and care for one another and take \nresponsibility for, among other things, health care. But they are not \nable to do it anymore. They are making very tough choices as a result.\n  By the way, one of the choices they are making is to not raise wages. \nMedian family income in Colorado went down by $800 over the last 10 \nyears, and in the country it went down over $300 in the same period, \nwhile in my State health insurance premiums went up by 90 percent. \nSmall businesspeople say to me that those things are directly related \nto each other. In other words, people have to make a choice between\n\n[[Page S10452]]\n\ncovering their employees and paying them a living wage, and more often \nthan not they are having to choose to compress wages just because of \nthe skyrocketing costs of health insurance.\n  Health care reform done right is going to make an enormous difference \nfor small businesses and for the people employed by small businesses. \nIt will lower premiums and the cost of health insurance coverage; \nprovide tax credits for small businesses that provide health \ninsurance--that do the right thing; exempt most small businesses from \nemployer responsibility requirements; subsidize health insurance for \nemployees in small businesses that do not provide health insurance; \nincrease entrepreneurship to expand the pool of workers available to \nsmall businesses; and eliminate job lock. Job lock means having to stay \nin a job because you are so scared of losing your insurance.\n  The estimate is that the administrative costs for small businesses, \nwhen it comes to health care insurance, will drop by over 50 percent. \nMost small businesspeople I know, who are skeptical sometimes of the \nreform we are talking about, will tell me this administrative burden is \nextraordinary for them today. Today, it is a paper-and-pencil system of \ntrying to root out and sort out the health insurance market for their \nemployees. Tomorrow, what we are going to have is an exchange where \npeople can easily compare prices, compare coverage, and get the best \ndeal for their employees, not to mention the fact they are going to be \nable to pool their purchasing power and drive down cost as a result.\n  The estimates are, small business will save billions of dollars over \nthe course of this reform--$432 billion by 2013, $855 billion just 9 \nyears from now. That is money that can be put into wages. In fact, the \nestimates are that of those savings, what we will see is small \nbusinesses being able to increase wages for their employees by almost \n$300 billion by the end of this period of time.\n  So today we are here to talk about why reform is important for small \nbusiness. We are at a very perilous moment in our economy for small \nbusinesses that do not have access to the credit they need to help get \nus where we need to be. They are facing an incredible credit crunch out \nthere, which is making it hard for them to hire again, which is driving \nup our unemployment rate. Over the medium and long term, what is \ncritical to the success of our small businesses is that we reform our \nhealth care system, we make it more transparent, we make it more \nefficient, we make coverage more available to small businesses and to \nthe millions of Americans who are employed by small businesses in their \ncommunities.\n  We are going to go through a series of colleagues today from the \nfreshman class, as we did last week and the week before, and I will now \nyield the floor for the Senator from Alaska to give his perspective on \nwhy, as a former small businessperson himself, health care reform is so \ncritical to keeping our small businesses competitive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for his \npresentation, especially on small businesses and the impact health care \nreform will have on them. The Senator from Colorado has done a great \nlay of the land on the impact to small business, and I wish to step it \nup and talk about what I heard as I sat here and listened to several of \nmy colleagues on the other side, the Republicans, talking about what is \ngoing to happen if we don't do something or if we do health care \nreform. In that regard, I wish to talk about at least one myth that I \nhear over and over from the other side that will impact not only small \nbusiness but impact everybody.\n  I am pleased to join my fellow colleagues and talk about the \nimportance of health insurance reform in general, but the myth I wish \nto talk about today, which I have heard stated over and over, involves \nscare tactics and, in particular, a word which I think belongs in the \nsoup lines of the Great Depression--``rationing.'' Opponents of health \ninsurance reform have resurrected the word to suggest that Americans \nwill get less care when reform legislation passes.\n  Is there anything more cynical than telling Americans their health \ncare will be rationed because of reform; that they will lose or get \nless care when Congress and the President finally take action? \nDefenders of the status quo ought to be embarrassed. They know the \nopposite is true--that more Americans will have access to more health \ncare when reforms are finally adopted.\n  Rationing is not some roadblock waiting down the road for the vast \nmajority of Americans, it is what is happening right now. Let's use my \nState as an example--a State where 52 percent of the folks employed are \nfrom small businesses. When I came into the Senate at the start of this \nyear, the Census Bureau said 123,000 Alaskans were uninsured. But new \ndata came out last month--just a few months after the earlier \nstatistic--and that number is up to 133,000. In other words, 10,000 \nmore Alaskans have been rationed out of their coverage. Insurance \ncompanies no longer cover them.\n  Unable to pay the skyrocketing insurance premiums, or maybe their \nemployers can no longer afford it--as laid out so well by the Senator \nfrom Colorado--people and businesses are struggling to make sure they \ncan afford their insurance premiums for their employees or they are \nrationed out of the system because they have switched jobs. Then, when \nthey apply for new insurance, they are disqualified because of a \npreexisting condition or perhaps the annual cap on how much their \ninsurance company will pay is so low people get sick and hit their \nlimit early. From that point on, they can't afford to see a doctor for \nthe rest of the year or ensure their coverage or their quality of care \nis maintained. This is another form of rationing, and it is real.\n  By one estimate, 14,000 Americans lose their health insurance every \nday. These are friends and neighbors and loved ones and it is \ninexcusable. Maybe the reasoning for rationing is even more \noutrageous--the cases where insurance companies revoke coverage by a \nprocess of rescission. Unfortunately, that is very real. A report by \nthe House Ways and Means Committee says insurance companies saved \nthemselves $300 million over 5 years through this practice of \nrescission.\n  So, again, let's put the word ``rationing'' in proper context. It is \nthe status quo, and the insurance industry is making lots of money \nbecause of it.\n  Let's talk about what will change when we pass health insurance \nreform. As you can see on the chart, reform will easily take care of \nmany of the issues Americans face: Tell insurance companies they can no \nlonger deny coverage because of preexisting conditions; stop them from \nsetting low annual or lifetime caps and refusing to pay the care after \nthat; reform will offer Americans more choices by creating health \ninsurance exchanges--as so well described by the Senator from Colorado. \nAs I like to call it, it is health insurance Expedia. As we do with \ntravel, we can do with health insurance. It will require insurance \ncompanies and Medicare to pay for more preventive care so people can \nhave regular checkups and screenings. This means we can recognize and \neven prevent oncoming chronic illness. Of course, this is better for \nthe patient, and it saves us money.\n  Let me say it again: The scare tactic of so-called health care \nrationing is just that, a tactic trotted out by those who want to kill \nreform. The truth is, health insurance reform will give Americans \nmore--more people have more access to more health care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska, and I \nthink he raises such an important point because so much of the debate \nhas been about dividing one set of Americans from another set of \nAmericans. Health care reform is something that needs to be of concern \nto 300 million Americans--if you are concerned about the double-digit \nincreases every year of your premiums; if you are concerned about \nspending almost 20 percent of our GDP on health care, when every other \nindustrialized country in the world is spending less than half that; \nconcerned, as the other side is and this side is, with the fiscal \ncondition of our government, when we know the biggest drivers of our \nmedium-term deficits are rising Medicare and Medicaid costs, and the \nbiggest drivers of those are health care costs. We are all in this \ntogether.\n\n[[Page S10453]]\n\n  It is a great pleasure for me to turn now to the Senator from Oregon, \nwho will talk about the fact that this isn't just about trying to cover \none small group of Americans, it is about all 300 million Americans in \nthis country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I am delighted to join my colleagues from \nColorado and Alaska to tackle some of the myths being printed about \nhealth care reform. It is startling to stand on the floor and hear \nincreasingly shrill presentations from those who wish to defend the \nstatus quo broken system of health care in America. I wonder to myself, \ndo they not hear what I hear from my constituents about the challenges \nthey encounter each and every day if they do not have insurance; who \nare worried about getting sick or, if they have insurance, are worried \nabout losing that insurance; worried about the problems and challenges \nfaced with utilizing that insurance?\n  I rise to talk about one of the most prevalent myths--that health \ncare reform is only about expanding access to those who don't have \nhealth insurance. Because here is the truth: Health care reform is \nabout improving health care for those who already have insurance. Those \nwith insurance in the United States live in a precarious state. Their \nrates often go up by double-digit increases every year, so \naffordability is hanging by a thread. Those who have insurance through \ntheir jobs can change jobs and lose that coverage. They could get \ndropped from their insurance because they become sick or injured or \nthey could find that their insurance has lifetime or annual limits that \nblock them from obtaining the medical care they need if they do become \ninjured or ill. We want to make health care insurance more stable and \nsecure for those who have it, and that is what health care reform will \ndo.\n  First, health care reform will make insurance portable. If you lose \nyour job, you often lose your coverage. That is a terrible double \nwhammy for American families. Health care reform will make sure your \ncoverage goes with you if you lose your job or if you choose to take on \na new career.\n  Second, health care reform will end dumping--the terrible practice of \ninsurance companies canceling policies when those citizens become \nseriously ill. That is wrong. What kind of health care system is it \nwhen you pay insurance premiums for 15 years and then your child or \nyour spouse or perhaps yourself becomes seriously ill and you get a \nletter from your insurance company saying they are canceling your \ninsurance? That is not health insurance. That is a scam. Health care \nreform will end that scam in America.\n  Finally, health care reform will get rid of annual or lifetime limits \nthat drive people into bankruptcy, even when they have coverage. Here \nis an example from my home State of Oregon.\n  Alaya Wyndham-Price lives in Oswego. She had insurance through her \nprevious job as an event planner and is currently on COBRA. Six months \nago, Alaya developed a tumor the size of a golf ball just below her \nbrain, and she has had numerous tests performed by a neurologist to \ndetermine the best course of treatment. Her insurance caps treatment \ncosts at $20,000 annually, and she has already approached $30,000 of \nexpenses with the diagnostic tests over the last few months.\n  Through COBRA, Alaya's insurance will renew in January, but the \nsurgery to remove her tumor will cost about $50,000--or $30,000 over \nthe amount her insurance will pay in 2010. So she is trying to work as \nmuch as possible--doing freelance writing, taking on projects--but on \nmany days is too ill to do much of anything. She is scheduled to see a \ndoctor again soon to have an expensive MRI test in November, but with \nevery single medical visit she goes deeper into debt.\n  This is not right, but it is common. More than half of bankruptcies \nin America are due to medical bills and in more than half of those \nsituations where medical bills drive people into bankruptcy, the \nindividuals had health insurance. No American should be driven into \nbankruptcy because he or she becomes sick or injured. Health care \nreform will end arbitrary annual and lifetime limits to make sure \nAmericans get the care they need when they need it, not having to delay \ncare to the next year in order to benefit from a new annual ceiling.\n  In conclusion: The myth is that health care reform is simply about \nextending coverage. The truth is this: Reform will mean better, fairer, \nand more affordable coverage for the millions of Americans who already \nhave insurance.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Oregon \nfor pointing out the incredible lack of stability that exists in the \nsystem today. The bankruptcy numbers are unbelievable. In my State, I \nthink roughly 62 percent of all bankruptcies are caused by health care \nissues. Of those health-care-related bankruptcies, 78 percent, nearly \n80 percent of them, are bankruptcies involving people who actually were \ncovered by insurance. We are not getting done the job that needs to get \ndone. That is why we are here today to talk about these issues.\n\n  I am going to call on the Senator from Virginia to talk a little bit \nabout how, under the current system, we pay for the uninsured in our \ncountry today, but we do it in the most inefficient way possible. Just \none fact from my State: We have a public hospital in Denver called \nDenver Health. It is an incredibly well-run hospital, run by a person \nnamed Dr. Patty Gabow. She told me they did a study a couple of years \nago that showed they spent, in 1 year, $180 million for uncompensated \ncare for people employed by small businesses who could not get \ninsurance at work.\n  I will yield for the Senator from Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first of all, I thank my colleague, the \nSenator from Colorado, for organizing this effort today and leading \nfreshmen Senators this week as we, once again, come down to the floor, \nas some of the folks who are newest to the Senate, most recently hired \nin most cases, to talk about the need for health care reform. I \nparticularly thank my colleague, the Senator from Colorado, for raising \nthe very important issue of the cost of health care to small \nbusinesses.\n  The remarkable thing about small businesses is they are basically the \nonly people who pay retail for their health care costs in America \ntoday. Those who have Medicare, those who have Medicaid, large \nemployers--they all can leverage their purchasing power. But small \nbusinesses are the folks who take it on the chin, and I am grateful for \nmy colleague's comments today, describing how health care reform can \nbenefit small businesses.\n  My colleagues, the Senator from Alaska and the Senator from Oregon, \nhave also pointed out some other myths, as the Senator from Colorado \nindicated. The one I am going to take on today, because we hear a lot \nfrom our friends on the other side of the aisle about the problems with \nreform, and sometimes they do actually dispel some of these myths--but \none of the myths I have dealt with for 18 years, as somebody who \nfounded the Virginia Health Care Foundation in the early 1990s, is, how \ndo we deal with the uninsured? Yes, part of our health care reform is \nabout extending coverage to the uninsured. There will be some \nadditional cost to do that, but I think it is very important to \nrecognize that under our current system, right now we pay for the \nuninsured. We pay for the uninsured through uncompensated care, as my \ncolleague from Colorado mentioned. We pay for the uninsured in higher \nhealth insurance premiums for all of us who buy private insurance. We \npay for the uninsured, candidly, in higher costs to our Medicare and \nMedicaid system.\n  Our uninsured end up on the emergency room doorsteps, oftentimes \nreceiving care in the most inefficient way possible and oftentimes \nwithout good quality care.\n  We have seen, on average, 8 percent of families' 2009 health care \npremiums--about $1,000 a year for all of us who purchase private health \ninsurance--we pay in effect a $1,000-a-year tax to compensate and pay \nfor the cost of the uninsured.\n  As my colleague mentioned, and I know from my experience in Virginia \n18 years ago, we started this Virginia Health Care Foundation to deal \nwith how we could provide health care coverage for the uninsured. We \nsaw folks ending up, as I mentioned, on hospital doorsteps. We saw \nfolks waiting too\n\n[[Page S10454]]\n\nlong before they could access the health care system. Oftentimes, if \nthey had a chronic disease and then waited to get that health care \ncoverage, the cost of covering that person was not only much higher--\nobviously, the person has to deal with a much more serious illness--but \nthey too ended up in the emergency room, which is an inefficient \ndelivery mechanism.\n  If we are going to truly start to bring down the cost of insurance, \nif we are going to do the right thing in giving the uninsured in this \ncountry a chance to receive a medical home and make sure they access \nhealth care through a more affordable and more long term, healthier \nway, we must pass health care reform this year.\n  A lot of numbers have been bandied about concerning what kind of \nextended coverage we are talking about in this health care reform. \nThere have been arguments that we are talking about covering 30 million \nadditional people. I believe the Senate Finance bill covers 25, 26 \nmillion. One of the things that is often absent from this debate is \nthat while these are the numbers we are trying to deal with right now, \nliterally triple that number, about 87 million Americans during a year, \nat one point or another, through either being unemployed for a while or \nmoving off one plan to another, go through some period of being \nuninsured and uncovered.\n  On top of that 87 million, we also have the problem of literally tens \nof millions of people who are stuck in dead-end jobs, who want to \nchange jobs, who want to become more productive, but they are afraid to \nmake that change because of concerns over losing their health care \ncoverage. If we can provide the kind of health care reform we are \ntalking about, if we can provide the kind of coverage we are talking \nabout, those kinds of problems will go away. We will become a more \neffective and cost-effective society.\n  I know we have other colleagues who want to speak, and I want to come \nback to where we started, at least the freshmen did a few weeks back, \nand why some of our colleagues on the other side who seem to be this \n``caucus of no,'' who seem to say: Let's take more time, let's put it \noff, let's wait a little bit longer before we take on health care \nreform--why that policy choice is so wrong.\n  If we do nothing, if we choose not to act this year, our current \nhealth care system is financially unsustainable. If we do nothing, \nMedicare, under the current projections, will go bankrupt in 2017. Many \nof us on this side of the aisle share the concerns of some of our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle about the exploding deficit \nour Nation faces. The largest single driver of our Federal deficit is \nnot the stimulus program, it is not the TARP program, it is not some of \nthe other things we debate back and forth, it is the rising cost of \nhealth care that we pay for with Federal dollars in Medicare, Medicaid, \nand the VA.\n  If we do nothing, our deficit and those health care costs will \ncontinue to explode, undermining the dollar, undermining our ability \nfor economic recovery. If we do nothing, an average family in \nVirginia--and I would argue probably an average family in the State of \nColorado--will see literally 40 percent of their disposable income go \nto paying their health insurance premiums within the next decade. Those \ncosts are unaffordable and unsustainable.\n  Finally, as a former business guy and somebody who believes, as my \ncolleague from Denver does, that the heart of what keeps our economy \ngrowing is the business community, and particularly the small business \ncommunity, if we can't lower our health care costs, then American \nbusiness will not be competitive in the global economy. No matter how \nproductive American workers are, America builds into our cost \nstructure, for almost every business, about $3,000 to $4,000 more per \nemployee because we have so much higher health care costs than any of \nour competitors around the rest of the world. We cannot maintain that \ncompetitive disadvantage in a global economy.\n  The time is now. There are ways we can continue to improve these \nbills. We are looking forward to the melding of the Finance bill and \nHELP bill, and I know myself and some of my fellow freshmen colleagues \nwill have some ideas about how we can improve programs even in that \npackage.\n  I thank my colleague from Colorado for his leadership on this issue, \nand I look forward to working with not only my freshmen colleagues but \nall colleagues on this side of the aisle, and hopefully those on the \nother side, to make sure we do get health care reform this year.\n  I yield my time.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Virginia. I particularly, on \nbehalf of all the colleagues here today, thank him for his leadership \nover the last couple of months on the question of personal \nresponsibility: how do we incentivize people to make sure they are \ndoing a better job to take care of themselves; how do we work with some \nof the corporations in this country that have done an extraordinary job \nof lowering health care costs by incentivizing folks to take personal \nresponsibility for their health care. I have enjoyed working on those \nissues with him and look forward to continuing to work on it.\n  Next, we have the Senator from New Mexico who is here to talk about \nanother myth, which is the idea that our health care system always \nworks well for everybody.\n  We have great things in our health care system. We have some of the \nbest health care technology in the world. We have some of the greatest \ntreatments in the world. If you are going to get sick, a place you want \nto get sick, depending on what you have, is the United States. But we \nare not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and the Senator from \nNew Mexico is going to comment on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, it is good to see our \nPresiding Officer, the new Senator from Massachusetts, here, who has \njoined us within the last couple of weeks, Mr. Paul Kirk.\n  Today we are talking about myths, inaccuracies, deliberate \nexaggerations, and outright lies that have abounded over the months we \nhave been debating health care reform. Some have been dreamed up by \nthose who stubbornly cling to the status quo. Others reflect fears \nlying just beneath the surface.\n  If we step back, it is easy to see these scare tactics for the lies \nthey are, but for Americans who will be most impacted by this reform, \nit may be difficult to separate fact from fiction. The myth I would \nlike to talk about today is a bit different from the others being \ndiscussed by my colleagues. It is a myth that existed long before the \ncurrent debate but is being used in a new way by people fighting this \nreform. They are using it as a weapon against change. It is a myth we \nhave all heard about. It is the myth that reform is not necessary \nbecause we have the greatest health care system in the world.\n  What makes this myth different from the others is that parts of it \nare absolutely true. Americans are blessed with some of the best \ndoctors and nurses and health care professionals in the world, hard-\nworking men and women who have dedicated their lives to the health and \nhealing of others but often work in difficult situations.\n  Our technology is unmatched. Our emergency care system is repeatedly \ncited as the best of the best, and we rank highly regarding the levels \nof dignity and respect with which patients are treated. But all these \nachievements, as great as they are, do not add up to the best health \ncare system in the world for all Americans--not as long as we are \nspending $2.4 trillion a year on medical care but continue to rank near \nthe bottom when it comes to premature deaths from diseases such as \ndiabetes, stroke, and pneumonia; not when we spend twice as much of our \nGDP on health care as Japan and the UK but have lower life expectancy \nat birth; not when we rank last in infant mortality among \nindustrialized countries; and not when half of the personal \nbankruptcies in the United States are related to medical bills.\n  Right now in America, if people have the money, they have access to \nthe best health care money can buy. For the vast majority of Americans, \nthat access is not there. If a person is a small business employee or \nlaid off from a job or someone with a preexisting condition, the ``best \nhealth care system in the world'' is much harder to come by. When 80 \nmillion\n\n[[Page S10455]]\n\npeople are either uninsured or underinsured, there is no way a country \ncan lay claim to that title.\n  But there is something we can do about it. With this reform, we have \nthe opportunity to build on the strengths of the U.S. health care \nsystem while also addressing its weaknesses. Comprehensive health \nreform will go a long way toward remedying these and other inequalities \nand reducing the health care disparities between rich and poor, the \nmajority and minority.\n  The solution is not always spending more money. Sometimes it is about \nmaking better use of the money we are already spending. It is about \nfinding ways to achieve better returns on our investment. The reforms \nwe are proposing would allow us to do that by ridding the system of \nwaste, by increasing our investment in prevention, by helping small \nbusinesses afford insurance for their employees, and by covering more \nindividuals whose only medical option right now is expensive emergency \nroom visits.\n  The status quo is unsustainable, but that is what reform opponents \nare hoping to continue with, myths like those we are discussing today. \nAmerica has the potential, the talent, the technology to achieve the \nbest health care outcomes in the world. Whether we reach that goal \ndepends on the actions we take now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, and I \nam reminded of the trips I made around my State during recess when \neverybody settled down and we could actually get into a conversation \nabout how well the status quo was working for people. It took about 40 \nminutes into the meeting before people would stand up and start to say: \nLet me tell you my story about how I was laid off from a company or \nlost my insurance, had a preexisting condition, couldn't get new \ninsurance and, therefore, can't get the health care I need.\n\n  That is the kind of conversation we need to have about what we are \nfacing. I was left with the impression from people in Colorado that \nwhile they don't like the status quo, they are worried that we are \ngoing to make it worse. We can't blame people for thinking that, as \nthey watch what is on TV every night or on the Internet. Our obligation \nis to make sure as we go through this legislative process, we deliver \nsomething that builds on our strengths, as the Senator said, but also \nfills in gaps that are clearly present and disrupting the lives of \nworking families.\n  I turn now to the Senator from Illinois to talk about the public \noption and choice. It is apparent to me, as people have begun to see \nthere might be a requirement that they have insurance, what I am \nhearing from people is they want more choices, not fewer. They don't \nwant to necessarily be forced into a private insurance plan. They want \ntheir family to have choices. Today the Senator from Illinois will talk \nabout the public option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, to my colleagues who are making this \npresentation on behalf of the people on health care, it is my pleasure \nto join them and speak briefly about what will take place if we do not \npass, as part of insurance reform, a public option. When it comes to \nhealth care reform, we have all heard the myth that a public option \nwould amount to a government takeover of the health care system. This \nis completely false and has no basis in the legislation under \nconsideration by the Senate.\n  Let's examine the facts: 45,000 Americans die each and every year \nbecause they do not have health insurance and cannot get quality care. \nThat is 1 death every 12 minutes. Clearly, the system is broken. The \ntime for action is long past. I believe we need to restore choice and \naccountability to the health care system. The only way to accomplish \nthis is with a public option. It would increase the availability of \ncare. It would help fight the disparities that plague our current \nsystem.\n  At the moment, people of color represent half of the Nation's \nuninsured, even though they make up only a third of the total \npopulation. A low-cost public option would meet the needs of these who \nare at a disadvantage, regardless of background or skin color. The \npublic option would restore competition to a market that is currently \nmonopolized by only a few corporations. Take my State. In the State of \nIllinois, two companies dominate 69 percent of the insurance market. \nThat is why their profits are growing four times faster than wages. \nThis is unsustainable. It is breaking America's businesses and \nbankrupting American families.\n  We talked about businesses earlier. My colleagues mentioned what this \nwill do for small businesses.\n  We must make sure there are choices for them to have an exchange \nwhere small businesses can shop for their insurance. If these companies \nhave to compete with a public plan, everyone's premiums will go down. \nIt will bring about competition in the marketplace. If you like your \ncurrent insurance providers, nothing will change except that you will \nsave money, and you won't have to worry about losing coverage when you \nneed it. No government bureaucrat will alter your insurance plan, your \ndoctor, or the level of care you receive. But if you can't afford \ninsurance or your coverage has been denied due to a preexisting \ncondition, you will be able to get quality care at an affordable rate. \nJust like any business, a not-for-profit public insurance option would \nrequire initial capital to get off the ground. But afterwards it would \nrely on the premium it collects to remain self-sufficient.\n  The current system is a drain on American taxpayers. The public \noption would not be. The public option would complement private \ninsurance providers, not drive them out of business. In fact, it will \nresult in an increase of 1 to 3 million additional customers for \nprivate companies. In other words, by bringing all those persons into \ncoverage, insurance companies will benefit when all these uninsured \npeople will now be covered. There will be no government takeover, no \ndeath panels, no rationing, and no redtape between you and your doctor.\n  It is time to reject these myths and to take decisive action. The \nonly way to achieve meaningful health care reform and bring costs down \nis through a public option that creates real competition in the system.\n  Let it be clear to all of my colleagues in this august body: I will \nnot vote for any health care bill that does not include a public \noption.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Illinois for his eloquent \ndiscussion about trying to provide more choice rather than less to our \nworking families. A lot of what we are trying to do with health care \nreform--and I hope the bills will improve over the coming weeks--is \ngive people more control over choices with respect to their doctors and \ntheir medical care, to make sure that it is doctors and patients making \ndecisions about treatment and not insurance company bureaucrats or a \ngovernment bureaucrat.\n  Next I will yield for the Senator from Delaware to talk about why \nthis is such an urgent problem and why we need to address it now and \nnot wait, as we have over the last 20 years. As the President said, the \nfirst President to call for health care reform was Teddy Roosevelt. \nHere we sit in 2009, confronted by the same sorts of arguments about \nwhy today is the wrong time to do this and why we ought to kick the can \ndown the road for another generation of Americans.\n  I turn the floor over to the Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennet for organizing \nthis event today. He has been a leader in our effort to try to achieve \nmeaningful health care reform. I am looking to him, as we move down the \nroad on health care reform, to continue to show leadership to make sure \nwe achieve meaningful health care reform.\n  I appreciate the opportunity once again to join my colleagues and \nshow our united support for health care reform. I want to address one \nof the biggest myths reform opponents have spread throughout the \ndebate, the myth that America cannot afford to change the health care \nsystem. They say our country has too much debt and the health care \nreform would only increase the Nation's deficit. They say we spent too \nmuch money on TARP\n\n[[Page S10456]]\n\nand the stimulus package. They say we must rein in spending and push \noff health reform until we straighten out our fiscal house. When we \nhear this kind of criticism, especially during this time of economic \ndownturn, it is reasonable to ask if now is the time for reform of the \nhealth care system. The answer is: We need health care reform now. We \nneed health care reform now because economic recovery for the long term \nis completely dependent on controlling health care costs.\n  We cannot afford to wait for reform because the status quo is \nabsolutely, positively unsustainable.\n  Medical costs account for one-sixth of domestic spending and are \nheaded upward. They are handcuffing families and workers, strangling \nFederal and State Governments. In 2000, the average premium for family \nhealth care in Delaware was just over $7,500. In 2008, that number \njumped to $14,900, almost doubling in only 8 years. If we do not enact \nhealth care reform now, the same premium for family coverage is \nexpected to reach $29,000 in 2016, another doubling in price.\n  The status quo is unsustainable because of health care spending on a \nnational level. In 1979, we spent approximately $220 billion as a \nnation on health care. In 1992, we spent close to $850 billion. In \n2009, we will spend $2.5 trillion on health care. That trajectory of \nhealth care expenditures is totally out of control. We must begin to \nbend the cost curve down on the health care system. We need to do this \nnow. We cannot wait any longer. We cannot afford to wait for reform \nbecause failure to do so will place even more pressure on the Federal \nbudget and on taxpayers to continue support for Medicare and Medicaid.\n  Clearly, one of the major driving forces behind our Federal deficit \nis the skyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid. Combined, these \nprograms account for 20 percent of all government expenditures. If we \ndo nothing to start bending the cost curve down for Medicare and \nMedicaid, we will eventually spend more on these two programs than all \nother Federal programs combined.\n  Let me say that again: If we do nothing to start bending the cost \ncurve down on Medicare and Medicaid, we will eventually--and not that \nfar off--spend more on these two programs than all other Federal \nprograms combined. Because of this, people who are concerned about \ndeficits should welcome health care reform now. The plans being \nconsidered by the Congress would require some upfront cost, but reform \ndone the right way will mean savings for families and businesses, money \nthat could be pumped into the economy.\n  We all know in the short term the cost of expanding coverage to \nAmericans will temporarily increase government spending. Quickly, \nhowever, the net impact of the cost containment provisions will \naccumulate, and there will be a reduction in government spending. It is \nimportant to remember that while we are awaiting the cost containment \nprovisions to take hold, the President and congressional leaders have \ninsisted that health care reform be deficit neutral. In other words, \nthe administration and Congress are committed to responsible health \ncare reform that reduces the deficit over 10 years and major reductions \nover the long term. We will not be able to get the major reductions we \nneed to sustain the budget and sustain the Government if we don't do \nthese things now which will only begin to benefit us in the long term. \nFor this reason we cannot afford to wait for health care reform.\n  Finally, if we lose this opportunity to pass health care reform, we \nwill not have an opportunity to reform our health system in the \nforeseeable future. We will be stuck with the unsustainable status quo. \nThis Congress, this President is not about to return to this issue if \nwe do not pass it because it is so incredibly difficult and so \ntraumatic and takes everyone's concern. I have been around Congress for \n36 years, and I have learned something about how Washington works. \nTrust me, we have truly a unique window of opportunity for health care \nreform. The window is now open. It will soon close. We have a new \nPresident in his first year in office who has a good relationship with \nCongress. There is major support for reform among providers, patients, \nbusiness, labor, and everyday Americans. With the major players in \nhealth care seeking reform, this could be our chance. I believe it is \nour chance, and this will be the only chance for a while.\n  Mark my words: If we don't take this opening and enact health care \nreform this year, it will not be done until the health care system \ncrashes down around our ears. We cannot continue the status quo for one \nmore day. We cannot wait to enact health care reform. We must gather \nour collective will and do the right thing during this historic \nopportunity by passing health care reform. We can do no less. The \nAmerican people deserve no less.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator from Delaware for pointing out that \nmaintaining the status quo, being unwilling to act, in fact, is making \na choice.\n  It is making a choice about having another decade of double-digit \ncost increases every year. It is making a choice about devoting a fifth \nof our economy to health care when every other industrialized country \nin the world is devoting less than half of that. It is making a choice \nabout having increasing and mounting and rising deficits in the \noutyears.\n  I thank the Senator from Delaware for pointing out that we have a \nonce-in-a-lifetime opportunity right now to try to address a number of \nthese issues at the same time.\n  Mr. President, our closer today is the Senator from New Hampshire, \nwho is here to talk about what this reform is about versus what some \nhave claimed it is about. I welcome her here this morning.\n  Let me turn the floor over to the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank very much Senator Bennet for \ncoordinating this effort today.\n  As you have all heard for the past few weeks, the freshmen Senators \nhave joined together to deliver a very simple message: We need to act, \nand we need to act now, on health care reform.\n  As people have been pointing out all morning, there is a lot of \nconfusing and, unfortunately, some false information that has been \ngoing around about who is going to be included in health care reform \nlegislation and what that is going to mean for people. So as everyone \nhas said, we are joining together today to try to dispel some of those \nmyths and to focus on what really matters, which is making our health \ncare system better for our families, for our businesses, and for our \nNation's economy.\n  One common myth we have heard is that health reform is a government \ntakeover of our health care system. This is simply not true. The truth \nis, health care reform is being driven by consumers who are concerned \nabout the cost of health care and about their coverage, and it is being \ndriven by the market because health care costs are so high that too \nmany businesses and too many people cannot get the health care they \nneed when they need it.\n  Under the current legislation, everyone will have the freedom to keep \ntheir health care plan if they like it. But for the millions of hard-\nworking Americans who cannot find affordable coverage or who have been \ndiscriminated against because of a preexisting condition or for women \nlike me who too often are discriminated against in the costs of health \ncare, health reform will give them a choice.\n  Last week, my office heard from a man named Andrew from New Boston, \nNH. Sadly, his story is all too common. Andrew and his family had \nemployer-sponsored insurance coverage through his wife's job. \nUnfortunately, she was laid off recently. Now not only is she out of \nwork, but her family has to find another source of health insurance \ncoverage. The fact is, the individual market simply does not provide \nsufficient affordable options for families. The coverage they managed \nto find--Andrew and his family--puts a significant financial burden on \ntheir family.\n  The good news is, health reform legislation offers a solution for \nfamilies such as Andrew's by offering more choice. The health insurance \nexchange creates a marketplace where insurance companies must compete \nfor our business. Individuals and small businesses will be able to shop \nfor the most affordable plans in a way that is transparent and easy to \nunderstand--similar to the\n\n[[Page S10457]]\n\nway Members of Congress get their insurance, and Americans should have \nthe same choice.\n  Increased competition and transparency do not sound like a government \ntakeover to me. Rather, it sounds like the markets acting in a way that \nbest serves the American people.\n  My health reform reality check is that health care reform is consumer \nbased and market driven. You can keep your insurance if you like it. It \nwill increase choices for families. It will promote competition.\n  We need to move past the rhetoric and the myths. We need to rise to \nthe occasion in this pivotal moment in our Nation's history. We must \npass meaningful health reform for the citizens of New Hampshire and all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for closing in such a perfect way today. I agree with her \nthat for far too long Washington special interest politics has gotten \nin the way of fixing this system, and the result has been enormously \nunfortunate for working families all across the United States of \nAmerica.\n  When your median family income is going down by $300 over a decade, \nand the cost of health insurance is doubling over the same period of \ntime--by the way, in my State, it has gone down by $800--and the cost \nof insurance has gone up 97 percent, the cost of higher education has \ngone up by 50 percent over the same period of time, essentially what we \nare saying to working families is: You are going to take home less, but \nyou have to pay more for, not ``nice to haves'' but things that are \ncritical to move your family ahead to have the kind of stability that \nis essential for everybody to have a shot at the American dream, and \nfor some reason we in Washington cannot figure out how to make some \nchanges that would help working families and small businesses all \nacross the United States.\n  That moment has come now, and we are here. We have the next few weeks \nto figure this out. I believe we will. I am enormously optimistic we \ncan pass a bill in this Senate and in the Congress that the President \ncan sign that will make a material impact, an improvement in the lives \nof working families and those employed by small businesses all over \nthis country. In fact, anything less than that should be unacceptable \nto all of us.\n  I hope we can do that in a bipartisan way. I hope we can have \ncooperation across the aisle and the best ideas from both parties as we \ndesign it. But, to me, the most important thing is to make sure people \nwho live in my State do not need to endure another decade of double-\ndigit cost increases every single year, do not need to endure another \ndecade where they lose their health insurance because they lose a job \nor because they have a preexisting condition or because, as happened in \nmy State last week, a baby was born who was deemed to be too heavy to \ninsure--fortunately, the insurance company did the right thing in the \nend--to not have another decade where people are wrestling with their \ninsurers to get paid, so that doctors and people providing health care \ndo not have to spend 30 percent of their overhead or more trying to get \nreimbursed for services they provided to their patients.\n  I am optimistic in part because of all my wonderful colleagues who \nwere here this morning. I thank them for joining me today.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in support of the \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act. This bill will extend at least \n14 weeks of unemployment benefits to workers across the country who \nwill exhaust their benefits by the end of the year.\n  This the second time I have come to the floor to urge those who are \nholding up this critical legislation to stop blocking its passage.\n  This week we learned that Wall Street firms are expected to pay out a \nrecord $140 billion in compensation. While the economy seems to have \nturned around for Wall Street executives, it sure hasn't turned around \nfor millions of American workers who still can't find a job.\n  If we can bail out the big banks that got us into this financial \nmess, shouldn't this Senate be able to act quickly to help the people \nhit hardest by this recession--unemployed workers?\n  Apparently not, because there are Members of this Senate who are \nplaying partisan political games and delaying an extension of \nunemployment benefits. This needs to stop.\n  Today, more 5 million workers have been unemployed for 6 months or \nlonger. Through no fault of their own, millions of Americans cannot \nfind work because there are now more than 6 unemployed workers for each \njob opening. Until the job market improves, we have a responsibility to \nhelp these workers keep food on the table and pay the mortgage.\n  Not only is this the right thing to do for families, it is the right \ninvestment to make in our economy. An effective stimulus is timely, \ntargeted and temporary, and that's how this extension is designed.\n  This extension is temporary. It is targeted at those who have been \nunemployed for more than 59 weeks and have exhausted their benefits. \nAnd no one can question that it is timely.\n  Unemployment compensation is money that gets spent immediately on \nnecessities. People who are out of work need this money to help pay \nrent and mortgages, buy food, and pay for gas.\n  So when we extend unemployment benefits, we are not just helping \nworkers who have lost their jobs, we are helping small businesses \nacross the country by boosting demand for their products and services.\n  In fact, economists say that dollar-for-dollar, extending \nunemployment benefits is one of the most cost effective actions we can \ntake to stimulate the economy.\n  Temporary extensions of unemployment benefits are an especially \neffective stimulus when the long-term unemployment rate is high, and, \nunfortunately, that is the situation today. Nationally, the number of \nlong-term unemployed--those jobless for 27 weeks or more--rose to 5.4 \nmillion in September. In my home State, New Hampshire, the number of \nlong-term unemployed has more than tripled in the past year.\n  I do not understand why any Senator would delay an extension of \nunemployment compensation that will help workers and small businesses \nin every single State.\n  People are counting on us to act now. American workers who have \nexhausted unemployment benefits cannot wait another week to pay the \nrent or buy groceries.\n  I urge my colleagues to stop the games and pass this critical \nextension without further delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Mr. President, I have the honor of chairing the United \nStates Helsinki Commission, representing the Senate. The Helsinki \nCommission is the U.S. participation in the Organization for Security \nand Cooperation in Europe. Fifty-six countries representing Europe, \nCentral Asia, Canada, and the United States got together in 1975 in \norder to further advancements in security, in human rights, and in \neconomics.\n\n[[Page S10458]]\n\n  We had our full meeting in Athens this past weekend, and the center \nsubject for that meeting was climate change and the need for the \ninternational community to come together to enact meaningful goals for \nreducing greenhouse gases and carbon emissions. It was clear, from the \nurgency of this mission, that we need to act now; that the \ncircumstances of floods and droughts in so many parts of the world are \ncausing immediate concern. We now have what is known as climate \nmigrants--people who are forced to leave their countries because of the \nimpact of global climate change. This is causing serious concerns in \nmany parts of the world in regard to stability and security, which \naffects U.S. interests.\n  I know each of us in our own States can give our own examples of the \nimpact of climate change. In my State of Maryland, the residents of \nSmith Island understand that their island is disappearing during their \nlifetime because of sea level changes, due in part to global climate \nchange. The watermen in Maryland know their livelihood is being \njeopardized because of the warming of the Chesapeake Bay, affecting sea \ngrasses, which affects the ability of the blue crab to survive. So we \nall know the immediate impact.\n  But in Athens it became apparent to the international community that \nwe need to act now. We need to act now for the sake of our security, we \nneed to act now because of the economic imperative, and we need to act \nnow because of the environmental risk. The good news is it was apparent \nto all of us that there is a common solution. If we deal with our \nenergy issues, we can solve all three of those problems.\n  We can strengthen our economies, particularly in these difficult \ntimes, by creating good new jobs; we can deal with international \nsecurity threats, when one nation threatens to cut off its oil or gas \nto another country; or the fact that so many places in the world that \nhave the mineral wealth have values that are different than our values \nand we are actually helping to support their values; and for the \nenvironmental need of making sure that we deal with global climate \nchange in future generations and we work together.\n  The question that was asked at this meeting was: Where is the United \nStates? Where is the leadership from the strongest Nation in the world? \nWell, my reply was: The United States is back. We are ready to assume \ninternational leadership on global climate change issues.\n  The Obama administration has already taken action. They have taken \naction on CAFE standards for automobiles. They have taken action \nthrough the Environmental Protection Agency. It is clear that we are \nready to act. The House of Representatives has already passed \nlegislation, and Senator Kerry and Senator Boxer have brought forward \nthe Clean Energy Jobs and the American Power Act, and I am proud to be \npart of that effort and that legislation. That legislation builds on \nthe work done in the last Congress with Senator Lieberman and Senator \nWarner, and it is very similar to the bill that has passed the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  What that legislation will do is to reestablish U.S. leadership on \ninternational efforts to deal with global climate change. The \nlegislation would establish a 20-percent reduction by the year 2020. \nThat is stronger than in the House bill and it establishes America as a \nleader. It dedicates investment toward domestic clean energy and 21st \ncentury infrastructure by providing the necessary investments in wind \nand solar. These technologies were developed in the United States and \nnow it is time for us to put that technology to work creating jobs in \nAmerica and alternative renewable energy sources that will wean us off \nthe need for imported oil.\n  The legislation also dedicates funds for other types of green \ntransportation, which we know can be very valuable. Green \ntransportation represents 30 percent of our greenhouse gas emissions \nand 70 percent of our oil. We can do much better. I am personally \nworking very hard to promote additional funding sources for public \ntransportation. You can't help, when you travel to Europe, but know \nthat their models are much stronger than ours in transporting people \nthrough public transportation. I happen to represent two of the most \ncongested urban areas in our country--Baltimore and Washington. Both \nhave transit systems that are in need of expansion. By doubling the \nridership on public transportation, we can reduce our imported oil by \n40 percent alone.\n  This legislation is friendly toward alternative energy sources and \nnuclear energy, which has a very favorable carbon footprint. It also \ncreates jobs. We know that we can create four times as many jobs here \nin America by investing in green energy rather than in oil or gas. \nJapan also knows that. They have been investing in renewable energy \nsources. Germany knows that. They are investing today because they know \nit is good for jobs. China knows that. They are investing today. They \nare going forward with these programs for alternative and renewable \nenergy sources in wind and solar and many other areas, because they \nknow that is where the competition will be tomorrow, and they are going \nto be prepared. We also need to be prepared.\n  The legislation Senator Kerry and Senator Boxer have brought forward \nprotects the consumers, making sure that in our transition we don't add \nto the cost of the typical consumer in America. It also helps \nindustries that are very dependent today on carbon energy sources. It \nhelps them in transition so they can transition to the new energy of \ntomorrow. It invests in clean coal. We have plenty of coal, but it \nemits too much carbon. Well, this bill invests in figuring out how we \ncan use coal in an environmentally friendly way.\n  The legislation also deals with our international responsibilities. \nAs a developed nation, we have a responsibility to developing \ncountries. They have already been impacted much more adversely than we \ndue to the impacts of global climate change. We need to strengthen \ntheir ability and resolve to protect our forests, to be good stewards \nof our environment, and to help them deal with development. The bill \nalso provides for wildlife--to preserve wildlife.\n\n  One last part about the Kerry-Boxer bill. It is deficit neutral. It \nwill not add any additional debt for future generations. This is truly \na bill that my two granddaughters, that all our children and \ngrandchildren will benefit from by having a cleaner environment, a \nsafer country through energy security, good jobs for the future, and \nall without adding to the deficit.\n  I reminded my colleagues in Athens that for Copenhagen to be \nsuccessful, we need to have a bill that sets reasonable targets, \nabsolutely--short term and long term. We have to have the mechanisms \nthat get us to those targets in place in Copenhagen. We also have to \nhave the financing to help the developing countries, and we also have \nto have enforcement. We have to have enforcement.\n  What do I mean by that? Well, we are not going to accomplish our \ngoals if the United States does everything it does to reduce carbon \nemissions but we find other countries don't do that and then they send \ntheir products here to America at a cheaper price. That is unfair to \nU.S. manufacturers and producers, and it doesn't accomplish our \ninternational goals of bringing down carbon emissions. So what I have \nsuggested is that in Copenhagen there needs to be a mechanism that says \nif your country does not meet the international standards, your \nproducts are subject to a border adjustment reflective of the cost to \nbring that product in compliance with international carbon standards. \nThat is fair to the manufacturers in those countries that have met \nthose standards, and it also permits us to make sure that other \ncountries in fact do act to deal with their international \nresponsibilities.\n  I am optimistic. I am optimistic we are going to be able to achieve \nthese results. The urgency of the issue requires us to act. We have \nSenator Kerry and Senator Boxer who have brought forward a reasonable \nbill, and hearings are scheduled before the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee later this month.\n  Recently Senator Kerry and Senator Graham have gotten together on a \nblueprint on how we can move forward on global climate change \nlegislation in this Congress, and they bring up two subjects I have \nalready mentioned--the use of nuclear power in America, which clearly \nneeds to be part of the solution, and how we can deal with clean \nburning coal.\n\n[[Page S10459]]\n\n  In Copenhagen, in December, we need to achieve the international \nresults that are the strongest in setting these goals and mechanisms in \nplace. I am confident that America will be a leader in Copenhagen, and \na leader in bringing forward responsible legislation to deal with \nenergy.\n  For those who say we should go slow, let me tell you, reviving our \neconomy is intrinsically linked to rethinking how we solve our energy \nchallenges. Investing in new technology creates new jobs. Diversifying \nour energy sources creates competition, stabilizing and lowering energy \nprices. And thinking beyond fossil fuel buried in unstable and \nunreliable countries makes us all more secure. Our dependence on old \nways, old patterns, and old resources puts us at a financial and \nnational security disadvantage. Those same fossil fuels we burn to \ndrive our cars, power our homes and heat and treat our water are \npolluting our air, making our children sick, and raising our planet's \ntemperature. The good news is that in solving our energy security \nchallenge, we can also grow our economy and clean our environment.\n  But let's remember that any deals we reach in Copenhagen and any laws \nwe pass here are but the beginning. The work must continue with earnest \nfollow-through dedicated to truly changing the way we work and live and \nmove around this Earth.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise for two purposes. First, there is \na huge argument in America with regard to health care, and we all know \none of the main contributing factors to the health difficulties of all \nAmericans is the subject of obesity. There are many opinions about ways \nto address it, but the most comprehensive way to address it is to be \nintellectually honest in addressing it.\n  The President of the Coca-Cola Company was published in an October 8 \nWall Street Journal article, and it is a brilliant article on obesity, \nweight, sugar content, and soft drinks. I commend it to the Senate for \ntheir study.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe full article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 8, 2009]\n\n                      Coke Didn't Make America Fat\n\n                            (By Muhtar Kent)\n\n       Obesity is a complex issue, and addressing it is important \n     for all Americans. We at the Coca-Cola company are committed \n     to working with government and health organizations to \n     implement effective solutions to address this problem.\n       But a number of public-health advocates have already come \n     up with what they think is the solution: heavy taxes on some \n     routine foods and beverages that they have decided are high \n     in calories. The taxes, the advocates acknowledge are \n     intended to limit consumption of targeted foods and help you \n     to accept the diet that they have determined is best.\n       In cities and states across America--and even at the \n     federal level--this idea is getting increased attention \n     despite its regressive nature and inherent illogic.\n       While it is true that since the 1970s Americans have \n     increased their average caloric intake by 12%, they also have \n     become more sedentary. According to the National Center for \n     Health Statistics 2008 Chartbook, 39% of adults in the U.S. \n     are not engaging in leisure physical activity. The Centers \n     for Disease Control and Prevention has found that 60% of \n     Americans are not regularly active and 25% of Americans are \n     not active at all. The average American spends the equivalent \n     of 60 days a year in front of a television, according to a \n     2008 A.C. Nielsen study. This same research data show that \n     the average time spent playing video games in the U.S. went \n     up by 25% during the last four years.\n       If we're genuinely interested in curbing obesity, we need \n     to take a hard look in the mirror and acknowledge that it's \n     not just about calories in. It's also about calories out.\n       Our industry has become an easy target in this debate. \n     Sugar-sweetened beverages have been singled out for \n     demonization in spite of the fact that soft drinks, energy \n     drinks, sports drinks and sweetened bottled water combined \n     contribute 5.5% of the calories in the average American diet, \n     according to the National Cancer Institute. It's difficult to \n     understand why the beverages we and others provide are being \n     targeted as the primary cause of weight gain when 94.5% of \n     calorie intake comes from other foods and beverages.\n       Those pushing for this tax lack some essential facts, not \n     to mention some basic common sense. Over the past 20 years, \n     the average caloric content of soft drinks has dropped by \n     nearly 25%. This is due in large part to a determined focus \n     by our company and others on the diet/light category with \n     brands like Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Zero and Powerade Zero. Even \n     soft drinks with sugar, like Coca-Cola, contain no more \n     calories (140 calories in a can) than common snacks, \n     breakfast foods and most desserts served up daily in millions \n     of American homes. And while obesity rates have skyrocketed, \n     sales of regular soft drinks decreased by nearly 10% from \n     2000 to 2008, according to the industry publication Beverage \n     Digest.\n       So where are all of the extra calories in the American diet \n     coming from? Research from the United States Department of \n     Agriculture shows that added sugars, as a percentage of total \n     daily available calories, have declined 11% since 1970. Yet \n     the percent of calories from added fats and flour/cereal \n     products has increased 35% and 13%, respectively, during that \n     same time period.\n       Will a soft drink tax change behavior? Two states currently \n     have a tax on sodas--West Virginia and Arkansas--and they are \n     among the states with the highest rates of obesity in the \n     nation.\n       Obesity is a serious problem. We know that. And we agree \n     that Americans need to be more active and take greater \n     responsibility for their diets. But are soft drinks the \n     cause? I would submit to you that they are no more so than \n     some other products--and a lot less than many, many others.\n       As a leader in our industry, we have a role to play in \n     solving this issue. Globally, we have led the industry for \n     nearly 30 years with innovations across the diet and light \n     beverage categories. Today, more than 25% of our global \n     beverage portfolio is comprised of low- or no-calorie \n     beverages.\n       Policy makers should stop spending their valuable time \n     demonizing an industry that directly employs more than \n     220,000 people in the U.S., and through supporting \n     industries, an additional three million. Instead, business \n     and government should come together to help encourage greater \n     physical activity and sensible dieting, while allowing \n     Americans to enjoy the simple pleasure of a Coca-Cola.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10459-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10459-S10460]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO FURMAN BISHER\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, on Sunday of this past week, an event of \njournalistic magnitude took place in the city of Atlanta and the State \nof Georgia. A man by the name of Furman Bisher published his last \nsports column in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He typed that column \non the same manual Royal typewriter upon which he typed his first \ncolumn 59 years ago.\n  Furman Bisher is a distinguished employee of the Atlanta Journal-\nConstitution, a distinguished resident of our city and our State. \nUnlike many in his profession, he had a profound positive effect on his \ncity and his State and on sports. Furman Bisher started writing in \nAtlanta, GA when Atlanta's only professional sports team was the \nAtlanta Crackers, a Double-A team playing in a small bandbox stadium in \nPonce de Leon Park. In the 1960s, as his career emerged, he, along with \nJesse Adler, were the principal writers of sports in the Atlanta \nJournal-Constitution. He began to be published in other magazines, \nmagazines such as Sports magazine, magazines such as the Sporting News. \nHe developed respect around the United States as a gifted, talented, \nand honest sports writer.\n\n  Had it not been for Furman Bisher, the Atlanta Braves probably would \nnot be in Atlanta, GA because when Mills B. Lane and Mayor Ivan Allen \nrisked what then was a huge amount of money, $18 million, to build a \nmajor league sports stadium without a sports team, it was not until \nFurman Bisher went and talked to the Bartholomay family who were \ngetting ready to move the Milwaukee Braves from Milwaukee and convinced \nthem to bring major league baseball for the first time ever to the \nSouth.\n  The same was true a few years later when Rankin Smith petitioned to \nbuy the first NFL franchise to exist in the South, and that $7.5 \nmillion purchase happened for a lot of reasons but probably the most \nimportant of which was Furman Bisher.\n  What is so great about Furman is he could make sports come alive, \nfrom cricket to football, from boxing to golf. His writing on boxing is \nhistoric and his following of Atlanta native Evander Holyfield helped \nelevate Evander to where he became the Heavyweight Champion of the \nWorld. But probably\n\n[[Page S10460]]\n\nnothing was more important than the years of coverage of the greatest \ngolf tournament on the face of the Earth--the Masters. None other than \nBobby Jones, none other than Jack Nicklaus, none other than Arnold \nPalmer, none other thank Tiger Woods acknowledged that the gifted \nwriting of Furman Bisher about that treasured tournament helped to \nelevate it to where it is today, the preeminent event in golf around \nthe world.\n  A lot of people contribute a lot to their profession. We in Georgia \nare proud of so many who have given so much to our State. Today I want \nto pay tribute to a man who for 59 dedicated years covered sports in \nGeorgia and made it possible for many great things to happen, a man who \nwas gifted, a man was talented and a man who, even today, shares his \nwisdom and his commitment to sports as he approaches his 91st birthday.\n  On a personal note, as a young boy and a sports fan in the late 1940s \nand 1950s, I used to rush to the mailbox to get our Atlanta Journal and \nour Atlanta Constitution and I didn't go to the funny papers, I didn't \ngo to the comics, I didn't go to the crossword puzzle. I went to Furman \nBisher. Furman was a great writer and to me an inspiration for sports \nin Atlanta, GA. I wish him and his family the very best in their \nretirement.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to discuss our \nefforts to extend unemployment benefits to over 15 million people who \nare looking for work today. That is only the number of people we know \nare out there based on the unemployment statistics, not those who have \ntried for a long time and been unsuccessful and are currently neither \nin the workforce nor are working two or three or four part-time jobs \ntrying to hold things together for themselves and their families. We do \nknow this. Over 15 million people today who are trying to support their \nfamilies in this very tough economic time need our help immediately to \nstay afloat.\n  Two nights ago I asked for agreement to move to the unemployment \ninsurance bill. Our leader had asked for agreement to do that before. \nThis has already passed the House and is awaiting Senate action. \nUnfortunately, Republican colleagues objected. They have objected \nseveral times and continue to object to our bringing forward an effort \nto help families who, through no fault of their own, find themselves in \nan extraordinarily difficult situation, relying on unemployment in \norder to be able to keep their families afloat.\n  Unemployment is not a partisan issue. Right now, 14 States and the \nDistrict of Columbia, blue States and red States, have unemployment \nrates over 10 percent: Illinois, Georgia, Alabama, Florida, North \nCarolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Kentucky, South Carolina, California, \nOregon, Rhode Island, Nevada and, of course, my great State of \nMichigan, where we are now seeing over a 15.3-percent unemployment \nrate, the highest in the country.\n  Our people are hurting and they have been hurting for a long time. I \nwas very proud of our President as he came into office for \nunderstanding that and joining with us in a recovery package to make \nsure we were extending unemployment at the beginning of the year. But \nunfortunately the recession continues and people are still hurting. \nDemocrats are unemployed and Republicans are unemployed. The people \ngetting unemployment insurance are looking for work, they are pounding \nthe pavement and they are putting in applications every day. This is \nnot their fault.\n  The economic situation in this country is not their fault. The bank \nfailures are not their fault. The foreclosure crisis is not their \nfault. But they are the ones paying the price every single day. Every \nsingle day, every single time the other side objects to bringing up \nthis bill, people across the country are hurting. They are exhausting \ntheir unemployment insurance and are being left with no way to pay the \nmortgage, to take the kids to the doctor, to pay their heating bills, \nto be able to hold it together, waiting for this economy to turn around \nand jobs to be available, jobs they so desperately want.\n  It is getting cold outside. Winter is coming and families across the \ncountry are turning on their heaters for the first time in months. They \nneed us to extend unemployment insurance so they can keep the heat on \nfor their kids. Pulling the rug out from under these hard-working men \nand women doesn't just hurt them and their families, it hurts every \ncommunity and it hurts our economy in America. When they can afford to \npay their bills, that money goes back into the economy, as we know. We \nknow that for every $1 spent on unemployment benefits, $2.15 goes back \ninto the economy. That is exactly what we need at this point--immediate \nstimulus.\n  This is an incredibly difficult time for families, certainly in my \nState and all across the country. Blocking this legislation, saying no \nto everything, delaying everything--that is not going to pull us out of \nthis recession and it is not going to help American families.\n  The time to act is now, right now. I urge my colleagues to stop \nblocking an important effort to help working men and women in this \ncountry, people who have followed the rules all their lives, have done \nnothing but find themselves at this place and this time, with the \neconomy where it is, as we rebuild it--and we are and we will. We need \nto support them so they can do the right thing for their families and \nkeep a roof over their heads and food on the table and the lights on \nand the heat on and know that their country has got their back.\n  That is what this is about. We need to pass the extension of \nunemployment insurance now. I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, last night I joined Senator Udall from New \nMexico and Senator Whitehouse and the Presiding Officer, Senator \nBurris, and some others. Senator Durbin, the other Illinois Senator, \nwas there too for part of the evening, talking about the public option \nand why it is so important to keep the insurance industry honest, to \nhelp constrain costs and to compete directly with private insurance so \nthat people, as they join those who are uninsured, who want to get \ninsurance, can choose. They can choose Cigna, they can choose Aetna, \nthey can choose WellPoint, they can choose United. In my State they can \nchoose Medical Mutual, or they can choose a public option, so they \nwould have that choice and it provides more choice to people. It is not \na government takeover in any way. It simply provides more choice for \nthose people who are insured.\n  I come to the floor, day after day, sharing letters I received from \npeople in Ohio, from Cincinnati and Dayton, from Athens and Saint \nClairsville, from Toledo and Lima. People who generally write most of \nthese letters are people who were satisfied with their health \ninsurance. They thought they had pretty good health insurance.\n  They find out, when they get sick, that their health insurance isn't \nwhat they thought it was. They end up battling every week with their \ninsurance company trying to get something paid for. They find out maybe \ntheir insurance coverage got cut off--insurance companies call it \nrescission, their official bureaucratic word--as so many people lose \ntheir health insurance when it has gotten too expensive. These are \npeople who were satisfied with their insurance and then found out it is \nnot so great after all.\n  I wish to share some of the letters I have received from Ohio. This \nis from Tony from Rocky River. He writes:\n\n       I'm the Executive Director of a provider of residential and \n     group homes for people with developmental disabilities. We \n     employ 250\n\n[[Page S10461]]\n\n     staff members, most of whom make a starting wage of $8.50 per \n     hour. We offer health insurance to staff who work at least 24 \n     hours a week. We don't have a Cadillac plan, we provide just \n     basic coverage. We believe in doing this [because] many of \n     our staff members are part-time workers and have to work two \n     other jobs just to pay for bills, groceries, and utilities. \n     We recently started negotiations with our health insurance \n     carrier for our 2010 rates. We were informed that we may have \n     an 84 percent increase over last year's rate.\n\n  That is almost double what they had last year.\n\n       We were told the increase was due, in part, because one \n     staff member [out of 250] had a heart attack in the past year \n     and another staff member is being treated for renal failure. \n     We were shocked as we already pay close to $500,000 per year \n     for our coverage. We could now be facing an additional \n     $420,000 just to cover [the same number of] employees. You \n     would expect in a staff of 250 that someone would have an \n     illness, yet we are being severely penalized for being \n     responsible and offering coverage to our workers and their \n     families.\n\n  That is what is happening. This is not a tiny, small business, but in \na small business, so often one person, two people, three people get an \nexpensive illness. Sometimes the insurance company will cut them off \nindividually or as a group. Other times the increase for insurance will \nbe so much that people such as Tony may not be able to offer insurance \nto their employees. This is so important. These are low-income people \nmaking $8.50, $9 an hour doing work that most people in this Chamber \nwouldn't be willing to do, getting paid such low wages. At least they \noffer health insurance. That may be gone. That is why reform is so \nimportant. That is why the public option is so important, so we don't \nsee this kind of profiteering by the insurance industry.\n  Rebecca from Summit County writes:\n\n       I have two sons with severe ADHD. They were both diagnosed \n     at an early age, due to their extremely impulsive behavior. \n     Each son requires three prescriptions per day to enable them \n     to go to school and get through their daily life. With the \n     medication and periodic exams with a neurologist, they are \n     doing well. My employer pays over half the cost of our \n     premiums, but my portion of the premium is $600 per month out \n     of my paycheck. I'm worried that soon my employer will be \n     unable to continue our coverage. As it is, my husband and I \n     don't go to the doctor because we simply can't afford it. \n     Even though it might not seem like a life-or-death situation, \n     it really is. Without their medication, my sons have serious \n     illnesses with impulsiveness that could be dangerous. If they \n     don't complete their education, they won't be able to support \n     themselves in the future.\n\n  Nothing scares a parent more than leaving behind children who can't \nsupport themselves because of some kind of illness. I don't think \nanything terrifies parents more than that.\n\n       I know our situation isn't unique, so I hope something can \n     be done to help all Americans.\n\n  Rebecca's is another plea for help from this institution. It is \nsimply unconscionable for us not to move forward.\n  Let me close talking about Virgil from Akron. He is a retired 30-year \nveteran of the Akron Police Department and has to spend one-third of \nhis retirement pay on health insurance premiums. Virgil retired in \n1999, when the premium for him and his wife Marlene was $45. Only 11 \nyears later, Virgil and Marlene pay monthly premiums of $700--from $45 \nto $700. This is a retired 30-year veteran police officer who served \nhis community as a law enforcement official for three decades. \nStruggling with high out-of-pocket medical expenses, Virgil and his \nfamily resorted to pill cutting to make their prescriptions last \nlonger. Virgil and the dedicated police officers, firefighters, \nteachers, nurses, and public servants deserve better than. They deserve \nhealth reform now.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

Mr. President, I stand to urge all of my colleagues, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to support having a vote on Vitter amendment \nNo. 2466 to the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill.\n  Unfortunately, the majority leader and others have been working quite \nhard to block that vote. I believe this issue demands attention, \ndemands focus, demands reasonable debate, and a vote.\n  What is this issue? This is the revised version of my amendment to \nthat appropriations bill:\n\n       None of the funds provided in this Act or any other act for \n     any fiscal year may be used for collection of census data \n     that does not include a question regarding United States \n     Citizenship.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nmy amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide that none of the funds provided to the Census may \nbe used for collection of census data that does not include a question \n             regarding status of United States Citizenship)\n\n       On page 110, line 7, strike ``activities.'' and insert \n     ``activities: Provided further; That none of the funds \n     provided in this Act or any other act for any fiscal year may \n     be used for collection of census data that does not include a \n     question regarding United States Citizenship.''\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, the point is very simple. A big decennial \ncensus is coming up next year. Under the current plans of the Census \nBureau, we are going to count everybody in the country--and that is \nfine--but we are not going to distinguish, we are not going to know the \ndifference between citizens and noncitizens. I think that is not fine, \nI think that is crazy, and I think it will lead to some dangerous \nresults.\n  First of all, the whole purpose of a census is to give us maximum \ninformation, maximum tools we can use in a whole host of policy debates \nand Federal programs. Certainly, it is useful to know both the overall \nnumber of persons in the country but also the subcategories of citizens \nand noncitizens. That is particularly relevant because the immigration \ndebate is important, and we need to get our hands around that issue.\n  Secondly, and even more important, it is important because I believe \nwhen we use the census for congressional redistricting for determining \nhow many U.S. House seats each State gets, we should count citizens, \nbut we should not count in that context noncitizens, including illegal \naliens.\n  I think it is crazy, nutty, and I think the average American \ncertainly agrees that we would determine how many U.S. House Members \nevery State gets to represent it in the Congress and count noncitizens, \nincluding illegal aliens. I do not think the Founding Fathers set up a \ndemocracy--in many ways one of the most important democratic \ninstitutions in history in the U.S. Congress--to represent noncitizens. \nWhy are we not adding in the entire population of France or Belgium or \nBrazil? For obvious reasons, because this is a democracy to represent \ncitizens of the United States.\n  Of course, we can only avoid that in terms of congressional \nreapportionment if we know the subcategories of the count, citizens \nversus noncitizens. I urge all of my colleagues to support having a \nvote on this Vitter amendment to the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill and then, of course, when we get to a vote--and we \nwill--hopefully, on this bill but sometime in the near future--I assure \nyou, we will--to support in a bipartisan way this amendment.\n  Let me make two final points. First of all, I have made every \nreasonable attempt to get this vote. I had two other amendments on the \nlist for votes on this bill that were important to me and I think are \nimportant substantively. I have told, through our representatives, the \nmajority leader and his office that I will forgo votes on those two \nother amendments. We need a vote on this crucial amendment.\n  Secondly, I remind particular Senators from eight States that their \nStates will lose representation in the U.S. House if we count \nnoncitizens versus if we were to do congressional reapportionment only \ncounting citizens.\n  I believe everybody should be focused on this issue. I believe \neverybody should support my commonsense position. But surely the \nSenators from\n\n[[Page S10462]]\n\nthose eight States would want to vote for their States' self-interest. \nThose States are Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania, \nMississippi, North Carolina, and, of course, my State of Louisiana.\n  Again, I particularly appeal through the Chair to the Senators from \nthose eight States--Indiana, Iowa, Maine, Michigan, Pennsylvania, \nMississippi, North Carolina, and Louisiana. Obviously, for the very \ninterests of your State, please support getting a vote on the Vitter \namendment. Please support the Vitter amendment. Your State's \nrepresentation in the U.S. House hangs in the balance. Of course, that \nmeans please do not vote for cloture on the CJS bill until we can have \nsuch a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we are about 10 minutes away from a vote \non the energy and water conference report. I wanted to put forward one \nvery cogent reason for voting against this bill.\n  This bill hides from the American people information to which they \nare entitled. There was clearly accepted by unanimous consent an \namendment that said the reports in that bill will be made available to \nall Senators and all the citizens of this country--and rightly so--\nunless it had a national security implication for not exposing that \ninformation.\n  The best government is the one that is the most open. The best \ngovernment is the one in which people have trust. By bringing this bill \nto the floor out of conference and dropping the transparency amendment, \nthe transparency section where one can actually see what is going on in \nWashington, where one can actually see where their money is being \nspent, where one can actually see the information that a select group \nof Senators see but other Senators do not, as well as the American \npeople--if, in fact, one can see that, that breeds accountability in \nWashington.\n  If my colleagues, in fact, vote for this conference report, what they \nare saying is they want to keep the American people in the dark; they \ndo not want them to see what we are doing; they do not want them to see \nhow we are doing it; they do not want them to see why we are doing it. \nThey want the elite position of making a judgment without being held \naccountable.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this conference report.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to approve this conference \nagreement to provide over $33 billion for a variety of energy and water \ninfrastructure projects and programs. Michigan is surrounded by the \nGreat Lakes, and the funding provided in this conference report to the \nArmy Corps to maintain the navigational infrastructure and to clean up \nand protect the Great Lakes is especially important. Michigan also will \nbenefit from the investments in clean energy technologies and energy \nefficiency programs provided in this bill that will help create a more \nsustainable economy while producing quality jobs.\n  The conference report includes important funding for a wide range of \nenergy research and technology development at the Department of Energy, \nincluding advanced vehicle technologies, hydrogen and fuel cell \ntechnologies, wind and solar energy technologies, and biomass and \nbiorefinery systems. This conference report also includes funding for \ncritical areas of science including high energy and nuclear physics, \nbiological and environmental research, and advanced scientific \ncomputing research. Research and technology development in these \ngroundbreaking areas of energy and science will continue our nation's \nadvancement toward greater use of technologies that will reduce our \ndependence on oil, reduce our carbon footprint and greenhouse gas \nemissions, and increase our reliance on our home-grown renewable \nresources. Federal Government support of research and development in \nthese technology areas will also help ensure that our companies remain \ncompetitive in the global marketplace and ensure that the U.S. remains \non the competitive edge of technology development and scientific \ndiscovery.\n  I am particularly pleased that the conference report includes $12 \nmillion in funding for research and development, conceptual design and \nengineering for the Facility for Rare Isotope Beams, FRIB, to be built \nat Michigan State University. Inclusion of this funding in the \nconference report is critical to moving forward with this facility. \nUnder the Department's current plans, engineering work would continue \nin fiscal year 2011, with initial design work beginning in fiscal year \n2011 and continuing into fiscal year 2012. Construction of the facility \nwould begin in fiscal year 2013. MSU has solid and well-known expertise \nin the field of rare isotopes and nuclear physics, with the largest \nnuclear physics faculty in the nation and a nuclear physics graduate \nprogram ranked number two in the U.S., second only to MIT. MSU is \ncurrently the home of the National Superconducting Cyclotron \nLaboratory, NSCL, which is the most advanced rare isotope accelerator \nin the U.S. and is the largest nuclear science facility on a university \ncampus. FRIB is the next generation rare isotope facility and the \nDepartment of Energy's decision in December 2008 to select MSU for FRIB \nis an indication of the university's preeminence in this field.\n  I am also pleased that the conference report includes funding for \nseveral important energy projects in Michigan that will advance the \ndevelopment of technologies including advanced batteries and energy \nstorage systems, plug-in hybrid vehicles, solar and photovoltaic \nsystems, wind energy, biomass, and energy efficiency. Michigan \ncompanies and universities are well-positioned to contribute to the \ndevelopment of these advanced technologies, offering both significant \nexpertise in these technology areas and a highly trained workforce to \ncarry out the manufacture and production of these technologies.\n  About 180 million tons of goods are transported to and from Great \nLakes harbors and ports each year, providing fuel to heat and cool \nhomes and businesses, limestone and cement to build roads and \nbuildings, iron ore to produce steel, and grain to feed our Nation and \nfor export overseas. Throughout the Great Lakes, there are significant \ndredging and other operation and maintenance needs so that freighters \ncan safely deliver these vital commodities. There is a significant \nbacklog in the work required to maintain the Great Lakes navigational \nsystem. The Army Corps estimates there is a backlog of 17 million cubic \nyards of material that needs to be dredged in the Great Lakes, which is \nestimated to cost to about $200 million, to restore\n\n[[Page S10463]]\n\nthe full functionality of the navigational system. The conference \nreport includes an additional $6 million above the administration's \nbudget to address this dredging backlog at Michigan harbors and \nwaterways, and attend to other operations and maintenance needs, \nincluding repair and renovation of breakwaters, improvements to locks, \nand disposal of dredged materials.\n  An important element of the Great Lakes navigational system is the \nSoo Locks, which connects Lake Superior with Lakes Huron and Michigan. \nEvery year, over 80 million tons of commodities pass through the Soo \nLocks, the bulk of which move through the Poe Lock, the larger of the \ntwo operational Soo locks. To ensure shipping is not impeded at the Soo \nLocks, it is important that another Poe-sized lock be built. \nConstruction on the new lock began this past July, and it is important \nthat this project be completed so that vital industrial and \nagricultural shipments are not impeded. The conference report includes \nabout $1 million for this project, which is barely a dent in what is \nneeded for this project; the Army Corps estimated that it could use \nabout $100 million in fiscal year 2010 for this $500 million project. I \nwill continue to urge the Administration to include funding for this \nimportant project in their budget, and I am glad the conference report \nalso makes this strong recommendation. The conference report states \nthat ``the conferees are deeply concerned that despite congressional \nsupport for the project, the support of the states in the region, and \nthe fact that the Army Corps of Engineers recognizes the Soo Locks as \nthe `single point of failure' that can cripple Great Lakes shipping, \nthe administration has failed to include funding for a second large \nlock, either under the authority provided in the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, ARRA, or in its budget request for fiscal year \n2010.'' I hope this lack of funding will be rectified in next year's \nbudget.\n  This bill includes important funding for several Great Lakes programs \nincluding the Great Lakes Fishery and Ecosystem Restoration Program, \nRemedial Action Planning Technical Assistance, and the Sediment \nTransport Models and Sediment Management Planning program. These \nprograms will help restore and protect the Great Lakes.\n  I am also pleased that the bill includes over $6 million for the \nCorps' work to prevent the introduction of Asian carp and other \ninvasive species into the Great Lakes. Invasive species can \ndramatically change the fishery and ecosystem by outcompeting native \nspecies for food and habitat. Asian carp are particularly devastating \nbecause they consume so much food and reproduce quickly. This funding \nwill allow the Corps to operate the barrier project and begin work on a \nstudy to consider options to improve the barrier projects' efficacy. \nThe conference report also provides authority for the Corps to take \nmeasures to prevent Asian carp from bypassing the electric dispersal \nbarrier. This authority is needed because just recently, the Corps \ndiscovered that the Asian carp had moved upstream in the Des Plaines \nRiver, and if the Des Plaines River floods, which it does regularly, \nthe floodwaters could carry Asian carp into the Chicago Sanitary and \nShip Canal above the dispersal barrier. It is critical that the Corps \ndo what it can to prevent the introduction of Asian carp into the Great \nLakes.\n  The bill also provides funding for a variety of other water \ninfrastructure and environmental restoration projects in Michigan. \nFunding is provided for two wastewater projects in Michigan--one in \nGenesee County and the other in the city of Negunee in Michigan's Upper \nPeninsula. Improving sewer systems is important not only for public \nhealth, but also to eliminate untreated discharge into surface waters. \nTwo Michigan flood control projects will also benefit from passage of \nthis bill. The aging Hamilton Dam in the city of Flint will benefit \nfrom $240,000 that will enable the Army Corps to plan how to improve \nthis dam that is in danger of failing. Flood control improvements at \nthe Cass River in Spaulding Township are identified to receive priority \nfunding from the Army Corps. Funding is also provided for three \nenvironmental restoration projects in Michigan. Funding of $90,000 will \nbe used by the Army Corps to continue its partnership with the city of \nLansing in the Grand River waterfront restoration project, which \nincludes a range of projects, such as shoreline and ecosystem \nrestoration, as well as recreational elements. I am pleased that \n$100,000 is included to implement the Lake St. Clair Management Plan. \nLake St. Clair and the St. Clair River that are part of the connecting \nchannel in the Great Lakes and have been plagued by invasive species, \npollution, urban sprawl, and sewer overflows. The funding in the bill \nwill allow the Corps to move forward to finally implement on-the-ground \nrestoration projects which are very much needed.\n  This appropriations bill will help move our country towards greater \nenergy security, advance technology to strengthen our manufacturing and \ninternational competitiveness, improve our shipping and boating \ninfrastructure, and improve the environment, and I support its passage.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will vote in about 4 minutes. I want to \nnote that yesterday's cloture vote had 79 votes in favor of cloture. \nClearly, there is strong support for this energy and water conference \nreport. It provides an investment in water and energy projects across \nthe country. It is fiscally responsible. It is slightly less than 1 \npercent above last year's expenditure.\n  What I wanted to say, however, is we that had to invoke cloture, \nwhich took us two days. Even though we had a cloture vote yesterday \nclearly demonstrating very substantial support for the bill, we have \nnow sat at parade rest for almost 30 hours because someone insisted on \n30 hours postcloture despite the fact that we will have a strong vote \nfor this conference report.\n  The reason for the insistence on 30 hours occurred was because the \nconference report did not include one amendment that was accepted in \nthe Senate offered by one of my colleagues. I supported that amendment \nby the way. We were not able to get that through the conference with \nthe House. It urged greater transparency on reports from the Energy \nDepartment. I regret that is not in the conference report, but the \nHouse would not accept it. Because of that, we have now been sitting \naround for the better part of a week, 30 hours postcloture.\n  My point is that we have to get appropriations bills moving. \nApparently, it does not mean anything to some people. If their \namendment did not get in the conference report, they don't mind holding \nup the Senate for a part of a week. That doesn't mean much to some \npeople.\n  I just wish we would have a little more cooperation. The very same \npeople who said we ought to get our work done by passing appropriations \nbill and avoiding omnibus bills are the same ones who hold up the \nSenate. If we could get a little bit of cooperation, we could get these \nappropriations bills completed.\n  This is a good bill. It makes very significant and important \ninvestments all around the country in water infrastructure and energy \nprojects. The fact is, it is less than 1 percent above last year's \nspending level. No one is going to take a look at this bill and suggest \nit overspends. It does not.\n  One of my colleagues talked about earmarks in the bill. The fact is, \nwe can take out all the earmarks, and there are some in here. It is the \ncase that Congress has a role to decide both through the water \ndevelopment authorizing bill and also in the appropriations conference \nreport before us where it wants to invest its money in major water \nprojects across the country. If the Congress decided not to do that, \nevery single penny would go downtown to the agency, and some GS-14 \nwould decide where to do that. All this talk about earmarks is not \ngoing to save a penny. The fact is, we have substantially cut back on \nearmarks and have made them transparent.\n  My point mainly is that we are going to vote in a minute. We could \nhave voted on this already, but we had to file cloture, then wait 30 \nhours. It is reflective of what is happening in this Chamber. \nRegrettably, there is very little cooperation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

If I were \nable to attend today's session, I would have voted yes on the \nconference report.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today the Senate voted 80 to 17 in favor of \nthe Energy and Water appropriations bill, H.R. 3182. I praise Chairman \nByron L. Dorgan and Senator Robert F. Bennett, the Republican ranking \nmember, and the other members of the Energy and Water subcommittee for \nputting together what I consider to be a good bill and certainly a big \nimprovement over the energy budget sent to us by the President.\n  Knowing that the funding measure would pass, I chose to vote against \nthis bill, which funds the Department of Energy, as a signal to the \nObama administration and the DOE that American taxpayers want and need \na serious pro-energy plan, not the anti-energy strategy being pushed on \nus by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \nwhich this administration has adopted.\n  When the Secretary of Energy testifies before Congress that he \nbelieves it is his job to cut carbon-dioxide emissions by 80 percent in \nthe next 40 years, then we know our Nation does not have an energy \npolicy; rather, we have an anti-energy policy. Cutting our Nation's \nemissions by 80 percent would provide two certain outcomes: First, \nreducing CO2 at that reckless pace would certainly devastate \nour economy and ruin our Nation's global competitiveness. Secondly, \naccording to the U.N.'s own calculations for CO2's warming \nability, it would result in no perceptible reduction in global \ntemperatures. At best, it would reduce temperatures by about 0.1 \ndegrees Centigrade after 40 years of economic torture.\n  Maybe the media have fallen for this dangerous distraction to a real \nenergy policy, but the polls show that the taxpayers have not.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10464-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10464]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BURRIS.

Mr. President, earlier this week I came to the Senate \nfloor to discuss some of the misinformation we have seen about the \nissue of health care reform. Just this morning, I joined my freshmen \ncolleagues to knock down some of the persistent myths about reform and \nparticularly about the need for a public option.\n  As we prepare to consider a health bill before the full Senate, I \nwould like to discuss the way forward from here. I believe our path is \nvery clear. The only way to achieve meaningful health care reform and \nbring costs down is through a public option that will bring real \ncompetition into the system. That is why I will not vote for any health \ncare bill that does not include the public option.\n  Insurance companies should have to compete for your business just \nlike any other company. This principle has always been at the heart of \nAmerica's economy, and it does not make sense for insurance companies \nto get a free pass. As competition shrinks, profits soar. A public \noption is the only way to restore choice to the marketplace. It is the \nkey to freedom, accountability, and fair play. That is why I will not \ncompromise on this point.\n  On Tuesday, our colleagues in the Finance Committee reached a new \nmilestone on the long road to reform. They became the last of five \ncommittees in both the House and the Senate to take up this \nlegislation. When they passed their version of the bill, it was the \nfurthest any health reform measure has ever come. Now let us make it a \nreality.\n\n  I congratulate my distinguished colleagues on their significant \nachievement. I applaud their leadership on this difficult issue. But it \nwas disappointing this legislation did not include a public option. As \nwe move forward and merge the Finance Committee bill with the HELP \nCommittee's version, I will work with my friends to make sure the \ncombined measure does include a public option. In a very short time, \nevery Member will have the opportunity to shape this important \nlegislation. When this bill comes before the Chamber, we will have the \nchance to make good on the promise Teddy Roosevelt made almost 100 \nyears ago when he first called for sweeping health care reform.\n  This pivotal debate is nearly at an end. The time for action is upon \nus. That means it is time to separate fact from fiction. It is time to \ndiscuss the facts and drown out the noise. The public option will \nrestore choice and competition to an insurance market currently \ndominated by only a few companies. The public option will spur fresh \naccountability and a return to fair practices. Premiums will come down. \nRelative health outcomes will go up. For the first time in years, \ninsurance corporations will need to compete for business. They will \nneed to be accountable to customers and not only to shareholders. That \nis what reform with a public option will mean to the American health \ncare system.\n  When opponents of reform talk about death panels, a government \ntakeover, and socialism, they are trying to distract us from the issue \nat hand. When they claim the Finance Committee bill will make premiums \ngo up instead of down, it is the same sleight of hand we have seen from \nthe big corporations many times before.\n  They know they cannot win the argument on the merits so they are \ntrying to change the subject. Instead of talking about American \nfamilies and rising costs, real health outcomes, they need to rely on \nscare tactics to maintain their monopoly over the insurance\n\n[[Page S10465]]\n\nmarket. That is why it is time to draw a line in the sand. It is time \nto reject these distractions and stand on the side of the American \npeople.\n  That is what this debate is about. It is about individuals who send \nus to Washington to fight for their rights and defend their interests. \nIt is about families who sit around the kitchen table in Illinois and \nacross America. They open their pocketbooks and write larger and larger \nchecks every month. They are wondering when we will have the courage to \nact on our convictions.\n  We must not delay another moment. If we fail to act, health care \ncoverage will continue to increase in price and decline in quality. Let \nus rise to the challenge. Let us seize this moment. There is no doubt \nthe Senate is the greatest deliberative body on the face of the planet. \nThroughout our history, contentious arguments such as this one have \nplayed out on the floor of this Chamber and the old Senate Chamber down \nthe hall. The world knows this Senate can debate. But let it now show \nthem we can also act. Let it show them we can take action.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I join in support of the Vitter \namendment, which would preclude any funding in the CJS appropriations \nbill being used for the 2010 census, if the census does not include a \ncitizenship question. Under current law, the census does not even ask \nthe question about whether individuals in the United States are \ncitizens or not. They ask people how many bathrooms and children they \nhave, all kinds of things, but they don't ask a citizenship \nquestion. Congressional apportionment in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives is based on that total population count, including \npeople illegally in this country. I think representation in Congress \nshould be based on the number of legal residents, and it should not be \nincreased because persons here illegally, not eligible to vote, happen \nto be in that State. That is a matter I hear a lot about from my \nconstituents. They ask how this is possible. They are shocked that is \nwhat might be happening. The truth is, it does happen.\n\n  So I think Senator Vitter is raising a good question, and I believe \nhis amendment is valid. Our next census will determine the \nreapportionment of the House of Representatives and Electoral College \nvotes each State has.\n  The 2010 census form lacks the simple question: Are you a citizen of \nthe United States of America? How accurate can we in Congress expect to \nbe about the composition of our population if we do not ask that \nquestion, especially when some estimate there may be as many as 12 \nmillion people illegally in the country? Indeed, I think that probably \nis an accurate figure, so it has an impact. Calculations using some of \nthe interim census data estimates are pretty dramatic and point out the \nreal impacts of this policy.\n  Using the American Community Survey of the Census Bureau, their \nestimates for State population, including noncitizen and citizen \npopulations, is instructive. The discrepancy in numbers for \nreapportionment using those different figures is significant. For \nexample, States that might otherwise expect to gain or expect not to \nlose population, lose congressional seats, would do so if these numbers \nare counted. For example, Indiana, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, \nOregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, and Louisiana--all of those would \nbe expected to stay the same or gain. And if illegals are counted, they \nwill either not gain or lose seats.\n  So I think that is a pretty important issue. It is not something with \nwhich my State is directly involved. But having dealt with the \nimmigration issue over some period of time, and trying to be informed \nabout it, I hear a lot of people raising this fundamental question. I \nthink it would be simple to fix constitutionally. We would simply say: \nAsk how many people are here legally and use that to be the basis of \nthe apportionment of congressional seats, and not using people who are \nnot here legally. It does not threaten people. It does not mean they \nwill be arrested or anything like that or to be subject to deportation. \nIt simply means when the numbers are all in, we will know how many U.S. \nresidents exist in the various States, and from that number we will be \nable to apportion our House of Representatives and the Electoral \nCollege for the next Presidential election.\n  I think that is the right thing to do. We need to get away from this \nother process and urge the support of the Vitter amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise to make some comments about the \nhealth care bill we are all anxious to see and discuss.\n  Everyone knows a principal focus of our attention now in the Senate \nis on the health care reform bill, and we expect a major debate on the \nprecise structure of that bill over the next few weeks. But I want to, \nin that connection, start my remarks with a quotation from a statement \ngiven by the Senator from South Carolina. He said, on June 17, 2009:\n\n       If we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his \n     Waterloo. It will break him.\n\n  That is the Republican dominant view on health care reform. The \nmission is not to do better for the American people but, rather, to \ndestroy the Presidency of Barack Obama. It is an unpleasant scene to \nwitness.\n  Almost all Americans want to see us fix our health care system. I say \n``almost'' because there is a group of people here who love the status \nquo: health insurance companies and their lobbyists and CEOs.\n  Everyone knows health care costs have skyrocketed, and that means \neverybody pays more. But when working people are under assault to pay \nmore, it could cause a catastrophic confrontation with funds, with \nmoney for food and education and other ordinary but essential expenses \nfor living.\n  America's small businesses are struggling to provide health care for \ntheir employees, and more people are less able to afford health care \ncoverage. And while enormous pressure is placed on middle-income \nfamilies, the largest health insurers are seeing massive profit growth.\n\n[[Page S10466]]\n\n  Wendell Potter, an executive at CIGNA and some other health insurance \ncompanies over the last 20 years, has put it this way. He testified \nbefore the Senate Commerce Committee earlier this year, and he said the \nhealth insurance companies--and I quote him--``confuse their customers \nand dump the sick--all so they can satisfy their Wall Street \ninvestors.''\n  That single-minded drive for profits is clear from the numbers. Here \nis a chart I have in the Chamber showing part of the outrage. This \nchart demonstrates the massive profit increases at some of our largest \nhealth insurance companies. Just look at them. The years for comparison \nare the year 2000 and 2008.\n  In 2000, the company called WellPoint earned $226 million worth of \nprofit. That $226 million had grown to $2.5 billion at the end of \n2008--an increase of 1,000 percent.\n  Aetna, one of the biggest: In 2000, they made $127 million worth of \nprofit. Eight years later, the $127 million grew to $1.4 billion--an \nincrease of 990 percent.\n  Humana: In 2000, they earned $90 million; in 2008, $647 million--a \nmodest gain, only 619 percent.\n  United Health--one of the largest--earned, in 2000, $736 million; in \n2008, $3 billion, an increase of 304 percent.\n  Mr. President, we all know who paid the price for those profits: \nworking-class Americans. This condition tells you what we have to be on \nthe lookout for as we develop our plan.\n  Just as the health insurance industry profits have risen, obviously, \nso has the CEO compensation. If we look at what has taken place over a \n3-year period for the five largest health care companies, the CEO pay \nhas grown steadily, while workers' pay has barely moved. The average \nhealth care CEO, over the last 3 years, in these five companies, earned \n$14.8 million. That was his--in this case--all his compensation. And \nthe average worker's salary was $44,200. Look at that comparison: $14.8 \nmillion, while the average working person earned $44,000. There is an \ninjustice there that I think is quite obvious.\n  So we look at that and say: Well, what is happening here? A single \nhealth insurance CEO earns approximately 335 times that of the average \nworker in this country. It is absolutely ridiculous. It is scandalous--\nscandalous--when we think about the struggle people go through to keep \ntheir families healthy and, at the same time, take care of the bare \nneeds for existence.\n  In New Jersey, for example, the largest health care insurer is \nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield. Last year, the CEO of that nonprofit, \nMr. William Marino, made $5.4 million--a nonprofit company. Although it \nis a company without profit, it certainly was pretty darn profitable \nfor Mr. Marino.\n  Let me be clear. While health insurers and CEOs have made out like \nbandits, the industry has been increasing premiums relentlessly. \nAccording to a new report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, insurance \npremiums for American families more than doubled during the last 10 \nyears. We see it: three times faster than wages over the last 10 years. \nThat is what has happened with health care.\n  Premiums, which now average more than $13,000 a year, are the highest \ncost on record. The chart shows it very clearly, that this expanding \npremium cost has gone way beyond the average family to be able to \nafford to pay the rate.\n  If today's CEOs cared as much about the public's health as their own \nfinancial wealth, our system would not look this way. We are stuffing \nthe greedy and starving the needy. That is the situation we are in.\n  It is time to reshape health care in this country once and for all. \nIt is time to make the insurance industry accountable so that health \ninsurance works for the people in our country. It is time to lift the \ncurtain of despair so those without insurance can get it, and those who \nare in dread fear of losing it can stop worrying. It is time to say \nthat in the richest Nation in the world, decent health care belongs to \neveryone in our country.\n  The reality is, we spend 1\\1/2\\ times more per person on health care \nthan any other country, and yet even as we pour more and more money \ninto health care, Americans' health has not improved.\n  Just take infant mortality. The infant mortality rate in the United \nStates is a telling marker of how well a society delivers health care. \nInfant death rates in our country have been going up for the last 40 \nyears. Now the United States has a higher infant mortality rate than 40 \nother countries in the world, including Cuba, Sweden, Taiwan, and most \nof Europe. By any metric, we are not delivering health care in our \ncountry fairly, fully, or efficiently, and the time for change is upon \nus.\n\n  Many in this Chamber have been working for decades to reform our \nsystem so children, the working poor, and the sick get the care they \ndeserve. No one worked harder than my former seatmate and dear friend, \nSenator Edward M. Kennedy. Today we are on the verge of a sweeping \noverhaul. We are proud of Senator Kennedy for all the years he labored \nso hard.\n  This Senate and the President and the House must do the right thing \nfor the health of America's working families. Surely these families and \ntheir children are as critical with their contributions to America's \nwell-being as those profiteering from their sweat and toil.\n  This debate is about our commitment to the millions of Americans who \nwork hard every day, pay taxes, care for their kids, but risk the \nchance of losing everything because of a single illness. We declare \nhere and now that we will not allow exaggerated profits to breach the \nprimary obligation we have to all of our people to protect them from \nassault, whether from terror, natural disaster, or from the scourge of \ndisease. In the wealthiest country in the world, no one should be left \nout and left behind because government won't respond to their cries for \nhelp.\n  I close with a reminder to those in this Chamber that our obligation \nfar exceeds the attention it has gotten over the years; far exceeds any \nstretch of decency that we can muster; that we do something about it, \nthat we show part of the shame we all feel when we look at millions of \npeople who have no health insurance in this country while we see the \ncompensation and the growth of these companies. I am a corporate \nperson. I come from having run a very large corporation, one of the \nlargest and one of the best in the country called ADP. It has over \n240,000 employees. A couple of other fellows and I started that \ncompany. I took a look at the fellow who is now running that company. \nThe company made over $1.5 billion last year and his salary was $1 \nmillion. He does a good job.\n  Some people here, largely on the other side--almost exclusively on \nthe other side, except for one courageous Senator who stood up and said \nshe is not going to let this go by without trying to do something \nserious about it--want to take the role of doctors and they want to \nwrite a prescription to do nothing but obstruct and say no. They want \nto say no to those looking to government for help and no to those \ndesperately in need of health care. All they say is no, no, no. I \nsummarize the Republican view and their health care mission. Theirs is \na missile gone astray. Kill the Obama presidency with this Waterloo, \nregardless of the number of casualties among the citizenry. Their \nvictory will be won with the political destruction of the Obama \nmission.\n  I say ``no'' is not the answer. It is time for us to act. I hope our \ncolleagues in this Senate will look in the mirror and see how they \nwould feel if a child suddenly comes up with a condition that is long \nlasting and that is hard to deal with. I have a granddaughter with \ndiabetes. I have a grandson with asthma. Fortunately, they have good \nhealth care. I am able to afford to pay it. But there are lots of \npeople in this country who can't. I would like one of these people on \nthe other side to stand up with them face to face and say, no, I don't \nthink we ought to help you. I don't think we can afford to help you. I \ndon't think my colleagues with whom I have an industry connection would \nlike it if I helped you.\n  Too bad. Too bad, I say. I hope we gain some sense and some \nvisibility in this debate over the next several weeks.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S10467]]\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico.

Mr. President, I rise today to mourn the \nuntimely deaths and celebrate the lives of two New Mexico heroes. One \ndied just last week from injuries he sustained while serving his \ncountry in Afghanistan. The other was killed this past June in a \nhelicopter crash after rescuing a stranded hiker lost on the Santa Fe \nBaldy Mountain.\n  Both men served their countries with distinction and honor. Both were \nraised in families with a strong tradition of public service. Both said \n``Choose me'' when they were needed the most. Both paid the ultimate \nsacrifice. They are Army SFC Kenneth Westbrook and New Mexico State \npolice sergeant Andrew Tingwall. I would like to tell you about them \ntoday.\n  Sergeant Westbrook's career in the military began more than 20 years \nago after he graduated from Shiprock High School in northwest New \nMexico. He married his childhood sweetheart, Charlene. Along the way, \nthey had three children--Zachary, Joshua, and Joseph.\n  He served in the Persian Gulf war and did numerous other stints \noverseas in places such as Korea and Germany. He was a proud member of \nthe Navajo Nation. He loved to hunt and fish, build model military \nvehicles, and was an expert chef and grill master.\n  His brother says Kenneth was looking forward to retiring from the \nmilitary and spending more time with his family when he got the call \nfor one more tour of duty--this time to Afghanistan. As much as he \ncherished the idea of spending more time with his family, Kenneth knew \nwhat he had to do: Of course, I will go, he said. Kenneth believed in \nthe work being done in Afghanistan, his brother said. And if the Army \nneeded him to complete that work, there was no question he would be \nthere.\n  Kenneth was gravely wounded on September 8 when his unit was attacked \nby insurgents in Afghanistan. He was quickly flown to Walter Reed Army \nMedical Center for treatment. That is where I met his wife Charlene and \nother members of his family. That is where Sergeant Westbrook died from \nhis injuries last week.\n\n  Military families are a special group of people. Every day they face \nsacrifices and challenges the average person can't imagine. They do it \nwith grace and strength and an unwavering belief in the country they \ncall home. That is what I saw the day I visited Charlene and Sergeant \nWestbrook's three boys. I saw a strength made even more striking when \nyou realize this tragedy wasn't their first.\n  Four years earlier, almost to the day, another Sergeant Westbrook \ndied. His older brother--SGT Marshall Alan Westbrook--was killed in \nIraq when an improvised explosive device detonated near his humvee in \nBaghdad.\n  The Westbrooks have given more than most families. Their tight-knit \nfamily has paid the ultimate sacrifice, and for the Westbrooks, it \nhappened not once but twice. As Americans, we often take for granted \nour freedoms, but we should never forget those whose sacrifice makes \nthose freedoms possible.\n  Sergeant Westbrook will be laid to rest on Friday in Farmington, but \nhe will forever live in the memory of New Mexicans.\n  This story of New Mexican heroism doesn't end there. I would also \nlike to talk about New Mexico State Police SGT Andrew Tingwall, who was \nkilled last June in a helicopter accident after rescuing a stranded, \nlost hiker. Sergeant Tingwall is being honored on Friday with a \nposthumous induction into the New Mexican Military Institute Alumni \nAssociation Hall of Fame, which I helped nominate him for. His honor is \nfor Eminence in a Chosen Field. Similar to Sergeant Westbrook, Andy \nTingwall's chosen field was service--service to his community, service \nto his State, and service to his country.\n  Known as ``Ting'' to his friends, Sergeant Tingwall graduated from \nthe New Mexico Military Institute in Roswell in 1991 and joined the \nU.S. Marine Corps shortly after. During his military career, he became \na jump-qualified reconnaissance marine and served with Delta Company's \nFourth Reconnaissance Battalion. He continued his distinguished career \nas a New Mexico reservist from 1993 to 1995, when he joined the New \nMexico State Police.\n  Eventually, he became lead instructor for the Training and Recruiting \nDivision of the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy before joining the \nNew Mexico State Police aircraft section, where he became a pilot. \nSergeant Tingwall proved his merit there, serving as chief pilot of the \nunit--the youngest man to ever have that title.\n  Sergeant Tingwall was known by his colleagues, friends, and family \nfor his heroism and love of the sky, saving many lives in his time with \nthe State police. In 2008, he was celebrated as Officer of the Year by \nthe New Mexico Sheriffs and Police Association and would have received \na Medal of Valor in June, but for Sergeant Tingwall, that day would \nnever come.\n  Sergeant Tingwall was in the middle of saving the life of a stranded \nhiker on June 9 when tragedy struck. He and his spotter, Officer Wesley \nCox, had located the stranded hiker and Sergeant Tingwall was \ntransporting her to safety when the helicopter struck a mountainside \nand crashed.\n  After the crash, as he had throughout his career, Sergeant Tingwall \nput the safety of others before his own. Despite being severely \ninjured, he managed to pull the hiker from the wreckage before they \nboth died from their injuries. Sergeant Tingwall was just 36 years old.\n  Duty, honor, country--three words you hear often when talking about \nthose who commit themselves to a life of public service. Sergeants \nWestbrook and Tingwall personified those words, both in the way they \nlived their lives and in the way those lives ultimately ended.\n  New Mexico is proud to honor these true American heroes. To their \nfamilies, we say thank you and ask them to accept the thanks of a \ngrateful State and a grateful nation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the introduction of S. 1789 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10467-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10467-S10468]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            THE FEDERAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, we have had an ongoing debate on the \nfloor about health care reform, its cost, whether it is going to add to \nthe deficit. We had an exchange yesterday or the day before with \nSenator McConnell, the Republican leader. We talked a little bit about \nthe debt America faces and how this debt came about.\n  Senator Kyl, my Republican counterpart, Republican whip from Arizona \nand a friend of mine, came to the floor and carried on this dialog and \ndebate. When you consider the Senate Chamber is supposed to be about \ndebate, it is all good that he would do that. But I do want to take \nexception to a couple of things my friend Senator Kyl said.\n  Let me say at the outset, between 1998 and 2000, under President \nClinton, our Nation ran a fiscal surplus. It is hard for many people \nnow, when they look at a multi-trillion-dollar deficit, to imagine just \na few years back we did have a surplus. We actually reduced the Federal \ndebt in those 2 years by $236 billion, our economy was doing well, \ncreating jobs and businesses. That is what President George W. Bush \ninherited when he came to office.\n  Between 2001 and 2009, when President George W. Bush was in office, \nthe economy grew. Normally you would think this period of economic \ngrowth would lead to an improved fiscal picture since tax receipts for \ngovernment usually grow with the economy. Instead, under President Bush \nour Nation\n\n[[Page S10468]]\n\nran deficits during his term of nearly $7 trillion. The cumulative \nFederal debt more than doubled under President George W. Bush, who \ninherited a surplus from President Clinton. It went up from $5.8 \ntrillion in 2001 to $12.7 trillion in 2009.\n  At the end of the Bush administration, the economy faced the worst \ncrisis since the Great Depression, the recession we are now \nencountering. That is what President Obama inherited when he was sworn \nin 9 months ago. Back in February, the Congressional Budget Office \nestimated that, assuming continuation of budget policies that were in \neffect in January of this year, the Federal budget deficit would \naverage more than $1 trillion each year over the next 10 years and \nwould climb higher in later years. That estimate was developed based \ncompletely on the budget policies that the current President inherited \nfrom the previous President. So to argue that the Nation's fiscal woes \nshould be all laid at the doorstep of President Obama overlooks the \nobvious. Given the soaring debts and woeful economy he inherited, it \ncertainly is not defensible.\n  America will run a fiscal deficit this year and it will be a large \ndeficit, there is no question about it. In an economy such as this, \nwhere there is so little private sector demand, we have tried to create \nthrough stimulus packages, reinvestment, and recovery good jobs and \neconomic activity that will revitalize our economy.\n  Why did President Bush have such record-breaking deficits during his \ntenure? I can tell you that he was the first President in the history \nof the United States to call for tax cuts in the midst of a war--in \nfact, in the midst of two wars. Giving tax cuts to the wealthiest \npeople in the Nation during a war is counterintuitive. A war is an \nadded expense to a nation, over and above the ordinary costs of \ngovernment, and to cut revenue sources by giving tax cuts to those in \nhigher income categories drove us deeper and deeper into deficit.\n  In addition, President Bush during his term passed the Medicare \nPrescription Drug Program. I think it was a good program, although \nthere were changes I certainly would have made before I would vote for \nit. But the fact is that the President did not pay for it. It was added \nto the deficit which the current President has inherited. It is little \nwonder then that the debt grew dramatically during President George \nBush's time in office.\n  Having said all of this, we have to do something serious about this \ndebt. I think we have to focus on putting this economy back on its \nfeet, getting people back to work, making sure that businesses have \ncredit, making certain that the money spent by our government is spent \nwell, without waste. Those are certainly monumental tasks for us to \nface. But to say that this health care reform is going to add to the \ndeficit is to overlook the obvious. President Obama has told Members of \nCongress: Don't send me a health care reform bill if it adds to the \ndeficit. The Senate Finance Committee bill that passed this week did \nnot add to the deficit. In fact, it reduced the deficit over a 10-year \nperiod of time. So we have taken President Obama's admonition \nseriously.\n  In a week or two, we will start the debate over the future of health \ncare in this Nation with the understanding that whatever we do has to \nbe paid for, that we cannot leave it as a debt to future generations. \nIt is an awesome responsibility and challenge we face. It is one I \nthink we are up to, that the American people would feel Congress had \ndropped the ball and had failed if we do not end up with health care \nreform. We have a lot of issues to work out among us. I hope Senator \nSnowe on the Republican side will be joined by other Senators who can \nin good faith join in trying to solve some of these awesome problems we \nface, problems we have inherited. It is a major responsibility and one \nwe accept with the leadership of the President to help us find that \nsolution.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10468-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10468-S10469]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE NATIONAL DEBT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, the American people are rightly very \nconcerned about the reckless spending being conducted in Washington \nspending that has resulted in huge national deficits. People sometimes \nthink that Republicans and Democrats are just bickering, but the truth \nis that we have never had deficits such as these in the history of our \ncountry--perhaps only during the peak of World War II, when we were in \na life-and-death struggle with millions of men and women in combat from \none end of the globe to the other.\n  The fiscal year 2010 deficit is $1.4 trillion. It is predicted to \naverage $1 trillion for the next decade, without relief in the \noutyears. People often ask me: When are we going to start paying it \nback? There is no plan to do so. There is not even any plan to reduce \nthe size of the deficit. In years 8, 9, 10, we are talking about over \n$900 billion in annual deficits. Interest today on our total debt is \n$170 billion, will rise to $800 billion in 1 year and that is just the \ninterest on the money we must borrow in order to carry these deficits \nthat are not being reduced in the outyears. It is unthinkable.\n  A lot of people think that the high deficit is due to costs from a \nhealth care reform bill. Health care reform will add to the deficit, \nbut is not currently counted in the numbers I referenced because the \nCongressional Budget Office did its scoring before any health care bill \nwas written. We don't have a final bill, so CBO couldn't score it \naccurately anyway.\n  The public debt will go from $5 trillion to $11.7 trillion in 5 years \nand triple to $17 trillion in 10 years, tripling the national debt. The \ntotal debt from the founding of the American Republic will be tripled. \nThat is a big deal.\n  My colleague, Senator Durbin, and our Democratic colleagues have \ntaken great pleasure in attacking President Bush. I was critical of \nPresident Bush's spending, but his average deficit was $250 billion, \nwhich was too much and big. However, this year's deficit is going to be \n$1.4 trillion. That is the deficit as of September 30, for this fiscal \nyear. And we will carry an average deficit $900 billion annually in the \ncoming years. You can blame the origins of the deficit on President \nBush if you want to, but President Obama's budget for the next 10 \nyears, scored by the Congressional Budget Office, continues to score \ndeficits at $900 billion. Regardless, we are spending too much money. \nRepublicans are guilty of it, and so are the Democrats. They promised \nto do better after they got elected this time, but I haven't seen any \nprogress, frankly.\n  The media has reported recently that the valuation of the Finance \nCommittee's health care bill by the Congressional Budget Office was \nquite positive. They said--you may have heard the phrase--that it was \ndeficit neutral. How did that happen? How can you add millions of \npeople to the rolls of insured, and subsidize insurance for low-income \npeople, all without having a cost? We need to examine that.\n  The CBO says the Finance Committee bill would cost $829 billion over \n10 years, but they say it is not going to increase the deficit. It will \nincrease the number of people covered but not increase the deficit.\n  The Washington Post wrote:\n\n       The Finance Committee's bill is the only legislation on the \n     table that meets Obama's objectives [. . .] all for less than \n     $900 billion over 10 years, and without adding to the \n     deficit.\n\n  So that has been the spin. That has been the statement from the \nmedia.\n  The President said in his September address to Congress that he would \nnot sign a health care reform bill that adds one dime to the deficit. \nSenator Baucus, the Finance Committee chairman, said:\n\n       Our balanced approach in the Finance Committee to health \n     reform has paid off once again.\n\n  He said the bill was ``a smart investment on the federal balance \nsheet.'' Would that it were so, but that is not an accurate statement. \nThe American people know you cannot expand coverage for millions of the \nuninsured without incurring cost. There is no\n\n[[Page S10469]]\n\nsuch thing as a free lunch. Money borrowed has to be repaid. If you \nmake obligations to expand the federal government's role in our health \ncare system, you must have the money to back it up.\n  So how can the CBO make such a report? It is not because they are \ndishonest. It is because they scored the bill the Washington way, and \nthe bill was written by Members of this body and staff who understand \nthe Washington way. They write the bill in such a way to hide its true \ncost. Republicans have done this in the past, but we are reaching new \nlevels of it today.\n  Under the Baucus plan, true costs are hidden. The bill's requirements \nthat all individuals have insurance does not fully phase in, for \nexample, until 2014. However, new fees on insurers, medical device \ncompanies, drug manufacturers and cuts to hospitals and doctors take \neffect almost immediately. For example, hospitals will take cuts and \nsee more patients beginning in 2010, but individuals are not required \nto have insurance coverage until 2014. If you are an insurance company, \nyou will face increased taxes and new annual fees beginning in 2010, \nbut again--individuals are not required to have insurance until 2014. \nDoctors' pay is kept stable in 2010, but under the Finance Committee \nlegislation, doctors are expected to take a 25-percent pay cut \nbeginning in 2011.\n  Why have we been engaging in these budget gimmicks? Both parties have \nbeen guilty of doing this. Why don't we just make the difficult \ndecisions? We have succeeded in balancing the budget in the past. But \nunder the Sustainable Growth Rate formula as it applies today, our \nphysicians the people that take care of us--would take a 25-percent cut \nin 2011. So, Congress fixes the formula, so to speak. We now call it \nthe doctors' fix. We arrange for a short-term solution that keeps \ndoctors' pay from being cut, but do not address the larger problem. If \nCongress were to fix the physician pay formula for 10 years, we would \nhave about $300 billion more in costs to figure in to our budget as a \ndeficit. The proposal that came out of the Finance Committee proposes \nto raise the doctors' fees for 1 year. It does not propose what is \nabsolutely necessary: a 10-year fix for doctor pay. So, the Chairman \nacts as if an update to doctor pay will not happen in 2011 so that the \nbill does not have to reflect the true costs. And Congress will update \ndoctor pay, as it has every year since 2002.\n  The bottom line is this: the true costs of the Finance Committee bill \nwill not begin until the new provisions are all phased in in 2014.\n  The Senate Budget Committee estimates--and I am a member of the \ncommittee--show that the Finance Committee bill cost for 2014 to 2023 \nis actually $1.8 trillion. So although CBO says that it costs $829 \nbillion from 2010 to 2019, if you look at numbers from 2014 to 2023, \nthe cost is $1.8 trillion--twice as much--because the full benefits and \nexpenses don't kick in until then that period.\n  Budget gimmicks used to offset the bill are misleading. This is not \nan honest way to represent the bill's costs, and it is designed for \npolitical reasons. It is designed to make the score look better than it \nis and to hide the true cost of enacting this legislation.\n  Let me use a chart.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used the existing time limit.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The Senate Finance Committee bill is paid for in a \nnumber of ways. Perhaps one of the most unjustified claims is that we \nare going to produce $404 billion in cuts to Medicare and Medicaid to \nfund an entirely new program.\n  First, it is doubtful that Congress will actually vote to cut $400 \nbillion from Medicaid and Medicare. However, CBO must assume we are \ngoing to cut it because that it included in the Finance Committee bill. \nCBO also assumed in their budget that we were going to raise a lot of \ntax money by being more efficient in tax collections last year, but \nthose new collections did not materialize either. The IRS said they \nwouldn't get them, and they were right. Our number one priority, if we \nwere to somehow make Medicaid and Medicare more efficient and more \nhonest and more effective and more productive and save $300 billion, \nthat money should stay in Medicare and Medicaid. Medicare is going \nbroke. We know that to be true. Medicare experts and the trustees \nissued a dire warning that unless measures are taken to shore up the \nprogram, it will be insolvent by 2017. We have known that for a long \ntime. These $400 billion in cuts is very unlikely to happen. The rest \nof these basically are new taxes. I do not have time to go into them \nnow.\n\n  But imagine this scenario: your family is running in a shortfall and \nyou do not have enough money for your business and you have agreed that \nyou would take on a Saturday job to make more income, would it be smart \nto buy a new car? You have a debt. You are trying to pay it down.\n  You take on more taxes, take on another job to bring in more income, \nbut, in the midst of that, you start a new spending program? That is \nexactly what the Finance Committee bill proposes. Instead of getting \nMedicare on a sound footing, this bill raises taxes to create a new \nprogram. Supporters act like we should be thankful because it is \ndeficit neutral, they say. That is not accurate. I know it, and every \nSenator in this body ought to know it if they have been around here \nvery long.\n  I am sorry about where we are headed. This sort of scoring is the \nkind of flimflam financial management that has put us on the road to \ntripling the debt of the United States in 10 years. It is an \nabomination. Our children will be paying interest on our debts for the \nrest of their lives. Indeed, the interest on our national debt today is \n$170 billion. In 10 years, CBO says it will be $800 billion a year. Yet \nwe spend only $100 billion a year on education, by contrast.\n  So I say, somehow we have to slow down, make some difficult choices, \nand recognize that we do not have the money to do everything we would \nlike to do. We do not have the money, and Congress must be more serious \nand more committed to improving Medicare, saving the program, and not \ngoing hog wild with new programs that we do not have the money to fund.\n  I thank the Chair for allowing me to go over and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I know my colleague from South Dakota is \nwaiting. I will try not to consume the entire 20 minutes. But let me \nfirst talk about deficit for a moment, since my colleague from Alabama \ndescribed that.\n  I do not think there is anyone in here who takes a look at the fiscal \npolicy we are on--and have been on for a long time--and feels very \ncomfortable about it. It is not sustainable and we have to change it. \nBut I do want to say this. It was not too long ago that this country \nwent to war and, at the same time, cut taxes and did not pay for a \npenny of the war. In fact, even now we have people saying: Let's send \n40,000 more troops to Afghanistan. I do not hear anybody suggesting we \npay for that. What is that going to cost?\n  I will talk next week about my interest in what is happening in \nAfghanistan. I have been there. I have some real concerns about sending \na lot of additional troops to Afghanistan and about our vital national \ninterests. But let me say, whether it is fighting a war or deciding to \nsend 40,000 more troops to another country, it costs money. Is \neverybody here willing to pay for it? Anybody willing to pay for it?\n  We have talked about this for years. We are in the middle of a war. \nWe send men and women to the battlefield, and the fact is, not a penny \nof it has been paid for. In the previous administration, they insisted \non tax cuts and pursuing a war strategy in Iraq and sending troops to \nAfghanistan and not paying for a penny of it. That also results in \nFederal budget deficits, and we have to resolve them.\n  The fact is, we cannot continue to describe a level of government the \nAmerican people are unwilling or unable to pay for, and we have to get \nthis fiscal policy under some control.

Madam President, I came to the floor to talk about \nsomething else today. On the way to the Capitol this morning, I was \nthinking of this: a quote by Will Rogers. I heard on the radio again \ntoday that we have a couple things going on. No. 1, we have a whole lot \nof folks who have lost their home in the last quarter, with a record \nnumber of home foreclosures in our country--and then, in the same \nnewscast, $140 billion in bonuses to be paid by the major firms on Wall \nStreet. I am thinking maybe these are two different countries or at \nleast two different economies. Here is what Will Rogers said many \ndecades ago. He said:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we'll get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.\n\n  The unemployed ``ain't'' eating regular, but we will get around to \nthem when everybody else gets fixed up.\n  Well, last year we watched some big shots steer this economy into the \nditch. It caused an unbelievable financial wreck. It has had an impact \non everything in this country. The fact is, we need to reform the \nsystem that allowed that to happen. But--do you know what?--as to the \nstory I heard this morning about $140 billion of expected bonuses to be \npaid by the top 23 firms on Wall Street, the fact is, less than a year \nlater, after the economic collapse in this country, we see these \nstories:\n\n       The U.S. has lent, spent or guaranteed $11.6 trillion to \n     bolster banks and fight the longest recession in 70 years.\n\n  By the way, ``banks'' here mean the biggest financial institutions in \nthe country.\n  The Wall Street Journal, August 31 of this year:\n\n       Wall Street is suiting up for a battle to protect one of it \n     richest fiefdoms, the $592 trillion over-the-counter \n     derivatives market. . . . Five U.S. commercial banks, \n     including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and \n     Bank of America Corp., are on track to earn more than $35 \n     billion this year trading unregulated derivatives contracts.\n\n  This story is what we have been reading day after day.\n  Steven Pearlstein: ``The Dust Hasn't Settled on Wall Street, but \nHistory's Already Repeating Itself.''\n\n       The Wall Street herd is at it again. Even as the cleanup \n     crew is carting away the debris left by the last financial \n     crisis, the investment banks, hedge funds and exchanges are \n     busy working on the next one.\n\n  I will go through these in a hurry because there is a narrative here \nthat is pretty easy to see.\n  The New York Times: ``A Year Later, Little Change on Wall St.''\n\n       One year after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the \n     surprise is not how much has changed in the financial \n     industry, but how little.\n       . . . banks still sell and trade unregulated derivatives, \n     despite their role in last fall's chaos.\n\n  The Washington Post, September 15: ``The Wall Street Casino, Back in \nBusiness.''\n\n       Wall Street's actual role is more like that of a giant \n     casino where the gamblers are rewarded for taking outrageous, \n     unconscionable risks with other people's money. If the bets \n     pay off, the gamblers win. If the long-shot bets turn out to \n     have been foolish, we're the ones who lose.\n\n  The Washington Post, September 8: ``A year after Lehman, Wall \nStreet's Acting Like Wall Street Again.''\n\n       [Wall Street] still operates on the principle of taking \n     care of itself first, really big and [most] important \n     customers second, everyone else last.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, August 22: ``Bankers Play Dress Up With Old \nDeals.''\n\n       Irresponsible securitization helped bring the financial \n     system to its knees. Yet, as banks start to heal, little \n     seems to have changed. Wall Street has quickly fallen back on \n     old habits.\n\n  The Washington Post, September 11: ``Wall Street's Mania for Short-\nTerm Results Hurts Economy.''\n\n       It's been a year since the onset of a financial crisis that \n     wiped out $15 trillion of wealth from the balance sheet of \n     American households, and more than two years since serious \n     cracks in the financial system became apparent. Yet while the \n     system has been stabilized and the worst of the crisis has \n     passed, little has been done to keep another meltdown from \n     happening.\n\n  The Los Angeles Times: ``The Financial Meltdown: Crisis has not \naltered Wall Street.''\n\n       Bellwether firms led by Goldman Sachs Group are churning \n     out mouth-watering profits. Risk-taking and aggressive \n     securities trading are mounting a comeback. And \n     compensation--the lifeblood of Wall Street--is pushing back \n     toward pre-crisis levels.\n\n  The Wall Street Journal, October 14: ``Wall Street On Track To Award \nRecord Pay.'' That was yesterday.\n\n       Major U.S. banks and securities firms are on pace to pay \n     their employees about $140 billion this year--a record high. \n     . . .\n       Total compensation and benefits at . . . firms analyzed by \n     the Journal are on track to increase 20% from last year's \n     $117 billion--and to top 2007's $130 billion payout.\n\n  Total compensation and benefits at 23 major Wall Street firms--this, \nfrom the Wall Street Journal--you can see what has happened--2009--a \nrecord in the last 3 years. Nothing has changed.\n  CNN news:\n\n       . . . there really is . . . this disconnect still between \n     what's happening on Wall Street . . . and what's happening \n     with the every day Joe. We talked about record home \n     foreclosures once again, as we said these problems with \n     employment, worries about whether benefits, jobless benefits \n     are going to continue.\n       On the flip side, . . . major banks and security firms are \n     on pace to pay employees $140 billion this year . . . a \n     record high.\n\n  And so it is. It was said once that investment banks are to \nproductive enterprise like mud wrestling is to the performing arts. \nWell, I don't know, I guess that was tongue in cheek. We need \ninvestment banking in this country. It is essential for the creation of \ncapital. It can, working properly, assist this country, and has \nassisted this country in lifting our economic opportunities.\n  But we have all too often, in recent years, seen the creation of \nexotic financial instruments that have almost nothing to do with \ncreating wealth, except for those who trade them and those who created \nthem. That is what steered this country into the ditch. CDOs, credit \ndefault swaps, unregulated derivatives, dark money--a lot of people got \nwealthy trading it. The fact is, it created an unbelievable bubble of \nrisk that began to wind this economy down and finally steered this \neconomy into a serious wreck last fall. The question is, What do we do \nabout that? Well, when you hear on the same newscasts that we reached a \nrecord number of home foreclosures and people are still losing their \njobs, and then, on the other hand, we see the very same interests that \nhave been at the trough of the Federal Reserve Board for at least $8 \ntrillion, at risk by the taxpayer, in loans and commitments to some of \nthe biggest financial enterprises in the country and then you see $140 \nbillion in compensation and bonuses from those firms? There is \nsomething disconnected here.\n  I want our financial system to work. I am not someone who comes to \nthe floor of the Senate who says investment banks are worthless. That \nis not my point. We need investment banking. But we also need to \nunderstand we cannot take FDIC insured banks, those that are insured by \nthe Federal Government, and decide it is OK if you trade on your own \nproprietary accounts on risky enterprises such as derivatives. That is \nall right. That is not all right. They may just as well put a keno pit \nor a craps table right in the middle of the bank lobby. Just call it \nwhat it is. It is simply flatout gambling with the taxpayers' money.\n  As we end this issue of financial reform, there are a lot of ideas \naround. What do you do to make sure this does not happen again? I wish \nto make this point: There is a doctrine called too big to fail. We have \nseen it in practice in the last year: interests that are too big, \nbanks, investment banks especially, that are too big to fail, and so it \nis no-fault capitalism. Whatever risks they have taken, whatever losses \nthey have had, the taxpayer picks that up to the tune of $11 trillion \nin exposure from Federal programs.\n  Well--do you know what?--when the dust is settled, and whatever is \ndone on financial reform, if we do not address this issue of too big to \nfail, shame on us. In fact, the very firms that are declared too big to \nfail are now getting bigger, supported by the Federal government, and \nthat is flat wrong.\n  Let me quote Professor Joseph Stiglitz:\n\n       . . . our bail-outs run the risk of transferring large \n     amounts of money . . . to those\n\n[[Page S10471]]\n\n     banks that did the worst job in risk management. . . . In \n     effect, the government is tilting the playing field--towards \n     the losers. . . .\n\n  Paul Volcker says:\n\n       I do not think it reasonable that public money--taxpayer \n     money--be indirectly available to support risk-prone capital \n     market activities simply because they are housed within a \n     commercial banking organization.\n       The question at the end of the day is, Are we going to \n     address these things, such as too big to fail and get rid of \n     no-fault capitalism and see if we cannot push investment \n     banking to that which it used to be? I hope so. But on today, \n     a day in which we hear of record home foreclosures and $140 \n     billion in bonuses and compensation on Wall Street, I just \n     say there is some huge disconnection in this economy of ours \n     and it is something we ought to care about and something we \n     ought to do something about.\n\n  This country works best when we lift the country, when we expand the \nmiddle class, when we have jobs available to people who want to work. \nThere is no social program in this country as important as a good job \nthat pays well. That is what makes everything else possible.\n  But this question of financial healing--when, first, the healing \noccurs to those who caused the problem, and the healing occurs in \nrecord compensation, $140 billion, at a time when other people are \nstruggling to pay their grocery bills, struggling to buy the medicine \nthey need, struggling to make their house payment because they have \nlost their job, there is something missing in this country.\n  My hope is, when I see all these stories about Wall Street--the same \nold Wall Street, nothing has changed, going right back to the same old \nrisk, right back to the same old risk because they know, they have \nlearned in the last year, whatever they lose, the American people will \npick up the tab--this Congress had better say to them: No more, no \nlonger, never again. Too big to fail is a doctrine that cannot continue \nto live at the Federal Reserve Board or in this government. It is time \nthose at the top at the biggest institutions who take the biggest \nrisks, when they lose--it is time they lose, not the American people.\n\n  So we are headed toward financial reform. When that happens, I will \nbe on the floor of the Senate talking about the too-big-to-fail \ndoctrine and how we are going to end it, and quickly.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from South Dakota \nis recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10471-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10471-S10473]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, earlier this week the Senate Finance \nCommittee, by a vote of 14 to 9, reported out its version of health \ncare reform. That makes now five committees that have acted on this \nissue, five committees of jurisdiction--three in the House of \nRepresentatives and two in the Senate--all of which have now at least \nput out their products. But I say that loosely because what emerged \nfrom the Senate Finance Committee was not, in fact, legislative \nlanguage; it was a concept paper. It is yet to be reduced to \nlegislative language. That will take some time, I suspect, because many \nof the concepts that were included in the concept paper are pretty \ncomplex.\n  So what is happening now on the issue of health care reform, at least \nin the Senate, is in the leader's office. The chairman of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee is meeting with the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, and I suspect a number of the members of the \nWhite House to hammer out what will eventually be the bill I suspect \nwill come to the floor of the Senate. I say that only because the \nprocess has been very much flawed from the beginning. It is not one \nthat is inclusive in terms of allowing ideas from our side of the aisle \nto be incorporated. It has not been a bipartisan process, to say the \nleast.\n  My guess is that at the end of the day, what comes out of the \nleader's office will be a very different bill than anything we have \nseen so far. But I think there are certain characteristics in that bill \nthat have been in all of the bills. I think we know a few basic things \nabout all of the bills so far that are consistent, those things that \nhave not changed.\n  The first one is it will lead to higher premiums. The second one is \nit will lead to higher taxes. The third one is it will include cuts in \nMedicare. So those three basic characteristics are the same with regard \nto all of the bills, the three that have emerged from the committees in \nthe House of Representatives and now the two that have emerged from \nSenate committees and are currently being married up in the leader's \noffice.\n  I predict when that bill comes to the floor of the Senate, the \nAmerican people will have the same thing to look forward to that they \nhave now with all of these various bills: higher premiums, higher \ntaxes, and cuts in Medicare. Why is that significant? It is significant \nfor this reason: Health care reform, at least as stated in terms of its \npurpose, is to lower costs. For the past decade and beyond we have been \ntalking about health care costs in this country and how we have to do \nsomething to rein in the escalating costs people deal with every single \nyear for health care and double-digit increases in health care costs \nfor many of those years.\n  So the whole purpose of health care reform, at least my understanding \nof it, and I think as stated by the President and others, is that we \nneed to rein in and get control of health care costs in this country. \nThat is why it is ironic that of the five bills so far that have \nemerged from House and Senate committees, none bend the cost curve \ndown. All increase premiums for people in this country, increase the \ncosts for health care coverage.\n  In the Senate Finance Committee bill--the most recent version, which, \nas I said earlier, was reported out this week by a 14-to-9 vote--there \nwasn't a direct assessment or estimate of what that increase in \npremiums would be. There were simply generalized comments by the \nCongressional Budget Office that, yes, these increased taxes in the \nbill would be passed on generally dollar for dollar. In other words, \nthe taxes that are imposed--a 40-percent excise tax on some of these \ninsurance companies--would be passed on in the form of higher costs or \npremiums to health care consumers in this country without being more \nspecific or quantifying in any more precise way what those increased \ncosts would be. Nevertheless, they said basically the same thing we \nhave seen in all of these various bills, and that is that health care \ncosts--coverage, premiums--are going to go up. We are going to have \nhigher premiums.\n  In the last week or so we have now seen two studies where independent \nanalysts have looked at this and concluded the same thing. In fact, the \nPricewaterhouseCoopers study from a few days ago went so far as to say \nif you are an individual buying in the individual marketplace, you are \ngoing to see your health care premiums go up about $2,600 if this bill \nbecomes law. That would be in the year 2019 at the end of a 10-year \nwindow, which is what the people who analyze these things look at. So \nit is about a $2,600-per-person increase in premium if you are buying \non the individual market.\n  If you are a small employer who is employing 50 or fewer employees or \nan individual who is employed at one of those small businesses, you \nwould see premiums increase $2,100 if you are an individual. If you are \na family, you would see premiums increase $5,400 under the bill that \nwas produced and emerged from the Senate Finance Committee. So whether \nyou are an individual buying on the individual marketplace or whether \nyou are getting your insurance through your employer, you will see \nhigher premiums, higher health care costs according to this analysis. \nIf you are a family, it is the same thing. It is just a varying \ndifference in the amounts, but it is anywhere from $2,100 up to $5,400 \nof increased premium costs, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers \nstudy.\n  This week there was a study released by Oliver Wyman which came to \nthe conclusion that if you buy your insurance on the individual \nmarketplace, you will see a $1,500 increase for single coverage and \n$3,300 for family coverage annually. That is exclusive of inflation. \nThat doesn't include the normal inflationary costs that we deal with \nyear in and year out for health care in this country. This study \nconcluded the\n\n[[Page S10472]]\n\nsame thing the PricewaterhouseCoopers study did; that is, whether you \nbuy on the individual marketplace, whether you get it through your \nemployer, if you are an individual or you are a family, you will see \nhigher premium costs. As I said, in this particular study, it is $1,500 \nfor single coverage, $3,300 for family coverage annually.\n  They also broke it down State by State, which is important because I \nthink everybody wants to know how this is going to impact our \nconstituents, including my constituents in South Dakota. In this \nparticular case, if you are someone buying on the individual market and \nyou are an individual buying a single policy, you will see your health \ncare premiums go up 47 percent. If you are someone who has a family \nbuying on the individual marketplace, buying a family policy, you are \ngoing to see your premiums go up 50 percent. If you are in the small \ngroup market, if you have the good fortune of being in a larger group, \nyou will see, if you are an individual, your premiums go up 14 percent. \nIf you are a family in a small group market, you will see your premiums \ngo up 15 percent, exclusive of inflation. So those are two recent \nstudies where independent analysts have looked at the bill produced by \nthe Senate Finance Committee and concluded there would be significant \nincreases in premiums and in what people would pay for health care in \nthis country.\n\n  So it begs the question: How is this reforming health care? The \nstated purpose of health care reform is to lower costs, to drive down \ncosts for individuals and families. As you can see from these studies, \nthat certainly isn't the case. Of course, the Congressional Budget \nOffice, as I said earlier, indicated in response to questioning about \nthe Senate Finance Committee that although they hadn't drilled down and \nfigured out exactly what those premium increases would be, that \ninevitably you would have higher premium costs simply because the taxes \nimposed under the legislation would be passed on to health care \nconsumers, and everybody who is buying health care out there would see \ntheir premiums increase, generally speaking, dollar for dollar. That \nwas the conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  So higher premiums, that is the first thing we know about all of the \nhealth care reform plans so far that have been put forward.\n  The second thing we know as well, with certainty, is that they all \ninclude higher taxes. The House versions of this legislation used \npayroll taxes. They have an employer mandate--what we refer to as a \npay-or-play mandate. There are additional, I guess you would say, \n``add-on'' taxes for people who are in higher income categories, so \nthey finance it with different forms of taxes. The tax increases \nproposed by the Senate Finance Committee--as I said earlier, there is \nan individual mandate, so if you don't have insurance, you will pay \npenalties. That will be a certain tax or fee on individuals in this \ncountry which will hit a lot of lower income individuals. But the \ninsurance companies which would be hit with these tax increases, of \ncourse, would then pass those on to health care consumers. So, again, \nwe see increases in taxes.\n  What the Congressional Budget Office did with respect to the issue of \ntaxes is, it did go so far as to say where that tax burden would lie. \nUnder the Congressional Budget Office estimate, 89 percent of the \nhigher taxes in this bill produced by the Senate Finance Committee \nwould fall on those wage earners, those taxpayers in this country \nearning less than $200,000 a year. They went so far as to say that, I \nthink it was 71 percent of those--and that was in the year 2019--71 \npercent of that tax burden would fall on those earning under $200,000 a \nyear when the bill initially kicks in.\n  So we are going to see significantly higher taxes on people making \nunder $200,000 a year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation has also analyzed this issue, and \nthey came to some conclusions earlier this week as well, one of which \nwas that, similarly, we would see almost 90 percent of the tax burden \nunder this bill falling on those households with incomes under $200,000 \na year. They went so far as to say that more than half of the tax \nburden would fall on those households with incomes under $100,000 a \nyear. So almost 90 percent of the tax burden falls on wage earners, \ntaxpayers with incomes under $200,000 a year, and over half of the tax \nburden falls on those wage earners, those taxpayers with incomes under \n$100,000 a year. That is according to the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  So what does that mean? Well, that means the President's promise that \nhealth care reform would not impose taxes on those earning less than \n$250,000 is just a bunch of hot air. It just doesn't add up. We have \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation and the Congressional Budget Office all \nsaying that the disproportionate share of these taxes--the tax burden--\nabout 90 percent is going to fall on $250,000 and under and over half, \nover 50 percent of the tax burden, falling on income earners, wage \nearners, taxpayers in this country with under $100,000 in income.\n  So the whole idea that somehow working families are going to be \nspared from the higher taxes under this bill just doesn't hold water. \nSo what we are going to see in this bill is not only higher premiums \nthat are going to affect people across this country who are expecting, \nbecause they have heard that health care reform is supposed to lower \ntheir health care costs--they are going to see higher premiums. \nPremiums are going to go up. They are also going to see their taxes go \nup, and go up significantly because if you look at the Joint Committee \non Taxation--and this is a letter that was written in response to \nquestions that were raised by members of the Senate Finance Committee, \nand it says:\n\n       Subsidy phase-outs raise marginal tax rates because for \n     every additional dollar you earn, you are eligible for a \n     smaller subsidy, imposing potentially high effective tax \n     rates on that additional dollar and reducing your incentive \n     to earn that additional dollar.\n\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, families earning 150 \npercent of the Federal poverty line--and that is $32,200 of income in \nthis country; that is, 150 percent of the Federal poverty line--will \nface an effective marginal tax rate of 59 percent, meaning that for \nevery additional dollar these taxpayers earn, they are losing 59 cents \nof it in foregone subsidies in taxes: Effective marginal tax rate, 59 \npercent on a wage earner who is making--that is 150 percent of the \nFederal poverty level or $32,200. So there are lots of higher taxes in \nthis legislation and lots of higher premiums.\n  Of course, the final point I will mention, and the other point we \nknow is consistent in all the bills, is significant cuts in Medicare. \nUnder the Senate Finance Committee, there is almost a half trillion \ndollars' worth of cuts in Medicare in the form of Medicare Advantage, \nwhich is about $133 billion that will be cut out of seniors who are \nreceiving benefits under Medicare Advantage: hospitals, home health \nagencies, hospices, pharmaceuticals--everybody gets a haircut under \nthis proposal, all of which I would argue is unlikely to happen. Here \nis why.\n  Anytime Congress has enacted changes in Medicare that were designed \nto achieve savings, they inevitably go back and reverse course. We have \nlots of history to support that assumption. But, nevertheless, let's \nassume for a minute these taxes did occur.\n  A $500 billion, or $\\1/2\\ trillion, cut in Medicare that impacts \nseniors and health care providers in this country will be one of the \nresults of the reform legislation that is being proposed by the \nDemocrats in the Senate. The Finance Committee's version of that is the \nmost recent. So that is $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts, $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in tax increases, and $1.8 trillion in new spending when it is \nfully implemented.\n  There was sort of a smoke-and-mirrors approach used to shield the \ntrue cost of this by having the revenues kick in immediately. The tax \nincreases kick in right away, but the actual costs under the plan don't \nkick up for about 4\\1/2\\ years. You have all these tax increases \nhitting people right away, and so the 10-year cost of this is \nunderstated significantly. CBO said $829 billion over the first 10 \nyears. I think the important number to look at is what is the cost of \nthis when fully implemented over a 10-year period. It is $1.8 trillion. \nThat is $1.8 trillion in new spending, which is financed with higher \ntaxes, cuts in Medicare, and, ironically, no savings to health care \nconsumers because every analysis done says it is\n\n[[Page S10473]]\n\ngoing to lead to higher premiums. I argue as well, in addition to \nhigher premiums, there will be higher taxes and Medicare cuts.\n  You are also going to see a significant reduction in the quality of \nservice in this country, as you have more and more government expansion \nin Washington, DC, more and more government involvement in the \ndecisions that are made. The government will now put mandates on what \ntypes of policies meet their threshold, their standard. I think, \ninevitably, in every model around the world where you have that level \nof government intervention, it leads to a rationing of care, denials of \ncare, and delays with respect to care.\n  I argue that the whole idea of this being characterized or labeled as \nreform is completely mislabeled. There is nothing that is reform about \nthis. It raises premiums, raises taxes, and cuts Medicare. I think you \nare going to see, in addition to that, diminishment in the services \nthat are available to people in this country through many of these \nprograms.\n  What is the alternative? We believe that rather than throwing the \nentire health care system overboard in this country, we ought to be \nlooking at what we can do on a step-by-step basis to improve it. \nRepublicans have offered a number of alternatives. We can allow buying \ninsurance across State lines. We believe interstate competition in \nbuying insurance would put downward pressure on prices in this country. \nThat is a good solution. We can have small business health plans, \nallowing small businesses to join groups. Group purchasing power will \nbring downward pressure on insurance prices. By the way, that is \nsomething a number of us voted for many times here in the Congress. It \nhas always been defeated. Also, we can deal with the issue of medical \nmalpractice reform, which, according to CBO, has significant savings--\n$54 billion. That applies to the government side of health care. If you \nextend that to private health care--I think there are estimates that \ndefensive medicine in this country costs $100 billion to $200 billion \nannually. So if you could address that issue that deals with litigation \ncosts and defensive medicine, you would see savings grow over the \nestimates of the CBO.\n  Having said that, those are several things, just off the top right \nthere, that we think are step-by-step improvements in our health care \nsystem in this country. That doesn't throw overboard everything that is \ngood about American health care. It doesn't move us toward a government \nplan or a single-payer system like they have in Europe, Canada, or \nsomeplace like that. It preserves the competition we have in the \nmarketplace today and a market-based delivery system for health care in \nthis country.\n  We will continue to talk about those ideas, as well as many others, \nincluding providing tax credits that will give access to health care \nfor those who don't have it. There is a way to do that that is very \nsimple.\n  By the way, the Baucus bill, the Finance Committee bill, still leaves \n29 million people in this country without health insurance. In spite of \n$1.8 trillion in spending, new taxes, higher premiums, and everything \nthat goes with that, you are still not getting many of the people who \ndon't have health insurance covered.\n  We think the bill that will be brought before the Senate--we don't \nknow what it is at this point because it is being written behind closed \ndoors--is the wrong approach, and the correct approach is a step-by-\nstep process that addresses the shortcomings, the flaws, and attempts \nto fix those in a way that doesn't bust the bank or the budget, that \ndoesn't raise taxes on consumers and raise premiums for health care \nconsumers, and that doesn't cut Medicare for seniors across this \ncountry and for many of the providers that are out there.\n  Mr. President, I hope that as the American people listen to this \ndebate, they will engage on this issue; that the bill--whatever comes \nout of the discussions going on in the leader's office, I hope there is \nan ample amount of time for the American people to analyze it and for \nMembers of the Senate to digest it. This is literally one-sixth of the \nAmerican economy. We are talking about reorganizing one-sixth of our \nentire economy. We should do it with great deliberation and great \ndiligence and with a great amount of care and, I argue, not by throwing \nthe current system overboard and wrecking it but by taking a step-by-\nstep approach that improves the system we have today and provides \naccess to those who don't have health insurance and does something to \nbend the cost curve down and drive health care costs down rather than \nraising them, like all the bills that have been produced by the \nDemocratic majority in the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as you know, today the Social Security \nAdministration announced there will be no COLA, or cost of living \nincrease, next year for more than 50 million seniors. That is the first \ntime in 35 years that situation has occurred, and it worries me very \nmuch.\n  About a month ago, I introduced legislation which the occupant of the \nchair is a cosponsor of, along with Senators Leahy, Dodd, Stabenow, \nBegich, and Casey.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Mikulski and Senator Tom Udall \nas cosponsors of S. 1685.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. We are all saying that in the midst of this major \neconomic downturn, the worst recession since the Great Depression, \nwhile we are keenly concerned about the 9.8 million Americans who are \nunemployed officially, the Americans who have given up looking for \nwork, the millions of Americans who are working part time when they \nwant to work full time--when you add that all together, that is \nsomething like 17 percent of our workforce, about 26 million Americans. \nWe are concerned about that issue, and we have to do everything we can \nto make sure we get this economy going in a way that benefits not just \nWall Street but ordinary Americans.\n  While we remain concerned about the need to start creating the \nmillions of jobs the middle class in this country desperately need, we \ncannot turn our backs on the senior citizens of this country. What we \nare seeing today is that millions of seniors are facing extremely high \nprescription drug costs. They are facing very high health care costs. \nWe have to address that issue.\n  The legislation I introduced--and it was introduced by Congressman \nDeFazio in the House--would provide a one-time $250 payment for more \nthan 50 million seniors and disabled veterans. We would pay for that \ncost of about $14 billion by raising the Social Security tax on people \nwho earn between $250,000 and $359,000, on a 1-year basis--about $14 \nbillion.\n  What I am delighted about is that yesterday President Obama announced \nhis support for the concept of a $250 one-time payment to our seniors \non Social Security and to disabled veterans. He did not yet determine, \nin his judgment, the best way to fund that program. I think it is a \nreal step forward that he is doing that. I am delighted that the \nmajority leader, Senator Reid, has also been very strong on saying we \nhave to make sure our seniors get some help this year, as has Speaker \nPelosi and the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, Congressman \nRangel. I think we are making some real steps in the right direction.\n  Let me quote what the President said because I think he was right on:\n\n       Even as we seek to bring about recovery, we must act on \n     behalf of those hardest hit by this recession. That is why I \n     am announcing my support for an additional $250 in emergency \n     recovery assistance to seniors, veterans, and people with \n     disabilities to help them make it through these difficult \n     times. These payments will provide aid to more than 50 \n     million people in the coming year, relief that will not only \n     make a difference for them, but for our economy as a whole, \n     complementing the tax cuts we've provided working families \n     and small businesses through the Recovery Act.\n\n  I very much appreciate that support from the President.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation is now in our jurisdiction. \nMy\n\n[[Page S10474]]\n\nhope and expectation is that we are going to move it as quickly as \npossible. With the President's support, we should be able to accomplish \nthat in a short while.\n  In Vermont, I can tell you there are many seniors making the \ndifficult choice about whether or not to heat their homes or pay for \nprescription drugs. Those are choices Americans should not have to \nmake. Many seniors are also going to be seeing an increase in the cost \nof Medicare Part D.\n  If we do not deliver on this one-time $250 payment, you are going to \nsee millions of seniors with a reduced amount in their Social Security \ncheck. That is not acceptable.\n  I think we are making some progress on this issue. Again, I thank \nSenator Reid for his strong support, Speaker Pelosi for her support, \nand most important, the President for his support. Let's get this done \non behalf of seniors and disabled veterans. I think we will have done \nsomething that is very important.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to honor a giant in the world of \njournalism, Furman Bisher.\n  Last Saturday, after nearly 60 years of elegant observation of the \nsports world for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, my friend Furman \nBisher pecked out his last and final column before retirement on the \nthinning keys of his trusty, old Royal typewriter. His choice of \ninstrument to convey his thoughts in this age of instantaneous, inane \nchatter says a lot about why newspaper readers, after all these years, \nhave continued to seek out his column on the AJC's sports page.\n  It all comes down to this: Furman's graceful prose, courtly voice, \nand sharp observations are unfailingly backed up by his old-fashioned \nshoe-leather reporting. He gloried in doing his homework, making that \nextra call, interviewing one more player or assistant coach or trainer \nin order to breathe even more life into the game or the race or the \nfight for his readers.\n  It is also why Furman has become a Georgian--and American--\ninstitution.\n  Simply put, Furman Bisher loved sports and he loved journalism. At \nage 90, he was still driving out on summer nights to cover minor league \nbaseball games.\n  In his career, Furman scored many journalistic knockouts, including a \n1949 interview with Shoeless Joe Jackson, the only one Jackson ever \ngave regarding his involvement in the 1919 Black Sox scandal.\n  He got stock tips from Ty Cobb and watched every Masters, including \nJack Nicklaus's 1986 Masters victory, which he gloried in. He sat in \nthe press box at countless Falcons games at Atlanta-Fulton County \nStadium and the Georgia Dome and covered the Olympics, both winter and \nsummer.\n  He wrote 11 books, including coauthoring two editions of a Hank Aaron \nautobiography. At the Masters Tournament in Augusta every April, Furman \nreigned among the azaleas and oaks as the dean of the sports press \ncorps.\n  In a testament to his longevity in a tough business, Furman has \ncovered every Kentucky Derby since 1950 and every Super Bowl but the \nfirst one.\n  Furman even branched out into TV. Although I did not grow up in \nAtlanta, I have heard from many people that preachers across the city \nwould cut a sermon short so that their congregations could be home for \nFurman's kickoff on ``Football Review.''\n  Along the way, he earned the respect of his colleagues and the \nloyalty of his readers, garnering writing awards too numerous to \nmention. Red Smith is acknowledged as probably the dean of all \njournalists from a sports perspective, and Furman Bisher has often been \nreferred to as the ``Red Smith of the South.'' He served as president \nof the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association from 1974 \nto 1976, and of the Football Writers Association of America from 1959 \nto 1960. His features have appeared in The Saturday Evening Post, Golf \nDigest, and Sports Illustrated, to name but a few.\n  In 1961, Time magazine named him one of the five best columnists in \nthe Nation. I would argue that even today, that honor still fits.\n  No less than the great Jack Nicklaus said of Furman's retirement:\n\n       He might be turning in his last column for the newspaper, \n     but Furman will never stop writing or giving his opinion. I \n     guess you could say that when it comes to the last writings \n     of Furman Bisher, I will believe it when I don't see it.\n\n  Furman would close every column with a single valediction--the word \n``selah,'' a Hebrew word that ends many Psalms and that exhorts the \nreader to reflect.\n  It is appropriate then to reflect on Furman's long, fruitful career, \none that began in Atlanta as the Korean war was starting, when Joe \nLouis was still boxing, when the Minneapolis Lakers were the NBA \nchamps, before Willie Mays had joined the Major Leagues, and before \nSports Illustrated even existed.\n  Ever since, with wit and style, Furman Bisher has chronicled the \ntriumphs and the travails of the sports world and its often all too \nhuman heroes.\n  Furman is leaving the AJC at almost 91 years old, and he is still \ngoing strong. While we may not be seeing his column on a regular basis, \nI am quite sure we have not heard the last of Furman Bisher. As Furman \nwould say, selah. I am thankful for Furman Bisher.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I know the hour is late and many are ready \nto end the week. I wish to say a few words tonight about the challenge \nwe have with regard to Afghanistan and Pakistan and our strategy going \nforward.\n  I spent some time in the last couple of weeks talking about the \nobligation we have in the Senate to have a full debate on these issues \nand not simply to point down Pennsylvania Avenue and say the White \nHouse has to do this or that or the President has to do this or that.\n  It is important, I believe, that the President and his team have \ntaken the kind of time they have to get the strategy right with regard \nto Afghanistan and Pakistan. But I believe the Congress has a role to \nplay. If we simply fall into partisan corners with regard to our \nstrategy in Afghanistan and dust off and reintroduce talking points \nfrom the war in Iraq, we will not get it right; we will get it wrong.\n  I believe we have to listen to a lot of different points of view. The \nPresident has undertaken that kind of review, and we have to do that as \nwell.\n  Part of that is doing what we have already begun to do, which is to \nhave a series of hearings.\n  In the Foreign Relations Committee, we have had a number of hearings. \nI know the Presiding Officer, as a member of the Intelligence Committee \nand his work as a Senator, has engaged in this review as well. We are \ntrying to get different points of view in front of us. I know Chairman \nKerry and the Foreign Relations Committee have had too many hearings to \ncount, and not just in the last couple of weeks but over many months.\n  Chairman Levin and the Armed Services Committee have outlined a \nstrategy, or at least an approach to part of a strategy, to focus on \nbuilding up the Afghan National Army and the police on an accelerated \nbasis so we can begin to move the responsibility more to the Afghan \npeople and the Afghan governing institutions as opposed to having the \nUnited States and other coalition partners bear this responsibility \nsolely. Chairman Levin has spent a good deal of time trying to \ncontribute to this debate.\n  We have heard both Democrats and Republicans contributing to this \ndiscussion. As much as we have heard\n\n[[Page S10475]]\n\nabout General McChrystal's report and his recommendations--and we have \nheard a good bit about that, and we should, and we have heard an awful \nlot about his recommendation with regard to troop levels, almost \nexclusively, General McChrystal's recommendations about troops.\n  If you read his report--the report that is now public--he talks at \nlength in that report about every topic under that heading and does \nrefer to troops, but he also talks about at least three areas. One, he \ntalks about security. Obviously, as the commander, he should address \nthat issue, and he does. But he also talks about governance and \ndevelopment. Those three areas are critically important. We can get the \ntroop level right and get the whole strategy wrong. Even if we focus on \nsecurity, which obviously involves troop levels and military \ndeterminations we have to make, we have to get it right with regard to \ndevelopment and also with regard to governance.\n  I note for the record an article from--I do not have it in front of \nme, but I will refer to it. The New York Times on October 2 had a story \nabout General McChrystal's approach to the strategy, but he was quoted \nin that story talking about debate and deliberation.\n  I have been listening to some people who talked about what he is \nrecommending. One would think all he did was put together a report, \nsend it to Washington, and the report said ``add troops'' and that is \nall he had to say. General McChrystal--I am paraphrasing--did refer to \nboth debate and deliberation to get the strategy right. He also said we \ndo not have the luxury of moving too fast. I think that is instructive \nof what he has been recommending.\n  I want to talk tonight briefly about one of those three areas, not \nsecurity or development, but governance, and in particular talk for a \nmoment about elections and other aspects of governance as well as the \njudiciary.\n  I know the Senator from Rhode Island, the Presiding Officer, is a \nmember of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a former prosecutor and \nunderstands how important the judiciary is to a functioning democracy. \nWe have a ways to go and the Afghan people have a ways to go between \nhere and there, meaning here where they are today and where they must \nget to with regard to their judiciary.\n  In terms of the election, we heard a lot about the problems, and some \nof it bears repeating. As documented by the National Democratic \nInstitute, the International Republican Institute, Democracy \nInternational, and a host of other international observers, the \nelections in Afghanistan saw widespread fraud amid an atmosphere of \nescalated violence. We saw many of these problems coming before the \nelections, and despite having years to prepare, there is still not a \nreliable voters list, which opened the possibility of wholesale fraud \non election day. The ``single nontransferable vote system'' for the \nprovincial government elections has led to candidates gaining seats \nwith only a few actual votes. On election day, many citizens were too \nscared to vote, citing Taliban threats to bomb polling stations or \nliterally cut fingers off of voters. Afghanistan itself can and should \ntake several concrete steps or measures to address these issues prior \nto the next election, including fixing the voters list, considering \nmoving away from the single nontransferable voter system, and enhancing \nthe security environment for voters in the preelection period and on \nelection day.\n\n  I would add to this that when I was in Afghanistan and Pakistan back \nin August with Senator Brown and Congressman Zack Space, we had several \nbriefings and one of them was on the election. One point that was made \nwe shouldn't lose sight of. This election, for all the fraud that we \nknow is on the record now, for all the problems, the security \nenvironment was generally good. The fact that despite those threats by \nthe Taliban an election took place in a time of war and under an \nadverse, difficult security environment shouldn't be glossed over. It \nwas a significant challenge. So we had a lot of fraud, but in terms of \nsecurity there is some good news on the security front.\n  Organized representation of any citizen's interests in Afghanistan \nalso remains underdeveloped. The electoral system disincentivizes the \ndevelopment of vibrant party structures. This is problematic, because \nwithout political parties--it is hard for us to understand this is \nstill a problem--without political parties that can help to organize \nand represent the policy concerns of the people, there is little hope \nthat the Parliament's legislation can truly reflect the will of the \nAfghan people.\n  Governing institutions in Afghanistan have atrophied over decades of \ncivil war and Taliban rule and have begun to develop other problems as \nwell, but institutional reform is vitally necessary. We know that the \nidea of a strong central government in the history of Afghanistan is \nsomewhat of a foreign concept. In recent years, the international \ncommunity has placed an emphasis on the development of governing \ninstitutions in Kabul, capable of projecting its presence and influence \nacross the country, but it has been a difficult challenge. Not enough \nattention has been paid to the development of proper financing of local \ngoverning institutions. Provincial government is underfunded, and that \nopens the door to local level corruption.\n  Local and international development nongovernmental organizations \noften take the lead in local development projects, which can serve to \nminimize the role of the provincial government at a time when we need \ntheir role to be strengthened in terms of what people see. So just at a \ntime when you need strong evidence of local government, sometimes the \nNGOs are doing a lot of the work.\n  While the international community has not paid enough attention to \nthe development of local governing structures, the Taliban, \nunfortunately, understands the importance of connecting with the people \nat the local level. Over the past few years, the Taliban has \nestablished shadow governments across the south which mete out their \nform of Sharia justice. They have ombudsmen who travel from district to \ndistrict to gauge the work of the Taliban shadow government and their \nofficials. And of course we know that Mullah Omar, the former head of \nthe Taliban-led government, now runs the so-called Quetta Shura--QST as \nit is known by its acronym--and they have produced a 30-page manual, \nbelieve it or not, on how best to win the favor of the local \npopulation.\n  So the Taliban is not just thinking in military terms. They have \nalready not just thought about but have begun to implement a governing \nstrategy, and our government--our strategy--and also the Afghan people, \nas well as our coalition partners--have to think this through as well \nand get it right. It is important we get this right--the governing part \nof our challenge--as much as we get the military part of this right.\n  The Afghan Government should make every effort to devolve power and \nresources to the local level to bring good governance as close to the \npeople as possible. The provincial reconstruction teams can help and \nplay a supporting role, but this essential connection between the \nAfghan citizen and government must be an Afghan-led enterprise.\n  Let me conclude with this thought about the judiciary. The Taliban \nare threatened by a strong judiciary, as evidenced by its deadly attack \non the Ministry of Justice in Kabul earlier this year. High levels of \nendemic corruption, insufficiently trained staff, and a complicated \nsystem of western, customary, and Sharia law hinders the Afghan \nGovernment's ability to provide justice for its people. This is perhaps \nthe biggest threat to the Afghan Government's viability, the Taliban's \nability to provide quick, albeit brutal, justice, which sharply \ncontrasts with the corrupt government officials who are unwilling or \nunable to take action. So in the absence of a strong effort by the \ngovernment to provide the kind of judiciary that we would hope they \ncould provide, the Taliban has filled the void. Thus a majority of \nlegal disputes are settled outside of the state's formal justice \nsystem. With little trust in the government, the population can easily \nturn to the Taliban for a swift, brutal form of justice.\n  As we ramp up our efforts to train the Afghan National Police force, \nwe must at the same time consider parallel reforms that must take place \nwithin the formal justice sector. We must support Afghan efforts toward \ninstitutional reform in the Ministry of Justice so that the local \npopulation\n\n[[Page S10476]]\n\nwill not rely only upon the informal justice sector, or worse, turn in \nfact to the Taliban for justice.\n  There has been noteworthy progress in some democratic institution \nbuilding within the country. First, by way of example, the Ministries \nof Defense and Interior are often recognized for their positive \nefforts. And while considerable work remains to be done, each has made \nsignificant strides in recent years. I can say from somewhat of a \nfirsthand observation that both Defense Minister Wardal and Interior \nMinister Akmar, two ministers we met with on our trip in August and sat \ndown with, indicated to me they have a strong sense of where they have \nto go to develop the Afghan army and police force, the security for the \ncountry. But they still have to demonstrate that over time. No matter \nwho ultimately wins the Presidential election, I hope that the Afghan \nGovernment will retain these important ministers, who have the \ninstitutional knowledge of success and of clear plans for continued \ndevelopment.\n  Second, the health sector, in particular, has seen impressive gains \nsince the fall of the Taliban government. Today, in Afghanistan, 82 \npercent of the population lives in districts with access to a \ngovernment-provided health care package, up from 9 percent in 2003. \nThat is a bit of good news we don't often hear about, but I am sure \nthere is progress yet to be made there as well in terms of health care.\n  Third, the education sector has seen improvements as well. In 2001, \nless than 1 million children--probably about 10 percent of the school-\naged population--were enrolled in elementary or secondary education, \nand almost none of them were girls at that time. Today, more than 6 \nmillion children are enrolled, 2 million of whom are girls. So there \nhas been measurable and significant progress in Afghanistan despite the \nrecent deteriorating security environment.\n  Building on these fragile gains will rest in large part on the \nviability of the Afghan democratic institutions. The United States can \nhelp in this effort through the continued provision of development \nassistance and other forms of diplomatic and political support for \nAfghanistan's institutions. While the security situation is \nincreasingly grave, between 79 and 91 percent of the population remains \nopposed to the Taliban and their brand of violent politics and their \nbrand of justice. I hope we can consolidate on the gains made in \nAfghanistan and seriously begin to address the severe shortcomings that \nremain in the democratic development of the country.\n  In conclusion, I would say that despite all the bad news about the \nsecurity environment, which is news we need to hear, we need to put it \nin the context of the two other challenges beyond security--governance \nand development. I have pointed out some real problems with the \ngovernance, especially as it relates to the judiciary, but we have had \nsome progress on health and on education. We need to accelerate and \ndevelop that and incentivize it and get it right, but we have seen some \ngood news.\n  So I think as we debate this strategy going forward, those of us in \nthe Senate who have a role to play here and who feel the obligation to \nget this right have to focus on more than just security and troops and \nthe military. We have to make sure that we get strategies in place to \nenhance and increase the governance priority as well as development. We \nwill talk more at another time about development.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10476-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10476]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                          SERGEANT JOSHUA KIRK\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, it is with deep sympathy and a heavy \nheart that I express my condolences to the family of SGT Joshua Kirk \nwho was killed on October 3 in Afghanistan. Joshua was serving his \nsecond tour of duty as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. The American \npeople will forever be grateful for his ultimate sacrifice.\n  Sergeant Kirk enlisted in the Army in the spring of 2005, joining the \n4th Infantry Division based out of Fort Carson in Colorado Springs, CO. \nHe was originally from Thomaston, ME and attended Southern Maine \nCommunity College, where he met his wife Megan of Exeter, NH, and \nearned a degree in construction technology.\n  Joshua believed deeply in his mission and in the cause of freedom for \nwhich he and seven of his fellow soldiers sacrificed their lives \ntogether. Words will not assuage the anguish each of these soldier's \nfamily will feel, nor the sense of loss at Fort Carson when these brave \nmen failed to return home, but we hope that one day these families will \ntake solace in what President Lincoln described as ``the solemn pride \nthat must be yours to have laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of \nfreedom.''\n  Our Nation can never fully repay the sacrifice Sergeant Kirk and his \nfamily have made. Through his service, he helped preserve the safety \nand security of the American people. It now falls to all of us to take \nup this responsibility and ensure that the cause Sergeant Kirk gave his \nlife for is won for his wife and young daughter.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and all Americans in honoring the life \nof SGT Joshua Kirk.\n\n\n                     Staff Sergeant Kurt R. Curtiss\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to U.S. Army \nSSG Kurt R. Curtiss of Utah who made the ultimate sacrifice for his \ncountry on August 26, 2009. The staff sergeant died from injuries \nsustained from enemy small arms fire in Paktika Province, Afghanistan. \nStaff Sergeant Curtiss was leading his unit into a hospital trying to \nrescue patients trapped inside when the attack occurred.\n  Staff Sergeant Curtiss was assigned to Headquarters and Headquarters \nCompany, 1st Battalion, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment, 25th \nInfantry Division, Fort Richardson, AK, in support of Operation \nEnduring Freedom.\n  On the day after the September 11 attacks, Kurt Curtiss enlisted in \nthe Army. He wanted to protect his country and make the world a better \nplace. This call to service led to two tours in Iraq and a final tour \nin Afghanistan. The sense of patriotism exhibited by his actions \nprovides a striking example to us all.\n  Early in his youth, Staff Sergeant Curtiss learned of selflessness \nand acceptance as he grew up in a home where his mother cared for over \n60 foster children. He will be remembered for his love, devotion, \ncompassion, and humor. Curtiss loved life. He was a caring man who \nalways placed others before himself, a characteristic exemplified by \nhis final moments.\n  Staff Sergeant Curtiss left behind a wife and two young children who \nI hope can find solace in the immense gratitude that our Nation owes \nfor his selfless service to his countrymen. We are forever in his and \nhis family's debt.\n  Therefore I know that I am joined by all of my colleagues in the \nSenate in mourning the loss of SSG Kurt R. Curtiss, our protector and \nhero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10476-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10476-S10482]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING SENATOR EDWARD M. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, yesterday evening, President Obama delivered \nanother eloquent tribute to Senator Edward M. Kennedy. I am sure my \ncolleagues will be pleased and touched to see it, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that excerpts from the tribute may be printed at this point in \nthe Record. I also ask unanimous consent that a series of tributes to \nSenator Kennedy from ``The Hill'' newspaper on August 29, 2009 may be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Excerpts From Remarks by the President at an Event Celebrating the \n        Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate\n\n          (Ritz Carlton Hotel, Washington, DC, Oct. 14, 2009)\n\n       The PRESIDENT: Thank you so much. Thank you, Patrick, for \n     that generous introduction, and for ensuring that the Kennedy \n     family spirit of public service lives on as strong as ever. . \n     . .\n       And to Vicki and all the members of the Kennedy family--to \n     Ted and Kara, obviously Patrick--there are few who are not \n     inspired by the grace and love that all of you have shown \n     throughout a difficult time.\n       Our friend Ted left us less than two months ago. In the \n     days that followed, we gathered in Boston to celebrate his \n     life--with a joyous Irish wake of sorts at the John F. \n     Kennedy Library, and with heavy hearts on Mission Hill. We \n     watched as mourners lined the streets of Massachusetts and \n     Washington in the rain to say a final thank you; and as \n     decades' worth of his colleagues and staff lined the steps of \n     the Capitol to say a final goodbye. We smiled as the Caucus \n     Room in the\n\n[[Page S10477]]\n\n     Russell Building, a room where so much American history was \n     made, was renamed for the three Kennedy brothers who served \n     there.\n       And over those days, there was some small measure of \n     comfort in the fact that millions of Americans were reminded \n     of Ted Kennedy's legacy, and a new generation came to know \n     it. His legacy as a man, who loved his family and loved his \n     country. His legacy as a senator, who crafted hundreds of \n     pieces of legislation and helped pass thousands more, all \n     with an incalculable impact on the lives of millions.\n       His legacy as a mentor, who not only taught so many young \n     senators, including myself, but inspired so many young people \n     and young staffers, some who entered public service because \n     of Teddy, others who--because of him--just plain refused to \n     leave. . . .\n       When Teddy first arrived in the United States Senate, he \n     immersed himself in the issues of the day and the concerns of \n     folks back home. But he also threw himself into the history \n     of the chamber. He studied its philosophical underpinnings; \n     he studied its giants and their careers; the times that \n     influenced its members, and how its members influenced the \n     times. He became fluent in procedure and protocol, no matter \n     how obscure, until he could master the Senate as easily as he \n     mastered the oceans.\n       No one made the Senate come alive like he did. He loved its \n     history and its place in our American story. Rarely was he \n     more animated than when he'd lead you through the living \n     museums that were his office and his hideaway office in the \n     Capitol. They held memories that stood still, even as he \n     refused to. And he could--and he would--tell you everything \n     there was to know about each artifact, each object that you \n     were seeing.\n       Any of us who've had the privilege to serve in that \n     institution know that it's impossible not to share Teddy's \n     feeling for the history that swirls around us. It's a place \n     where you instinctively pull yourself a little straighter and \n     commit yourself to acting a little nobler.\n       I still remember the first time I pulled open the drawer of \n     my desk and saw the names like Taft and Baker; Simon and \n     Wellstone--and Robert F. Kennedy. I thought of the great \n     battles they'd waged and how they still echoed through the \n     Senate chambers. And one can't enter the chamber without \n     thinking of the momentous debates that have occurred within \n     its walls--questions of war and peace; of tangled bargain \n     between North and South; federal and state; of the origins of \n     slavery and prejudice; of the unfinished battles for civil \n     rights and equality and opportunity.\n       It was where Americans of great eloquence deliberated and \n     discussed the great issues of the age; where Webster and Clay \n     and Calhoun fought and forged compromise; where LBJ stalked \n     the aisles, imposing his will and collecting votes; and where \n     Ted Kennedy raged at injustice like a force of nature, even \n     after a staffer would hand him a note saying, ``Sir, you're \n     shouting.''\n       At its worst, it could be a place where progress was \n     stymied. There was a time, of course, when there were no \n     desks for women, or African Americans, or Latino Americans, \n     or Asian Americans. There was a time when a Senator might \n     have referred to another as a--I like this--``noisome, squat \n     and nameless animal,'' just to name one instance of the \n     occasional lack of decorum. And we should all view it as a \n     positive sign that there hasn't been a caning on the Senate \n     floor in more than 150 years. That's good.\n       But at its best, it was what Ted Kennedy loved; a place of \n     community and camaraderie where Senators inspired their \n     colleagues to seek out those better angels and work \n     collectively to perfect our union, bit by bit. And in my time \n     in the Senate, I never met a colleague, not even one with \n     whom I most deeply disagreed, who didn't have a deep \n     sincerity in his or her beliefs, an abiding love for this \n     country, and a genuine desire to leave it stronger and \n     better.\n       Still, I know that many of us, from both parties, shared \n     Ted's sentiment that something vital about the Senate has \n     been lost. Where it once was a more personal and more \n     collegial place, it's become more polarized and more \n     confrontational. And gone, sometimes, is that deeper \n     understanding of one another; that ideas that there are great \n     battles to be won and great battles to be waged--but not \n     against the person on the other side of the aisle, rather to \n     be waged on behalf of the country.\n       What Ted wanted to save, above anything else, is that sense \n     of community and collegiality and mutual responsibility--to \n     our constituents, to the institution, and to one another. \n     ``As senators,'' he wrote, ``we need to be vigilant that we \n     don't lose track of the whole essence of what the Senate is; \n     of what our involvement in it signifies; of our relationship \n     with people; and of what all of that should lead to, which is \n     the unfettered and vital exchange of ideas.''\n       That's why whenever heartbreak struck a colleague--he was \n     always the first to call. That's why whenever a stalemate \n     needed to be broken--he was the first to visit another \n     senator's office. That's why whenever debate got fierce he \n     never got personal--because that was the fastest way to \n     ensure nothing got done. Once, after he and Strom Thurmond \n     went at each other for a few rounds--as you'd imagine Ted and \n     Strom might do--Ted put his arm around him and said, ``C'mon, \n     Strom. Let's go upstairs and I'll give you a few judges.''\n       The thing is, even though he never technically ran the \n     Senate, it often felt like Teddy did. It was his arena. \n     That's why, if you came to the Senate hoping to be a great \n     senator someday, he was who you went to see first. I know \n     that's who I went to see first. Because rather than lord over \n     it, Teddy sought to mentor others to better navigate it. \n     Rather than to go it alone, he sought cooperation, he never \n     hesitated to cede credit. Rather than abandon course when \n     political winds got rough, he always followed his north \n     star--the cause of a society that is more fair, more decent, \n     and more just. And through all of it, his seriousness of \n     purpose was rivaled only by his humility, his warmth, his \n     good cheer, his sense of humor.\n       That is who Ted Kennedy was. That's what he did. And that's \n     why he's so missed. . . .\n       For it is now--especially now--that we need to get people \n     interested in our public problems, and reignite their faith \n     in our public institutions, bring Americans together to forge \n     consensus and understand not just the United States Senate's \n     role in our government--but their role in it at well.\n       Today, the Senate is engaged in another important battle on \n     one of the great causes of our time, and the cause of Ted \n     Kennedy's life--the battle to make health care not a \n     privilege for some, but a right for all. He has been so \n     sorely missed in this debate; especially now that we're \n     closer than we've ever been to passing real health reform. \n     But even though we took a critical step forward this week, \n     we've got more work to do. And I hope and believe that we \n     will continue to engage each other with the spirit of \n     civility and seriousness that has brought us this far--a \n     spirit that I think Teddy would have liked to see.\n       More than a half century ago, a Senate committee was set up \n     to choose the five greatest senators of all time. No, it \n     wasn't an exercise in the Senate's own vanity--it was because \n     there were five empty spaces designated for portraits in the \n     Senate Reception Room.\n       ``There are no standard tests to apply to a Senator,'' the \n     chairman of that committee wrote. ``No Dun & Bradstreet \n     rating, no scouting reports. His talents may vary with his \n     time; his contribution may be limited by his politics. To \n     judge his own true greatness, particularly in comparison with \n     his fellow senators long after they are all dead, is nearly \n     an impossible task.''\n       When John F. Kennedy wrote those words, I doubt that he \n     imagined his 25-year-old-brother would one day stand as \n     indisputably one of the finest senators of this or any age. \n     But here's the thing: Teddy--Teddy didn't earn that \n     distinction just because he served in the United States \n     Senate for nearly one out of every five days of its \n     existence. He earned it because each of those days was full, \n     and passionate, and productive, and advanced the life of this \n     nation in a way that few Americans ever have. And he did it \n     all by bridging the partisan divide again and again in an era \n     that someday may be recalled as one where bipartisanship was \n     too rare an achievement.\n       There will never be another like Ted Kennedy. But there \n     will be other great senators who follow in his footsteps. \n     That's not an insult to his legacy--it is, rather, the legacy \n     he sought to leave, both with this institute and with his \n     example.\n       ``Being a senator changes a person,'' he wrote in his \n     memoirs. ``Something fundamental and profound happens to you \n     when you arrive there, and it stays with you all the time \n     that you are privileged to serve. I have seen the changes in \n     people who have come into the Senate. It may take a year, or \n     two years, or three years, but it always happens: it fills \n     you with a heightened sense of purpose.''\n       In all our debates, through all our tests, over all the \n     years that are left to come--may we all be blessed with a \n     sense of purpose like Edward M. Kennedy's. Thank you, Vicki, \n     thanks to all of you. Thanks for making this such a success. \n     God bless you, God bless America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Ted Kennedy: A Life of Service\n\n                  (By Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.))\n\n       With the passing of Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), this \n     nation lost a great patriot, a force for justice and equality \n     and a passionate voice for a brighter future.\n       Sen. Kennedy was the beloved patriarch of a beautiful \n     family. At this moment of mourning, our thoughts and prayers \n     are with his loving, caring and devoted wife, Vicki; and with \n     his children, Kara, Teddy Jr. and our colleague Patrick. \n     Surely it was a highlight for both father and son to see the \n     Kennedy-Kennedy Mental Health Parity bill become law last \n     year--ending discriminatory treatment toward mental health \n     coverage--and a true tribute to the Kennedy family's \n     unyielding commitment to the common good.\n       Above all else, Sen. Kennedy was a champion--of the poor \n     and the oppressed, of the forgotten and the voiceless, of \n     young and old. Over a lifetime of leadership, Sen. Kennedy's \n     statesmanship, passionate arguments and political prowess \n     produced a wealth of accomplishment that expanded opportunity \n     for every American and extended the blessings of prosperity \n     to millions of his fellow citizens.\n       He had a grand vision for America and an unparalleled \n     ability to effect change and inspire others to devote \n     themselves to that change. And no one did more to educate our \n     children, care for our seniors and ensure equality for all \n     Americans.\n\n[[Page S10478]]\n\n       The reach of Sen. Kennedy's achievements extends far beyond \n     any one state, issue or group. And the light of his example \n     shone bright across lines of party or philosophy. Because of \n     his work, countless students can afford to reach for a \n     college diploma.\n       Because he returned to the Senate floor for one day last \n     July, once-fierce opponents of Medicare understood their \n     responsibility not to politics, but to the people they \n     serve--and today, America's seniors have a stronger and more \n     enduring safety net to keep them healthy.\n       Because he believed in the need for bold action to rescue \n     our economy, from his hospital bed he played a pivotal role \n     in ensuring the passage of the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act, putting people back to work and setting our \n     nation on the road to recovery. And because of his stirring \n     words of optimism, vitality and courage at the Democratic \n     convention exactly one year before he passed away, he laid a \n     foundation for the election of a president who shared his \n     ideals and intellect--and personified his vision of an \n     America where race was no longer a barrier or qualification.\n       Sen. Kennedy's deep faith remained a palpable force in his \n     life. It inspired his belief in social justice. It demanded \n     action on behalf of the least among us. It sustained him, and \n     offered a refuge from the spotlight of elected office. When \n     his daughter, Kara, was diagnosed with lung cancer, Sen. \n     Kennedy turned to his faith for solace, going to Mass each \n     morning in the same house of worship where his funeral \n     service will be conducted--a basilica that became a source of \n     hope and optimism for him in recent years.\n       Throughout his career, Ted Kennedy spoke of a new hope; of \n     holding fast to our ideals and fulfilling the promise of our \n     country. He carried on the legacy of an extraordinary \n     family--a family defined by service and a family that \n     inspired an entire generation, including myself, to take \n     action and to serve a cause greater than our individual \n     interests. And with the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act \n     now the law of the land, another generation of teachers and \n     volunteers, students and community organizers will put those \n     values into action.\n       Perhaps more than any other issue, Sen. Kennedy never \n     stopped fighting for what he called ``the cause of my \n     life''--ensuring quality, affordable healthcare for every \n     American. He believed it was a moral imperative. He viewed it \n     ``as a fundamental right, not a privilege.'' It is a tribute \n     to him--but really to the Americans for whom he fought every \n     day--that this dream will become reality this year.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                             One of a Kind\n\n  (By Rep. Dale E. Kildee (D-Mich.), Chairman of the Subcommittee on \n          Early Childhood, Elementary and Secondary Education)\n\n       I have a lot of acquaintances in Congress and many friends, \n     but one who stood out above the rest and to whom I always \n     felt close was Ted Kennedy. It was a privilege to know him as \n     a friend, and it was an honor to work with one of the most \n     dedicated and knowledgeable senators I ever met. His passing \n     is truly a great loss for our country. I am hopeful, however, \n     that in mourning his death, we will be inspired to continue \n     to fight for the causes to which he dedicated himself so \n     tirelessly and work together to pass the comprehensive \n     healthcare reform that he called ``the cause of my life.''\n       My relationship with the Kennedys started back in 1960 when \n     I was a volunteer on John F. Kennedy's campaign for president \n     and had the privilege of meeting his mother Rose, who was \n     nothing but gracious and kind. When Rose came to my hometown \n     of Flint, Mich., to campaign for her son, it was my \n     responsibility to get her to Mass at St. Michael's. It wasn't \n     even Sunday, but Rose went to Mass every day. I met John \n     later that year when he was campaigning for the presidency \n     and again in October of 1962 when he came to campaign for the \n     midterm congressional elections. Shortly thereafter he went \n     back to Washington claiming he had a ``bad cold,'' even \n     though he appeared to be the picture of health. We learned \n     later that we weren't completely misled, but that it was a \n     different kind of cold flaring up--the Cuban Missile Crisis, \n     one of the most heated moments of the Cold War.\n       Ted was the last member of the Kennedy family whom I \n     actually met, but my relationship with him lasted the \n     longest. Like his brothers, Ted was born into a life of \n     privilege, but instead of choosing a comfortable life of \n     leisure, he chose to work hard in the U.S. Senate, fighting \n     to improve the lives of American families. Ted successfully \n     fought to raise the minimum wage, protect Americans with \n     disabilities, expand health insurance for low-income children \n     and improve educational opportunities for all students, \n     regardless of family income. His legislative accomplishments \n     were so wide in scope that his work has changed the life of \n     nearly every American for the better.\n       Ted and I shared a passion to improve education and we \n     worked together often, particularly during the Head Start \n     Reauthorization of 2007, which he and I authored. During many \n     of the other conferences we worked on together, when \n     differences arose that were slowing down the passage of \n     legislation, Ted was a skilled and fair negotiator who would \n     keep the conversation going until late into the night to make \n     sure things were resolved. From Ted, I learned that \n     compromise is often necessary to achieve the greater good. \n     But above all, he taught me that we must never stop fighting \n     for what we believe in.\n       While Ted achieved greatness in his political life, he was \n     no stranger to personal tragedy and suffering. The country \n     mourned with him as first John and then Bobby were taken from \n     us in acts of violence, leaving Ted as the only remaining \n     Kennedy brother. A 1964 plane crash broke his back and left \n     him with terrible pain that plagued him for the rest of his \n     life, but he never let his condition get in the way of his \n     goals for the country. His discomfort was evident on the \n     trips he often took with me to Flint, where he always enjoyed \n     visiting Buick UAW Local 599. It was difficult for him to \n     stand for long, but he would patiently pose for pictures and \n     sign autographs for the workers there, who greeted him as a \n     hero. He would stay until his back became too painful and \n     then he would turn to me and say, ``Dale, you have to get me \n     out of here, now,'' and we would make a quick exit so he \n     could rest in my campaign van, which he referred to as the \n     ``Kildee Express.'' Even while in pain, he always had a smile \n     on his face and was an inspiration to those around him.\n       I have never known another senator like Ted Kennedy, and we \n     may never see another like him again. He carried on the torch \n     of his family's political legacy, masterfully reaching across \n     the aisle to shepherd important and often difficult pieces of \n     legislation through Congress. As we mourn the passing of our \n     friend Ted, let us celebrate his numerous achievements and \n     remember him for the great humanitarian and leader that he \n     was. Let us honor his memory by never giving up the fight for \n     social justice, never resting until every child has an equal \n     chance to learn, and never backing down until every American \n     has access to quality affordable healthcare. He often called \n     universal healthcare ``the cause of my life'' and it is a \n     tragedy that he will not be around to vote for the \n     legislation for which he fought so tirelessly. So let's \n     continue the fight in his honor and pass healthcare reform so \n     that all Americans, regardless of income, age or pre-existing \n     condition, will have access to quality, affordable \n     healthcare. Let's realize this dream for Ted and for America.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                 A Dedicated Servant and a Dear Friend\n\n    (By Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, former Secretary of the Interior)\n\n       As a very junior senator from Idaho, I selected an office \n     on the third floor of the Russell Building, which happened to \n     be next door to Sen. Ted Kennedy's office. The first day that \n     we were allowed to officially occupy the space, in came Sen. \n     Kennedy, walking through each of the offices and introducing \n     himself to all of my staff and welcoming each of them to the \n     Russell. Later that day, a beautiful bouquet of flowers \n     showed up for my wife, Patricia, with a note saying, \n     ``Welcome to the neighborhood--Ted.'' With that, Patricia and \n     I began a wonderful and enduring relationship with Ted and \n     Vicki Kennedy.\n       Our offices shared a common balcony, and I had a friend \n     from the Kennedy offices who used that route to come see me \n     every day . . . Blarney, his Jack Russell Terrier. I began \n     keeping a box of Milk Bones for Blarney's morning visits--and \n     he gladly accepted these treats. In his classical Boston \n     accent, Ted would pretend frustration with Blarney's habit of \n     taking the treats back down the balcony and eating them in \n     his office while leaving all the crumbs on his floor!\n       When I decided to come home to Idaho and run for governor, \n     Sen. Kennedy said he completely understood my decision. There \n     was no second-guessing why I would want to return to a \n     beautiful state like Idaho and be closer to the people there. \n     He wished me well and said that he would miss me. Little did \n     we both know that in 2006 President George W. Bush would \n     nominate me to become the 49th Secretary of the Interior. One \n     of the very first calls I received after the announcement was \n     from Ted Kennedy, who said he was so glad I was coming back \n     and he asked what he could do to help with my confirmation. \n     That was the kind of man he was and the kind of friend he \n     was. It didn't matter that I was a conservative Republican or \n     he was a liberal Democrat. We were friends, and he wanted to \n     help. And he did.\n       Several months later, I got another call from Ted Kennedy \n     telling me he had been invited to speak at the Ronald Reagan \n     Library. Nancy Reagan was going to host an intimate dinner \n     for him in her residence at the library and she said he could \n     invite a few friends. He was calling to see if I would go. \n     After extending the invitation, he started laughing and said, \n     ``What a pal I am, right? Inviting you to dinner 2,500 miles \n     from here!'' We both laughed, and I said I wouldn't miss it \n     for anything.\n       The night of the speech, I was seated in the front row \n     along with Nancy Reagan and California Gov. Arnold \n     Schwarzenegger. Sen. Kennedy commented on how three of his \n     favorite Republicans were there for him. I don't think many \n     people realize how much Ronald Reagan and Ted Kennedy liked \n     each other, but it was very apparent that night at the dinner \n     that Nancy gave for her friend, Ted, and his great wife \n     Vicki, and a few of their friends.\n       After Sen. Kennedy was diagnosed with his illness and it \n     was made public, I wrote him a two-page letter recapping some \n     of the positive and enjoyable things we had done together. I \n     received an immediate call from Vicki saying how it had \n     brightened his day. That was followed by a handwritten note \n     from Ted, and that was followed by a phone\n\n[[Page S10479]]\n\n     call from him. It was a good visit on the phone, but, as \n     usual, he also had some business he wanted to discuss. He \n     always worked so diligently for his constituents. I last \n     spoke to him in January of this year. It was that same jovial \n     voice of a friend with no hint of the personal health battle \n     he was fighting.\n       It is universally noted how hard he worked as a senator. He \n     also worked hard at affirming and maintaining friendships. \n     Wouldn't this be a better place if we all worked a little \n     harder at affirming and maintaining friendships? Perhaps \n     this, too, was one of Ted Kennedy's lasting legacies.\n       I will miss my friend.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                        In Memory of Ted Kennedy\n\n                           (By Nancy Reagan)\n\n       Sometimes the best friendships are made under unlikely \n     circumstances. Such was the case with the Kennedys and the \n     Reagans.\n       Of course there were differences in our political beliefs, \n     and some believed that those differences would make it \n     impossible for us to get along. Most people are very \n     surprised to learn that our families are actually quite \n     close.\n       Ted and I have corresponded regularly for years. He always \n     wrote lovely letters of support, encouragement and \n     appreciation. He phoned often--I'll never forget that he \n     managed to track me down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean \n     to wish me a happy birthday one year. I enjoyed working \n     together with him over the past few years on behalf of a \n     cause that was important to both of us, stem cell research.\n       As a Republican president and a Democratic senator, Ronnie \n     and Ted certainly had their battles. There were conflicts to \n     overcome, disagreements to settle and compromises to be made, \n     but in doing so, the mutual respect that came from struggling \n     to work together led to a deeper understanding and \n     friendship. Both were men of strong convictions, but they \n     understood an important principle: Politicians can disagree \n     without being disagreeable.\n       When Ronnie and I were presented with the Congressional \n     Gold Medal in 2002, Ted gave a beautiful tribute to Ronnie. \n     As I reread that speech today, I was struck by how some of \n     the wonderful things he said about Ronnie also describe Ted: \n     ``He was a fierce competitor who wanted to win--not just for \n     himself, but for his beliefs. He sought to defeat his \n     opponents, not destroy them. He taught us that while the \n     battle would inevitably resume the next morning, at the end \n     of each day we could put aside the divisions and the debates. \n     We could sit down together side by side . . . And above all, \n     whatever our differences, we were bound together by our love \n     of our country and its ideals.'' That was Ronnie, all right--\n     and that was Ted, too.\n       Ted and Ronnie were the kind of old-fashioned politicians \n     who could see beyond their own partisan convictions and work \n     together for the good of the country. I wish there were more \n     of that spirit in Washington today. I am encouraged to see \n     how many politicians ``from across the aisle'' spoke of their \n     admiration for Ted after his passing, so maybe it isn't \n     really lost. Maybe we can all be inspired by Ted and Ronnie \n     to renew that spirit of bipartisan cooperation.\n       Ted Kennedy was a kind man, a great ally and dear friend. I \n     will miss him.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Kennedy and the GOP: A Marriage of Mutual Respect\n\n                         (By J. Taylor Rushing)\n\n       Despite his affinity for liberal policymaking, Republicans \n     on Capitol Hill greatly admired Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-\n     Mass.).\n       ``He's a legislator's legislator,'' Sen. Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.) \n     told The Hill last May, immediately after Kennedy's diagnosis \n     of brain cancer. ``At the end of the day, he wants to \n     legislate, he understands how, and he understands compromise. \n     And it's worth talking about because it shows how people with \n     drastically different points of view can come together.''\n       In April, The Hill conducted a survey of all sitting \n     senators to ask which member of the opposing party they most \n     enjoyed working with. The most common answer among \n     Republicans was Kennedy, being specifically mentioned by Kyl, \n     Orrin Hatch of Utah, Kit Bond of Missouri, Richard Burr of \n     North Carolina, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Mike Enzi of \n     Wyoming, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Jeff Sessions of \n     Alabama.\n       ``I'd love to co-sponsor every piece of legislation with \n     Ted Kennedy,'' Burr said at the time. ``When Ted says he's \n     going to do something, he's committed to it.''\n       Kennedy's 47 years in the Senate began as his brother, \n     Democrat John F. Kennedy, was president and were marked by a \n     legislative record of liberalism long and prominent enough to \n     earn him his ``Liberal Lion'' moniker. Republican Party \n     leaders even used him as a fundraising tool for years in \n     races across the country.\n       In the Senate itself, though, the Massachusetts senator was \n     mostly known by Republicans for his bipartisanship--for \n     diligent, patient and consistent reaching across the aisle to \n     find common ground on the country's most pressing concerns. \n     Eventually, some of the chamber's most conservative \n     Republicans, from Alan Simpson of Wyoming to Hatch to Kyl, \n     came to discover that while Kennedy may have had the heart of \n     a liberal, he possessed the mind of a pragmatist.\n       Republican leaders such as Conference Chairman Lamar \n     Alexander of Tennessee recalled that Kennedy was known for \n     reaching out since his earliest days in Congress. Alexander \n     came to Congress in 1967 as an aide to then-Sen. Howard Baker \n     of Tennessee and worked with Kennedy near the end of his \n     first term.\n       ``I've known and worked with him for 40 years. He's \n     results-oriented. He takes his positions, but he sits down \n     and gets results,'' Alexander said last May.\n       In recent years, examples of Kennedy's bipartisan efforts \n     included teaming up with Kansas Republican Nancy Kassebaum on \n     healthcare in 1996, with President George W. Bush on \n     education reform in 2001, and on unsuccessful attempts with \n     Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and other Republicans to pass \n     immigration reform in the 110th and 111th Congresses.\n                                  ____\n\n\n            Kennedy Brought Intensity, Passion to the Senate\n\n                            (By Jim Manley)\n\n       Coming from a wealthy, famous family, Sen. Kennedy could \n     have taken shortcuts. But he never did that--he brought a \n     passion and intensity to his work the likes of which I will \n     never forget.\n       His staff accepted the long hours and dedication he \n     demanded from us because he stood with us working twice as \n     hard.\n       Former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell (D-Maine) \n     once accurately remarked that Sen. Kennedy was better-\n     prepared than any other senator. His No Child Left Behind \n     briefing book was legendary--a huge binder full of studies \n     and analyses. It seemed every page was dog-eared, heavily \n     underlined and carefully tabbed.\n       One Friday, there was a lull in a debate over a minimum-\n     wage increase. On pure impulse, he went to the Senate floor \n     and delivered one of the most impassioned speeches I had ever \n     heard from him. At one point, he voice echoed through the \n     chamber so loud that I had to leave the floor because my ears \n     were ringing.\n       As Sen. Kennedy said of his brother Robert, the same can be \n     said of him. He ``need not be idealized, or enlarged in death \n     beyond what he was in life, to be remembered simply as a good \n     and decent man, who saw wrong and tried to right it, saw \n     suffering and tried to heal it, saw war and tried to stop \n     it.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    Bayh Remembers 1964 Plane Crash\n\n                         (By J. Taylor Rushing)\n\n       If not for former Sen. Birch Bayh of Indiana, Sen. Edward \n     Kennedy very well may have died on the night of June 19, \n     1964.\n       Both nearly died in a plane crash the night the Senate \n     passed the 1964 Civil Rights Act. Delayed by the vote, the \n     two men were flying through a thunderstorm to get to the \n     Massachusetts state Democratic convention.\n       ``We were bounced around so much we couldn't see the moon \n     in any steady way,'' said Bayh, who served in the Senate from \n     1963 to 1981 and is now a partner in the D.C. law firm \n     Venable LLP. ``Then I looked out and saw this black line \n     coming. I thought it was another storm, but it was the tops \n     of trees.''\n       Pilot Ed Zimy pulled out of the trees but quickly lost \n     control again, crashing into an apple orchard just short of \n     the Springfield airport. Bayh said he thought the plane had \n     been hit by lightning, and was convinced he was dead. When he \n     woke up, Bayh said, his wife Marvella was screaming, the \n     pilot and Kennedy aide Ed Moss were both mortally wounded and \n     Kennedy was barely responsive.\n       Bayh said he resisted initial thoughts of leaving Kennedy \n     in the wreckage, but was later amazed at how he carried the \n     hefty senator.\n       ``We've all heard adrenaline stories about how a mother can \n     lift a car off a trapped infant. Well, Kennedy was no small \n     guy, and I was able to lug him out of there like a sack of \n     corn under my arm,'' Bayh said.\n       Kennedy spent five months in the hospital, re-emerging \n     barely in time to win reelection in November 1964.\n       ``A lot of the older senators were wondering if they were \n     going to have to kiss his ring. I mean, he could have been a \n     pariah,'' Bayh said. ``But he had no airs, and just did a \n     remarkable job of ingratiating himself not only to his new \n     colleagues but the older members.\n       ``He was a Kennedy, and you could say he was born with a \n     silver spoon in his mouth, but he was determined to spend his \n     life helping the little people. That tells you what he was \n     made of.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n           Boehner Found Kennedy a Generous Partner in Faith\n\n                         (By Christina Wilkie)\n\n       Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) needed a favor.\n       In 2003, Boehner wanted to support Washington's Catholic \n     schools, which were suffering severe budget shortfalls. He \n     needed an A-list Democrat willing to lend his name to the \n     effort.\n       What he got instead was access to one of the most powerful \n     Democratic fundraising machines in politics.\n       The GOP congressman was setting up a gala dinner complete \n     with celebrities, politicos and media personalities. He went \n     for the most powerful Catholic in Congress, Sen. Edward \n     Kennedy (D-Mass.), to be his partner at the event and balance \n     the politics.\n       Presented with Boehner's request to co-chair the inaugural \n     gala dinner, Kennedy ``didn't blink'' before signing on; and \n     true to his reputation for generosity, Kennedy's response \n     went well beyond that.\n       Kennedy threw himself into the project, offering Boehner \n     the use of his entire fundraising staff to assist with the \n     event. He\n\n[[Page S10480]]\n\n     wrote letters and made personal appeals on behalf of the \n     struggling schools. And perhaps most importantly, Kennedy \n     pulled in real talent: NBC's Tim Russert to emcee the \n     inaugural evening and comedian Bill Cosby to keep the guests \n     laughing.\n       Boehner and Kennedy were both lifelong Catholics and \n     graduates of Catholic schools. They had recently worked \n     together on the House and Senate versions, respectively, of \n     the 2002 education law known as the No Child Left Behind Act.\n       As colleagues, they enjoyed a comfortable rapport, which, \n     according to a staff member, was strengthened by the fact \n     that ``Boehner and Kennedy always knew what the other had to \n     do to get legislation passed.''\n       This dinner was no exception. It marked the start of a \n     five-year collaboration between two men who served radically \n     different constituencies, but who found common ground in \n     their shared commitment to education, service and their \n     faith.\n       Both lawmakers also believed they had an obligation to give \n     back to the citizens of Washington, their ``adopted city.'' \n     To help illustrate this point, each year at a pre-gala \n     breakfast Kennedy would share the example of his brother, \n     former President John F. Kennedy, who instructed his entire \n     Cabinet to visit Washington's public schools and read books \n     to the students.\n       Dubbed the Boehner-Kennedy Dinner, the annual event takes \n     place each September, and since its inception has raised more \n     than $5 million for the District's Catholic schools.\n       Much of the credit for this success belongs to Kennedy. As \n     one Boehner staff member told The Hill, ``This event may have \n     been John Boehner's idea, but it was Sen. Kennedy who really \n     got it off the ground.''\n       During the last year of his life, Kennedy's illness forced \n     him to scale back his commitments. As a result, former \n     Washington Mayor Anthony Williams assumed the co-chairman's \n     role alongside Boehner in 2008.\n       This year's Boehner-Williams Dinner will be held on Sept. \n     23 at the Washington Hilton. Discussions are under way about \n     how best to honor Kennedy at the event.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     Tributes to Edward M.

Ted \n     Kennedy last night. Ted Kennedy will be remembered with great \n     affection and enduring respect here in Ireland. Ted Kennedy \n     was a great friend of Ireland.\n       In good days and bad, Ted Kennedy worked valiantly for the \n     cause of peace on this island. He played a particularly \n     important role in the formative days of the Northern Ireland \n     Peace Process. He maintained a strong and genuine interest in \n     its progress. He used his political influence wisely. He was \n     the voice of moderation and common sense. He was unequivocal \n     in his rejection of violence at all times and from all \n     quarters. He believed that only politics would provide a \n     sustainable and enduring way forward. His belief that the \n     United States could play a strong role in solving our \n     problems has been vindicated by the success of the Peace \n     Process.\n       Today, America has lost a great and respected statesman and \n     Ireland has lost a long-standing and true friend.\n       Ar dheis De go raibh a anam.--Brian Cowen, prime minister \n     of Ireland\n                                  ____\n\n       Sen. Edward Kennedy will be mourned not just in America but \n     in every continent. He is admired around the world as the \n     Senator of Senators. He led the world in championing \n     children's education and health care, and believed that every \n     single child should have the chance to realise their \n     potential to the full. Even facing illness and death he never \n     stopped fighting for the causes which were his life's work.\n       I am proud to have counted him as a friend and proud that \n     the United Kingdom recognised his service earlier this year \n     with the award of an honorary knighthood.--Gordon Brown, \n     prime minister of the United Kingdom\n                                  ____\n\n       I'm not sure America has ever had a greater senator, but I \n     know for certain that no one has had a greater friend than I \n     and so many others did in Ted Kennedy.\n       I will always remember Teddy as the ultimate example for \n     all of us who seek to serve, a hero for those Americans in \n     the shadow of life who so desperately needed one.\n       He worked tirelessly to lift Americans out of poverty, \n     advance the cause of civil rights, and provide opportunity to \n     all. He fought to the very end for the cause of his life--\n     ensuring that all Americans have the health care they need.\n       The commitment to build a stronger and fairer America, a \n     more perfect union, was deeply ingrained in the fiber of who \n     he was, and what he believed in, and why he served.\n       That's why he stands among the most respected senators in \n     history. But it was his sympathetic ear, his razor wit, and \n     his booming, raucous laugh that made him among the most \n     beloved.\n       Whatever tragedy befell Teddy's family, he would always be \n     there for them. Whatever tragedy befell the family of one of \n     his friends, he would always be there for us.--Sen. Chris \n     Dodd (D-Conn.), a close friend who in Kennedy's absence took \n     over the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (HELP) \n     Committee\n                                  ____\n\n       I had hoped and prayed that this day would never come. My \n     heart and soul weep at the lost of my best friend in the \n     Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy.\n       Sen. Kennedy and I both witnessed too many wars in our \n     lives, and believed too strongly in the Constitution of the \n     United States to allow us to go blindly into war. That is why \n     we stood side by side in the Senate against the war in Iraq.\n       Neither years of age nor years of political combat, nor his \n     illness, diminished the idealism and energy of this talented, \n     imaginative, and intelligent man. And that is the kind of \n     Sen. Ted Kennedy was. Throughout his career, Sen. Kennedy \n     believed in a simple premise: that our society's greatness \n     lies in its ability and willingness to provide for its less \n     fortunate members. Whether striving to increase the minimum \n     wage, ensuring that all children have medical insurance, or \n     securing better access to higher education, Sen. Kennedy \n     always showed that he cares deeply for those whose needs \n     exceed their political clout. Unbowed by personal setbacks or \n     by the terrible sorrows that have fallen upon his family, his \n     spirit continued to soar, and he continued to work as hard as \n     ever to make his dreams a reality.\n       In his honor and as a tribute to his commitment to his \n     ideals, let us stop the shouting and name calling and have a \n     civilized debate on health care reform which I hope, when \n     legislation has been signed into law, will bear his name for \n     his commitment to insuring the health of every American.\n       God bless his wife Vicki, his family, and the institution \n     that he served so ably, which will never be the same without \n     his voice of eloquence and reason. And God bless you Ted. I \n     love you and will miss you terribly. In my autobiography I \n     wrote that during a visit to West Virginia in 1968 to help \n     dedicate the ``Robert F. Kennedy Youth Center'' in \n     Morgantown, ``Sen. Kennedy's voice quivered with emotion as \n     he talked of his late brothers and their love for West \n     Virginia. `These hills, these people, and this state have had \n     a very special meaning for my family. Our lives have been \n     tightly intertwined with yours.'\n       I am sure the people of the great state of West Virginia \n     join me in expressing our heartfelt condolences to the \n     Kennedy family at this moment of deep sorrow--Sen.

When I first came to the United States \n     Senate I was filled with conservative fire in my belly and an \n     itch to take on any and everyone who stood in my way, \n     including Ted Kennedy. As I began working within the confines \n     of my office I soon found out that while we almost always \n     disagreed on most issues, once in a while we could actually \n     get together and find the common ground, which is essential \n     in passing legislation.--Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), one of \n     Kennedy's closest Republican friends in the Senate\n                                  ____\n\n       He had a gregarious personality. He had a keen sense of how \n     to position himself with people. He had an old Irish wit and \n     was a great storyteller. But all of those things probably \n     pale in--in comparison to the fact that once he was on an \n     issue, he was relentless. And he--once he gave his word, then \n     there was never any--any variance from that, to the point \n     where he would cast votes on amendments that really were \n     against his own position in order to keep a carefully crafted \n     compromise intact. And when others from his own party and our \n     party didn't do that, I've seen him chastise them rather \n     severely.\n       History judges all of us. And after a period of time, I \n     think history will make a judgment about Ted Kennedy. All of \n     us had our failings and weaknesses. But the fact is that Ted \n     Kennedy was an institution within the institution of the \n     Senate. And all of my colleagues, no matter how they felt \n     about his causes or his positions, I think, would agree with \n     that.--Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who often referred to \n     Kennedy as a ``good friend'', talked about what made the \n     liberal senator likable to his GOP adversaries, about their \n     time working together on immigration legislation and about \n     his spirit in the end, in an interview with CNN's ``Larry \n     King Live'' on Thursday\n                                  ____\n\n       We have known for some time that this day was coming, but \n     nothing makes it easier. We have lost a great light in our \n     lives and our politics, and it will never be the same again. \n     Ted Kennedy was such an extraordinary force, yes for the \n     issues he cared about, but more importantly for the humanity \n     and caring in our politics that is at the center of faith and \n     true public service. No words can ever do justice to this \n     irrepressible, larger than life presence who was simply the \n     best--the best senator, the best advocate you could ever hope \n     for, the best colleague, and the best person to stand by your \n     side in the toughest of times. He faced the last challenge of \n     his life with the same grace, courage, and determination with \n     which he fought for the causes and principles he held so \n     dear. He taught us how to fight, how to laugh, how to treat \n     each other, and how to turn idealism into action, and in \n     these last fourteen months he taught us much more about how \n     to live life, sailing into the wind one last time. For almost \n     25 years, I was privileged to serve as his colleague and \n     share his friendship for which I will always be grateful.--\n     Sen.

In the Senate, Ted Kennedy was \n     our sun--the center of our universe. To be pulled by his \n     strong gravitational field, to bask in his warmth was a \n     privilege, an honor, and, for many of us, even a life \n     changing experience. His death leaves our world dark but, as \n     he said in his own words, ``the work goes on, the cause \n     endures, the hope still lives, and the dream shall never \n     die.''

He was \n     one of the most dynamic and influential legislators in our \n     Nation's history, and his legacy will live on in the work of \n     the colleagues he inspired, and in the lives of the millions \n     of Americans for whom his passion for social justice made a \n     difference. My thoughts and prayers are with his family and \n     friends; even though this day was anticipated, I am sure that \n     little can soften the blow. Throughout his final illness, \n     Sen. Kennedy was privileged to have the best doctors and the \n     best treatment. But he never forgot, in this as in all cases, \n     those who were not similarly privileged: those waiting hours \n     in emergency rooms this morning for a doctor's care; those \n     who went to sleep last night unsure that they were covered, \n     uncertain that their families could cope with the financial \n     burden of an illness. For their sake, health care reform was \n     the cause of Ted Kennedy's life. For their sake, and his, it \n     must be the cause of ours.--House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer \n     (D-Md.)\n                                  ____\n\n       I have known Ted Kennedy for more than 47 years. In that \n     time, it has been my greatest pleasure to work with him in \n     the Congress to try to tackle many human problems, but I am \n     especially gratified by his contributions to the cause of \n     civil rights and voting rights.\n       At some of the most tragic and difficult moments in this \n     nation's history, Ted Kennedy gathered his strength and led \n     us toward a more hopeful future. As a nation and as a people, \n     he encouraged us to build upon the inspirational leadership \n     of his two brothers and use it to leave a legacy of social \n     transformation that has left its mark on history.--Rep.

In 1994, I \n     joined the long list of those who ran against Ted and came up \n     short. But he was the kind of man you could like even if he \n     was your adversary.

Mr. President, just a month ago, I joined \nfellow Coloradans, my colleagues in the U.S. Congress, and others \nacross the country to celebrate and acknowledge the many \naccomplishments and contributions of the Hispanic community in the \nUnited States and Colorado. I am particularly proud to highlight the \nlong history of Hispanics in Colorado, as they established some of \nColorado's oldest communities, irrigation systems, and earliest \nbusinesses. I am equally proud that this community continues to be a \nvibrant part of the fabric of our great State.\n  Throughout this month, my colleagues and I have been hard at work to \nmove forward on many policy concerns that are vitally important to \nColorado's Hispanic community. From the confirmation of America's first \nLatina Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor, to progress on health \ninsurance reform, and continued support for efforts to create and save \njobs, I have been working with the best interests of Colorado in mind. \nStill, there is much to be accomplished.\n  We must come together to find opportunities to improve the quality of \nlife of all Coloradans. In doing so, it is important to keep in mind \nthat certain populations, such as Latinos, are disproportionately \naffected by many of the challenges we face as a State and country. At a \nnational level, Latinos face an unemployment rate that is 3 percent \nhigher than the national rate. In Colorado, Latinos face a poverty rate \nthat is 12 percent higher than the State's overall poverty rate. \nLatinos also face other challenges--40 percent of Hispanics in Colorado \nare uninsured, approximately 24 percent higher than the State average, \naccording to a Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment \nreport. Though these issues are not a concern for Latinos in Colorado \nalone, they undoubtedly raise heightened concerns for the Hispanic \ncommunity, given these statistics.\n  These are just a few reasons I have continued to support and develop \npolicies that provide both quality jobs and help reduce the costs of \nhard-working Coloradans. Most notably, we have made significant \nprogress toward reforming our health insurance system so that it better \nmeets the health needs of all Americans. Making our health system more \nefficient, fiscally manageable, and accessible is vitally important to \nmaking health insurance more affordable for Hispanic and non-Hispanic \nfamilies alike.\n  As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I \nhave also been working to develop new ways to help low-income and \nworking families afford to make their homes more energy efficient. By \nimproving access to energy-saving technology and making homes more \nenergy efficient, families can reduce their energy costs, while helping \nto make our environment and communities better places to live. This is \njust one part of a new energy economy that can bring more jobs to our \nState.\n  We have had much to celebrate during this year's Hispanic Heritage \nMonth, but we also have much to do, and I understand there are many \nmore goals that we have yet to achieve. So while we have enjoyed the \ncelebration of Hispanic heritage and the contributions Latinos make in \nour communities over the last month, I will continue my efforts to \nimprove the quality of life for Coloradans of all backgrounds in every \nmonth of the year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10482-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10482-S10483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  20TH ANNIVERSARY OF POINTS OF LIGHT\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I stand today to recognize and honor an \nextraordinary organization that began its important work 20 years ago, \nborn from the words of a new President who was dedicated to engaging \nthe American spirit of giving and service. The words of that President \nresonate even now: ``I have spoken of a thousand points of light . . . \na new engagement in the lives of others, a new activism, hands-on and \ninvolved that gets the job done.'' This 1989 speech given by President \nGeorge H.W. Bush outlined the vision for the Points of Light \nFoundation, now merged with HandsOn Network as the Points of Light \nInstitute, the largest volunteer network in the country.\n  This independent, nonpartisan organization has worked to encourage, \nrecognize, and empower the spirit of volunteer service that is encoded \nin our Nation's cultural DNA and is, as President Bush stated, central \nto living a meaningful life.\n  Throughout our Nation's history, Americans have demonstrated their \nwillingness to give back and to serve in their communities, even in the \nhardest of times. Last year alone, over 60 million Americans performed \nvolunteer service in this country. I am proud that my home State of \nUtah had the highest volunteerism rate, with over 45 percent of adults \nvolunteering in the State in 2008. All told, these volunteers \ncontributed almost 162 million hours of service in a single year.\n  Earlier this year, I had the privilege of joining with my good \nfriend, the late Senator Ted Kennedy in sponsoring the Edward M. \nKennedy Serve America Act, a new law that expands volunteer \nopportunities for Americans of all ages. I know that the Points of \nLight Institute will be at the forefront in realizing the full \npotential of this important legislation, creating healthy communities \nby inspiring and equipping\n\n[[Page S10483]]\n\nwilling Americans to do more of the heavy lifting in their communities \nas we all work to improve our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I once again commend the Points of Light Institute on \nthis landmark anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10483-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10483]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LAURA RHEA\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that \ntoday I honor and recognize more than 25 years of service by Laura Rhea \nto our great State of Arkansas. Laura has served the Arkansas Rice \nDepot with steadfast leadership as President and CEO, ensuring the \norganization remained a faith-based ministry and developing innovative \nsolutions to ending hunger.\n  Hunger and poverty are not just global issues; they are so pervasive \nthat we all have some experience with them in our local communities. \nWorldwide, three billion people, nearly half the world's population, \nlive on merely $2 per day. In our Nation alone, almost 36.2 million \nAmericans struggle day in and day out to find adequate nutritious food. \nMore than 12.4 million children live in households that are food \ninsecure. According to the Arkansas Hunger Relief Alliance, \napproximately 80 percent of supplemental nutrition assistance goes to \nhouseholds with children, many of them in working families, including \nmilitary families.\n  In Arkansas, Laura Rhea has been making a difference to reduce those \nfigures. Under her leadership, Arkansas Rice Depot has grown from a \nsmall hunger program that distributed only rice, to a comprehensive \nhunger agency that distributes almost 7 million pounds of food and \nsupplies in Arkansas each year.\n  Laura grew up in North Little Rock. As a child she dreamed of \nbecoming a missionary, but never dreamed that her mission field would \nbe feeding hungry Arkansans. She is a certified volunteer manager and \nwas recognized as a certified fund raising executive in 1995.\n  Laura developed Food for Kids, a backpack program serving over 600 \nschools in Arkansas, sending home backpacks of food to over 25,000 \nstudents who face food insecurity. This program has been recognized by \nthe Wall Street Journal, CNN, and has been replicated in over 40 \nStates.\n  Laura also developed Simple Pleasures, a gourmet gift shop that sells \nthe Rice Depot line of soup and chili mixes. Proceeds from the gift \nshop are used to purchase food for Rice Depot's hunger relief efforts.\n  Faith is an important part of Laura's life. In 2003, Laura suffered a \nheatstroke unloading a truck. Although she would continue to serve her \nlife's mission from a wheelchair, she is not limited by her disability. \nShe often quotes Psalms 37:11 to sum up her life, ``Delight yourself in \nthe Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart.''\n  And last but certainly not least, Laura's family--her husband Don, \ndaughter Allison, and four grandchildren are not only inspirations for \nher but also stalwart supporters. In fact, her daughter Allison shares \nher mother's mission and has served the Rice Depot for the past 12 \nyears. In addition, Laura's granddaughter worked there over the summer, \nbringing three generations of her family to the effort to wipe out \nhunger.\n  As you can see, Laura Rhea is a generous, compassionate, and \ndedicated individual.

On October 20, 2009, the Howard County \nDemocratic Central Committee is sponsoring a dinner to honor his \nlifelong public service to Arkansas and his country.\n  The day after Christmas in 1948, Westbrook set out with newly elected \nCongressman Boyd Tackett of Nashville for Washington, DC. Over the \ncourse of the next 26 years, Parker served his home State in our \nNation's Capital for four members of the Arkansas congressional \ndelegation, most notably as a special assistant to U.S. Senator J. \nWilliam Fulbright. In 1975, he returned to Arkansas and served as a \nspecial assistant to Governor David Pryor.\n  Although public service in government was a calling for much of Mr. \nWestbrook's life, his true passion was historic preservation. Westbrook \nwas born in 1926 and was the third generation of the Westbrook-Parker \nfamilies to live in the home of his maternal grandfather, which is \nlisted on the National Register of Historic Places. The house and \nfarmstead provided Parker with an early appreciation for historic \npreservation, and after leaving Washington in 1974, he set out on a \ncourse to help preserve Arkansas's cultural legacy.\n  While working for Governor Pryor, Westbrook was elected to the \nPioneer Washington Foundation, Inc. Board, a private nonprofit group \ncommitted to preserving Historic Washington. Washington, AR, is home to \nthe oldest continuous post office in Arkansas, established on February \n23, 1820 shortly after Arkansas became a territory. In 1979, Westbrook \nbecame a full-time volunteer and restoration adviser. In 1980, he \nbecame the executive director and was elected president of the \nfoundation in 1990. He continued in that role until May of this year.\n  In 1975, Westbrook was elected to the Historic Arkansas Museum Board \nof Directors and has served that organization continuously for 34 \nyears. For many years, he was chairman and now holds the title of \nchairman emeritus.\n  Westbrook was also appointed to the Arkansas State Review Board of \nthe Historic Preservation Program in 1975. He was reappointed three \ntimes by Governor Bill Clinton and again by Governor Jim Guy Tucker and \nserved as chairman for 4\\1/2\\ years.\n  In addition, Westbrook has served on a number of other Arkansas \nhistoric entities including the Historic Preservation Alliance of \nArkansas, Department of Arkansas Heritage Advisory Board, the President \nWilliam J. Clinton Birthplace Foundation, Corinth Cemetery Association \nin Howard County, Friends of the Carousel, and Main Street Arkansas \nAdvisory Board.\n  He has been awarded the Arkansas Historical Association's Endowed \nHistory Award and was recognized in 1986 as Arkansas's Distinguished \nCitizen for his volunteer work.\n  In 1995, President Clinton recognized Westbrook's longstanding \nservice to historic preservation and appointed him to the President's \nCouncil for Historic Preservation where he served until 2003.\n  In addition, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbit twice appointed Parker \nto the National Park System Advisory Board where he served as chairman \nof the Committee on National Historic Landmarks.\n  As you can see, Parker Westbrook has a long and distinguished career \nserving his community, Arkansas, and our Nation.\n  As the Howard County Democratic Central Committee recognizes Mr. \nWestbrook's service, I extend my sincere thanks and appreciation on \nbehalf of all Arkansans for his devotion and commitment to public \nservice throughout his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10483-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10483-S10484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  275TH ANNIVERSARY OF FIRST CONGREGATIONAL CHURCH, UNITED CHURCH OF \n                                 CHRIST\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the First \nCongregational Church, United Church of Christ of South Portland, ME, \non the momentous occasion of its 275th anniversary. What a tremendous \nmilestone and enduring testament to the church's centuries of spiritual \nleadership and goodwill.\n  Established in 1733, the church held its inaugural worship service in \n1734 and has, through its steady growth and exemplary commitment to \nothers, expanded its ministries, championed education for all, and \nengendered an abiding sense of fellowship for literally hundreds of \nyears. Although the physical buildings of worship may have changed over \ntime, the church's fundamental mission--to foster its congregation's \nspiritual life while offering outreach to others through words and \nactions--has not wavered.\n  Although this church's history and time-honored presence within the\n\n[[Page S10484]]\n\nSouth Portland area are truly remarkable, the First Congregational \nChurch, United Church of Christ concentrates its energies and attention \non its current and future role within the greater community--to serve \nmembers of its congregation and people whose lives are enriched by the \ninteraction of the ministry, the congregants, and the faith that binds \nthem to a benevolence of purpose that is an inspiration to all.\n  Through such practical programs as the Discovery Center preschool, \nthe Community Crisis Ministries Program, the Mission and Outreach \nTeam--which offer soup kitchen and food pantry assistance--and the \nSocial Witness Ministries that address current sociocultural and \nenvironmental challenges, this church truly extends its reach beyond \nits walls in the selfless quest to contribute to others.\n  As 2009 represents a monumental moment of celebration in the life of \nthe First Congregational Church, United Church of Christ, I wish to \noffer my heartfelt congratulations and profound gratitude to all who \nhave sustained the dynamic work of this church in centuries past and \nwho will do so for many more years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10484-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10484-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10484-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:46 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1327.

A bill to direct the Secretary of Labor to issue an \noccupational safety and health standard to reduce injuries to patients, \ndirect-care registered nurses, and all other health care workers by \nestablishing a safe patient handling and injury prevention standard, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to help \nkeep our country's invaluable nurses and health care workers safe from \ndebilitating injuries suffered on the job. This legislation will \nrequire workplace standards that eliminate the manual lifting of \npatients--the primary cause of musculoskeletal disorders in the health \ncare profession. And I want to first thank my colleague in the House, \nRepresentative Conyers of Michigan's l4th District, for his leadership \non this issue and for the impressive work he put into crafting this \nbill.\n  When we think of dangerous working conditions, mines or construction \nsites might come to mind. But in fact, work performed in hospitals and \nnursing homes contributes to thousands of cases of musculoskeletal \ndisorders in nurses and health care workers each year. These injuries \nrequire time away from work, and unfortunately, many workers suffering \nfrom chronic back injury are forced to leave the profession \npermanently. Nurses and health care workers deserve better--they \nshouldn't have to sacrifice their safety and their livelihood to help \nothers, especially when many of these injuries could be prevented.\n  The manual lifting of patients is the primary cause of \nmusculoskeletal injuries, and can be eliminated with the use of lifting \nequipment. Many health care facilities already have this equipment \navailable, and studies have shown that it reduces injuries to workers, \nincreases safety for patients, and is a cost-effective investment over \nseveral years.\n  This legislation would require the Department of Labor to propose \nstandards for safe patient handling to prevent musculoskeletal \ndisorders for health care workers, and eliminate manual lifting of \npatients through the use of lift equipment. It would also require \nhealth care facilities to develop safe patient handling plans and \nprovide training on safe patient handling techniques.\n  Under the bill, health care workers would have the right to refuse \nassignments that are not in compliance with safe patient handling \nstandards and be protected from employer retaliation against workers \nwho refuse these assignments or report violations.\n  To help health care facilities to make this transition, the bill \ncreates a new grant program for needy health care facilities that \nrequire financial assistance to purchase safe patient handling \nequipment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Nurse and Health Care Worker \nProtection Act. All of us benefit from the services these professionals \nprovide, and by passing this legislation, we can help ensure they are \nable to safely continue in their important careers.\n\n[[Page S10489]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of this bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1788\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE; FINDINGS; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Nurse and \n     Health Care Worker Protection Act of 2009''.\n       (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 2007, direct-care registered nurses ranked seventh \n     among all occupations for the number of cases of \n     musculoskeletal disorders resulting in days away from work--\n     8,580 total cases. Nursing aides, orderlies, and attendants \n     sustained 24,340 musculoskeletal disorders in 2007, the \n     second highest of any occupation. The leading cause of these \n     injuries in health care are the result of patient lifting, \n     transferring, and repositioning injuries.\n       (2) The physical demands of the nursing profession lead \n     many nurses to leave the profession. Fifty-two percent of \n     nurses complain of chronic back pain and 38 percent suffer \n     from pain severe enough to require leave from work. Many \n     nurses and other health care workers suffering back injury do \n     not return to work.\n       (3) Patients are not at optimum levels of safety while \n     being lifted, transferred, or repositioned manually. \n     Mechanical lift programs can substantially reduce skin tears \n     suffered by patients and the frequency of patients being \n     dropped, thus allowing patients a safer means to progress \n     through their care.\n       (4) The development of assistive patient handling equipment \n     and devices has essentially rendered the act of strict manual \n     patient handling unnecessary as a function of nursing care.\n       (5) A growing number of health care facilities have \n     incorporated patient handling technology and have reported \n     positive results. Injuries among nursing staff have \n     dramatically declined since implementing patient handling \n     equipment and devices. As a result, the number of lost work \n     days due to injury and staff turnover has declined. Studies \n     have also shown that assistive patient handling technology \n     successfully reduces workers' compensation costs for \n     musculoskeletal disorders.\n       (6) Establishing a safe patient handling and injury \n     prevention standard for direct-care registered nurses and \n     other health care workers is a critical component in \n     protecting nurses and other health care workers, addressing \n     the nursing shortage, and increasing patient safety.\n       (c) Table of Contents.--The table of contents of this Act \n     is as follows:\n\nSec. 1. Short title; findings; table of contents.\nSec. 2. Safe patient handling and injury prevention standard.\nSec. 3. Protection of direct-care registered nurses and health care \n              workers.\nSec. 4.

SAFE PATIENT HANDLING AND INJURY PREVENTION STANDARD.\n\n       (a) Rulemaking.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Labor, shall, \n     pursuant to section 6 of the Occupational Safety and Health \n     Act of 1970 (29 U.S.C. 655), propose a standard on safe \n     patient handling and injury prevention (in this section such \n     standard referred to as the ``safe patient handling and \n     injury prevention standard'') under such section to prevent \n     musculoskeletal disorders for direct-care registered nurses \n     and all other health care workers handling patients in health \n     care facilities. A final safe patient handling and injury \n     prevention standard shall be promulgated not later than 2 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Requirements.--The safe patient handling and injury \n     prevention standard shall require the use of engineering \n     controls to perform lifting, transferring, and repositioning \n     of patients and the elimination of manual lifting of patients \n     by direct-care registered nurses and all other health care \n     workers, through the use of mechanical devices to the \n     greatest degree feasible except where the use of safe patient \n     handling practices can be demonstrated to compromise patient \n     care. The standard shall apply to all health care employers \n     and shall require at least the following:\n       (1) Each health care employer to develop and implement a \n     safe patient handling and injury prevention plan within 6 \n     months of the date of promulgation of the final standard, \n     which plan shall include hazard identification, risk \n     assessments, and control measures in relation to patient care \n     duties and patient handling.\n       (2) Each health care employer to purchase, use, maintain, \n     and have accessible an adequate number of safe lift \n     mechanical devices not later than 2 years after the date of \n     issuance of a final regulation establishing such standard.\n       (3) Each health care employer to obtain input from direct-\n     care registered nurses, health care workers, and employee \n     representatives of direct-care registered nurses and health \n     care workers in developing and implementing the safe patient \n     handling and injury prevention plan, including the purchase \n     of equipment.\n       (4) Each health care employer to establish and maintain a \n     data system that tracks and analyzes trends in injuries \n     relating to the application of the safe patient handling and \n     injury prevention standard and to make such data and analyses \n     available to employees and employee representatives.\n       (5) Each health care employer to establish a system to \n     document in each instance when safe patient handling \n     equipment was not utilized due to legitimate concerns about \n     patient care and to generate a written report in each such \n     instance. The report shall list the following:\n       (A) The work task being performed.\n       (B) The reason why safe patient handling equipment was not \n     used.\n       (C) The nature of the risk posed to the worker from manual \n     lifting.\n       (D) The steps taken by management to reduce the likelihood \n     of manual lifting and transferring when performing similar \n     work tasks in the future.\n\n     Such reports shall be made available to OSHA compliance \n     officers, workers, and their representatives upon request \n     within one business day.\n       (6) Each health care employer to train nurses and other \n     health care workers on safe patient handling and injury \n     prevention policies, equipment, and devices at least on an \n     annual basis. Such training shall include providing \n     information on hazard identification, assessment, and control \n     of musculoskeletal hazards in patient care areas and shall be \n     conducted by an individual with knowledge in the subject \n     matter, and delivered, at least in part, in an interactive \n     classroom-based and hands-on format.\n       (7) Each health care employer to post a uniform notice in a \n     form specified by the Secretary that--\n       (A) explains the safe patient handling and injury \n     prevention standard;\n       (B) includes information regarding safe patient handling \n     and injury prevention policies and training; and\n       (C) explains procedures to report patient handling-related \n     injuries.\n       (8) Each health care employer to conduct an annual written \n     evaluation of the implementation of the safe patient handling \n     and injury prevention plan, including handling procedures, \n     selection of equipment and engineering controls, assessment \n     of injuries, and new safe patient handling and injury \n     prevention technology and devices that have been developed. \n     The evaluation shall be conducted with the involvement of \n     nurses, other health care workers, and their representatives \n     and shall be documented in writing.

A bill to restore fairness to Federal cocaine sentencing; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Fair Sentencing \nAct of 2009, which I am introducing today.\n  This narrowly tailored bill would eliminate the sentencing disparity \nthat exists in the United States between crack cocaine and powder \ncocaine. At the same time, it would increase penalties for the worst \noffenders for crimes involving these substances. It accomplishes two \nvery important goals: One goal is to restore fairness to drug \nsentencing and, second, to focus our limited Federal resources on the \nmost effective way to end violent drug trafficking.\n  I have cast thousands of votes as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate. Most of those votes are kind of lost in \nthe shadows of history. Some were historic, relative to going to war \nand impeachment issues, and you never forget those.\n  But there was one vote I cast more than 20 years ago which I regret. \nIt was a vote that was cast by many of us in the House of \nRepresentatives, when we were first informed about the appearance of a \nnew narcotic on the streets. It was called crack cocaine. It was so \ncheap it was going to be plentiful, and it was so insidious--or at \nleast we were told that 20 years ago--we were advised to take notice \nand do something dramatic and we did.\n  More than 20 years ago, I joined many Members of Congress from both \npolitical parties in voting for the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986. It \nestablished the Federal cocaine sentencing framework that is still in \nplace today.\n  Under this law, it takes 100 times more powder cocaine than crack \ncocaine to trigger the same 5-to-10-year mandatory minimum sentence. \nThis is known as the 100-to-1 crack/powder sentencing disparity. But \nthat phrase doesn't tell the story. Here is the story. Simply \npossessing 5 grams of crack, which is the equivalent of holding five \npackets of sugar or Equal or one of the sugar substitutes, simply \npossessing that small amount of crack cocaine under the current \nsentencing framework carries the same sentence as selling--not \npossessing but selling--500 grams of powder cocaine--the equivalent of \n500 packets of sugar. Why? Well, because we believed we were dealing \nwith a different class of narcotics; something that was much more \ndangerous and should be treated much more harshly.\n  Make no mistake, cocaine--whether in crack or powder form--has a \ndevastating impact on families and on our society and we need to have \ntough legislation when it comes to narcotics. But in addition to being \ntough, our drug laws have to be fair.\n  Right now, our cocaine laws are based on a distinction between crack \nand powder cocaine which cannot be justified. Our laws don't focus on \nthe most dangerous offenders. Incarcerating for 5 to 10 years people \nwho are possessing five sugar packets' worth of crack cocaine for the \nsame period of time as those who are selling 500 sugar-size packets of \npowder cocaine is indefensible.\n  The Fair Sentencing Act, which I am introducing today, would \ncompletely eliminate this crack/powder disparity. It establishes the \nsame sentences for crack and powder--a 1-to-1 sentencing ratio.\n\n[[Page S10491]]\n\n  Those of us who supported the law establishing this disparity had \ngood intentions. We followed the lead and advice of people in law \nenforcement. We wanted to address this crack epidemic that was \nspreading fear and ravaging communities. But we have learned a great \ndeal in the last 20 years. We now know the assumptions that led us to \ncreate this disparity were wrong.\n  Vice President Joe Biden, one of the authors of the legislation \ncreating this disparity in sentencing, has said: ``Each of the myths \nupon which we based the disparity has since been dispelled or \naltered.''\n  Earlier this year, I held a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee \non this disparity in sentencing and we learned the following: Crack is \nnot more addictive than powder cocaine, and crack cocaine offenses do \nnot involve significantly more violence than powder cocaine offenses. \nThose were the two things that led us to this gross disparity in \nsentencing between powder cocaine and crack cocaine. We were told it is \ndifferent; it is more addictive. It is not. We were also told it was \ngoing to create conduct which was much more violent than those who were \nselling powder cocaine and their activities. It did not.\n  We have also learned that more than 2.3 million people are imprisoned \nin America today. That is the most prisoners and the highest per capita \nrate of prisoners of any country in the world, and it is largely due to \nthe incarceration of nonviolent drug offenders in America. African \nAmericans are incarcerated at nearly six times the rate of White \nAmericans. These are issues of fundamental human rights and justice our \ncountry must face.\n  It is important to note that the crack/powder disparity \ndisproportionately affects African Americans. While African Americans \nconstitute less than 30 percent of crack users, they make up 82 percent \nof those convicted of Federal crack offenses.\n  At a hearing I held, we heard compelling testimony from Judge Reggie \nB. Walton, who was Associate Director of the Office of Drug Control \nPolicy under President George H.W. Bush and was appointed by President \nGeorge W. Bush to the Federal bench. Judge Walton is an African \nAmerican, and he testified about ``the agony of having to enforce a law \nthat one believes is fundamentally unfair and disproportionately \nimpacts individuals who look like me.''\n  We also heard about the negative impact the crack/powder disparity \nhas on the criminal justice system. Judge Walton further testified \nabout ``jurors who would tell me that they refused to convict, that \neven though they thought the evidence was overwhelming, they were not \nprepared to put another young black man in prison knowing the \nsentencing disparity that existed between crack and powder cocaine.''\n  Asa Hutchinson, who was head of the Drug Enforcement Administration \nunder President George W. Bush, testified: ``Under the current \ndisparity, the credibility of our entire drug enforcement system is \nweakened.''\n  The crack disparity also diverts resources away from the prosecution \nof large-scale drug traffickers. In fact, more than 60 percent of \ndefendants convicted of Federal crack crimes are street-level dealers \nor mules.\n  During these difficult economic times, it is also important to note \nthat the crack/powder disparity has placed an enormous burden on \ntaxpayers and the prison system. Based on the Bureau of Prison's \nestimates of the annual costs of incarceration and the U.S. Sentencing \nCommission's projections of the number of prison beds reduced per year, \nwe know that eliminating this disparity could save more than $510 \nmillion in prison beds over 15 years.\n  There is widespread and growing agreement that the Federal cocaine \nand sentencing policy in the United States today is unjustified and \nunjust.\n  At the hearing I held on the crack/powder disparity, Lanny Breuer, \nthe Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division, announced that \nthe Justice Department and this administration support completely \neliminating the crack/powder disparity and establishing a 1-to-1 ratio, \nwhich is included in my bill.\n  In June, Attorney General Eric Holder testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I asked him about this issue and here is what he \nsaid.\n\n       When one looks at the racial implications of the crack-\n     powder disparity, it has bred disrespect for our criminal \n     justice system. It has made the job of those of us in law \n     enforcement more difficult. . . . [I]t is time to do away \n     with that disparity.\n\n  Here on Capitol Hill, Democrats and Republicans alike have advocated \nfixing the disparity for years.\n  The following 10 Senators are original cosponsors of the Fair \nSentencing Act: Senator Patrick Leahy, the Chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, who for years has advocated for drug sentencing reform; \nSenator Arlen Specter, the Chair of the Judiciary Committee's Crime and \nDrugs Subcommittee; Five other members of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee--Senators Russ Feingold, Ben Cardin, Sheldon Whitehouse, Ted \nKaufman, and Al Franken; and Senators John Kerry, Chris Dodd, and Carl \nLevin.\n  I would also like to recognize at this point, though he is not a \ncosponsor of the bill, Senator Jeff Sessions, the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee. He has been a leader in calling for reform of \ncrack/powder sentencing policy.\n  The Senator from Alabama is a former U.S. attorney, not known to be \nsoft on crime in any way, shape, or form, but he was one of the first \nto speak out about the injustice of the crack/powder disparity. I \ncontinue my dialog with Senator Sessions in the hope that he and I can \ncome to a common place with regard to this important issue.\n  There is a bipartisan consensus about the need to fix the crack-\npowder disparity. I have been in discussions with Chairman Leahy and \nRanking Member Sessions, as well as Republican Senators Lindsey Graham, \nOrrin Hatch, and Tom Coburn, and I am confident that the Judiciary \nCommittee can come together to find a bipartisan solution to this \nproblem.\n  A broad coalition of legal, law enforcement, civil rights, and \nreligious leaders and groups from across the political spectrum \nsupports eliminating the crack-powder disparity, including, for \nexample: Los Angeles Police Chief Bill Bratton, Miami Police Chief John \nTimoney, The American Bar Association, The Leadership Conference on \nCivil Rights, The National Black Police Association, and The United \nMethodist Church.\n  The bipartisan United States Sentencing Commission has been urging \nCongress to act for 15 years. They have argued that fixing the crack-\npowder disparity ``would better reduce the [sentencing] gap [between \nAfrican Americans and whites] than any other single policy change, and \nit would dramatically improve the fairness of the federal sentencing \nsystem.'' The Sentencing Commission has repeatedly recommended that \nCongress take two important steps: No. 1, reduce the sentencing \ndisparity by increasing the quantities of crack cocaine that trigger \nmandatory minimum sentences; and No. 2, eliminate the mandatory minimum \npenalty for simple possession of crack cocaine. This is the only \nmandatory minimum sentence for simple possession of a drug by a first \ntime offender.\n  The bill that I have introduced does both those things.\n  In order to ensure that limited Federal resources are directed toward \nthe largest drug traffickers and the most violent offenders, not just \nthose guilty of simple possession and a first offense, the Fair and \nSentencing Act provides for increased penalties for drug offenses \ninvolving vulnerable victims, violence and other aggravating factors.\n  For example, an individual being prosecuted for possessing either \ncrack or powder cocaine will face more jail time if he: uses or \nthreatens to use violence; uses or possesses a dangerous weapon; is a \nmanager, leader or organizer of drug trafficking activities; or \ndistributes drugs to a pregnant woman or minor.\n  The bill would also increase the financial penalties for drug \ntrafficking. This sentencing structure will shift Federal resources \ntowards violent traffickers and away from nonviolent drug users who are \nbest dealt with at the State level.\n  In the final analysis, this legislation is about fixing an unjust law \nthat has taken a great human toll. At the hearing I held in the \nJudiciary Committee, we heard testimony from Cedric Parker, who is from \nAlton in my home State of Illinois. In 2000, Mr. Parker's\n\n[[Page S10492]]\n\nsister, Eugenia Jennings, was sentenced to 22 years in prison for \nselling 14 grams of crack cocaine. Mr. Parker told us that Eugenia was \nphysically and sexually abused from a young age. She was addicted to \ncrack by the time she was 15.\n  Eugenia has three children, Radley, Radeisha, and Cardez. They are \nnow 11, 14, and 15. These children were 2, 5, and 6 when their mother \nwent to prison for selling the equivalent of 6 sugar cubes of crack. \nThey have seen their mother once in the last 9 years. They will be 21, \n24, and 25 when she is released in 2019.\n  At Eugenia's sentencing, Judge Patrick Murphy said this:\n\n       Mrs. Jennings, nobody has ever been there for you when you \n     needed it. When you were a child and you were being abused, \n     the Government wasn't there. But when you had a little bit of \n     crack, the government was there. And it is an awful thing, an \n     awful thing to separate a mother from her children. That's \n     what the Government has done for Eugenia Jennings.\n\n  It is time to right this wrong. We have talked about the need to \naddress the crack-powder disparity for long enough. Now, it's time to \nact. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Fair Sentencing \nAct of 2009.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see my colleague, the assistant \nmajority leader. I know we have been talking about improvement in the \nsentencing process for crack cocaine. I have offered legislation for \nalmost a decade that would substantially improve the sentencing process \nin a way that I think is fair and constructive and allows us to deal \nwith serious criminals like drug dealers. I believe it is pretty close \nto being a good policy. Senator Salazar, now a member of the Obama \nCabinet, and Senator Mark Pryor, my Democratic colleague from Arkansas, \nSenator John Cornyn from Texas, and I, all four former attorneys \ngeneral, offered that legislation. Senator Durbin has some ideas too. I \nlook forward to working with him. I do think it is past time to act.\n  I will not favor alterations that massively undercut the sentencing \nwe have in place, but I definitely believe that the current system is \nnot fair and that we are not able to defend the sentences that are \nrequired to be imposed under the law today.\n  I am a strong believer in law enforcement and prosecution of those \nwho violate our laws, particularly criminals who really do a lot of \ndamage beyond just dealing drugs. They foster crime and form gangs. \nPeople who use cocaine tend to be violent. Even more, in some ways, \npeople who use crack cocaine, as opposed to powder cocaine, tend to be \nparanoid and violent. It is not a good thing.\n  We don't need to give up the progress that has been made, but at the \nsame time we need to fix the sentencing. I oppose anything that \nrepresents a 50, 60, 70, or 80 percent reduction in penalties but a \nsignificant rebalancing of that would be justified.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am proud to join Senators Durbin, \nSpecter, Feingold, Cardin, Whitehouse, Kaufman, Franken, and others to \nintroduce the Fair Sentencing Act of 2009. Our bill will eliminate the \ncurrent 100-to-1 disparity between Federal sentences for crack and \npowder cocaine, equalizing the penalties for both forms of cocaine. I \nhope that this legislation will finally enable us to address the racial \nimbalance that has resulted from the cocaine sentencing disparity, as \nwell as to make our drug laws more fair, more rational, and more \nconsistent with our core values of justice.\n  I commend Senator Durbin for his leadership in fixing this decades-\nold injustice. He chaired a hearing before our Crime and Drugs \nSubcommittee six months ago to examine this issue where we heard from \nthe Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division at the Justice \nDepartment. We should do what we can to restore public confidence in \nour criminal justice system. Correcting biases in our criminal \nsentencing laws is a step in that direction.\n  Today, the criminal justice system has unfair and biased cocaine \npenalties that undermine the Constitution's promise of equal treatment \nfor all Americans. For more than 20 years, our Nation has used a \nFederal cocaine sentencing policy that treats ``crack'' offenders one \nhundred times more harshly than other cocaine offenders without any \nlegitimate basis for the difference. We know that there is little or no \npharmacological distinction between crack and powder cocaine, yet the \nresulting punishments for these offenses is radically different and the \nresulting impact on minorities has been particularly unjust.\n  Under this flawed policy, a first-time offender caught selling five \ngrams of powder cocaine typically receives a 6 month sentence, and \nwould often be eligible for probation. That same first-time offender \nselling the same amount of crack faces a mandatory five year prison \nsentence, with little or no possibility of leniency. This policy is \nwrong and unfair, and it has needlessly swelled our prisons, wasting \nprecious Federal resources.\n  Even more disturbingly, this policy has had a significantly disparate \nimpact on racial and ethnic minorities. According to the latest \nstatistics assembled by the United States Sentencing Commission, \nAfrican-American offenders continue to make up the large majority of \nFederal crack cocaine offenders, accounting for 80 percent of all \nFederal crack cocaine offenses, compared to white offenders who account \nfor just 10 percent. These statistics are startling. It is no wonder \nthis policy has sparked a nationwide debate about racial bias and \nundermined citizens' confidence in the justice system.\n  These penalties, which Congress created in the mid-1980s, have failed \nto address basic concerns. The primary goal was to punish the major \ntraffickers and drug kingpins who were bringing crack into our \nneighborhoods. But the law has not been used to go after the most \nserious offenders. In fact, just the opposite has happened. The \nSentencing Commission has consistently reported for many years that \nmore than half of Federal crack cocaine offenders are low-level street \ndealers and users, not the major traffickers Congress intended to \ntarget.\n  The Fair Sentencing Act of 2009 would return the focus of Federal \ncocaine sentencing policy to drug kingpins, rather than street level \ndealers, and address the racial disparity in cocaine sentencing. The \nlegislation we introduce today would align crack and powder cocaine \nsentences by setting the mandatory minimum sentencing triggers at the \nsame levels. This equalization is a sound way to address the unjust \nsentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine.\n  We have heard calls for this reform from Senators on both sides of \nthe aisle. Senator Hatch, who has called the current ratio ``an \nunjustifiable disparity,'' recognizes that because ``crack and powder \ncocaine are pharmacologically the same drug'' our sentencing laws do \n``not warrant such an extreme disparity.'' Even Senator Sessions, now \nthe ranking Republican member of the Judiciary Committee, has called \nthe 100-to-1 disparity in sentencing between crack cocaine and powder \ncocaine ``not justifiable'' and called for changes to make the criminal \njustice system more effective and fair.\n  The legislation we introduce today would also eliminate the mandatory \nminimum sentence for possession of crack cocaine. The 5-year mandatory \nminimum sentence penalty for simple possession of crack is unique under \nFederal law. There is no other mandatory minimum for mere simple \npossession of a drug. This bill would correct this inequity, as well. \nStill, the Federal penalties for drug crimes remain very tough. This \nbill toughens some of those penalties. It would increase fines for \nmajor drug traffickers, as well as provide sentencing enhancements for \nacts of violence committed during the course of a drug trafficking \noffense. As a former prosecutor, I support strong punishments for drug \ntraffickers.\n  This legislation already has support from a broad coalition of \ngroups, including the American Bar Association, the NAACP, the ACLU, \nFamilies Against Mandatory Minimums, the Sentencing Project, the United \nMethodist Church, and many more.\n  While serving in the Senate, in September 2007, then-Senator Obama \nsaid:\n\n       If you are convicted of a crime involving drugs, of course \n     you should be punished. But let's not make the punishment for \n     crack cocaine that much more severe than the punishment for \n     powder cocaine when the real difference is where the people \n     are using them or who is using them.\n\n  I agree. And the Justice Department agrees as well, as Assistant \nAttorney\n\n[[Page S10493]]\n\nGeneral Lanny Breuer announced at our hearing this spring.\n  For over 20 years, the ``crack-powder'' disparity in the law has \ncontributed to swelling prison populations without focusing on the drug \nkingpins. We must be smarter in our Federal drug policy. Law \nenforcement has been and continues to be a central part of our efforts \nagainst illegal drugs, but we must also find meaningful, community-\nbased solutions.\n  American justice is about fairness for each individual. To have faith \nin our system Americans must have confidence that the laws of this \ncountry, including our drug laws, are fair and administered fairly. I \nbelieve the Fair Sentencing Act of 2009 will move us one step closer to \nreaching that goal. I urge all Senators to support this measure.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President. I have sought recognition to urge support \nfor the legislation introduced today by Senator Durbin to completely \neliminate the unfair and unwarranted sentencing disparity between crack \nand powder cocaine. I am an original co-sponsor of this bill.\n  Since the passage of the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1986, which \nestablished the basic framework of mandatory minimum penalties \ncurrently applicable to Federal drug trafficking offenses, there exists \na 100-to-1 ratio between crack and powder cocaine. That means it takes \n100 times as much powder cocaine as crack to trigger the same 5-year \nand 10-year mandatory minimum penalties.\n  On April 29, 2009, 6 witnesses testified before the Senate Judiciary \nSubcommittee on Crime and Drugs regarding the sentencing disparity \nbetween crack and powder cocaine, including the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice, the \nActing Chair of the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a U.S. District Court \nJudge representing the Judicial Conference of the U.S. Courts, and a \nPolice Commissioner from a major urban city. All six witnesses \ntestified in favor of an immediate reduction or elimination of this \ndisparity.\n  At the time Congress established the crack-powder disparity in 1986, \nit did so because it was believed that crack was uniquely addictive and \nwas associated with greater levels of violence than powder cocaine.\n  Today, more than 20 years later, research has shown that the \naddictive qualities of crack have more to do with its mode of \nadministration--smoking compared to inhaling--rather than its chemical \nstructure. Moreover, recent studies suggest that levels of violence \nassociated with crack are stable or even declining.\n  Last year, 80.6 percent of crack offenders were African Americans, \nwhile only 10.2 percent were white. Compare that with powder cocaine \nprosecutions. For that same year, 30.25 percent of powder cocaine \noffenders were African Americans, 52.5 percent were Hispanic, and 16.4 \npercent were white. The average sentence for crack offenders is 2 years \nlonger than the average sentence for powder cocaine.\n  Let me repeat that. African Americans, who make up approximately 12.3 \npercent of the population in the U.S., comprise 80.6 percent of the \nFederal crack offenders.\n  It takes about $14,000 worth of powder cocaine compared to only about \n$150 of crack to trigger the 5-year mandatory minimum penalty. Given \nthat crack and cocaine powder are the same drug--just in different \nforms--why should we impose the same 5-year sentence for the $150 drug \ndeal as for the $14,000 drug deal?\n  These sentencing disparities undermine the confidence in the criminal \njustice system. Our courts and our laws must be fundamentally fair; \njust as importantly, they must be perceived as fair by the public. I do \nnot believe that the 1986 Act was intended to have a disparate impact \non minorities but the reality is that it does.\n  The White House and the Department of Justice have asked Congress to \neliminate this unfair sentencing disparity. It is time to correct this \ninjustice.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DORGAN (for himself, \n        Mr. Reid, Ms. Murkowski, \n        Mr. Udall of New Mexico, \n        Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Tester,  Mr. Akaka, \n        Mr. Conrad, Mr. Begich, \n        Mr. Franken, Mr. Burris, \n        Mr. Inouye, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mr. Udall of Colorado, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 1790. A bill to amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act to \nrevise and extend that Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nIndian Affairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I introduced the Indian Health Care \nImprovement Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2009. We face a bona \nfide crisis in health care in our Native American communities, and this \nbill is a first step toward fulfilling our treaty obligations and trust \nresponsibility to provide quality health care in Indian Country. I \nintroduce this bill on behalf of myself, Leader Reid and Senators \nMurkowski, Udall of New Mexico, Begich, Franken, Whitehouse, Inouye, \nAkaka, Johnson, Tester, Conrad, Burris, Stabenow, Udall of Colorado, \nand Klobuchar.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs, I have again \nmade health care a top priority for the Committee this Congress. Native \nAmericans suffer staggering health disparities due to an outdated, \nstrained and underfunded health care system. We have a federal health \ncare system for Native Americans that is only funded at about half of \nits need. Clinician vacancy rates within this system are high and \nmisdiagnosis is rampant. Only those with ``life or limb'' emergencies \nseem to get care. Native Americans die of tuberculosis at a rate 600 \npercent higher than the general population, suicide rates are nearly \ndouble, alcoholism rates are 510 percent higher, and diabetes rates are \n189 percent higher than the general population.\n  These numbers are appalling and represent Third World conditions \nright here in the U.S.\n  I have heard the heartbreaking stories about the lack of health care \non our Native American reservations: people like Ta'shon Rain \nLittlelight, Jami Rose Jetty, Russell Lente and Avis Little Wind, who \nlikely still would be living today had they had access to adequate \nhealth care. Our Federal system has failed them and so many other \nNative Americans. We owe our First Americans something better, and the \nbill I introduced today with my colleagues will provide a better \nsystem.\n  For over a decade, Indian Country has asked Congress to reauthorize \nand amend the Indian Health Care Improvement Act, P.L. 94-437. The \nNational Steering Committee for Reauthorization, National Congress of \nAmerican Indians, National Indian Health Board, and other Native \nAmerican health advocates have been dedicated to improving the health \ncare available to Native Americans across the country. I too am \ncommitted to ensuring the United States fulfills its trust \nresponsibility to provide decent health care to the Native Americans.\n  Last Congress, the Senate passed the Indian Health Care Improvement \nAct Amendments of 2008, which would have brought needed improvements to \nthe Native American health care system. The bill passed by an \noverwhelming 83 to 10 vote. This was the first time in almost 17 years \nthat the Senate considered and passed a Native American health care \nbill. Ultimately, the bill failed to be considered in the House of \nRepresentatives. My colleagues and I remain committed to getting a bill \nenacted into law.\n  In July, I developed a Native American health concept paper which was \nsent out to Indian Country for comments. I and the Committee on Indian \nAffairs held many listening sessions and meetings with many Native \nAmericans around the country to discuss the concept paper. In addition, \nthe Committee has held five hearings focused on Native American health \nissues this Congress. The Committee has worked to compile the feedback \nreceived from the concept paper and other meetings to develop the \nNative American health bill I introduced today.\n  Similar legislation has been considered in the 106, 107, 108, 109, \nand 110 Congresses. Today, my colleagues and I put forward a Native \nAmerican health bill for the 111 Congress which builds on the work of \nprior Congresses, but goes beyond to include innovative solutions and \nreforms for the Native American health care system.\n  I would like to highlight some of the important updates the Indian \nHealth Care Improvement Reauthorization and Extension Act of 2009 will \nbring to\n\n[[Page S10494]]\n\nthe Native American health care system.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the Native American health bill permanently \nreauthorizes all current laws governing the Native American health care \nsystem. This means that once this bill is passed, Indian Country will \nnever again have to wait nearly 20 years for a reauthorization of the \nIndian Health Care Improvement Act.\n  This bill also authorizes long-term care services, including hospice \ncare, assisted living, long-term care and home- and community-based \ncare. Current law does not allow for these services to be provided by \nthe Indian Health Service or tribal facilities. Although some areas of \nIndian Country are merely focused on addressing life or limb medical \nemergencies, other areas are in need of long-term care. Thus, I believe \nthey should be authorized.\n  In addition, the bill establishes mental and behavioral health \nprograms beyond alcohol and substance abuse, such as fetal alcohol \nspectrum disorders, child sexual abuse and prevention treatment \nprograms. The mental health needs in Native American communities extend \nbeyond alcohol and substance abuse, in fact over \\1/3\\ of the health \ncare needs in Indian Country are related to mental health. The \ncomprehensive mental and behavioral health programs established as a \nresult of this bill will bring necessary care and resources to Native \nAmericans.\n  In order to address the tragic level of youth suicide, the bill \nincludes behavioral health provisions solely focused on preventing \nNative American youth suicide. The youth suicide rate in Indian Country \nis 3.5 times higher than the general population. Earlier this year, I \nchaired an Indian Affairs hearing to draw attention to this important \ntopic.\n  The bill also incorporates many new ideas aimed at improving the \naccess to health care available to Native Americans. The bill \nauthorizes projects which will incentivize tribes to use innovative \nfacilities construction which save money and expand the health care \nservices available to Native American communities. For example, these \nprojects include the use of modular component facility construction and \nmobile health stations.\n  Modular component health facilities can be built at often one-third \nthe cost and a fraction of the time of a typical health facility. In \naddition, mobile health stations will allow for Native Americans in \nrural areas without a hospital, increased access to specialty health \nservices like dialysis, same-day surgery, dental care, or other \nservices. Currently, there is an estimated $3 billion backlog for \nmaintenance, improvement and construction of Native American health \ncare facilities. In addition, the average age of an Indian Health \nService facility is 33 years, as compared to 7 years in the general \npopulation. These innovative health care facilities will go a long way \nin this disparity and improving access to health care for Native \nAmericans across the country.\n  The Native American health bill establishes a health delivery \ndemonstration project. This project provides for convenient care \nservices, which could be offered in local grocery stores and other \nvenues, to make health care more available to Native American \ncommunities. The health delivery demonstration project authorizes the \nIndian Health Service to consider other innovative health delivery \nmodels, like community health centers, and other models which will \nincrease access to health care services.\n  I want to end by saying the need for health care is not new for \nIndian Country. Nowadays, the need for national health care reform is \nfront page news, but our Native Americans have long been in need of \nhealth care reforms. Therefore, I intend to offer this Native American \nhealth bill as an amendment to any national health care reform bill \nconsidered on the Senate floor.\n  I want to thank all the Native American health advocates who assisted \nus in the development of this crucial piece of legislation. The Federal \nGovernment signed the dotted lines years ago, and today, we make an \nimportant step towards finally fulfilling those obligations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/15/senate-section/article/S10494-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10494]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2691.
