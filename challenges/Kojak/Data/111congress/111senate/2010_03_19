Mr. President, has morning business been announced?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are on the bill.\n  Mr. REID. We are on the bill. That is where we should be.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, this morning we are awaiting the \nopportunity to do a unanimous consent request that would then give us \nthe road ahead to complete the FAA reauthorization bill on Monday. We \nhave spent 5 days on the floor of the Senate, entertained a fairly \nlarge number of amendments and had votes on amendments. We have one \nlarge group of amendments that has been cleared by both sides. We will \ninclude that in the unanimous consent request as well.\n  We made a lot of progress last night in reaching some understandings \nabout a couple of the complicated and controversial issues. It appears \nnow, when we get the unanimous consent request, which I think we have \nagreed to--we are just getting it prepared--we will be able to get that \ndone this morning. That will give us the road forward, and we will \ncomplete this bill Monday evening.\n  This is a very big achievement because the FAA reauthorization bill \nhas been extended 11 times rather than completed and reauthorized. It \nhas been extended 11 times without what we needed to do, such as \nauthorize the activities to modernize our air traffic control system, \nupdate some of the safety issues that are included in this legislation, \nupdate the essential air service program, including the passengers' \nbill of rights--a series of provisions that are very important to make \ncertain we have a modern aviation system that is as safe as it can be \nand that is as protective of passengers as is possible, giving the \nairlines and those in general aviation, as well, the opportunity to \nhave a modern air traffic control system, the most modern in the world.\n  This is a big achievement. I appreciate the cooperation of all of our \ncolleagues, Republicans and Democrats, who joined last evening in \nwanting to finish this bill. We were able to reach some understandings \nto do that.\n  While we are waiting for the opportunity to do the unanimous consent \nrequest--it is not yet completely written--I am going to give a \npresentation this morning on the subject of energy.\n  I will withhold on that. I know our colleague from Arizona is on the \nfloor. Let me at this point yield the floor, and at some appropriate \npoint I will spend some time talking about energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask my friend from North Dakota, I \nintended to speak in morning business as well, if he has no objection.\n  I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is a lot of excitement and interest, \nobviously, around the country about the impending, possibly, vote in \nthe other body, perhaps as early as Sunday. I think it is time we \ntalked a little bit about reality as well. I would like to mention one \nitem.\n  I read from an article from the Dow Jones Newswires:\n\n       Caterpillar, Inc., said the health care overhaul \n     legislation being considered by the U.S. House would increase \n     the company's health care costs by more than $100 million in \n     the first year alone.\n       In a letter Thursday to [House] Speaker Nancy Pelosi and \n     House Republican leader John Boehner of Ohio, Caterpillar \n     urged lawmakers to vote against the plan ``because of the \n     substantial cost burdens it would place on our shareholders, \n     employees and retirees.''\n       Caterpillar, the world's largest construction machinery \n     manufacturer by sales, said it's particularly opposed to \n     provisions in the bill that would expand Medicare taxes and \n     mandate insurance coverage. The legislation would require \n     nearly all companies to provide health insurance for their \n     employees.\n\n  I would point out to my colleagues that this is one of the largest \nexporters the United States of America has.\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       Caterpillar noted that the company supports efforts to \n     increase the quality and value of health care for patients . \n     . . unfortunately, neither the current legislation in the \n     House and Senate, nor the President's proposal, meets these \n     goals.\n\n  Most telling, perhaps, is the comment of the vice president, who said \nthis:\n\n       We can ill-afford cost increases that place us at a \n     disadvantage versus our global competitors.\n\n  So here we are with a huge trade deficit of almost unprecedented \nproportions. We owe the Chinese $850 billion, or some huge amount, and \nmore every day, so Caterpillar is going to have their expenses \nincreased in 1 year by $100 million or more. How in the world are they \ngoing to be competitive?\n  I probably should have begun with this. Yesterday, in my home State \nof Arizona, almost an unprecedented event took place. The Governor of \nthe State of Arizona, Governor Jan Brewer, the majority leader of the \nsenate, and the speaker of the house, held a press conference in which \nthey talked about a letter they sent to the President of the United \nStates. I want to quote from the letter:\n\n       Dear Mr. President: We share common ground in that we both \n     have been called to lead during some of the most difficult \n     times our Nation has faced. Like you, I hear painful stories \n     on a regular basis from people who are struggling to survive. \n     Yet in their time of need, our State government is on the \n     brink of insolvency.\n       During this downturn, Arizona has lost the largest \n     percentage of jobs in the United States. The flagging economy \n     has resulted in a loss of State revenues in excess of 30 \n     percent, placing tremendous pressures on our State budget. \n     Today, Arizona faces one of the largest deficits of any \n     State.\n       There is no doubt that this fiscal calamity has been \n     compounded by the enormous spending increases we are facing \n     as a result of our Medicaid, which has seen population growth \n     of almost 20 percent in the past 12 months. It is for that \n     reason I write to you today.\n       You have repeated on several occasions that the debate on \n     health care reform has consumed the past year and you most \n     recently called on Congress to vote the measure ``up or \n     down.'' As the governor of a State that is bleeding red ink, \n     I am imploring our congressional delegation to vote against \n     your proposal to expand government health care and to help \n     vote it down.\n       The reason for my position is simple: We cannot afford it. \n     And based on our State's own experience with government \n     health care expansion, we doubt the rest of America can \n     either.\n\n  Then the Governor of the State of Arizona, Jan Brewer, along with the\n\n[[Page S1761]]\n\nother legislative leaders, goes on to explain why this would cause such \ndevastating harm to the State of Arizona, which is already suffering \nunder unprecedented fiscal difficulties.\n  As the Governor pointed out in her letter, Medicaid has seen \npopulation growth of almost 20 percent in the last 12 months. All over \nAmerica, Governors are saying: Don't do this to us. They are saying: \nDon't mandate this dramatic increase in our Medicaid expenses. \nGovernors and legislatures and citizens all over the country are \nenacting laws and proposing constitutional amendments that say: You \ncannot force us to buy health insurance.\n  I want to congratulate the Governor of the State of Arizona and our \nlegislative leaders for their courage in standing up and telling the \nAmerican people and the President of the United States the reality of \nwhat they are facing.\n  I guess a lot of this may be coming to a head in some respects, \nalthough there still seems to be some speculation as to what \n``reconciliation'' will take place over here, exactly what form that \nwill take, and exactly what the rulings of the Parliamentarians and \nothers will be to what sounds like arcane procedures and how they will \nunfold. But I think it is very clear that we are facing, possibly for \nthe first time in our history, a major reform in the face of \noverwhelming opposition to it on the part of the American people.\n  This morning's Wall Street Journal has an interesting lead editorial \nentitled: ``March Madness.'' ``Scenes from a devolution as Democrats \nwrithe towards 216 votes.'' I want to quote from the editorial of this \nmorning:\n\n       Has there ever been a political spectacle like the final \n     throes of Obama care? We can't recall one outside of a banana \n     republic, or, more accurately, Woody Allen's 1971 classic \n     ``Bananas.'' Capitol Hill resembles nothing so much as that \n     movie's farcical coup d'etat in San Marcos, as Democrats try \n     to assemble a partisan minimum of 216 votes--if only for an \n     hour or so at some point on Sunday--and no bribe is too \n     costly, no deal too cynical, no last-minute rewrite too \n     blatant.\n\n  That pretty much sums it up. One of the issues is, what are the tax \nincreases in this? When do they kick in? How is it that the \nCongressional Budget Office can come up with such estimates, as they \nhave? Well, the first principle, my friends, is: Garbage in, garbage \nout. If you give the Congressional Budget Office certain assumptions, \nthey will have to give estimates based on those assumptions, even if \nthose assumptions are totally out of the realm of possibility, such as \ncuts of $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare, such as saying that we will have a \nso-called ``doc fix''--a reduction in doctors' payments of some $217 \nbillion. We know that is not going to happen. We know that is not going \nto happen.\n  Let me quote again from the Wall Street Journal article:\n\n       Also yesterday the white smoke rose up from the \n     Congressional Budget Office, which released its cost \n     estimates for the ``reconciliation bill'' and the sundry \n     fixes without which Ms. Pelosi can't deem the Senate bill \n     passed. Democrats preemptively released the topline numbers, \n     which by themselves took weeks of tweaking to game the CBO's \n     accounting conventions and officially stay under $1 trillion \n     in spending for 10 years. The real cost over a decade, once \n     all the spending kicks in, is $2.4 trillion.\n\n  Why is that? It is obvious that the first 4 years the taxes are \nraised and the benefits are cut, and it is only after 4 years that you \nbegin to see benefits. That is a classic example of budget gimmickry.\n  Once again quoting from the article:\n\n       CBO Director Doug Elmendorf was thus obliged to release a \n     ``preliminary estimate,'' having ``not thoroughly examined \n     the legislative language.'' Mr. Elmendorf said at a hearing \n     that his health-care staff members were close to burning out \n     under ``the almost round-the-clock schedule'' of unrelenting \n     Democratic demands about the budgetary effects of this or \n     that provision. And all for a bill whose subsidies don't \n     begin until 2014.\n       By the way, to make the deficit numbers ``work,'' Democrats \n     decided at the 11th hour to increase their new tax on \n     investment income to 3.8 percent from 2.9 percent. \n     Congratulations. White House budget director Peter Orszag \n     quickly declared that ``the CBO score today should leave no \n     doubt that we are operating in a new fiscal era.''\n\n  We certainly are.\n\n       One thing the score also made clear, however, is that Mrs. \n     Pelosi's reconciliation fixes could easily be blown to pieces \n     in the Senate. While the Democratic strategy is already a \n     wholesale abuse of the traditional reconciliation process, it \n     now bids to violate the actual rules of the reconciliation as \n     well.\n       In a carom shot if there ever was one, excise tax on gold-\n     plated health coverage has received one last tweak. It is \n     expected to fund ObamaCare as employees take more of their \n     compensation in wages rather than health insurance, thus \n     exposing more income to ordinary taxes. The House demand \n     to delay that tax until 2018--\n\n  And does anybody believe we are going to impose taxes in 2018?\n\n     --from 2013 in the Senate bill--to appease the likes of AFL-\n     CIO president Richard Trumka, who met one-on-one with Mr. \n     Obama on Wednesday--therefore reduces Social Security payroll \n     tax revenues. But reconciliation expressly forbids such \n     changes.\n\n  The reconciliation rules forbid changes to Social Security.\n\n       And CBO says this change will drain some $53 billion from \n     the program's trust fund.\n       Senate Republicans will therefore be entitled to raise a \n     budget ``point of order'' against the entire reconciliation \n     bill if it does arrive in the upper chamber.\n       North Dakota Senator Kent Conrad admitted the risks \n     yesterday, asking rhetorically if he expected that some GOP \n     ``challenges will be upheld? Yeah, I do.'' By the way, Mr. \n     Conrad and his House North Dakota colleague Earl Pomeroy are \n     getting a special provision that exempts a state-owned North \n     Dakota bank from the unrelated private student loan takeover \n     that Democrats have included as part of ObamaCare. That \n     multibillion-dollar baby was added to further rig the budget \n     numbers and win over conflicted Members.\n\n  I understand that my colleague Senator Conrad has now said he does \nnot wish for that exemption to be in legislation.\n  I want to point out that there are new taxes--even more tax increases \nin this bill--more than $560 billion in taxes on Medicare patients, \nprivate health insurance plans, medical device manufacturers, small \nbusinesses, and much more, including Caterpillar's estimate, as I \nmentioned, of $100 million more in cost. There is more than $200 \nbillion in taxes on individuals and small businesses; Medicare hospital \ninsurance tax, $210 billion; penalty payments by employers--these are \npenalty payments in taxes on employers that will be enacted between \n2010 and 2019.\n  In other words, the assumption in this legislation is that we will \nplan on penalizing employers some $52 billion over 10 years. I think \nemployers might be interested in hearing that. Then, more than $30 \nbillion in taxes on private health insurance plans--$32 billion--nearly \n$20 billion in taxes on uninsured Americans, and $20 billion in taxes \non medical device manufacturers.\n  I want spend a minute on that--$20 billion in taxes on medical device \nmanufacturers. The excise tax on manufacturers and importers of certain \nmedical devices, $20 billion. Impose a 2.9-percent excise tax on \nmanufacturers and importers of certain medical devices from 2010 to \n2019, which will then count as $20 billion in revenue.\n  Who pays? Who then pays when we raise taxes on the manufacturers of \nmedical devices? Who at the end of the day is going to pay for that? We \nknow who is going to pay for it. We know it will be the person who \npurchases these medical devices because the companies, obviously, \ncannot stay in business at a loss.\n  I note the presence of my colleague and friend from Arizona. I would \nbring this to his attention.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a colloquy with \nmy colleague from Arizona.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I mentioned earlier, I say to my friend, Senator Kyl, the \nletter and press conference of our, I think very courageous, Governor \nand a speaker of our Arizona House and Senate. They held a press \nconference yesterday and announced the letter they were sending to the \nPresident of the United States. I think she graphically demonstrates \nnot only the incredible burden this lays on our home State of Arizona \nbut on States all over America.\n  Isn't it true, I ask my colleague from Arizona, that not only has the \nState of Arizona warned of the consequences of this legislation, in the \nState of Arizona we may have on our ballot a statement included in our \nState constitution that no one should be forced to buy health \ninsurance. Isn't it true that other States both have enacted \nlegislation and are working on their own State constitutions to prevent \nthis mandatory health insurance purchase and the included tax increases \nand costs on their States?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague bringing that to \nlight.\n\n[[Page S1762]]\n\nThe answer, of course, is absolutely yes. I think at last count there \nwere some 38 States that had expressed either through their attorneys \ngeneral, Governor, or State legislature the intention to file \nlitigation, and some of those States, such as Arizona, will have either \nballot propositions or some have already passed legislation, such as \nIdaho, that has the effect of law to exempt their citizens from having \nto participate in this Federal mandate.\n  I ask my colleague, has this letter been printed in the Record yet?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I had it printed in the Record, and also I highlighted \nthe comments the Governor said, ``imploring our Congressional \ndelegation to vote against your proposal. . . .'' Therefore, ``the \nreason for my position is simple: we cannot afford it.''\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could, the Governor had sent a previous \nletter, which is also in the Congressional Record, in which she \nspecified the amount of money, $4 billion of extra costs, for the State \nof Arizona after our State has already slashed billions from the \nbudget. In fact, our State is in such financial doldrums that they \nliterally had to sell some of the buildings at the State capital in \norder to generate revenue, and then they are leasing those back.\n  Our State is in terrible financial condition. As my colleague pointed \nout before, with the number of homes in foreclosure and underwater, it \nis a terrible situation. Now to impose an additional $4 billion expense \non the people of the State of Arizona with this legislation, as the \nGovernor said, is very objectionable. She has urged our colleagues in \nthe House of Representatives, therefore, to oppose the legislation.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would like to bring to my colleague's attention--one of \nthe major health care providers in our home State of Arizona and across \nthe country is Banner Health, as my colleague knows. There is a letter.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the letter from Peter Fine, \nCEO of Banner Health in Phoenix be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 15, 2010.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate, Senate Russell Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The President has called on Congress \n     to pass H.R. 3590, the Senate's Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act, before Easter, along with some changes \n     that the Administration recently outlined. This legislation \n     would greatly expand Medicaid at a tremendous cost to \n     Arizona. Our state cannot afford its current Medicaid program \n     and your support for H.R. 3590 would be fiscally \n     irresponsible.\n       The Arizona Legislature adopted an $8.5 billion spending \n     plan this past week for SFY 11, addressing one of the largest \n     deficits of any state. This budget drastically reduces \n     spending for the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System \n     (AHCCCS)--Arizona's version of Medicaid. Specifically, this \n     budget cuts $2.7 billion in state and federal dollars as \n     follows:\n       Eliminates funding for the AHCCCS expansion population, \n     known as Prop. 204, as of Jan. 1, 2011. As a result, nearly \n     310,000 adults at or below 100 percent of the federal poverty \n     level will lose health care coverage under AHCCCS.\n       Repeals the KidsCare program, Arizona's version of SCHIP, \n     as of June 30, 2010. KidsCare provides health care coverage \n     for 47,000 children from low-income families.\n       Eliminates all Medicaid funding for Graduate Medical \n     Education, which supports physician residence training \n     programs.\n       Cuts $14 million in Medicaid Disproportionate Share \n     Hospitals (DSH) payments and reduces the number of hospitals \n     eligible to receive DSH.\n       Cuts provider payments up to 5 percent beginning October \n     2010. If Prop. 100 (the one-cent sales tax referendum) fails \n     to pass on May 18th, the AHCCCS Administration is authorized \n     to cut provider rates up to 10 percent.\n       Eliminates behavioral and mental health services for 36,000 \n     individuals, including 14,600 adults who have a serious \n     mental illness.\n       Despite these and other drastic program cuts, Arizona's \n     budget still has $2.5 billion structural deficit--the \n     difference between on-going expenditures and on-going \n     revenues. And if Prop. 100 (the one-cent sales tax \n     referendum) fails, the structural deficit will be a \n     staggering 43.4 billion.\n       Arizona has run a budget deficit in eight of the last ten \n     years. The state's reliance on long-term borrowing to finance \n     operations has grown significantly and serves only to further \n     exacerbate the on-going structural deficit. To put a finer \n     point on it, our state's budget has become a house of cards.\n       Banner Health, Arizona's largest provider of health care \n     services, supports expanding access to health care services \n     for the uninsured but not as an unfunded mandate. According \n     to the AHCCCS Administration, the Medicaid expansion in H.R. \n     3590 will cost Arizona $3.9 billion from 2014 thru 2020. The \n     state simply cannot afford this expansion. This state cannot \n     financially support the first dollar to gain the federal \n     match and if the legislation calls for expanded Medicaid \n     coverage, the federal government will have to financially \n     support it in total. While the legislation has many good \n     things that could still be put in place by going after them \n     individually rather than in a large complex bill, the \n     negative impact of the unfunded mandates associated with the \n     expansion of Medicaid will devastate Arizona. Therefore, I \n     strongly urge you to oppose H.R. 3590 unless the unfunded \n     Medicaid expansion is removed or fully funded by the federal \n     government. If not, the effect on the state and its financial \n     condition will be devastating and will reach unprecedented \n     levels. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. His letter states:\n\n       The President has called on Congress to pass H.R. 3590. . . \n     .\n       This legislation would greatly expand Medicaid at a \n     tremendous cost to Arizona. Our state cannot afford its \n     current Medicaid program and your support for H.R. 3590 would \n     be fiscally irresponsible. . . .\n       Despite these and other drastic program cuts, Arizona's \n     budget still has a $2.5 billion structural deficit--the \n     difference between on-going expenditures and on-going \n     revenues. . . .\n       Arizona has run a budget deficit in eight of the last ten \n     years.\n       Banner Health, Arizona's largest provider of health care \n     services, supports expanded access to health care services \n     for the uninsured but not as an unfunded mandate. According \n     to the AHCCS Administration--\n\n  That is our State's version of Medicaid--\n\n     the Medicaid expansion in H.R. 3590 will cost Arizona $3.9 \n     billion, from 2014 through 2020. The state simply cannot \n     afford this expansion. The State cannot financially support \n     the first dollar to gain the federal match and if the \n     legislation calls for expanded Medicare coverage, the Federal \n     Government will have to financially support it in total. \n     While the legislation has many good things that could still \n     be put in place by going after them individually rather than \n     in a large complex bill, the negative impact of the unfunded \n     mandate associated with the expansion of Medicaid will \n     devastate Arizona.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I say to my colleague, Mr. Fine, a leader of \none of the very large health systems in the State of Arizona, had been, \nI would say, very forward leaning, maybe even supportive of the health \ncare reforms that had been proposed by the President initially. This \ncomes from someone who wanted reform and who notes in this letter that \nthere are some good things there, but he has finally concluded that the \nimposition of the unfunded mandates and other features of the \nlegislation simply make it--unsustainable.\n  I ask my colleague for the exact word. I am not sure if it was \n``unsustainable.'' But he said: So this legislation should not be \nsupported. Instead, he suggested the approach that we have taken, which \nis we should take the good features that address specific problems and \ntry to deal with them one by one rather than in this comprehensive \nform.\n  This is from someone who initially was pretty supportive of trying to \nmove forward with this and now has concluded it is just too much and \nthe State cannot afford it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Also, I am very interested. I said earlier, before my \ncolleague came to the floor, that the announcement this morning that \nCaterpillar has announced the health care bill would cost the company \n$100 million more in the first year--$100 million more, just \nCaterpillar, in the first year alone.\n  The hour is late. But what I think maybe my colleague and I should do \nis ask people from Raytheon and Boeing and other major manufacturing \ncompanies--by the way, many of them are export driven, Intel and \nothers, that are located in our State--what the cost to them would be. \nIf Caterpillar says it is $100 million more in 1 year, I can imagine \nwhat the costs are going to be to the major manufacturers that are \nlocated in the State of Arizona as well.\n  Again, I want to repeat--I know Senator Kyl agrees with me--I would \nlike to congratulate our Governor for standing up for the people of \nArizona, for the courage she has shown more than once in her press \nconference. The statement she, joined by the members of the \nlegislature, made is an important aspect of this debate. We should know \nin Washington what our actions will do to the people of the States we \nrepresent.\n\n[[Page S1763]]\n\n  As Senator Kyl mentioned, 38 States are taking some kind of action or \nanother to prevent this piece of legislation from--however it comes \nout, certainly in its present form, which we know will not change very \nmuch if it is passed--wanting us to stop and start over.\n  I hope our colleagues will recognize if this legislation passes \nthrough this weekend, through the House of Representatives, that the \nfight will then come back to the floor of the Senate. If in the worst \ncase scenario this legislation is passed by the Senate and signed into \nlaw by the President of the United States, there will be a movement \nthroughout the country that will be entitled ``Repeal Now'' or \nsomething like that, which will argue strenuously through \ndemonstrations, at the ballot booth, and at tea parties and gatherings \nall over America that we will repeal this legislation.\n  Back in the 1990s there was a piece of legislation called \ncatastrophic health care. We passed it through the Congress. The \nPresident signed it. The American people said no.\n  This fight goes on. All of us want to fix the health care system. All \nof us want to bring health care costs down. This is not the way to do \nit. It is certainly not the way to do it, which would be done strictly \non a partisan basis for the first time in history that legislation of \nthis magnitude is passed without a broad, bipartisan basis for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to be speaking on the legislation \npending before us. Perhaps Senator Dorgan would like to lock in \nspeaking time after I am done?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me ask unanimous consent to be recognized following \nthe presentation by Senator Kyl.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I am going to speak in more detail later, \nfollowing up on comments that my colleague from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain, has made. He has rightly pointed out that the Governor of the \nState of Arizona and our legislative leaders discussed in press \nconference in Arizona the impact of this legislation in Arizona. They \nare very worried. They have urged our congressional delegation to \noppose the legislation. I will make some comments about that.\n  But I do want to address this question of the so-called perimeter \nrule, which is relevant to the FAA bill that is before us, and an \namendment that has been filed by Senator Ensign that will be modified \nand refiled sometime today, either by Senator Ensign or by Senator \nHutchison. It is an amendment which I support.\n  I am going to discuss the perimeter rule and the way that the \namendment would change it, briefly, today, and then after it is filed \nwe will have a little bit more to say about it. The Ensign amendment \nwould have the effect of modifying an archaic regulation that has had \nthe effect of limiting competition and travel options for those who fly \nin and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.\n  Many years ago, Congress restricted the departure or arrival of \nnonstop flights from airports that are more than 1,250 miles from \nReagan National Airport. It is called DCA, in the terminology--1,250 \nmiles. That established a perimeter beyond which planes could not fly \ninto or out of Reagan National Airport. That is referred to, therefore, \nas the perimeter rule. Effectively, it forced passengers in the Western \nUnited States either to use Dulles Airport or to use some other hub \npartway through the country, change planes, and then fly into Reagan \nfrom that shorter distance.\n  Obviously, this is inconvenient and discriminatory against citizens \nin the western portions of the United States who, I submit, should have \nequal access to their Nation's Capital as citizens who are closer to \nthe Capital.\n  The original purpose of it was a valid one, and it was to ensure the \nnew Dulles Airport--I think now over 50 years old, but I still think of \nit as a new airport--would become successful. It did take a few years \nfor Dulles to establish itself as a major national and international \nairport, now serving, I think--just 2 years ago, the last year for \nwhich I have statistics--over 24 million passengers, which is millions \nmore than Reagan Airport.\n  So it is clearly both an international hub in the United States, as \nwell as the long-haul airport serving the Washington, DC, area. It is \nthriving, as I said. It has something over 24 million passengers, and \nthat was as of over 2 years ago.\n  Over the years because of not only the success of Dulles Airport but \nalso improvements in technology and handling more airplanes and \nhandling more planes on the ground and, importantly, in reducing the \nnoise of jet engines, the desire of more people to be able to travel \ndirectly into Reagan Airport has obviously increased, and there has \nbeen pressure to grant at least a limited number of exceptions for the \ntraveling public which is eager for options in getting in and out of \nthe Washington, DC, area.\n  So a very few limited exceptions to this perimeter rule were created. \nYet today there are only a dozen nonstop flights--12--between \nWashington National and the entire Western United States; specifically, \n4 flights to Denver, 3 to Phoenix, 2 to Seattle; 1 to Las Vegas, 1 to \nLos Angeles, and 1 to Salt Lake City. And that is out of approximately \n400 flights from Washington Reagan Airport. That is the only number--\n12--out of more than 400 flights traveling to those important cities in \nthe United States--Los Angeles and Phoenix, 2 of the top 5 populated \ncities in the entire country.\n  In 1999, now more than a decade ago, the Transportation Research \nBoard found that the perimeter rules ``no longer serve their original \npurpose and have produced too many adverse side effects, including \nbarriers to competition.'' Of course, barriers to competition not only \nmake it more costly for flyers but also reduce the ability of airlines \nto compete and create stress on them even to remain in business. With \nall of the other stresses that have impacted airlines recently, this is \njust one more.\n  The same Transportation Research Board found that these perimeter \nrules ``arbitrarily prevent some airlines from extending their networks \nto these airports; they discourage competition among the airports in \nthe region and among the airlines that use these airports; and they are \nsubject to chronic attempts by special interest groups to obtain \nexemptions.'' We all are aware of that latter point because we hear \nabout it. Every month, it seems, there are people who are putting \npressure on to try to get more exemptions.\n  There is also legislative precedent that supports this argument that \nthis DC perimeter rule should be repealed. This was done just 4 years \nago in 2006 in the Wright amendment reform of 2006.\n  In 1979, there was a Federal law passed, headed by Speaker Jim \nWright, of the House, that restricted flights at Dallas's Love Field \nAirport. Love Field was the first airport in the Dallas region, and \nthis legislation originally limited most nonstop flights from Love \nField to destinations within Texas and neighboring States of Texas. \nBut, as I said, in 2006 we passed the Wright Amendment Reform Act, \nwhich issued a full repeal of this Love Field perimeter rule. There \nwere certain conditions to it, but the bottom line was that lifting the \nrestrictions at Love Field gave the public a lot more flight options, \nit cut prices, and it made traveling for the traveling public much more \nefficient.\n  The Ensign amendment would have much the same effect with respect to \nthe Washington, DC, area. Here is the key thing it does: It would amend \nthe DC perimeter rule by allowing any carrier that currently has slots \nat Reagan Airport--not saying new air carriers would come in; only \nthose that currently have slots--they could simply convert slots they \ncurrently have that serve large hub airports inside the perimeter to an \nairport outside the perimeter.\n  The first concern is, well, what about the cities that are served \ninside the perimeter? The amendment is limited to large hub cities, so \nthere isn't an argument that some smaller city is going to be cut out. \nThe only flights that could be transferred would be flights that \nalready go into large hub cities, cities that are already served with \nplenty of flights and can be. So an airline, in order to take advantage \nof this amendment, would have to remove a\n\n[[Page S1764]]\n\nflight from one of its large hubs and transfer it to a city outside the \nperimeter, a city such as Phoenix or Las Vegas or Los Angeles or Salt \nLake City, for example. This is referred to as the ``slot conversion \nprovision,'' and this is the guts of the amendment. It does not add \nflights; it does not take flights away from small communities; it \nsimply allows the airlines to move up to 15 flights per carrier from a \nhub that they already have to some city outside of the perimeter, the \n1,250-mile perimeter.\n  It ensures that service to small and medium hub airports is not \naffected, and it would not alter the slot regulations at DCA--no new \nflights in or out of DCA. The only difference is that when a plane \ntakes off from Reagan National Airport, its destination may be Los \nAngeles rather than--pick a city--Omaha--well, Omaha may be a smaller \ncity--perhaps Dallas or Chicago. So there are no new allowable flight \noperations. The airplanes are the same, no additional concentration at \nthe airport, and obviously very little impact on Dulles because of the \nfact that there would be so few flights and they would be going to \ncities that presumably are already being served.\n  As I mentioned, it is capped at 15 round trips per carrier. It is \nexpected that only five carriers could take advantage of the provision \nand that not all of them would be able to take full advantage of it. So \nthe maximum number of flights would be 75, and it is likely that it \nwould be far fewer than that. But even if you take the maximum of 75 \nflights, you are talking about well over 100 flights in and out of \nDulles as it is right now. According to the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority, Dulles has 333 daily flights to 83 U.S. cities and \n59 daily flights to 43 international cities. Obviously, 75 beyond the \nperimeter would have a negligible impact on the operations or demand \nfor Dulles Airport.\n  The key, as I said, is we will be able to create greater options for \npassengers, thus reducing their cost of travel, providing greater \nflexibility, access to the Nation's Capital at a somewhat more \nconvenient location, and help for airlines that need to do everything \nthey can to stay in business to serve the traveling public. Airlines \nare under a great deal of economic pressure these days, and what these \nairlines have said is this will help them continue to serve the \ntraveling public if they are able to change this perimeter rule.\n  So we are going to be able to debate further the Ensign amendment, \nwhich is scheduled to be considered by the Senate at 5:30 on Monday. \nBecause of the fact that it would simply increase the ability of--the \nairlines' flexibility to move from large hub cities today to similar \ncities outside the perimeter, it is our hope that our colleagues in \nVirginia, who naturally have been very concerned over the years about \nensuring the continued success of Dulles Airport, concerned about the \nenvironment for their citizens both in the Dulles area and in the area \nof Reagan National Airport, that their concerns would be assuaged by \nthe fact that this is very limited and it, as far as I can see, has no \nadverse impacts of any kind for the citizens of Virginia.\n  So we would hope eventually to be able to work something out here \nwhere we could modify the perimeter rule. It is anachronistic; it is \ndecades old. As I said, a lot has changed since it was put into effect, \nand we are hoping this is the time to do it. There will be no better \nopportunity than on this FAA reauthorization bill. In fact, it is \nprobably the only opportunity. Given that fact and given the fact that \nwe have been trying to accomplish this for many years, I think it is \nsafe to say that those of us who support this are going to insist this \nlegislation be the vehicle for finally making a change.\n  I very much appreciate the ability of probably the key person on the \nDemocratic side, Chairman Rockefeller, but also the chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Chairman Dorgan, to discuss this matter seriously, and \nthe Senator from Virginia, Mr. Warner, to discuss this, recognizing \nthat the conference committee is presumably where all of these issues \nare going to be hashed out given the fact that the House of \nRepresentatives adopted an amendment relating generally to the subject \nmatter but not the Ensign amendment at all.\n  So it would be my hope, with the kind of constructive conversation we \nhave had in discussing this, that that kind of constructive \nconversation can continue and we can get this matter resolved as part \nof the FAA reauthorization legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for his \ncomments, and I think his comments describe, No. 1, the rather \ncomplicated set of issues--slot rules, perimeter rules for Washington \nNational, which are rather complicated, somewhat controversial. Yet I \nthink he knows and I know and everyone understands that when there is a \nconference on the FAA reauthorization bill, the House brings to that \nconference some provisions the House has completed on slot rules.\n  So it is going to be an open discussion, and it seems to me all of us \nunderstand that things change, and the slot and perimeter rules will \nalways be a subject of change. My expectation is there will be a change \ncoming out of that conference.\n  I think the discussion we had last evening, as all of us work \ntogether trying to understand what is the optimum solution that relates \nto the needs of all of the interests concerned, is something we can and \nshould strive to achieve, and I think we will do that.\n  So I appreciate the cooperation of the Senator from Arizona and \ncertainly the strong feelings of the Senator from Virginia. My guess is \nthat this will get resolved in the right way because I think all of us \nunderstand the good will here to do it, and that will allow us--in \norder to unlock this bill and get it finished Monday night, we needed \nto try to find a way to reach a common ending here. And if we can--and \nwe will, I believe--on Monday evening finalize this bill, that will be \na significant achievement at long, long last.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  I want to talk about energy policy. I wanted to spend a little time \nspeaking about another important subject. Right now, this Congress is \nvery focused on health care, all the time these days, and for good \nreason because I think the health care debate is reaching a conclusion. \nIt will get finished perhaps Sunday or Monday in the House and then \ntaken up next week here in the Senate. But there is another issue out \nthere that has had a lot of discussion, and it is very big, important, \ncontroversial, and urgent, in my judgment, and that is the subject of \nenergy and climate change. There is a great deal of discussion about \nthe intersection of energy and climate change; that is, energy security \nfor our country and trying to protect our planet from climate change.\n  Typically, most of us do not think much about energy. We just use it, \nand we assume it comes from somewhere. But we use it, and we are \npleased to be able to have access to it. Starting in the very early \nhours of the morning, when an electric alarm goes off, a sleepy hand \nreaches over and shuts off the alarm and then turns on a light and then \nperhaps even turns on a television or a radio. Then in many households, \nprobably uses an electric toothbrush, a toaster, a coffee pot, and \nmore. For those who shower in the morning, a hot water heater keeps \nthat water nice and hot. For those who work really hard, of course, \nthey shower after work, but all in all, it is the same hot water \nheater. And we do this all day long. We just take advantage of flipping \na switch and a light goes on and putting a key in an ignition and the \nengine starts, but not realizing that all of this is made possible by \nenergy, and we use a lot of it.\n  We had a circumstance in the Washington, DC, area a few years ago \nwhen a lot of homes were out of electricity, I should say, for upwards \nof a week. You know, only then did people understand what role it plays \nin their lives. All of a sudden, there was no television, no lights at \nnight, or no hot water. So then people understood the importance and \nthe role of energy.\n  So here is this issue of energy security. We import a lot of our oil \nfrom outside of our country. A substantial amount of the oil reserves \nin the world is produced in countries that don't like us very well. So \nis that a security issue? I think it is, and we ought to worry about \nthat--being less dependent on others for our energy. Particularly in a \nday and age of terrorism, we\n\n[[Page S1765]]\n\nshould be more concerned about the issue of national energy security.\n  Even as we do that and work on the issue of energy security, we are \nfaced with questions about how we protect our planet. We now understand \nfrom the wide consensus of scientists is there is something happening \nto the global climate. Much of it is related to the amount of \nCO2 and other greenhouse gases that are emitted into the \natmosphere from man-made sources. So how do we have a future that \naddresses our energy production and use and that reduces the \nCO2 to bring about a lower carbon future in order to protect \nour planet?\n  These two pieces must fit together and relate to each other: How do \nyou promote greater energy security and how do you protect the planet \nwith respect to global climate change?\n  Well, with energy security, there are about three major ways: one, \nyou produce more energy; two, you conserve more energy and use it more \nefficiently in all kinds of ways; and three, you maximize renewable \nenergy, even as you produce more from traditional sources. With respect \nto climate change, you take a look at what are the carbon emissions \nfrom fossil energy sources and then find ways to lower those emissions.\n\n  I want to talk a little about the dilemma we have, and I have spoken \nabout it before. We wrote a bill in the Senate Energy Committee last \nJune. We passed it out on a bipartisan vote, and it has been \nlanguishing on the Senate calendar ever since. The reason it has \nlanguished and not been brought to the floor of the Senate is because \nthere is another group in this Chamber who says: We will not accept \nworking on an energy bill--even though the bill, by the way, lowers \ncarbon emissions and is taking steps to do exactly what you would do to \nactually reduce carbon. Even though that is the case, we have a group \nof other folks in this Chamber who say: We do not intend to allow an \nenergy bill to come to the floor unless it is part of a cap-and-trade \nclimate change bill. Well, I want to talk about that a bit.\n  My colleague, this past week--I probably will not name him--but, \naccording to this article, ``came out swinging . . . against the idea \nof passing just an energy bill.''\n\n       ``It's the `kick the can down the road' approach,'' said \n     [one of our colleagues]. ``It's putting off to another \n     Congress what really needs to be done comprehensively. I \n     don't think you'll ever have energy independence the way I \n     want until you start dealing with carbon pollution and \n     pricing carbon. The two are interconnected.''\n\n  He pledged to fight against bringing the Energy and Natural Resources \nbill to the floor of the Senate. Then he said it is a ``half-[blank]'' \napproach bill, and so on.\n  He is wrong. Everybody has a right to be wrong, of course, but he is \nwrong. The bill the Energy Committee passed actually reduces carbon \nemissions. If you want to reduce carbon emissions, you can have a \ndebate in here about targets and timetables. But it is the actual \nenergy policies that reduce carbon. That is exactly what we did in the \nEnergy bill.\n  That Energy bill will maximize the production of energy where the \nwind blows and the Sun shines. If you can maximize renewable energy \nfrom the wind and the Sun, then you dramatically reduce carbon. The \nonly way you can do that is to decide as a country: Here is where we \nwant to go.\n  It is interesting to me that if you ask someone about Social Security \nor Medicare or a number of other things 50 years from now, they will \ngive you their estimates of this or that. Then you ask them this: What \nkind of an energy future do you want America to have? What do we aspire \nto achieve? How will we use energy 50 years from now? They do not have \nthe foggiest idea. They have not thought much about it. Well, they \nshould, and we should.\n  But here is the situation. I feel we ought to produce more here at \nhome. We ought to conserve more. We ought to promote much greater \nefficiency. We ought to maximize the use of renewable energy. We ought \nto do all those things. But I feel we ought to find ways to put caps on \ncarbon. I also am willing to price carbon. I think a price signal on \ncarbon is important.\n  What I do not support, and have never supported, is offering a \ntrillion dollar carbon securities market to Wall Street so they can \ntrade carbon securities on Monday and Tuesday--with their inevitable \nbubble of speculation--and then tell us on Thursday and Friday how much \nour energy is going to cost, as a result of the trades they made early \nin the week. I have no interest in doing this, given the history of \nwhat has happened on Wall Street, with the bubbles; and there have been \nplenty of them. The last bubble threw us right into the ditch as a \nresult of the most unbelievable avarice and greed and speculative \nbehavior we have seen in this country in about six or eight decades. I \nhave no interest in saying to them: Here is a new trillion dollar \ncarbon security market. You all grab it and trade it. By the way, they \nare already prepared to trade carbon derivatives--and probably very \nquickly synthetic derivatives. I have no interest in helping them do \nthat.\n  But that is not the only way to address this issue. We could consider \nother options. We can do a carbon fee. We can do some sort of hybrid \napproach in which there are auctions by the government, just as we \nauction T-bills. There are other ways to do that. I support a cap on \ncarbon, and I support finding a way to price carbon. I just do not, and \nwill not, support a new carbon securities market for Wall Street to \ndecide what the price of carbon is going to be.\n  Having said all that, my hope is that perhaps we all could get \ntogether and bring the Energy bill to the floor that actually takes \nsteps to reduce carbon. By the way, if you are opposed to that, you are \napparently opposed to reducing carbon. Bring that bill to the floor--\nand if somebody here wants to do cap and trade, have them offer an \namendment and try to bolt that amendment onto the bill. If they have \nthe votes, good for them. I am willing to vote for an amendment that \nputs a price on carbon when a bill comes to the floor. I will consider \nvoting for something that caps carbon and puts a price on carbon. Yet, \nI will not vote for cap and trade with Wall Street manipulation. I will \nvote for the underlying Energy bill, which should be done because that \nis the way you begin to lower carbon.\n  There are many important aspects of the Senate Energy bill. We build \nan interstate highway of transmission capability so you can gather the \nenergy from the wind where the wind blows and then send it on \ntransmission lines to the load centers that need it. The same is true \nwith solar energy. We would have the first ever national renewable \nenergy standard in the history of this country--the first ever--saying \n15 percent of electricity must be produced from renewable sources. I \nwould offer an amendment on the floor that would take that to 20 \npercent. I believe it should be at least 20 percent.\n  We have provisions to support building retrofits and greater \nefficiency. We do all of the things: maximize renewable with a national \nRES, support the development of an interstate transmission capability \nand more. Why on Earth, then, would they oppose bringing that bill to \nthe floor, to do exactly what they suggest has to be done ultimately to \nmeet the targets they want to propose? I want to mention, as we deal \nwith this issue--the very fact there is an urgency with respect to \nenergy and also climate change--the very fact that urgency exists means \nthere are a lot of things going on.\n  I want to describe some of them that I think are very positive. I \nwant to do that because in this Chamber on health care and virtually \nevery other subject, most of what is discussed is negative. I \nunderstand that problem. That is what we work on. We work on the things \nthat do not work. We find out what is wrong and debate that. And the \nold saying that I have described often: Bad news travels half way \naround the world before good news gets its shoes on--is true in this \nChamber as well. It is what sells. But there is a lot of good news.\n  Let me describe some good news with respect to energy and climate \nchange. First, in terms of the production of oil, we have had some \nimportant successes. In North Dakota, my home State, the U.S. \nGeological Survey has identified the largest reserve of oil that is \nrecoverable using today's technology that they have ever surveyed in \nthe history of the lower 48 States--4.3 billion barrels of technically \nrecoverable oil. Here is how they get it. It is a 100-foot seam called \nthe Bakken Shale which is about\n\n[[Page S1766]]\n\n10,000 feet below the Earth. They punch a hole in the planet with a \nlittle drilling rig. They go down 2 miles, make a big curve, and go out \n2 miles. So they have one drilling rig. They are drilling a well down 2 \nmiles, take a big curve out 2 miles, and then hydrofracture with high-\npressure solution. With that, the oil begins to seep, and they pump the \noil out. In North Dakota, they drill a new well about every 30 days.\n  We have 100 drilling rigs in North Dakota right now. Last year, for \nthe first time in a long, long, long time, we actually produced more \noil than we did in previous years. Over decades, we have been on a slow \ndecline in production. But not last year because we are discovering \nmore oil and more natural gas. So there is good news in those areas.\n  With respect to wind, take a look at wind turbines that are going up \nall across this country. We are seeing the same with solar. There is so \nmuch good news about the production of energy.\n  Let me tell you about the inventiveness because I think inventiveness \nis going to solve some of these problems. We have people coming in all \nthe time wanting to get through what is called the valley of death, if \nthey have a new idea. A new idea needs to get sustained funding and \nsupport in order to demonstrate at scale. Often it is hard to get the \nmoney. That is part of the problem in terms of the valley of death that \nthey have to go through. Some of them never make it through.\n\n  There is a person who is developing synthetic microbes that can be \nused to consume, or in layman's terms, eat the coal and leave methane \nin its wake. Wouldn't that be interesting: synthetic microbes that \nwould turn a coal seam into methane.\n  There is a person who has what he described as a lollipop-shaped \nmicrobe they discovered that breaks cellulose more efficiently than any \nother known microbe that would then make cellulosic ethanol that you \nwould put in your car that is one-third less expensive. That would be a \nbig deal. I do not know whether it works, but they claim it does.\n  I have had a presentation by a guy who says he has a diesel engine \nthat gets 100 miles to the gallon that is being tested. We have had \npresentations from a guy who has invented a process for taking the flue \ngas from a coal plant, mineralizing it, and turning it into a product \nthat is harder than concrete which also contains CO2. So you \nget rid of the CO2, which is the problem, by creating a \nproduct that has value that is harder than concrete.\n  We have projects around the country now of taking the CO2 \nfrom a power plant and using the CO2 to produce algae--that \nsingle-cell pond scum that you see in wastewater, the green stuff--\nproducing algae with CO2 and then harvesting the algae for \ndiesel fuel. Isn't that something? You take a problem and you turn it \ninto a fuel.\n  We have another group working on algae that excretes the lipids, and \nwith very little treatment it becomes the fuel. There are so many \npeople doing so many things. I had a group come in to tell me about \ntheir new patent that will make a different kind of wind tower--blades \nand turbines--that they believe will reduce the cost of producing \nenergy from wind towers by 50 percent. Well, maybe that is the better \nmouse trap. Maybe the world will beat a path to their door. I do not \nknow.\n  But there are so many breathless new ideas that are being discovered. \nOur national laboratories are studying the guts system of a termite. \nWhy are we studying 200 strains of bacteria in the guts system of a \ntermite? Because when a termite eats your house, a termite creates \nmethane gas. Well, that is not so unusual. That happens with a lot of \norganisms that eat something. But it also produces hydrogen. This \nlittle bug that eats your home produces hydrogen. If we can figure out \na way to turn wood into fuel, just as a termite does, then we would \nhave something interesting and important, and those experiments go on.\n  We can take the CO2 from a coal-fired power plant, \ntransport it, and invest that into oil wells and pull up much more oil \nfrom wells that were nearly depleted. This is called enhanced oil \nrecovery and has been used for years. All of these things are happening \naround our country, and all of them, it seems to me, have very \ninteresting potential.\n  We had testimony at one of our hearings from a Ph.D. from Sandia \nNational Laboratory who talked about experiments they are doing there \nusing a sunlight heat engine and putting CO2 into one side, \nwater into the other side, fracturing the molecules, and then \nchemically recombining them and producing a fuel, water, and \nCO2. My point is this: There is a race to the finish here in \nthis country by a lot of inventive people to find new ways to produce \nnew energy and find new ways to be able to continue to use our abundant \nsources of energy while at the same time protecting the atmosphere and \nour planet. I am absolutely convinced that some of these ideas are \ngoing to be the ideas that represent the silver bullets.\n  We appropriated about $37 billion to the Department of Energy through \nthe Recovery Act funding, which has been described as the largest \nventure capital firm in energy in the history of humankind. Through the \nleadership of Dr. Chu, Matt Rogers and others at DOE, they are funding \na lot of inventive, interesting new approaches to address these diverse \nenergy challenges. How do you continue to use current fossil energy \nwhile protecting our planet? How do you continue to use coal through \ngeologic sequestration or beneficial use of CO2? How do you \ncreate new kinds of fuels? How do you expand the use of renewables? All \nof these things are happening now, and all of them, I think, are \nexciting, and I think will have a profound impact on what we do 5, 10, \n25, and 50 years from now.\n  We are working very hard to try to electrify the automobile fleet, \nand I believe in the years ahead we will see a much greater movement to \na predominantly electric vehicle fleet. So those are the kinds of \nchanges we will see.\n  I know this is important for two reasons. We stick holes in the \nEarth, and we suck out about 85 million barrels a day. We also know \nthat of that roughly 85 million barrels a day, one-fourth of it needs \nto come to the United States of America because that is our appetite \nfor that oil. We are a country whose people depend on and whose economy \nruns on oil and on energy.\n  We know the Chinese and Indians look at this, and in India and China, \nwe know there are people who want to drive vehicles. In the very near \nfuture, I expect that hundreds of millions of additional people will be \ndriving cars around this planet. They are going to want to find a gas \nstation to stop at once a week to put fuel in those cars.\n  What does that mean for us, for our supply of energy that is \nnecessary to run the American economy? That is why all of these things \nare important.\n  Let me go back to where I started. We are having this debate about \nwhether the Energy bill that was passed out of the Senate Energy \nCommittee on a bipartisan basis should come to the floor of the Senate. \nMy response is, yes, it should come to the floor of the Senate. I am a \nlittle tired of somebody saying it is not a worthwhile bill to debate. \nThis person isn't on the Energy Committee. This person doesn't know the \nspecifics of that bill or at least misrepresents it in a press article.\n  If there are those who wish to have a cap-and-trade debate in the \nChamber, let them come, but let's bring the Energy bill to the floor. \nThat is the way the Senate works. You work a bill up through the Energy \nCommittee, doing something you think is good for the country. In this \ncase, our bill increases energy security and begins to reduce carbon \nemissions. We should bring that bill to the floor through the regular \norder. Then, if somebody wishes to offer amendments to cap carbon, I \nwill be supportive of those amendments. If somebody wants to offer \namendments to put a price on carbon, I could be supportive of that. \nHowever, I will not support the aspect of cap and trade which creates a \nfurther abyss by giving Wall Street a $1 trillion carbon security \nmarket with which to trade for our energy future.\n  I know I have given this speech five or six times, the first five \ntimes to no avail. Perhaps, I hope, now that we are nearing D-day, \nwherein if we don't get an energy bill to the floor, we will have \nfinished last year and this year having done nothing about what I think \nis an urgent national need. We will not have taken steps to bring about \ngreater energy security and doing the kind of things that are necessary \nto reduce carbon emissions.\n  The Senate Energy Bill takes both of those steps. The fact is, we \nhave now\n\n[[Page S1767]]\n\nlost nearly a year's time because others have wanted to bolt on cap-\nand-trade provision, or they won't allow it to come to the floor unless \nthey bring their cap-and-trade proposal to the floor.\n  Understand that I am in favor of capping carbon. I am willing to \nprice carbon. However, I am not willing to agree that we ought to \nabandon the work of the committee which actually begins to reduce \ncarbon. I am also not willing to agree, given Wall Street's recent \nhistory, to dive into a pool of carbon derivatives with carbon \nsecurities so they can determine our energy pricing future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to go back to the subject my \ncolleague, Senator McCain, was discussing earlier today. He had printed \nin the Congressional Record a letter sent by the Governor of the State \nof Arizona to the Speaker and to the majority leader of the Senate \nrelating to the health care legislation, imploring them not to impose \nthe new mandates that would cost the State of Arizona additional funds \nfor covering Medicaid patients and urging the Members of the \nCongressional delegation to reject the legislation that does that.\n  It is not clear yet, because it has been hard to go through the \nentire legislation, what all the changes are in the last bill, but I do \nwish to discuss those that have at least been identified by the staff \nwho have had an opportunity to read the bill since it was put on the \nWeb site yesterday.\n  To back up a little bit, let's remember there was a bill that passed \nthe House of Representatives. Then there was a bill that came out of \nthe Finance Committee in the Senate. It was combined with the bill that \ncame out of the HELP Committee in the Senate. This was done behind \nclosed doors. It was essentially done by the majority leader in the \nSenate. That bill was not the subject of the normal committee process, \nbut it was presented to the Senate floor. The Senate then modified that \nlegislation and voted on it and sent that back to the House of \nRepresentatives. So the latest bill represents a piece of legislation \ndrafted by representatives of the White House, the Senate, and \nprimarily the House of Representatives, behind closed doors, primarily \nto add elements to it that the President desired and to ``fix'' parts \nof the Senate bill that Members of the House of Representatives did not \nwant.\n  There is an editorial in the Wall Street Journal today called ``March \nMadness,'' which discusses this a little bit. In the first paragraph \nthey say:\n\n       No bribe is too costly, no deal too cynical, no last-minute \n     rewrite too blatant.\n\n  The first sentence says:\n\n       Has there ever been a political spectacle like the final \n     throes of Obama care?\n\n  I admit I have never seen anything in my roughly 24 years in the \nCongress such as this, either in terms of substance or in terms of \nprocess.\n  I note that several days ago the President said several times he \nwants an up-or-down vote on this legislation. ``We just ask for an up-\nor-down vote,'' he said. But it now turns out the President and his \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives don't want an up-or-down \nvote. In fact, yesterday, on a purely party-line basis, Democrats \ndefeated, 222 to 200--some Democrats supporting the Republican \nresolution--but defeated the resolution offered by Republicans that \nwould have required them to vote up or down on the Senate bill.\n  So what the President requested--an up-or-down vote--is, in fact, not \ngoing to occur in the House. Instead, they are going to pretend the \nSenate bill has been passed. The word they use is ``deem.'' We are \ngoing to deem it passed. We are not going to vote on it, but it is \ngoing to be passed anyway. One might say: How on Earth could that \nhappen?\n  Well, there is a way they have figured out in which they can include \nthe Senate-passed bill in a rule they will then pass, and by passing \nthe rule, they will deem the Senate bill passed and send it to the \nPresident and he would then sign it. Then, later, they will amend that \nbill through what they call the reconciliation process. But there is a \nlittle problem with that, too, because when the reconciliation bill \ncomes back over here, as the chairman of the Budget Committee has \nacknowledged, it will be changed. There are points of order that lie \nagainst it and those points of order will be upheld and potentially the \nbill could be amended as well so it will have to go back to the House \nof Representatives. The reality is, what the House Members are hoping \nwill correct the Senate-passed bill will not, in fact, do all they hope \nit will do.\n  The Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, told reporters last week: \n``Nobody wants to vote for the Senate bill.''\n  I guess this is the way they avoid that vote, by having the deeming. \nThey will assume it has passed, even though they haven't taken a vote \non it. The reason they don't want to vote on it is because it has a lot \nof bad features from their perspective--and I think from mine as well--\nbut their hope to fix all those bad features is going to fail as well.\n  This editorial I mentioned in the Journal points out one of them, and \nit is the House demand to delay the tax on insurance plans from 2013 to \n2018. That is something labor unions have very much wanted, and they \nwant to respond to labor unions. They note that Richard Trumka, who met \none on one with President Obama Wednesday--he is the head of the AFL-\nCIO--has wanted to accomplish this. The effect it would be to reduce \nSocial Security payroll tax revenues. The reconciliation bill expressly \nforbids any impact on Social Security. So that would be subject to a \npoint of order, and 41 Republicans have said we will vote to uphold the \npoints of order. So this particular change the labor unions very much \nwant in the taxation of the so-called Cadillac plans is not going to be \nable to be made in reconciliation. It will be subject to a point of \norder. The point of order will be sustained. The bill will have to go \nback to the House of Representatives. One of the big things they wanted \nto fix will not be fixable by reconciliation. That is just one example.\n\n  There are several changes we are aware of in the bill, and let me \nidentify those for my colleagues. I am sure there will be others we \nwill discover. Those of us who opposed the bill complained about the \nroughly $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes. Well, this latest bill increases \nthe taxes by over $70 billion. The taxes will now be increased by \nalmost $570 billion; to be precise, $569.2 billion. The Senate bill \nincreased taxes by $493.6 billion. So we have now about $77 billion \nmore taxes in this legislation than in the bill the Senate passed--$77 \nbillion in more taxes. The CBO has, of course, said these taxes will be \npassed on to the consumers of health care and the buyers of health \ninsurance through higher rates.\n  Medicare. Medicare was cut in the Senate bill by $464.6 billion, but \nunder this new bill, Medicare will be cut by $523.5 billion, obviously \nwell over $\\1/2\\ trillion, and much of that will be in the Medicare \nAdvantage area we have all been complaining about.\n  The individual mandate is the requirement that individuals will pay a \ntax if they don't buy a federally approved insurance policy. This is \ngoing to be raised by a couple billion dollars. The Senate bill had it \nat $15 billion. It is now going to be $17 billion. I don't know whether \nthat is because they assume more people will fail to buy the policy \nand, therefore, will simply be collecting more revenue or the amount of \nthe tax has been increased. Either way, it is an individual tax \nincrease, all of which, of course, is administered by the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  The employer mandate. This imposes $52 billion in new taxes on \nemployers that don't offer government-approved insurance. That is \nalmost double from the Senate bill, which was at $27 billion. I can \nguarantee the small business folks are up in arms about this additional \nnew tax on employers.\n  I mentioned the Medicare Advantage plans. They are now cut by $131.9 \nbillion. The Senate bill cut them by $118.1 billion.\n  The payroll taxes, which is probably the most destructive of all \nthese tax increases because it goes right to job creation, are \nincreased. These are now $210 billion. All these figures are over 10 \nyears. The Senate bill was $86.8 billion, and that was enough. But \nthink about this: From $86 billion in the Senate-passed bill, the \nhigher payroll taxes\n\n[[Page S1768]]\n\nare now up to $210 billion--so from $86 billion to $210 billion. That \nis 2\\1/2\\ times higher, and that is a direct tax on employment.\n  We just considered a bill that gives a break to employers, a payroll \ntax break to employers that hire people who have been unemployed. We \nunderstand there is a direct relationship between how much an employer \npays in payroll taxes and how many people he can afford to hire or to \nretain--and I say ``he''--about half of small businesses are women \nowned, so I should obviously say he or she. We understand the \nrelationship between the amount of payroll tax you have to pay and the \namount of people you can afford to hire. Yet, in this legislation, we \nnow impose $210 billion worth of new payroll taxes on employers. This \nwill be a job killer. Whatever minuscule efforts we have been making in \nthese other stimulus plans to try to increase jobs, with not much \neffect, I might say, and at huge cost per job, all that gets wiped out \nwhen you impose this kind of tax directly on hiring or retaining \nemployees.\n  Then there is the 40-percent excise tax on the high-premium plans. \nThis raises $32 billion. As I say, this is a problem because \nreconciliation, by its terms--this isn't a matter of interpretation. \nReconciliation precludes an effect on Social Security. That is the way \nit is written. You cannot affect Social Security in reconciliation. \nBecause of the effect that this provision has, this is not going to be \nable to remain in the bill.\n  All these estimates, according to CBO, are preliminary. In fact, I \nthink their phrase was that there is substantial uncertainty in their \nestimates. So these are not final estimates. Never before, I think, \nhave we passed a bill without having final estimates from the CBO.\n  It is interesting to me that as much as folks don't like the IRS, we \nare now going to have to add about 16,500 additional IRS employees, at \na cost of up to $10 billion, just to administer the IRS-enforced \nprovisions of this health care legislation. For example, every citizen \nis required to buy an insurance policy. There are certain exceptions, \ndepending upon your wealth, but you have to buy an insurance policy the \ngovernment identifies for you. If you do not, then you have to pay a \ntax, and that is administered through the Internal Revenue Service. \nThat is why they are going to need 16,500 more employees. How do you \nlike that for increasing the size and the power of the Federal \nGovernment?\n\n  Let me mention some of the other effects of the legislation. One of \nthe payroll tax increases is a brand new tax. It is destructive, \nespecially to senior citizens or others who have investment income \nbecause, for the first time in our history, we would be applying the \nMedicare payroll tax to all investment income of people with incomes \nover $200,000. That includes, as I said, investment income--dividends, \ncapital gains, income of that sort. We have never taxed that in the \npast.\n  Moreover, this is going to hit people with far less income very \nquickly because it is not indexed for inflation. Just as the \nalternative minimum tax, which originally applied to about 218 \nmillionaires, was never intended to apply to the vast majority of \nmiddle-income Americans, now it applies to over 23 million American \ntaxpayers because we did not index it for inflation. Likewise, this \ntax, too, will be applied to more and more Americans as the years go \non.\n  I mentioned the higher premiums. The Congressional Budget Office has \nspecifically said these taxes will be passed on to all Americans. The \ntaxes are imposed in a variety of ways: If you have insurance, you get \ntaxed. If you do not have insurance, you get taxed. If you are an \nemployer, you get taxed. If you do not have insurance for your \nemployees, you get taxed. If you do and one of your employees goes to \nan exchange and is subsidized, you get taxed. You get taxed if you need \na new device, such as a heart stent or a diabetes pump, even a \nwheelchair, if you need new drugs to take care of you. Why would we \nimpose taxes? We are trying to help people with their health care. You \nneed medical devices and you need pharmaceutical products to help you \nstay well or get better. Why tax those items? It is just beyond \nimagination.\n  I can imagine why we would tax alcohol or tobacco or some other sin, \nbut the very things we need to make us healthy we are going to tax. \nAmazing.\n  We are going to tax insurance. Of course, that immediately gets \npassed on to you in the form of higher insurance premiums, which is one \nof the reasons that CBO says, yes, insurance premiums will go up under \nthis bill. Why do that? Because insurance companies are bad. This is \nbrilliant. This is like shooting yourself in the foot. We do not like \ninsurance companies, so we are going to tax them and then turn right \naround and add that tax to your insurance premiums. The politicians \nthen say: We punished the insurance companies. We are on your side. \nRight, they are on your side so they make sure you pay higher insurance \npremiums.\n  What does the Congressional Budget Office say? We are not even \ntalking about where your employer provides the insurance. Take the \nindividual insurance market where you have to buy it; the premiums as a \nresult of the legislation will go up between 10 and 13 percent, and in \nsome States it is a lot more than that.\n  Oliver Wyman Group, which is a very respected third party, has \nestimated that it is in the neighborhood of 50 percent for most folks, \nand in my State of Arizona it is 72 percent in insurance premiums. That \nis wrong. When Congress passes legislation that we are warned in \nadvance is going to increase insurance premiums, whether it is 10 \npercent or 70 percent because of the legislation, it is wrong to pass \nthat kind of legislation. Even in the nonprivate markets, CBO says the \ncost will go up because of medical inflation. We are not bringing \ninsurance premiums down.\n  There will be more lost jobs. This bill nearly triples the penalty on \nbusinesses that cannot afford to provide their workers with health care \ncoverage. It was $750. Now it is $2,000 for every worker. This applies \nto part-time workers as well as full-time workers. This does not make \nsense. Businesses are trying to stay in business, keep people on their \npayroll or, hopefully, one of these days hire new people. Yet we impose \nthese kinds of burdens on them. This is wrong.\n  What about the idea that we are going to affect the deficit? First of \nall, as I said, the Congressional Budget Office has said their \nestimates are subject to revision. They are offered with substantial \nuncertainty and are preliminary estimates only. They make these \nestimates based on what Congress gives them. If Congress includes in \nthe legislation a provision that says we will cut $500 billion from \nMedicare, then the Congressional Budget Office has to score that as a \n$500 billion cut to Medicare, even though about half of that cut is the \nsame kind of thing we have tried to do over the years to eliminate \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. Of course, if it could be done, it would have \nbeen done.\n  The President, when he talked about this over a year ago in his State \nof the Union speech, could have spent this last year cutting out a lot \nof waste, fraud, and abuse. If it is there to be cut out, he could have \ndone it. It is hard to do. But in the law, the way this has been \nwritten, it will be done; therefore, the Congressional Budget Office \nmust score it as having been accomplished. It is not going to happen. \nAs a result, this bill will be in deficit. It will not create the \nbudget surpluses.\n  Think about it. One of my friends said: This is a pretty neat deal. \nWe are going to add 30 million people to the insurance rolls and reduce \nthe size of the deficit. He said: I have a great idea. Let's get rid of \nthe deficit by insuring everybody in China. Of course, the absurdity of \nthe argument makes the point. You do not save money by spending money \nto insure more Americans. Every American understands that, which is why \nwhen we look at the surveys, they all laugh.\n  When they are asked the question: Do you think adding more people to \nthe insurance rolls and paying for that is going to reduce the deficit? \nThey say: Of course not, and it is ludicrous to suggest that it is.\n  I feel sorry for CBO that has to, with a straight face, say this will \nreduce the deficit. The only reason they have to say that, or can say \nit, is Congress gives a bill that says: You must assume it will reduce \nthe deficit because we\n\n[[Page S1769]]\n\nare going to make all of these savings in waste, fraud, and abuse. It \nwill not happen.\n  There are so many different gimmicks in it. Let me mention two: the \nphysician payment cliff for Medicaid whereby payments for primary care \nphysicians are increased for 2013 and 2014, and then it goes away. Do \nyou really think we are going to pay physicians at the same rate we are \npaying them today, or slightly increase the payments in 2013 and 2014, \nand then they are going to suffer a 22-percent or 23-percent cut every \nyear thereafter? Of course not. Yet that is how they balance this out. \nThey assume a 23-percent cut in physician payments. It is not going to \nhappen. It would be an abomination.\n  How do you with a straight face ask physicians to take a 23-percent \ncut in what they receive in reimbursements from the government? It is \nalready difficult for them. In fact, the Mayo Clinic in Phoenix says it \nhas to cut out many of the services and not take any additional \nMedicare patients because the reimbursement from the government is not \nenough to keep them in business.\n  By the thousands physicians are leaving the Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms. They cannot stay in it right now. Yet we are to assume we are \ngoing to cut them another 23 percent? It will not happen. Yet that is \nwhat the CBO must assume in making the budget projections.\n  The bill also hides the cost of filling in the so-called doughnut \nhole by not phasing it in. There are a whole variety of these gimmicks. \nI will mention one more.\n  This is the so-called CLASS Act, a long-term entitlement. They \ngenerate a bunch of revenue up front to make payments later on. \nHowever, the bill steals that money, reduces the cost of this new \nentitlement program, and never tells us how it is going to make it up \nlater when it has to pay for the CLASS Act. It is a Ponzi scheme. The \nfirst dollar in they use to take care of the last investor, and \neventually there isn't enough money to take care of the last investor, \nso that investor loses all the money, just like what happened with \nBernie Madoff. No idea how they are going to pay for the CLASS Act once \nthey use all the money they collected for it, spend it all on the new \nentitlement, and then have nothing in the till when they have to pay \noff benefits under the CLASS Act.\n  Social Security, same thing. They count the money twice. They say: We \nare going to extend the Social Security Program for 17 more years; it \nwill be viable. However, we are going to take the same money we are \napplying to that, and we are going to pay for this new entitlement out \nof it, $500 billion.\n  You cannot count the money twice, as the CMS Actuary pointed out.\n  The bill is rife with these gimmicks that say it is going to be \nbalanced. It is not going to be balanced. Everybody knows it is going \nto cost trillions of dollars. Mr. President, $2.3 trillion is a low \nestimate for the first 10 years of operation.\n  Let me close with a couple other points.\n  One of the things that has caused people so much angst about this is \nthe sweetheart deals. The Senate bill was stuffed with them. Our House \ncolleagues and, I might say, some of our Senate colleagues, too, said: \nThat is wrong; we are going to fix some of them. I applaud those who \nrealized, perhaps after the fact, but at least realized this was \ntotally inappropriate. Things such as the ``Cornhusker kickback'' to \nNebraska, that is being fixed in the bill. My guess is, even though \nsome of these may be subject to budgetary points of order, some of them \ncan be fixed through the reconciliation process. But there are still a \nbunch of them in the bill.\n  For those who said we have to take all of these sweetheart deals out \nof the Senate bill and fix that with reconciliation, no. Some are still \nthere, and there are new ones added.\n  We talked before about the ``Louisiana purchase.'' It is still in the \nbill. Medicare coverage for folks in Libby, MT, still in here. Mr. \nPresident, $100 million for a Connecticut hospital, still in here. \nThere is a new one. Tennessee, it turns out, is an important State in \nterms of votes in the House of Representatives. So Tennessee hospitals \nget more money for the so-called DSH payments, the disproportionate \nshare. Tennessee hospitals--is that going to stay in here?\n  Another one was put in to help North Dakota relating--this is a whole \nother story. We have now taken over student loans for college education \nin the health care bill. In case you did not realize, it is not just \nhealth care. After taking over GM, Chrysler, and insurance companies, \nAIG, and a bunch of other sectors, now we are going to take over \nstudent loans. That is going to be put in the health care bill.\n  It turns out that hurts banks. Obviously, banks have a lot of \nemployees who provide students with these loans. North Dakota has some \nbanks that were going to get hurt. At least one bank in North Dakota \nwas going to be able to continue to offer the student loans. To his \ncredit, I am informed the chairman of the Budget Committee, the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, said: Wait a minute, we cannot do that, so I will \ntry to get that out somehow or another. That is an appropriate thing to \ndo.\n  You see how this happens when bills are written behind closed doors \nand there is an effort to make sure there are enough votes to pass it? \nThey need to sweeten the pot, and this is the kind of thing that \nhappens. These are some of the provisions. I am sure we will discover \nothers that are in the bill.\n  One of my colleagues pointed out there are going to be some deals \nthat have been made that do not show up in this bill. He is going to be \nlooking for those deals wherever they do show up.\n  I note the last two items. We did not want to put more people in \nMedicaid, but there are another 2 million people in Medicaid. Still 23 \nmillion are uninsured after all is said and done. The whole idea was to \nget 30 million people more insured and try to reduce costs.\n  We know it does not reduce costs. It does not get all the people \ninsured, and those who are covered, the majority are put into the \nMedicaid Program that we know is broken.\n  Finally, the bill does not prohibit Federal funds flowing to \ninsurance plans that cover elective abortions. This is a matter of \nconcern to a great many people in both the House of Representatives and \nthe Senate. They did not try to fix it in the reconciliation bill. But \neven if they had, that would be subject to a point of order as well.\n  The bottom line is that this legislation, crafted behind closed doors \nyet again, is replete with special deals, is worse in virtually every \nrespect that I can see from the Senate bill. It increases the top line \nspending, increases taxes by maybe close to $70 billion or a little \nmore, cuts Medicare now by $523 billion, adds to the individual \nmandate, adds to the employer mandate, hurts Medicare Advantage plans \neven more, a much higher payroll tax--$210 billion increased payroll \ntax, a job killer--increases insurance premiums even more. It is hard \nto see how you can say that this is going to help the American people.\n  As the editorial in the Wall Street Journal that I cited before \nconcludes:\n\n       This is what happens when a willful President and his party \n     try to govern America from the ideological left, imposing a \n     reckless expansion of the entitlement state that most \n     Americans, and even dozens of Democrats in Congress, clearly \n     despise.\n\n  I hope, Mr. President, that colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives will have the courage to stand up and represent their \nconstituents rather than the President and the Speaker of the House. \nThey owe their obligation to respond to the message their constituents \nare sending: They want to stop this bill, to start over, and get it \nright.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I have only been in the Senate \nabout 3 years, but you don't have to be too quick around here to figure \nout that it is pretty easy to attack and to oppose and to try to stop \nthings.\n  I am fairly amazed at the number of people I see--and I will share \nsome letters of people from Ohio, from my home State, about this health \ncare bill and about what this means personally to them. I will do that \nin a second, but just putting aside ideological arguments and political \nattacks, these attacks that there is nothing good in this bill, it is a \ngovernment takeover, it is socialism, it is putting a government \nbureaucrat between you and your doctor--the same argument the John\n\n[[Page S1770]]\n\nBirch Society used against Medicare we are hearing again. I hear those \nthings, but I really never hear anything constructive.\n  They talk about the deals, forgetting about the deals they made when \nthey were in the majority, which were huge giveaways to the drug \ncompanies and to the insurance companies and giveaways to the oil \ncompanies and to these big companies that outsource jobs to China. \nWhoever had their hand out, whoever the special interests were, they \ngot what they wanted. Now I see my colleagues just shrink back and say \nhow horrible all this is. Well, they have nothing to offer.\n  They say: Let's stop; let's work together; let's start with a blank \nsheet of paper and do this over. Well, they have no intention of doing \nthat. We spent a year answering their objections, and we accepted 160 \nRepublican amendments in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, amendments from Senator McCain, Senator Alexander, Senator \nEnzi, Senator Burr, and Senator Coburn--from one Republican Senator \nafter another, one hundred sixty Republican amendments. It is never \nenough. They continue to oppose. But in the 8 years when President Bush \nwas here and in the several years when they were in the majority in \nboth Houses, the only thing consequential they could do for health care \nto insure the uninsured, to do anything, was to give hundreds--not tens \nof billions but hundreds of billions of dollars of giveaways to the \nNation's largest drug companies and insurance companies.\n  Then I hear my Senate colleagues talk about we are blowing a hole in \nthe budget. The fact is, the Congressional Budget Office--and the \nPresiding Officer understands this, because we all know the \nCongressional Budget Office is not comprised of Democrats or \nRepublicans; they are not on our side or their side; they are simply \naccountants and lawyers and actuarial people who play this straight--\nthe CBO says this bill more than pays for itself.\n  I wonder, Mr. President, if this water we drink here causes amnesia \nfor some of my colleagues because all of a sudden they are for \nbalancing the budget. But in 2000, when President Bush took office, \nthere was a budget surplus--a trillion-dollar budget surplus, year \nafter year, as far as the eye could see--and we had tax cuts for the \nrich that they never even tried to pay for, and they never even tried \nto pay for the Iraq war. Even Senator Simpson, one of the most \ndistinguished Senators of the Republican Party, who sat in this Chamber \nfor 18 years, said in the paper yesterday: Never, to my knowledge, have \nwe gone to war without paying for it. But they did that in those days, \nand I didn't hear my colleagues saying: Let's pay for this Iraq war, \nwhich cost us billions of dollars a month, month after month, year \nafter year. When they did the Medicare privatization--the giveaway to \nthe drug and insurance companies--they didn't try to pay for that \neither. But now they are saying we have to balance the budget. And I \nthink we do, and I know the Presiding Officer and his constituents in \nChesapeake and Arlington and Richmond think the same thing because we \ndo need to balance the budget. But I find it curious, when the CBO says \nthis actually creates a budget surplus--and they are not willing to \nbelieve them--that they were also not willing to pay for anything when \nthey were in the majority.\n  But putting that aside, this bill is too important for that. It is \ntoo important to throw political accusations around. What is \nparticularly important is what this bill means to individual Americans.\n  I hear my Republican friends talking about we are cutting Medicare. \nYet this is the party that opposed Medicare, the party that tried to \nprivatize Medicare. Yet they accuse us of cutting Medicare? I know \nnobody really believes that. They probably ought to quit saying it. It \nundercuts anything else they say because, as I say, nobody really \nbelieves that.\n  They say this bill was done behind closed doors. We had hearing after \nhearing, negotiation after negotiation, and floor debates. This has \nbeen going on, well, for 75 years, some would say, because Franklin \nRoosevelt tried to do it, Harry Truman tried to do it, John Kennedy \ntried to do it, Richard Nixon and Lyndon Johnson, who had some success \nbetween Kennedy and Nixon on Medicare.\n  Instead, my colleagues would rather talk about process and deals. In \nWashington, there is a buzz about process and deals, but in the country \nthere isn't because people in the country know why we are here and why \nwe are doing this. And as a result, Mr. President, let me take 5 or 10 \nminutes to read a handful of letters from constituents of mine because \nthis is really why we are doing this. We are not doing it to score \npolitical points: This may help the Democrats or it may help \nRepublicans win the election.\n  That doesn't really matter. It may help or it may hurt a reputation. \nNone of that matters. What matters is this bill, and this matters to so \nmany Americans.\n  I have read letters on the Senate floor for months now as we have \ndebated this bill, and what is most common in these letters are two \nthings. One of the most common things I hear from so many people is \nthat a year or 2 years before they wrote these letters, they would have \nsaid: I am satisfied with my health insurance; it seems to work pretty \nwell. Then something happened and they lost their job and then lost \ntheir insurance or they got sick and it was so expensive that the \ninsurance company cut them off or they had a child born with a \npreexisting condition and they couldn't get insurance.\n  The insurance company model is why this is important, because of what \nit does individually for people. In a sort of macro way, think about \nhow insurance companies operate. I have a lot of insurance companies in \nmy State. I have no malice aimed toward them or their executives. I \nthink their executives are paid too much. The CEOs in the average \nlargest 10 insurance companies make $11 million a year. When they are \ncutting people off from their insurance, I think that is a bit of an \noverreach.\n\n  But I also think the insurance companies, because they compete with \neach other, in a for-profit model, do things they probably would rather \nthey didn't have to do. Let me explain that for a moment. Insurance \ncompanies hire a whole bunch of bureaucrats to decide they do not want \nto insure potential customers. They look at all the new applicants, do \ntests, find out things about them, and these bureaucrats make the \ndecision: We don't want to insure that person because that person has a \npreexisting condition and will get sick and it will be expensive. So \nthey hire a bunch of bureaucrats to keep customers away. Then, on the \nother end, they hire a bunch of bureaucrats to deny claims of their \ncustomers when they get really sick sometimes.\n  So their business model is to keep customers away who are too \nexpensive, too costly, and to deny payments for those who actually get \nexpensive. That is their business model. That business model serves \ntheir profitability, to be sure, but that business model doesn't serve \nthe American people.\n  So while we will continue to use private insurance in this country \nfor health care--many countries in the world do, although no country \nuses private for-profit insurance. Many countries use private insurance \nto run their health care systems, in whole or in part, but they are \nnonprofit insurance companies. We will continue to use for-profit \ninsurance companies, but we are going to have a whole set of rules \naround what they do. No more denying care for a preexisting condition; \nno more putting a cap on coverage so that once you get sick and get \nexpensive, you could lose your insurance; people will be allowed to \nstay on their parents' insurance until they are 26--a whole host of \nthings. Eighty-five percent of the insurance premium dollar must go to \nhealth care, not to executive salaries and marketing and to hire all \nthose bureaucrats that the insurance companies do.\n  So that is the one thing mentioned by people in most of these \nletters, people who were satisfied with their insurance a year or 2 \nyears earlier but then found out it wasn't such good insurance.\n  The second thing in these letters--and a lot of this comes from \npeople in their early sixties--is many of them say they simply just \nneed to hang on until they reach 65 and become Medicare eligible \nbecause then they will have the security and stability of something \nthey trust.\n  As Senator Cardin of Maryland knows, government really can provide\n\n[[Page S1771]]\n\nhealth care, as it does with Medicare, as it does with Medicaid, as it \ndoes with TRICARE for all the Active military people in Maryland and \nVirginia and Ohio. Government knows how to do this and can do it very \nwell. But this bill is not a government takeover. It uses the parts of \ngovernment that run the insurance, that do the insurance now, but it is \ncertainly not a government takeover.\n  Let me now share these three letters from constituents, and then I \nwill turn it over to Senator Cardin.\n  This first letter is from Melanie, Erie County in northern Ohio, the \ncounty next to mine, along Lake Erie.\n\n       I have a health condition that requires me to be on thyroid \n     hormone replacement the rest of my life. But before my \n     condition was diagnosed, I had to undergo all kinds of tests. \n     And instead of being able to afford a 6 month and 1 year \n     prescription, I have to buy my pills monthly, depending if I \n     can afford them or not. We need a health care system that \n     doesn't let insurance companies decide whether I can afford \n     the medicine I need.\n\n  When someone is sick, they want to put their efforts into, how do I \nget well, not into, how can I afford this? Do I have to cut the pills \nin half? Do I have to take the pill every other day and hope that works \nout right? How am I going to pay for it this month?\n  There is a mind-boggling statistic that a woman in this country with \nbreast cancer, without insurance, is 40 percent more likely to die than \na woman with breast cancer who has insurance. Part of the reason for \nthat is the anxiety and the fear people have when they are sick and \ntrying to get well but who have to worry about so many other things in \ntheir lives and, most importantly, how are they going to pay for their \nmedical treatment and how is their family going to deal with this. This \nbill will obviously help with that.\n  Here is a letter from John from Hancock County, Findlay, OH, not too \nfar south of Toledo.\n\n       I am a 44-year-old diabetic who has had this condition for \n     43 years. Most people who know me thought I would never make \n     it past 25.\n\n  He was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 1, which is pretty \nastounding.\n\n       What my insurance company has done to me may make \n     bankruptcy my only option. In 2008, I needed a new insulin \n     pump. I filled out all the paperwork that was required by my \n     insurance company. I received my insulin pump via mail and \n     thought everything was all right. I received a bill from my \n     pump supply company for $8,500, along with the supplies to \n     use the pump for an additional $5,500. That is a $14,000 bill \n     that my insurance company said they would not pay because of \n     preexisting condition.\n\n  What is the point of health insurance? What is the point of a system \nwhere a man diagnosed as an infant with diabetes is faced with charges \nsuch as this, when diabetes is a terrible affliction that an increasing \nnumber of Americans have? We know how to manage it pretty well so that \npeople such as John can live a pretty long, productive life. Yet the \ninsurance company puts him through that. What will that do to his \ndiabetes and health generally, to have to worry about how he is \npossibly going to come up with the $14,000?\n  Here is the last letter. It comes from Hayden, a young woman who is a \nPeace Corps volunteer from Delaware County, outside Columbus. She e-\nmailed us from Thailand, but she is an Ohioan.\n\n       I am thousands of miles away from you. I am far away from \n     family, friends, and my hometown of Sunbury, OH. I am a \n     member of the U.S. Peace Corps in Thailand. I believe I help \n     to provide for the common good. I am creative, courageous and \n     compassionate, and I believe my abilities can make a \n     difference. In 15 months I will return to the United States, \n     and I would like nothing more than to continue to work in \n     community development. But I might not be able to.\n       Unfortunately, my life depends on two pills, each no bigger \n     than your smallest fingernail. Without insurance, the cost of \n     these two small pills is often more than my rent. And I am \n     unlikely to get insurance unless I go to work with a large \n     company.\n       Too many of my friends are in the same situation. We are \n     young and bright, products of an American school system that \n     has taught us to think independently and pursue our dreams. \n     We want to be entrepreneurs, researchers, and community \n     activists.\n       We need the opportunity to start our own ventures, to take \n     responsible risks, and to go out into our communities--\n\n  Work to start businesses such as the Presiding Officer has.\n\n       I work everyday to give voice to those who have none [in \n     the Peace Corps]. But today I need you to be my voice. I need \n     you to speak for my generation.\n       So please let me come home--\n\n  She writes, to Delaware, OH, now working in the Peace Corps in \nThailand; she e-mails:\n\n       . . . please let me come home to a system that is better \n     than the one we have now. My future depends on it.\n\n  She is serving this great country, the United States, in the Peace \nCorps is doing the right thing with her life. When she comes back to \nthe United States, I hope this bill is passed. I hope the President of \nthe United States has signed this bill, and we can be a better country \nas a result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I understand the Republican leader will be \ncoming to the floor and I will yield the floor as soon as the \nRepublican leader is here and then, after that, I ask that I will have \nthe opportunity to speak. But until the Republican leader comes to the \nfloor, let me compliment my colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown. He \npoints out this debate is about allowing every American to be able to \ntell their children that when they get sick, they will have an \nopportunity to see a doctor. It is about a small business owner who \nshould not have to chose between insuring his employees or maintaining \nhis workforce or expanding his workforce. It is about our seniors \nhaving to decide whether they can take a pill or have to split that \npill because they fall within the doughnut hole and cannot afford \nprescription medicines.\n  This debate is about whether we are, as a nation, going to be able to \nbring down the growth rate of health care costs and guarantee that \nevery American has access to affordable health care and also bring down \nour budget deficit in health care, which clearly we have to do in this \nNation.\n  I look forward to engaging in that debate. I came to the floor to \ntalk about the FAA bill, and I will do that after the Republican leader \nhas his opportunity on the floor, but I wished to thank Senator Brown \nfor pointing out how critically important this debate on health care is \nto the American people.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, well, it has come down to a few \nwavering votes.\n  That is what this year-long debate has come to: a handful of \nDemocrats had been holding out to see the final bill.\n  Now we have it.\n  Anyone who was waiting to see what the final bill meant for \ngovernment spending should vote no, because this bill spends even more.\n  Anyone waiting to see what the final bill meant for Medicare should \nvote no, because the Medicare cuts in this bill are even deeper than \nthe Senate bill that Speaker Pelosi said Democrats didn't want to vote \non.\n  Anyone waiting to see what the final bill meant for taxes should vote \nno, because the tax increases in this bill are even higher than the \nSenate bill.\n  Anyone waiting to see what the final bill did to the cost curve \nshould vote against this bill, because this bill is likely to bend the \ncost curve up even further than the Senate bill, not down.\n  If you were waiting for a bill without the CLASS Act in it--a \nprovision that even top Democrats describe as a Ponzi scheme, then you \nwill vote against this bill, because it is still in there.\n  If you were waiting to see if they had cut out the sweetheart deals \nthat have outraged the Nation and soured the public on the entire \nlegislative process, then you have to vote against this bill, because \nthere are even more of them in there now.\n  If you were waiting for a bill that costs less, then you will vote \nagainst this bill, because it costs even more than the last one.\n  And if you were waiting for a bill that wouldn't compel taxpayers to\n\n[[Page S1772]]\n\ncover the cost of abortions, then you will vote against this bill \nbecause this is, the National Right to Life Committee says, the most \nabortion-expansive piece of legislation ever to reach the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Americans are outraged at what is going on here: a bill that aims to \nshift a major segment of our economy into the hands of the government, \nand which accomplishes that goal by imposing crushing burdens on \nalready-struggling seniors, middle class families, and small \nbusinesses, is being rammed through Congress against the clear will of \nthe public. No amount of spin will change the fact that Medicare will \nbe deeply cut, insurance premiums and taxes will go up, the Federal \nbureaucracy will grow, and as demand increases, the quality of care in \nthis country will get worse and worse.\n  Taking a bill that House Democrats are too embarrassed to vote on, \nadding more than $50 billion in new taxes and slashing $60 billion more \nfrom our seniors' Medicare and keeping sweetheart deals may make some \nWashington Democrats ``giddy,'' but it is not reform.\n  This bill isn't an excuse to vote in favor of the Democrat plan for \nhealth care. It is a reason to vote against it.\n  Anyone who votes for this bill is clearly less concerned about \nresponding to their constituents than responding to the pressure \ntactics of Democrat leaders in Congress.\n  Some may have concluded that there is more merit in following the \ncajoling voices in Washington than the clear voices of their \nconstituents back home, more merit in choosing to side with Democrat \nleaders in their quest to ram this bill through over the wishes of the \nAmerican people.\n  Some may argue that the details we have seen since yesterday are \nreason to support it. But if anything is clear in this debate, it is \nthat yesterday's CBO score is conclusive proof that this health care \nbill is unsalvageable.\n  This is something the American people realized a long time ago, and \nnow they are counting on the final holdouts to vote on their behalf \nthis weekend. Now that they have seen the final bill, they can't \nunderstand why anyone would do otherwise.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, first, let me respond very briefly to the \nRepublican leader and say that, looking at what the Congressional \nBudget Office has said, the objective scorekeeper, it says this bill \nwill accomplish bringing down the growth rate of health care costs, it \nwill substantially increase the number of Americans who have access to \naffordable health care, and it will bring down our budget deficit. It \nwill bring down our budget deficit by over $130 billion during the \nfirst 10 years but $1.3 trillion during the second 10 years.\n  That is making progress on dealing with health care costs and \nbringing down the Federal budget deficit. The overwhelming majority of \nAmericans will see their health insurance premiums under this bill go \nup at a slower growth rate than they would otherwise go up, and it will \ncover another 31 million Americans who currently do not have health \ninsurance. They will be covered.\n  The appropriate question that should be asked is how will this \nlegislation affect health care versus what will happen if we do not get \nhealth care reform passed, and I think it is clear this bill will \nimprove health care for Americans and bring down the cost of health \ncare for Americans.\n  Mr. President, I take this time to talk about the modernization of \nthe Federal Aviation Administration bill, and I wish to first thank \nSenators Rockefeller, Hutchison, Dorgan, and so many others who have \nworked on the FAA Modernization Act. Our aviation system clearly needs \nmodernization. Air traffic control needs to get into modern technology. \nWhat I like most about this bill is what it does under facilities and \nequipment, the NextGen flight guidance system using GPS satellite-based \nguidance in order to control air traffic in America. That will \nsubstantially cut down travel time for air passengers.\n  It will save us energy, which we all are talking about. Let me give \none example that will demonstrate how dramatic it is to go to a GPS \nsystem. I think most Americans will be surprised to learn they are \nusing more high-tech technology in their cell phones than they are on \nairplanes in America. I think they would be surprised to learn that. \nBut this bill will allow us to put that type of satellite technology \ninto the way that we control air traffic in America.\n  As I said, it will save time for the passenger, save energy for our \nNation. To give an example, today a flight from Washington, DC, Reagan \nNational Airport to Boston takes about 537 miles of air travel and \nconsumes over 7,000 pounds of fuel. Using GPS, using NextGen, we can \nsave over 20 percent of the mileage traveled and the fuel consumed. We \nactually save over 1,000 pounds of fuel. That is just one flight. \nMultiply that times the hundreds of thousands of flights throughout our \nNation. We can make a substantial improvement on productivity, \nefficiency, and on energy consumption. We can significantly reduce the \nnumber of delays. The delay not only inconveniences that one passenger \nbut, as you know, the whole system gets thrown into a morass when we \nhave delays. We will have much better on-time arrival rates because it \nwill be a more predictable flight using NextGen GPS technology.\n  The legislation also provides for new technology training \nrequirements for pilots and air traffic controllers. That is the safety \nissue. We know air travel is safe, but we want to make it safer. This \nlegislation will give us the tools in order to do that.\n  It provides for grants for improvements to our airports around the \nNation. Let me talk for one moment about BWI, Thurgood Marshall \nAirport, the largest airport in the State of Maryland. We have over \n$400 million in projects ready to go to improve the efficiency of that \nairport. I know Senator Warner is aware, at Washington Dulles Airport, \nthey have projects ready to go that will help in regard to not just \nconvenience for the people who use that airport, which is important, \nbut also safety issues, providing for the types of improvements \nnecessary to deal with the newer aircraft that are coming on board. All \nthis will reduce noise in the community, which is also another issue \nthat is important and I am sure Senator Warner has heard about.\n  We had 21 million passengers in 2009 use BWI Thurgood Marshall \nAirport--21 million passengers. We have to keep up with that, and these \ngrant programs will allow us to do it. But let me tell you something \nelse. We have 35 other airports in Maryland. These are commercial, \nmunicipal, regional, and general aviation airports. These airports are \nin need of improvement. I have visited many of them.\n  That will not only be important for air traffic to our rural areas, \nbut it is also about economic development. This FAA modernization bill \nis about jobs. It is about creating new jobs. But it is also about \ncommunities being able to have the type of improvements to their \nregional airports that will allow businesses to come in and take \nadvantage of that regional airport, bringing jobs to parts of Maryland \nand our Nation that are, at times, difficult to find. Of course, today, \nwe need to find more jobs for America. This bill will help us in our \ngoal to increase the number of jobs.\n  I have talked about rural air service. I wish to talk particularly \nabout the essential air service, EAS, issue. I offered an amendment--\nand I wish to thank the managers for accepting that amendment--that \nwould extend the expiration date on the mileage determination for those \nrural airports that can qualify for essential air service.\n  That is important to the people of Hagerstown and that region because \nthat is the difference between the Hagerstown airport being eligible \nfor EAS help.\n  I have visited that airport in Hagerstown. I can tell you how \ncritically important it is to have passenger service. As a result of \nthat amendment, we have Cape Air service at Hagerstown. If we did not \nhave EAS, we would not\n\n[[Page S1773]]\n\nhave that passenger service. That means that airport is much more \nviable. That is the reason for the EAS program, the viability of \nairports in rural areas.\n  That is important for passenger service, but it is equally important \nto have a viable airport so it can bring in the type of economic \nactivities that are associated by having an airport close by. \nHagerstown, that area, has been able to attract industry relating to \nthe aircraft industry because it has an airport there.\n  I must tell you, I do not think they would have the type of airport \nif they did not have passenger service. So all of this comes together \nand helps us create jobs in a part of Maryland that otherwise could \nfind it difficult to bring in new economic opportunities.\n  This bill is very important. I thank the managers again for including \nthat amendment in the managers' package. It includes the passengers' \nbill of rights. Many of my colleagues have talked about the passengers' \nbill of rights. We all know about passengers being stranded on the \ntarmac for hours, strapped to their seats in a very uncomfortable \nposition. Well, that is inexcusable. Congress needs to speak to that.\n  I am pleased the passengers' bill of rights is included in this \nlegislation that will provide passengers with certain basic rights that \nairlines will need to adhere to.\n  I also am pleased it includes workers, pilots, flight attendants. \nThis bill is about helping not just the passengers but helping all \nthose who work in the industry. It will help all the workers. That is \nan important issue.\n  Before I yield the floor, I wish to talk about one other issue that I \nunderstand the distinguished Senator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, talked \nabout a little bit earlier; that is, amendments that are being \nconsidered and several have been filed, I understand negotiations are \ntaking place as to the modification of the perimeter and slot rules as \nit relates to Reagan National Airport.\n  Let me tell you, before we start fooling around with this, let's make \nit clear that my colleagues understand how important this issue is to \nthe people of the District, Virginia, and Maryland. In 1987, a peace \nagreement was entered into between the three jurisdictions and the \nthree airports that are located here: Washington Dulles International, \nBWI Thurgood Marshall Airport, and Reagan National Airport.\n  All were involved in that agreement because, quite frankly, having an \nairport located in a residential community is an issue of concern of \nsafety and noise and economic activities. So we have to be very mindful \nwhat is done at Reagan National.\n  For that reason, we entered into these restrictions in regard to the \nnumber of slots and the perimeters in which the flights originating \nfrom Reagan National can travel. They were carefully negotiated, and I \nurge us to be very careful about any modifications in those slots and \nperimeter rules.\n  We also created the Metropolitan Washington Airport Authority to deal \nwith Reagan National and Washington Dulles International. But then the \nslot issue and the perimeter issue were very important for the \ndevelopment of BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport in Maryland. These are \nvery delicate balances.\n  The growth airports are clearly Washington Dulles and BWI Thurgood \nMarshall. They have the capacity for growth; Reagan National does not. \nIt has a serious issue in regard to noise and safety to the community. \nWe know that. I would urge my colleagues to be very cautious on \nmodifying either the slot rule or the perimeter rule.\n  If we modify the slot rule, obviously, we are putting more traffic \ninto Reagan National that it cannot handle. The aviation experts have \ntold us that, that Reagan National is at capacity. It cannot handle \nmore slots. If you change the perimeter rule, then you are talking \nabout flights that currently go to cities such as Atlanta, Charlotte, \nPhiladelphia, Providence, Minneapolis, Miami, Boston, Detroit, \nCincinnati. All those flights are going to be affected.\n  So this is not about giving the airplanes more flexibility, it is \nabout affecting a delicate balance that currently exists when you have \nthree major airports located within a very short distance. I would urge \nmy colleague to be very cautious as we consider these amendments.\n  The ones I have seen so far are ones that I would oppose. I would \nurge my colleagues to respect the three jurisdictions in which these \nairports are located. We are not coming to you suggesting changes in \nthe slots and perimeter rules. We are not the ones coming to you asking \nfor it. It is our communities that are affected by the decisions. I \nwould hope my colleagues would respect the judgment of the Senators \nfrom Maryland and Virginia.\n  This is a very important bill. It is a very good bill. It modernizes \nour FAA. It provides for safety, convenience, and, as I said earlier, \nwill save time, save energy, and make our air traffic meet the growing \nneeds of those of who use our airports and Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we have reached a unanimous consent \nagreement, which I will read momentarily, with the minority and the \nmajority agreeing to the request. It is the way forward to a final vote \non the FAA reauthorization bill on Monday afternoon.\n  It is an important moment because it has taken a long while to get an \nFAA reauthorization bill through the Senate. Finally, on Monday that \nwill be achieved. It will accomplish many objectives that are so \nimportant for our country, air safety, and investment in \ninfrastructure, the passengers' bill of rights.\n  It is bipartisan. It represents all the best of what we should be \ndoing around here. It came out of the Commerce Committee on a \nbipartisan basis. We have had this long discussion.\n  There are a couple discussions prior to the completion of the bill, \nand one of them deals with the subject my colleague from Maryland was \njust describing. But let me read the unanimous consent request. It has \nbeen agreed to by the minority and the majority.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further amendments, \nother than those covered in this agreement, be in order to H.R. 1586; \nand that when the Senate resumes consideration of the bill on Monday, \nMarch 22, the time until 4:30 p.m. be for debate only, equally divided \nand controlled between Senators Rockefeller and Hutchison or their \ndesignees; further, that at 4:30 p.m., the Ensign amendment No. 3476 be \nreported for consideration and that it be modified with the changes at \nthe desk; with the time until 5:30 p.m. for debate with respect to that \namendment, and that the time be equally divided and controlled between \nSenators Warner and Kyl or their designees; that at 5:30 p.m., the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to amendment No. 3476, as modified, \nthat adoption of the amendment require an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold, and that if the amendment achieves that threshold, it be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be made and laid upon the table; \nthat if it does not achieve the threshold, then it be withdrawn; \nfurther, that it also be in order for the amendment to be withdrawn \nprior to the vote; that upon disposition of amendment No. 3476, as \nmodified, the pending McCain amendment No. 3527 be withdrawn; the \npending McCain amendment No. 3528, if not disposed of, the Senate then \nproceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that upon disposition of \nthe McCain amendment No. 3528, the managers' amendment, which is at the \ndesk and cleared by the managers and leaders, be considered and agreed \nto, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table; that the bill, as amended, be read a \nthird time, and the Senate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill; \nthat upon passage, the title amendment, which is at the desk, be \nconsidered and agreed to, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, that is a long unanimous consent request. \nThe potential would be only one vote on Monday or the potential might \nbe three votes or somewhere in that neighborhood. But it does, upon its \nexecution on Monday, allow us as a Senate to finish the FAA \nreauthorization bill. It has so much to commend\n\n[[Page S1774]]\n\nfor our country. I am pleased to have negotiated with so many people--\nSenator Hutchison, Senator Kyl on that side, Senator Warner and \nothers--that we were able to reach agreements so we will have a way \nforward dealing with only a couple controversial issues that will \nremain and then we will have final passage.\n  I know the Senator from Florida wishes to speak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/19/senate-section/article/S1774-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1774]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, I am here to speak on this FAA bill and \non an amendment that I filed on this bill concerning the space program.\n  For decades, the space shuttle has been a symbol for American \ninnovation and ingenuity and the pioneering spirit that has made our \nNation the most technologically advanced country in the world.\n  Today, our space program, however, stands at a crossroads, between \none project and the next. For years, we have had soaring aspirations \nabout space without funding. Now we have a plan that includes the money \nbut lacks the vision.\n  In our Nation's space program, we cannot have money without ambition. \nThe result will be directionless spending. As sure as winter follows \nfall, that directionless spending will lead to cuts in spending and \neventually, I believe, the demise of our space program.\n  In 2004, the Constellation Program was announced as a followup to the \nspace shuttle program. That vision was endorsed by Congress in 2005 and \nin 2008. In both years, we directed NASA to focus its efforts on \nreturning to the Moon by 2020 and someday sending Americans to Mars and \nworlds beyond.\n  In fact, I have here the public law that was passed just about a year \nand a half ago, October 15 of 2008. It is Public Law 110-422. If I may \nread from it, it says:\n\n       The Congress finds, on this, the 50th anniversary of the \n     establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration, the following:\n\n  It goes on to say that one of the points they find is:\n\n       Developing United States human space flight capabilities to \n     allow independent American access to the International Space \n     Station, and to explore beyond low Earth orbit, is a \n     strategically important national imperative, and all prudent \n     steps should thus be taken to bring the Orion Crew \n     Exploration Vehicle and Aries I Crew Launch Vehicle to full \n     operational capability as soon as possible and to ensure the \n     effective development of a United States heavy lift launch \n     capability as soon as possible and to ensure the effective \n     development of a United States heavy lift launch \n     capability for missions beyond low Earth orbit.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have that portion of the \npublic law printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds, on this, the 50th anniversary of the \n     establishment of the National Aeronautics and Space \n     Administration following:\n       (1) NASA is and should remain a multimission agency with a \n     balanced and robust set of core missions in science, \n     aeronautics, and human space flight and exploration.\n       (2) Investment in NASA's programs will promote innovation \n     through research and development, and will improve the \n     competitiveness of the United States.\n       (3) Investment in NASA's programs, like investments in \n     other Federal science and technology activities, is an \n     investment in our future.\n       (4) Properly structured, NASA's activities can contribute \n     to an improved quality of life, economic vitality, United \n     States leadership in peaceful cooperation with other nations \n     on challenging undertakings in science and technology, \n     national security, and the advancement of knowledge.\n       (5) NASA should assume a leadership role in a cooperative \n     international Earth observations and research effort to \n     address key research issues associated with climate change \n     and its impacts on the Earth system.\n       (6) NASA should undertake a program of aeronautical \n     research, development, and where appropriate demonstration \n     activities with the overarching goals of--\n       (A) ensuring that the Nation's future air transportation \n     system can handle up to 3 times the current travel demand and \n     incorporate new vehicle types with no degradation in safety \n     or adverse environmental impact on local communities;\n       (B) protecting the environment;\n       (C) promoting the security of the Nation; and\n       (D) retaining the leadership of the United States in global \n     aviation.\n       (7) Human and robotic exploration of the solar system will \n     be a significant long-term undertaking of humanity in the \n     21st century and beyond, and it is in the national interest \n     that the United States should assume a leadership role in a \n     cooperative international exploration initiative.\n       (8) Developing United States human space flight \n     capabilities to allow independent American access to the \n     International Space Station, and to explore beyond low Earth \n     orbit, is a strategically important national imperative, and \n     all prudent steps should thus be taken to bring the Orion \n     Crew Exploration Vehicle and Ares I Crew Launch Vehicle to \n     full operational capability as soon as possible and to ensure \n     the effective development of a United States heavy lift \n     launch capability for missions beyond low Earth orbit.\n       (9) NASA's scientific research activities have contributed \n     much to the advancement of knowledge, provided societal \n     benefits, and helped train the next generation of scientists \n     and engineers, and those activities should continue to be an \n     important priority.\n       (10) NASA should make a sustained commitment to a robust \n     long-term technology development activity. Such investments \n     represent the critically important ``seed corn'' on which \n     NASA's ability to carry out challenging and productive \n     missions in the future will depend.\n       (11) NASA, through its pursuit of challenging and relevant \n     activities, can provide an important stimulus to the next \n     generation to pursue careers in science, technology, \n     engineering, and mathematics.\n       (12) Commercial activities have substantially contributed \n     to the strength of both the United States space program and \n     the national economy, and the development of a healthy and \n     robust United States commercial space sector should continue \n     to be encouraged.\n       (13) It is in the national interest for the United States \n     to have an export control policy that protects the national \n     security while also enabling the United States aerospace \n     industry to compete effectively in the global market place \n     and the United States to undertake cooperative programs in \n     science and human space flight in an effective and efficient \n     manner.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. That was a year and a half ago. This is now. The \nPresident's 2011 budget cancels this program, the Constellation \nProgram, and what it does, in effect, is put our efforts for space \nexploration in severe jeopardy, potentially risking the jobs of more \nthan 7,000 rocket scientists in Florida as well as jobs throughout this \ncountry in more than 20 States.\n  I understand there are many private conversations going on between \nMembers of this body and the administration concerning this topic. But \nI think it is important to reflect back upon what then-Senator Obama, \nthen-candidate Obama said about space exploration and compare it to \nwhat his administration has proposed in his budget.\n  In August of 2008, Senator Obama was campaigning in Florida, in \nTitusville, FL, on our space coast. He said this:\n\n       One of the areas where we are in danger of losing our \n     competitive edge is our space program. When I was growing up, \n     NASA inspired the world with achievements we are still proud \n     of. Today, we have an administration--\n\n  He is referring to the Bush administration--\n\n     that has set ambitious goals for NASA without giving NASA the \n     support it needs to reach them. As a result, they've had to \n     cut back on research, and trim their programs, which means \n     that after the Space Shuttle shuts down in 2010, we're going \n     to have to rely on Russian spacecraft to keep us in orbit.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       More broadly, we need a real vision for space exploration. \n     To help formulate this vision, I'll reestablish the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Council so that we can develop a plan \n     to explore the solar system--a plan that involves both human \n     and robotic missions, and enlists both international partners \n     and the private sector. And as America leads the world to \n     long-term exploration of the moon, Mars, and beyond . . . .\n\n  And he goes on to say a few more things.\n  So we know the Congress passed a law that was reaffirmed in 2008, on \nOctober 15, that said we were going to go into low-Earth orbit with the \nConstellation Program. We know the President of the United States, when\n\n[[Page S1775]]\n\ncampaigning for this office, said we must be exceptional in the space \nprogram, continue with our vision, properly funded, go to the Moon and \nMars and planets beyond.\n  But today the President's budget scraps that plan. We have no plan to \nget into low-Earth orbit after the Space Shuttle is retired. We are \ngoing to rely upon the Russians to take us to the International Space \nStation--exactly what candidate-Obama said we should be worried about.\n  So to this end, I have filed an amendment, an amendment to the FAA \nReauthorization Act, to prohibit NASA from terminating the \nConstellation Program. It is the prerogative of this institution, the \nCongress--that our Founders put forth--it is our prerogative to deem \nhow money is spent, how programs are funded. This Congress twice has \nsaid we will fund the Constellation Program, that we will fund these \nprograms for the next generation of spacecraft to take us into low-\nEarth orbit.\n  This amendment reiterates the Federal law prohibiting NASA from using \nfunds in fiscal year 2010 to cancel Constellation contracts. Several of \nmy colleagues have joined me in this amendment: Senator Wicker from \nMississippi, Senator Shelby from Alabama, Senator Sessions from \nAlabama, Senator Hatch from Utah, and Senator Bennett from Utah.\n  The problem is, NASA is ignoring the will of Congress in already \nbeginning to cancel the Constellation Program. That is not their right. \nThey must follow the law, and this amendment intends to hold them to \nthat. The amendment sends a clear message that there are no loopholes, \nexclusions, or other routes the agency can use to kill the program.\n  I say publicly here on the floor of the Senate, whether this \namendment passes on this bill, whether this amendment passes in the \ncoming weeks, the law of the land is this: fund the Constellation \nProgram. NASA is on notice that it is their legal requirement to do so, \nthat they should not cancel contracts, they should not tell contractors \nto stop working. They cannot do that until the Congress makes a change \nin the law, and to do so would be unlawful.\n  The ultimate determination on the future of the space program rests \nwith Congress, not a budget proposal submitted by this administration \nor, in fact, any administration.\n  As candidate-Obama agreed, without Constellation, the United States \nwill be relying on Russia for any manned space missions. The United \nStates has led the world in space exploration since the early 1960s. We \ncannot, and we should not, cede this leadership to any other country. \nWe must summon the same vision that guided President Kennedy whose \nvision put a man on the Moon at the end of the 1960s. He said: Why \nshould we settle for anything less? To quote him:\n\n       We choose to go to the moon . . . because that challenge is \n     one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to \n     postpone, and one which we intend to win. . . .\n\n  It is my sincere hope we will adopt this amendment, if not on this \nbill, on another bill soon. I hope my colleagues and our President will \nalso come to say we choose to continue to be the leader in space \nexploration to the Moon, to Mars, and planets beyond because the \nchallenge is one we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to \npostpone, and one we intend to win.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/19/senate-section/article/S1775-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 SPRING\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, ``From winter, plague and pestilence, good \nLord, deliver us!'' wrote Thomas Nashe in 1600, in ``Summer's Last Will \nand Testament,'' to which I add a hearty, ``Amen!''\n  At last, this Saturday, March 20, spring arrives, both by calendar \nand weather, and we are all happier for it. Blue skies, warming \nbreezes, and the faint blush of buds upon the trees--this year, \nespecially, spring is a sight for sore eyes too long blinded by the \nglare of Sun upon sparkling snow. The cheerful chorus of springtime \nfrogs is welcome music after the almost silent whisper of falling \nsnowflakes.\n  This year in particular, spring seemed a long time coming. Rarely \nhave we seen so much snow in West Virginia--storm after storm, flurry \nupon flurry, until roofs groaned under the weight and plows could find \nnowhere to push the drifts. Even children home from school day after \nday edged slowly from delight to cabin fever. And just when it seems we \ncould not stand one more session with the snow shovel, we must now fear \nthe flooding snowmelt, the menacing legacy of this epic winter.\n  In time to prevent our moods from miring, like our yards, in the mud, \ncome the first bright petals of crocus and daffodil to give us hope. \nTheir petals glow among the wet leaves and drab grasses of winter. The \nAmerican poet, Amy Lowell, knew how daffodils could revive one's \nflagging spirits:\n\n     Thou yellow trumpeter of laggard Spring!\n     Thou herald of rich Summer's myriad flowers!\n     The climbing sun with new recovered powers\n     Does warm thee into being, through the ring\n     Of rich, brown earth he woos thee, makes thee fling\n     Thy green shoots up, inheriting the dowers\n     Of bending sky and sudden, sweeping showers,\n     Till ripe and blossoming thou are a thing\n     To make all nature glad, thou art so gay;\n     To fill the lonely with a joy untold;\n     Nodding at every gust of wind to-day,\n     To-morrow jeweled with raindrops. Always bold\n     To stand erect, full in the dazzling play\n     Of April's sun, for thou hast caught his gold.\n\n  As we all slowly unfurl from our winter burden of coats, scarves, \nhats, and boots, shedding them like the dark mulch of winter's leaves, \nwe, too, rejoice in the colors of springtime. Our petals may only be \ncheerful t-shirts or bright windbreakers, but what a welcome change \nfrom fleece and wool.\n  Warm weather will bring out walkers and gardeners and allow children \nto play in yards and parks, doing more to improve our outlooks, health, \nand waistlines than all the fitness reality shows we watch on \ntelevision during the cold, dark months of winter.\n  I hope that many Americans will revive their flagging New Year's \nresolutions and take advantage of spring's surge of energy to spend \nmore time outdoors. I hope that my fellow Senators will note the beauty \nof the blossoms and the greening of the city as they hurry between \nhearings and the Senate floor.

Mr. President, my colleague, Senator Daniel K. \nAkaka, and I commend the Hawaiian students' club of Pacific University, \nNa Haumana O Hawaii, for their steadfast commitment to the preservation \nof the rich cultural heritage of Hawaii. For 50 proud years, its strong \nmembership has championed educational opportunities to ensure the \nsurvival of a distinct history, beautiful language, and long-standing \ntraditions. The story of our State is one of a strong native people who \nhave persevered against forces that nearly extinguished their \nexistence, of struggling immigrants whose hope sustained them while \nthey toiled to achieve the American dream, and of a remote chain of \nislands who overcame obstacles to attain statehood in the 20th century. \nHawaii began with a proud people and continues to serve as a home for \nproud people. Through the efforts of Na Haumana O Hawaii, those ancient \nstories and values upon which our island home is founded will endure \nfor future generations to come.\n  The Annual Luau hosted and facilitated through the leadership of \nPacific University shares and exemplifies the ``aloha spirit.'' This \nevent allows others to experience the unique qualities of Hawaiian \nculture in an atmosphere that encourages fellowship. We would like to \nexpress our appreciation to faculty, staff and students of Pacific \nUniversity, Na Haumana O Hawaii, and the\n\n[[Page S1776]]\n\nlocal community for their great efforts in making this event so \nmemorable and for spreading the aloha spirit.\n  Mr. President, we ask our colleagues to join us in recognition of \nthis momentous occasion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/19/senate-section/article/S1776-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1776]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          Enrolled Bill Signed\n\n  At 10:10 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 1147.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the \n     Commonwealth of Puerto Rico urging the Federal Deposit \n     Insurance Corporation (FDIC) to show temperance in the \n     application of asset valuation rules to minority-owned banks \n     established in Puerto Rico, to establish effective measures \n     so as to expedite the granting of credit, and to help local \n     banks in their financial recovery and capitalization; to the \n     Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 860\n\n       During the last year, the finances of a significant number \n     of banking institutions around the world were severely \n     impacted as a result of the worldwide economic crisis. Puerto \n     Rico was not the exception in this serious and complex \n     financial problem. We see more often news reporting such \n     problems and governments assessing financial proposals and \n     alternatives to provide mechanisms so as to address and stop \n     the loss suffered by this sector, as well as strengthening \n     their economies by promoting and revitalizing banking \n     activities. Certainly, success in the recovery of the global \n     economy lies in achieving the delicate balance between the \n     needs and rules of the different economies, their \n     applicability to consumers, and their implementation by the \n     regulating bodies of such governments.\n       The press in Puerto Rico recently published data furnished \n     by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, known as the \n     FDIC, reporting that as of September 30, 2009, local banks \n     maintained a diminishing trend by reporting a reduction in \n     their total assets equal to 9%, and a net loss, as of such \n     date, of approximately $147 million. They also reported on \n     the efforts made by the Administration of Governor Luis \n     Fortuno to reach financing agreements that would allow the \n     Government of Puerto Rico to purchase assets from domestic \n     banks through the ``Troubled Asset Relief Program'' (TARP) in \n     order for them to lower their loan-in-default reserves and \n     grant new loans.\n       The importance of the Banking Industry in the economy of \n     Puerto Rico is unquestionable. Banks in Puerto Rico generate \n     over 15,000 direct jobs and countless indirect jobs by \n     financing the business activity in Puerto Rico. Furthermore, \n     in the beginning of this decade, banks were major taxpayers \n     into the treasury of Puerto Rico, with taxes over $200 \n     million. In light of the difficult financial situation faced \n     by banks, the FDIC has decided to establish stringent \n     regulatory examinations that contravene the public policy of \n     President Barack Obama and Governor Luis Fortuno of \n     reactivating and making regional and national economies \n     feasible. Specifically, in times requiring that temperance be \n     shown in the valuation of assets, the FDIC, through its \n     examiners, is suggesting proposals whose effect would be \n     detrimental to the value of assets used as collateral for \n     loans in the banks of Puerto Rico. This could entail \n     significant increases in the loan reserve of financial \n     institutions in Puerto Rico and a potential reduction on the \n     net worth of domestic banks. Therefore, this would cause a \n     reduction in the lending and economic activity in Puerto \n     Rico.\n       It is necessary to mention that, according to FDIC data, \n     most banks in Puerto Rico are among the top twenty largest \n     minority-owned banks of the Nation. For example, Banco \n     Popular of Puerto Rico holds the first position; First Bank \n     of Puerto Rico holds the second position; Westernbank of \n     Puerto Rico holds the third position; R-G Premier Bank of \n     Puerto Rico holds the eight position; and Eurobank holds the \n     thirteenth position, respectively.\n       As in Puerto Rico, this issue has been experienced at the \n     national level, as recently stated by Congressman Barney \n     Frank, Representative for the 4th congressional district of \n     the State of Massachusetts and Chairman of the House \n     Financial Services Committee, in a letter addressed to the \n     members of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the \n     Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of the Thrift \n     Supervision, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and \n     the National Credit Union Administration. In said letter, \n     Congressman Frank calls on them to show temperance in the \n     application of the rules that govern national banks and urges \n     federal regulating entities to take into account safety and \n     soundness standards established by them.\n       Said official also recognized that one of the challenges \n     currently faced by national banks is how to respond to the \n     call from the United States Congress to stimulate the \n     national economy by establishing measures so as to promote \n     lending activities and to work with troubled borrowers facing \n     foreclosure proceedings, while dealing with the directives \n     from federal government regulators. It has been proven on \n     different occasions that the construction and execution of \n     these regulatory standards do not allow for the expected \n     market stimulus, since the same are counter to the message of \n     Congress. Such has been the case when regulatory agencies \n     representatives have intervened with community banks, such as \n     those of Puerto Rico, requiring compliance with even more \n     stringent directives in the banking industry, which preclude \n     banks from recovering their assets promptly and efficiently.\n       On the other hand, on October 30, 2009, federal regulators \n     established a new policy on commercial loan restructuring. \n     The new policy establishes, among other things, temperance \n     and prudence in the decision-making process regarding loan \n     restructuring, the timely identification of losses, and the \n     proper classification of loans. The new policy establishes \n     that the classification of a loan should not be based solely \n     on the fact that the value of the collateral has declined, in \n     absence of other adverse factors. Loan restructurings are \n     generally in the best interest of both the banking \n     institutions and the borrowers. Furthermore, the new policy \n     establishes that examiners should give a reasonable amount of \n     deference to collateral valuation assumptions when these are \n     made by qualified appraisers or banking institutions. This \n     practice by the FDIC is not consistent with the principles of \n     this new policy.\n\n[[Page S1777]]\n\n       For all of the above, the Senate of Puerto Rico concludes \n     that the application by the FDIC of stringent asset valuation \n     rules would have a severe impact on the participation of \n     minority-owned banks and would substantially reduce the \n     access of minority populations to credit and financial \n     sources. Thus, the FDIC is hereby urged to show temperance in \n     its practices with minority-owned banks established in Puerto \n     Rico; to establish effective measures so as to expedite the \n     granting of credit; and to help domestic banks in their \n     financial recovery and capitalization.\n       Be it Resolved by the Senate of Puerto Rico:\n       Section 1.--To urge the Federal Deposit Insurance \n     Corporation (FDIC) to show temperance in the application of \n     asset valuation rules to minority-owned banks established in \n     Puerto Rico, to establish effective measures so as to \n     expedite the granting of credit, and to help local banks in \n     their financial recovery and capitalization.\n       Section 2.--This Resolution shall be officially notified, \n     in both official languages, to the Honorable Sheila C.

Bernanke, \n     Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \n     System, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System 20th \n     Street and Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, D.C. 20220; \n     and to the Honorable Timothy F.

Obama, President of the United States; to \n     the Honorable Joseph R.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee urging Congress to \n     stimulate markets for recycled materials, recycling, and \n     source reduction and the development of comprehensive solid \n     waste management plans; to the Committee on Environment and \n     Public Works.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 176\n\n       Whereas, recognizing the need to manage solid waste in an \n     environmentally, economically, and politically acceptable \n     manner, states are enacting comprehensive solid waste \n     management plans; and\n       Whereas, in the long run, source reduction and recycling \n     offer the most economically and environmentally sound methods \n     for dealing with a significant percentage of the solid waste \n     stream; and\n       Whereas, the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee believes that properly \n     designed and operated landfills will continue to be a \n     component of any comprehensive solid waste management plan; \n     and\n       Whereas, the volume of waste to be landfilled should be \n     reduced and minimized through environmentally sound methods \n     such as source separation to retrieve recyclable or reusable \n     materials; and\n       Whereas, yard waste and some biodegradable materials should \n     be composted rather than landfilled, and source separation \n     should occur in all waste streams; and\n       Whereas, solid waste incinerators without energy recovery \n     and landfilling should be limited, whenever practical, to \n     non-toxic and non-hazardous materials that cannot be treated \n     by any other economically and environmentally sound method; \n     and\n       Whereas, with respect to waste-to-energy or resource \n     recovery facilities, their capacity should be designed for \n     the solid waste volume remaining after source separation, \n     toxic materials removal, recycling, and pollution prevention \n     measures have been implemented; and\n       Whereas, the states are in need of the full cooperation and \n     assistance of the federal government to accomplish their \n     diverse solid waste management objectives: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That recognizing the \n     importance of a state-federal partnership and in support of \n     the objectives of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act \n     (RCRA), the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General Assembly \n     of the State of Tennessee hereby urges the United States \n     Congress to stimulate markets for recycled materials, \n     recycling, and source reduction and the development of \n     comprehensive solid waste management plans. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee urges the federal \n     government to significantly increase technical assistance to \n     state and local governments in developing comprehensive \n     source reduction, source separation, reuse, and recycling \n     programs while fully recognizing the primacy of state and \n     local governments in solid waste management. The development \n     of solid waste management plans is a state and local \n     government responsibility and the federal government should \n     restrict its role to reviewing these plans by setting \n     performance standards. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee urges that regulation, \n     tariffs, and transportation policies be revised to remove \n     artificial price supports in order to create regulatory \n     parity between recyclable and reusable material and virgin \n     material. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee urges the full \n     implementation of the provisions of RCRA requiring the \n     federal government to promulgate regulations for federal \n     procurement of recycled products. The federal government \n     should give priority consideration to the purchase of \n     reusable and recycled products and allow a temporary price \n     differential, where applicable, for goods made from recycled \n     materials. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee urges Congress to provide \n     the states with the greatest authority possible to manage \n     solid waste. Such an authorization should allow states to \n     restrict imported waste and allow restrictions on the \n     exportation of waste, including the imposition of \n     differential fees. Be it further\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate of the One \n     Hundred Sixth General Assembly of the State of Tennessee that \n     funds received from any permits authorized by federal law and \n     issued by states for purposes of management of solid waste \n     should be expended as determined by state legislatures.

A bill to amend section 1004 of title 39, United States \nCode, to include that it is a policy of the Postal Service to ensure \nreasonable and sustainable workloads and schedules for supervisory and \nmanagement employees and to clarify provisions relating to consultation \nand changes or terminations in certain proposals; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill to clarify \ncertain provisions relating to pay and benefits consultation between \nthe United States Postal Service and supervisors' and postmasters' \norganizations.\n  The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created a process for \npostmasters and other non-union postal employees to negotiate pay and \nbenefits through consultation. In the 108th Congress, I sponsored the \nPostmaster Equity Act which extended additional protections for \npostmasters to provide for fact-finding in the event that consultation \nreached an impasse. The same protections already applied to \nsupervisors. However, it has come to my attention that there may be \nambiguity in the interpretation of these provisions.\n  The legislation I am introducing, along with Representative Gerald \nConnolly in the House of Representatives, should eliminate any \nambiguity in existing law regarding consultation with management \norganizations. It reiterates that any changes to pay policies or \nbenefits for postmasters, supervisors, and other managerial positions \nbe done in conjunction with consultation process required under title \n39 section 1004(e). The bill also requires the Postal Service to ensure \npolicies to provide for reasonable and sustainable workloads and \nschedules for supervisory and management employees.\n  In light of the unprecedented challenges faced by the Postal Service \ntoday, fostering close cooperation and consultation on pay and benefits \nbetween the Postal Service and management organizations is essential. \nIt is my hope that the Postal Service and all of its employee \norganizations will continue to work cooperatively to keep the Postal \nService an employer of choice, and to promote advancement across the \norganization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3145\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs be discharged from further consideration and the \nSenate now proceed to S. Res. 451.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 451) expressing support for \n     designation of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day.''\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 451) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 451\n\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in the Republic of South \n     Vietnam from 1961 to 1975, and involved North Vietnamese \n     regular forces and Viet Cong guerrilla forces in armed \n     conflict with United States Armed Forces and the Army of the \n     Republic of Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States Armed Forces became involved in \n     Vietnam because the United States Government wanted to \n     provide direct military support to the Government of South \n     Vietnam to defend itself against the growing Communist threat \n     from North Vietnam;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began \n     serving in an advisory role to the Government of the Republic \n     of South Vietnam in 1961;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on \n     August 2 and 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf \n     of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 88-408), on August 7, 1964, \n     which provided the authority to the President of the United \n     States to prosecute the war against North Vietnam;\n       Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat \n     units arrived in Vietnam;\n       Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United \n     States troops in Vietnam, and by 1969, a peak of \n     approximately 543,000 troops was reached;\n       Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was \n     signed, which required the release of all United States \n     prisoners-of-war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of \n     all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces \n     completed the withdrawal of combat units and combat support \n     units from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on April 30, 1975, North Vietnamese regular forces \n     captured Saigon, the capitol of South Vietnam, effectively \n     placing South Vietnam under Communist control;\n       Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces were wounded;\n       Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was \n     dedicated in the District of Columbia to commemorate those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who died or were \n     declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue \n     among the people of the United States and a conflict that \n     caused a generation of veterans to wait too long for the \n     United States public to acknowledge and honor the efforts and \n     services of such veterans;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who \n     served bravely and faithfully for the United States during \n     the Vietnam War were often wrongly criticized for the policy \n     decisions made by 4 presidential administrations in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam \n     Veterans Day'' would be an appropriate way to honor those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who served in South \n     Vietnam and throughout Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War; \n     and\n       Whereas March 30, 2010, would be an appropriate day to \n     establish as ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors and recognizes the contributions of veterans who \n     served in the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam during \n     war and during peace;\n       (2) encourages States and local governments to also \n     establish ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day''; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities that--\n       (A) provide the appreciation Vietnam War veterans deserve, \n     but did not receive upon returning home from the war;\n       (B) demonstrate the resolve that never again shall the \n     Nation disregard and denigrate a generation of veterans;\n       (C) promote awareness of the faithful service and \n     contributions of such veterans during their military service \n     as well as to their communities since returning home;\n       (D) promote awareness of the importance of entire \n     communities empowering veterans and the families of veterans \n     to readjust to civilian life after military service; and\n       (E) promote opportunities for such veterans to assist \n     younger veterans returning from the wars in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan in rehabilitation from wounds, both seen and \n     unseen, and to support the reintegration of younger veterans \n     into civilian life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/19/senate-section/article/S1780-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1780]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR MONDAY, MARCH 22, 2010\n\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, our country has lost a friend, a patriot, \nand an environmental pioneer, Stewart Udall. Stewart Udall did more to \npreserve and protect the American landscape than probably anyone else. \nHe died this weekend. Our thoughts are with his family and many \nfriends.\n  On my last trip to New Mexico, I had the good fortune of being able \nto sit and talk with Stewart Udall for about an hour. It was a \nwonderful experience for me. I had never met him. I had served with his \nbrother in the House of Representatives, but this was the first \nconversation I ever had with him. It was wonderful. He was physically a \nlittle impaired, but his mind was sharp as a tack. We talked about \nthings that had happened or things that were happening. He was in great \nspirits and good humor. That is how I will always remember him.\n  The last surviving member of President Kennedy's original Cabinet, \nStewart Udall served as Secretary of the Interior for nearly the entire \n1960s. In that position for both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, the \nman who asked us to not spoil our natural surroundings left an \nindelible imprint on our land.\n  His legacy as Secretary of the Interior includes four national parks, \nsix national monuments, eight national seashores, nine national \nrecreational areas, 20 historic sites, and 50 wildlife refuges. That is \nhard to comprehend.\n  He was a versatile, talented, and very accomplished man. He served \nour Nation in the Army Air Corps, later to become the Air Force. He \nserved in Europe during World War II. He was a significantly good \nbasketball player at the University of Arizona. He was an All-\nConference guard. He taught students at Yale and wrote books that have \nbeen read by millions.\n  He reached the summits of Mount Kilimanjaro and Japan's Mount Fuji. \nAt 84, he was still rafting the Colorado River and hiking in the Grand \nCanyon.\n  Before he was Secretary Udall, he was Arizona's Congressman Udall. \nDecades later, as I indicated, I served with his famous brother, Mo \nUdall. Now we are all privileged, we Senators, to serve with Secretary \nUdall's son and his nephew, Tom and Mark. What a great legacy--two \ncousins now serving in the Senate. A lot of people do not know their \nfirst cousin is Gordon Smith, a former Senator from Oregon. It is an \naccomplished family.\n  As a dedicated steward of our environment, Stewart Udall's guiding \nprinciple was that our resources are not limitless. They are scarce, he \nreminded us, and they should be sincerely treasured, always protected, \nand never taken for granted. The same can be said of Stewart Udall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1783-7", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1783-S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, the House of Representatives deserves the \nappreciation of the entire Nation for what it did last night. A clear \nmajority of Congressmen and Congresswomen voted in favor of the bill \nthat a supermajority of Senators passed on Christmas Eve a few months \nago. Tomorrow the Senate will begin to put the final touches on this \nenormous effort.\n\n[[Page S1784]]\n\n  Last night's vote took both courage and common sense. Their votes \nwere momentous. They were historic. They were right.\n  After a century of working and waiting, going back to the days of \nTheodore Roosevelt, real reform will become the law of the land, not in \na matter of years or months or weeks but in a matter of hours. In the \nvery near future, various parts of this bill will take effect and \nimprove the life of millions. Soon insurance companies will no longer \nbe able to refuse to cover children with preexisting conditions. They \nwill no longer be able to drop your coverage just because you get sick.\n  Small businesses that today cannot afford to cover their employees \nwill soon get tax credits to help them right that wrong. Tens of \nthousands of small businesses will benefit in Nevada alone--24,000 to \nbe exact.\n  Reform means that if you have a preexisting condition and no health \ninsurance, you soon will be able to finally afford the care you need to \nget and stay healthy.\n  If you are stuck in the prescription drug doughnut hole, you will \nsoon get a check to help pay for your medicine. That will help seniors \nstay healthy while we completely close that loophole, once and for all, \nfor nearly 60,000 Nevada seniors and millions more across the country.\n  Also, starting this year, no insurance company will be able to impose \na lifetime limit on your benefits.\n  Those changes are just a tip of the iceberg. They are only some of \nthe benefits that will kick in almost immediately--some in 3 months, \nsome in 6 months but none longer than what I am going to talk about \ntoday--just a fraction of what this bill will do over the long term for \nthe health of our Nation, our economy, and, most importantly, our \ncitizens.\n  When all is said and done, more than 600,000 Nevadans will be able to \naccess affordable coverage. More than 300,000 Nevadans will get tax \ncredits to help them buy health coverage from the private market. \nAnother 300,000 seniors in the State of Nevada will get free preventive \nannual services, such as physicals and checkups.\n  Nevadans who buy insurance on their own will also save money. Because \nof this bill, their premiums will go down as much as 20 percent, which \nmeans Nevada families can save more than $2,000 a year.\n  This bill will also save our country money and lots of it. Over the \nnext 10 years, it will slash our deficit by $143 billion; in the next \n10 years, a $1.3 trillion deficit reduction.\n  Many Senators deserve credit for getting us this far, and many will \nhelp us cross the finish line this week.\n  I thank especially Chairman Baucus, who oversaw the financial aspect \nof this bill that will bring down health care costs and vastly reduce \nour deficit; Chairman Dodd, who oversaw the parts of reform that will \nensure more healthy Americans, and they did that in the HELP Committee. \nNot only will it allow people to stay healthy, it will allow them to \nstop being sick in the first place. Our friend, Ted Kennedy, must \nsurely be proud of this work. Chairman Harkin, who has led the HELP \nCommittee down the home stretch, deserves our thanks for the work he \nhas done to make college more affordable. Chairman Conrad, who is head \nof the Budget Committee, will continue to guide us through the budget \nreconciliation process--a fiscally responsible final piece that will \nfurther reduce the deficit, ensure more Americans can afford more \nhealth insurance, and fully close the doughnut hole.\n\n  I know the other side watched the House vote last night, as we did. \nAs they did, I hope they finally learned that a strategy of delay, \nmyths, and fear might slow progress, but it cannot stop it. I hope this \nweek, when we take up the final revisions of what will soon be the long \noverdue law, our Republican friends will finally act in the interests \nof their constituents and not just in the interests of the insurance \nindustry or their political party.\n  The other side has made it clear they will try to stop progress based \non a technicality. But without substance, they are powerless. What this \nbudget process is all about is simply making a good law that we passed \non Christmas Eve even better.\n  The other side is still talking about the number of pages in the \nbill, but we will not stop talking about the number of lives it will \nsave.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1784-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1784]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night marked a turning point in \nour politics and in our Nation.\n  On a Sunday night in March, with the Nation howling in opposition, a \nbare majority of Democrats in the people's House ignored the people to \nclaim a win for their party, and then they celebrated. The American \npeople watched all this in utter disbelief.\n  Here is what the Democrats voted for last night: a vast expansion of \nthe entitlement state that we cannot afford, massive cuts to Medicare, \nhigher taxes, higher health care costs, worse care, taxpayer-funded \nabortions. Do not believe the spin that this was not a party-line vote. \nYes, not a single Republican voted for the bill, but a whole lot of \nDemocrats voted against it as well.\n  The fact is, the so-called Senate version of the health care bill \nthat passed the House last night could not even pass the Senate today. \nWhy is that? Because this bill is so deeply unpopular that the voters \nin the most liberal State in the country just elected a Republican to \nthe Senate for the first time in nearly four decades in order to stop \nit.\n  Democrats want to pretend this did not happen. They want to pretend \nNew Jersey and Virginia and Massachusetts simply did not happen. They \nwant to pretend the views of the people who sent us here do not matter. \nThey want to pretend we can afford a $2.5 trillion entitlement in the \nmiddle of a recession, when we cannot even meet the obligations we \nalready have. They want to pretend future generations will not have to \nbear the burden of their actions. They want to pretend our actions \ntoday will not affect the American dream tomorrow.\n  They are living in a fantasy, and today that fantasy becomes even \nmore absurd. As if the bill they voted on yesterday was not bad enough, \nnow they want to make it even worse. That is what is going to happen in \nthe Senate. That is what is going to happen in the Senate this week.\n  Democratic leaders now want us to take the bill that passed the \nSenate back in December and that the House voted on last night and make \nthe tax hikes even higher and the Medicare cuts even deeper. They want \nus to endorse a raft of new sweetheart deals that were struck behind \nclosed doors just last week so this thing could limp over the finish \nline last night.\n  Americans said they did not want this bill. Democrats passed it \nanyway. They said they did not like the deals and they did not like the \ngiveaways. Democrats struck them anyway. Now they want to make this \nbill even worse. They want to add more deals on top of the other ones. \nWell, I have a message for our Democratic friends: Enough is enough. No \nmore tax hikes, no more Medicare cuts, no more dealmaking, no more \nbackroom deals.\n\n  Democrats may have won their vote last night, but they lost the \nargument and they have lost the trust of the American people. Americans \nknow you don't drive down the cost of health care by spending another \n$2.5 trillion on health care. They know we can help people with \npreexisting conditions without slashing Medicare to do it. They know we \ncan do all these things without crippling the economy or forcing \ntaxpayers to pay for abortions. Americans see through the false choices \nthey have been handed by the Democrats here in Washington.\n  Democratic leaders may have gotten their votes, they may have gotten \ntheir win, but today is a new day. Already we are seeing Democrats in \nthe Senate distancing themselves from this effort to make a bad bill \nworse. So we already know that reconciliation is guaranteed to have \nbipartisan opposition.

Mr. President, I have been in and out of public life a \nlong time, and I have never had anything affect me in a personal way \nlike the health care debate. I got up this morning in West Millers Cove \nin Blount County and drove to the Knoxville airport, and almost every \nsingle person with whom I talked on the way into the airplane had \nsomething to say to me about the health care debate. When I get on the \nplane, here comes another fellow right down the aisle, hands me a note, \nand says: Thanks for all your hard work. None of them are for the \nhealth care bill passed last night. They are all deeply concerned and \ndeeply worried about it, and they see it as I see it. They see it as a \nhistoric mistake.\n  Unlike the Social Security bill, the Medicare bill, the Medicaid \nbill, the civil rights bills of 1957 and 1964 and 1968 and later, all \nthose bills passed with significant bipartisan support. But the bill \nlast night was a completely partisan act. The only thing bipartisan \nabout it is the opposition to it. I think it is important that we \ncontinue to say why that is true.\n  The fundamental mistake is that the bill basically expands a health \ncare delivery system that we all know is too expensive at a time of \nenormous concern about the national debt. In the middle of a great \nrecession, we are expanding a health care delivery system that we know \nis too expensive; instead of focusing our attention and working \ntogether to set as a goal of reducing the cost of the health care \ndelivery system so more Americans can afford to buy insurance. That is \nthe basic difference of opinion.\n  The Democrats believe we should expand the system we have now. Of \ncourse, they make some changes, but basically it is an expansion of a \nsystem that is too expensive, and they make it more expensive. We \nbelieve what we should do, instead, is to reduce the cost of the \nAmerican health care delivery system, and by doing so make it possible \nfor more Americans to be able to afford health insurance.\n  Here is what the bill does now, as we see it. It imposes even larger \ntaxes on job creators in the middle of a recession. It will mean \nMedicare cuts and premium increases for millions of Americans. The \nMedicare cuts, it is said, are alright because there is some fraud and \nabuse in Medicare. We agree with that. But what we are saying is that \nMedicare, according to its trustees, is going broke by 2010, and every \npenny of savings in Medicare ought to go to Medicare to help make it \nstronger. This bill spends almost all the money on a new entitlement, \nand the bill last night cuts Medicare even more deeply.\n  Some say: Well, it only hurts providers and hospitals. Well, those \nhospitals are the ones that may announce, as some are announcing, that \nwe are not going to accept Medicare patients anymore because we are \nalready being reimbursed so little. But it also cuts Medicare \nbeneficiaries' benefits. The Congressional Budget Office says that \nfully half of those who have Medicare Advantage--and that is one out \nfour Medicare beneficiaries in the country--will see their benefits \ncut. That is what this bill does.\n  As far as premium increases go, the President and I had a little \nfriendly discussion about that at the health care summit. I said: For \nmillions of Americans, individual premiums would go up. He said: No, \nthey won't. I said: With respect, Mr. President, the Congressional \nBudget Office says yes, they will, by 10 to 13 percent, on the average. \nHe said: Oh, no, oh, no, they will be getting a better policy. But that \nis like saying: If the government requires you to buy a better car and \nit is more expensive, it may be better but it is still more expensive. \nFor a variety of reasons individual premiums are going to go up, and \none is the government requirement that you buy a better policy.\n  Senator Collins, who was the insurance commissioner in Maine, has \nsurveyed her State, and her conclusion is that 87 percent of the \nindividual policies there will be more expensive under this bill. It is \ntrue that maybe half of those persons would get subsidies--paid for by \ntaxpayers--but that still leaves maybe 40 percent of the individual \npolicies in Maine where individual premiums will go up. They will go up \nbecause we are dumping more people into Medicaid--the State program for \nlow-income Americans--and we don't reimburse physicians and hospitals \nadequately for those patients.\n  Today, one-half of doctors won't see new Medicaid patients. So what \ndo hospitals and the doctors do when they do see a Medicaid patient? \nThey transfer part of the cost of seeing that patient--that Medicaid \npatient--on to someone who has private insurance. So that forces \npremiums to go up.\n  When you have a provision in the bill, as this bill does, which says \nthat my policy can't go up much when compared with my son's policy, \nwell, that might keep my policy from going up so much, but my son is \ngoing to be paying a lot more. So younger Americans are going to be \nvery surprised as the cost of their policies goes up. Then the \nprovision in the bill with the requirement to buy policies was \nweakened, and because it is weak, a lot of young people especially may \nnot join the policy. When they do not, that will leave sicker and older \npeople within the system, and that will help drive premium costs up as \nwell. So for all those reasons, for millions of Americans, it is \naccurate to say that premiums will go up.\n  I was at the University of Tennessee this morning--a tremendous \nuniversity. Dr. Chu, the President's Energy Secretary, is visiting \nthere today and tomorrow. I wish I could be with him to talk about the \nwork they are doing, between the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and the \nuniversity and its science program. Senator Bingaman has visited there \nbefore. But one of the undercurrent stories in America today is the \ncondition of America's public higher education. State funding for \npublic higher education has been flat for the last 10 years.\n  Why is that? Because Medicaid costs continue to rise. Governors can't \ncontrol those budgets or control those costs, and the reason they can't \nis because we write the program up here and then send them about a \nthird to 40 percent of the bill. They cannot afford it, so what do they \ndo? They cut the amount of money that goes to the University of \nVirginia or the University of Tennessee or the University of New Mexico \nor the University of Wyoming and then what happens? Either quality goes \ndown, fewer students are served, fewer faculty are attracted or tuition \ngoes up, which is why the students are protesting in California about \nthe 34-percent increase in tuition at the University of California. \nThey probably didn't even imagine the reason for that\n\n[[Page S1786]]\n\nis the Federal Government is causing Medicaid costs to continue to rise \nand Governors, therefore, make cuts and tuition goes up. This bill will \nmake that worse.\n\n  Then, on top of that, you have the last-minute takeover of the \nFederal student loan program. Suddenly, 19 million students--well, 15 \nmillion of those 19 million will go to the Federal Government to get \ntheir loan, beginning in July, instead of to 2,000 lenders across the \ncountry. The Government is saying we are going to save money. That may \nbe true. But guess what the Government is going to do with its money. \nThey are not going to say: Because the Government can borrow the money \nat 2.8 percent it is going to cost us less to operate the program, \ntherefore, we are going to give students the savings. They are going to \nspend the savings. So they are going to borrow it at 2.8 percent and \nloan it to the students at 6.8 percent. That is overcharging America's \nstudents to help pay for the health care program.\n  These students are not Wall Street financiers. They are working \npeople, some of them pretty grown up, in their thirties and forties, \ngoing back to Walter State Community College. They often have a job. \nThey are not going to be very happy when they find out they are paying \nhigher interest. The estimate that we have made in our office is it \nmight be $1,500-$1,700 dollars over 10 years in more interest. That is \nthe amount the Governor is going to be overcharging them to pay for \nother government programs, including health care.\n  The action that is being taken may be historic. But we believe that \nit is a historic mistake and that throughout the rest of this year the \ndebate will not end about health care; but it will change. It will be \nlarger than just health care.\n  As the President himself said last year, the health care debate is a \nproxy for a larger debate about the role of government in America's \nlife. We believe that is a debate our country should have, and we \nbelieve the country will soundly reject a policy of more taxes, more \nspending, more debt, and more Washington takeover.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I heard my colleague's comments about \nhealth care. I will plan to return to the Senate floor to discuss \nhealth care in some detail in the next couple days.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1786-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1786-S1787]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING STEWART UDALL\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about a great American \nwho has inspired me and countless others with his leadership and \ncommitment to public service. That great American is Stewart Udall.\n  At the outset, I extend my condolences to my friend and colleague, \nStewart's son, Tom Udall, and his wife Jill; his nephew, my friend and \ncolleague, Mark Udall, and his wife Maggie; and all the Udall family \nfor this enormous loss. In several conversations I had with Stewart in \nrecent years, it was clear that Tom's own exemplary public service and \nI'm sure Mark's as well, were a source of great pride for him.\n  Stewart Udall is best known for his lifetime of service in \npreservation of our public lands. His accomplishments as Secretary of \nthe Interior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson are legendary. Those \naccomplishments were recounted yesterday in the New York Times. It \nsaid:\n\n       . . . he presided over the acquisition of 3.85 million \n     acres of new holdings, including four national parks \n     Canyonlands in Utah, Redwood in California, North Cascades in \n     Washington, and Guadalupe Mountains in Texas--six national \n     monuments, nine national recreation areas, twenty historic \n     sites, fifty wildlife refuges and eight national seashores.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the obituary from the Times be printed \nin the Record, after my comments.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  [See exhibit 1.]\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. His commitment to and achievements in conservation and \npreservation are unequaled in our country. He was a moving force behind \nall of the landmark environmental legislation of the 1960s, including \nthe Clean Air Act of 1963, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of \n1965, the Wilderness Act of 1964, the Land and Water Conservation Act \nof 1965, the Endangered Species Act of 1966, the National Trails System \nAct of 1968, and the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act of 1968. Long after \nleaving public office, he was instrumental in securing the enactment of \nthe Radiation Exposure Compensation Act of 1990 which I was proud to \nsupport.\n  But his commitment to our public lands was part of a larger lifetime \ncommitment, a commitment to public service.\n  With all the rancor and heated rhetoric that surround us in \nWashington today, it is easy to lose sight of what is good about our \nsystem of government. And one of the very best things about our great \ncountry, and our system of government, is that it has attracted to \npublic service many of the best among us to devote their lives to work \nfor us all.\n  Stewart Udall was one of those people. He devoted his life to \npursuing the common good the greater good and left this Nation a better \nplace because of it.\n  Stewart cared deeply about the people of this great country and that \ncaring was evident in each encounter that he had. My wife Anne has fond \nmemories of heartfelt conversations she had with Stewart where he spoke \nforcefully about the challenges we face. I myself was fortunate to \nalways hear from him words of encouragement and constructive advice \nwhenever we would visit.\n  Stewart Udall set the highest standards for public service and for \ndecency as a human being. As Ben Jonson said of Shakespeare, ``he was \nnot of an age, but for all time.'' Stewart Udall had, as he urged his \ngrandchildren to have, ``a love affair with the wonder and beauty of \nthe earth.'' We are all the richer for it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 20, 2010]\n\nStewart L. Udall, 90, Conservationist in Kennedy and Johnson Cabinets, \n                                  Dies\n\n                          (By Keith Schneider)\n\n       Stewart L. Udall, an ardent conservationist and a son of \n     the West, who as interior secretary in the 1960s presided \n     over vast increases in national park holdings and the public \n     domain, died Saturday at his home in Santa Fe, N.M. The last \n     surviving member of the original Kennedy cabinet, he was 90.\n       Mr. Udall had been in failing health after a fall last \n     week, according to a son, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico.\n       Though he was a liberal Democrat from the increasingly \n     conservative and Republican West, Stewart Udall said in a \n     2003 public television interview that he found in Washington \n     ``a big tent on the environment.''\n       The result was the addition of vast tracts to the nation's \n     land holdings and--through his strong ties with lawmakers, \n     conservationists, writers and others--work that led to \n     landmark statutes on air, water and land conservation.\n       President Obama said in a statement Saturday night that Mr. \n     Udall ``left an indelible mark on this nation and inspired \n     countless Americans who will continue his fight for clean \n     air, clean water and to maintain our many natural \n     treasures.''\n       Few corners of the nation escaped Mr. Udall's touch. As \n     interior secretary in the Kennedy and Johnson \n     administrations, he presided over the acquisition of 3.85 \n     million acres of new holdings, including 4 national parks--\n     Canyonlands in Utah, Redwood in California, North Cascades in \n     Washington State and Guadalupe Mountains in Texas--6 national \n     monuments, 9 national recreation areas, 20 historic sites, 50 \n     wildlife refuges and 8 national seashores. He also had an \n     interest in preserving historic sites, and helped save \n     Carnegie Hall from destruction.\n       ``Republicans and Democrats, we all worked together,'' Mr. \n     Udall said in a television interview with Bill Moyers. But by \n     the time of that interview, Mr. Udall added that Washington \n     had been overtaken by money and that people seeking public \n     office fought for contributions from business interests that \n     viewed environmental protection as a detriment to profit at \n     best.\n       In his years in Washington, he won high regard from many \n     quarters for his efforts to preserve the American landscape \n     and to educate his fellow Americans on the value of natural \n     beauty, points he made in his 1963 book ``The Quiet Crisis.'' \n     The book, whose aim, he wrote at the time, was to ``outline \n     the land and people story of our continent,'' sold widely.\n       It was Mr. Udall who suggested that John F. Kennedy invite \n     Robert Frost to recite a poem at Mr. Kennedy's inauguration. \n     Mr. Udall accompanied Mr. Frost to the Soviet Union in 1962, \n     a trip meant to foster better ties with Premier Nikita S. \n     Khrushchev.\n       Mr. Udall also held evenings at the Interior Department \n     with the poet Carl Sandburg and the actor Hal Holbrook. In \n     addition, he invited the Pulitzer Prize-winning author \n     Wallace Stegner to be the department's writer in residence. \n     It was Mr. Stegner's presence that prompted Mr. Udall to \n     write ``The Quiet Crisis.''\n\n[[Page S1787]]\n\n       Mr. Udall was also an early supporter of Rachel Carson, the \n     biologist whose book ``Silent Spring'' brought attention to \n     the environmental hazards of pesticide use.\n       Mr. Udall stepped onto the national stage in 1954, when he \n     was elected to Congress from Arizona. In the hotly fought \n     Democratic presidential primary of 1960, he urged his fellow \n     Arizona Democrats to support Kennedy. When Kennedy won the \n     White House, he nominated Mr. Udall as interior secretary.\n       After Kennedy was assassinated in 1963, Mr. Udall was kept \n     on by Lyndon B. Johnson.\n       ``I think probably part of that was Lady Bird,'' Mr. Udall \n     said, referring to Mr. Johnson's wife, with whom he \n     collaborated on beautifying the nation's capital and similar \n     projects. ``She treasured me, and we were wonderful \n     friends,'' he added.\n       Roger G. Kennedy, who was director of the National Park \n     Service in the 1990s, said Mr. Udall ``escaped the notion \n     that all public land was essentially a cropping opportunity--\n     the idea that if you cannot raise timber on it or take a deer \n     off it, it wasn't valuable.'' On the other hand, Mr. Kennedy \n     said, Mr. Udall understood that public lands like parks \n     enhanced the economic value of privately held land nearby.\n       This lesson was sometimes communicated with difficulty. For \n     example, in the 1960s, when the Kennedy administration, with \n     Mr. Udall in the lead, began efforts to establish the \n     nation's first national seashores, people in regions \n     including Cape Cod in Massachusetts, Cape Hatteras in North \n     Carolina, and Point Reyes in California objected that taking \n     coastal land out of private hands would ruinously inhibit \n     economic development.\n       Instead, the parks have been beacons for lucrative tourism.\n       On this and other fronts Mr. Udall pushed with a formidable \n     combination of political acumen and political allies--\n     including his younger brother Morris K. Udall, who succeeded \n     him in Congress and in 1976 ran for president in a campaign \n     that his older brother managed. Many of the significant \n     environmental and land-protection statutes that became law in \n     the 1970s and '8os, including the Endangered Species Act, \n     bore their stamp and influence.\n       ``That was a wonderful time, and it carried through into \n     the Nixon administration, into the Ford administration, into \n     the Carter administration,'' Stewart Udall said. ``It lasted \n     for 20 years. I don't remember a big fight between the \n     Republicans and Democrats in the Nixon administration or \n     President Gerald Ford and so on. There was a consensus that \n     the country needed more conservation projects of the kind \n     that we were proposing.''\n       Stewart Lee Udall was born on Jan. 31, 1920, in St. Johns, \n     Ariz., a small community in Apache County in the northeast, \n     into a family with strong ties to the Mormon Church. His \n     mother, Louise Lee Udall, was a granddaughter of John Doyle \n     Lee, who was executed in 1877 for his involvement in the \n     Mountain Meadows Massacre in Utah, in which a wagon train of \n     California-bound migrants were killed in 1857.\n       Mr. Udall served as a Mormon missionary in Pennsylvania and \n     New York. During World War II, he was a gunner in the 15th \n     Army Air Forces, serving in Europe.\n       He received bachelor's and law degrees from the University \n     of Arizona. After graduating from law school in 1948, he \n     started his own law practice in Tucson, where he and Morris \n     later became partners.\n       After leaving Washington, he taught at Yale, practiced law \n     and wrote several books, including ``The Myths of August,'' \n     an account of the effects of uranium mining and nuclear \n     weapons work in the Western desert.\n       That grew out of his representation of thousands of uranium \n     miners, nuclear weapons industry workers and citizens exposed \n     to radiation from atomic weapons manufacturing and testing in \n     the West.\n       Though he won the first case in 1984 in Federal District \n     Court, an appeals court overturned the ruling and the United \n     States Supreme Court declined in 1988 to hear arguments. Mr. \n     Udall then turned to Congress, working with lawmakers of both \n     parties, particularly Senator Orrin Hatch, Republican of \n     Utah, and Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of \n     Massachusetts, who died in August.\n       In 1990, President George Bush signed the Radiation \n     Exposure Compensation Act. The law, administered by the \n     Justice Department, provided up to $100,000 for those \n     sickened by radiation exposure, and issued a formal apology \n     for harm done to those who were ``subjected to increased risk \n     of injury and disease to serve the national security \n     interests of the United States.''\n       Throughout his life he relished physical challenges. He was \n     an all-conference guard on the University of Arizona \n     basketball team and he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro, in East \n     Africa, and Mount Fuji, in Japan, while heading American \n     delegations to both regions. When he was 84, at the end of \n     his last rafting trip on the Colorado River, Mr. Udall hiked \n     up the steep Bright Angel Trail from the bottom of the Grand \n     Canyon to the south rim, a 10-hour walk that he celebrated at \n     the end with a martini.\n       Mr. Udall's wife, the former Irmalee Webb, died in 2001. \n     Besides his son Tom, he is survived by his other sons, Scott, \n     Denis and Jay, and his daughters, Lynn and Lori, as well as \n     eight grandchildren.\n       At his death, Mr. Udall was a senior member of one of the \n     nation's last and largest political dynasties--in the West it \n     was often said there were ``oodles of Udalls'' in politics. \n     His grandfather David King Udall served in the Arizona \n     Territorial legislature; his father, Levi Udall, was for \n     decades an elected judge in the Arizona Superior Court and \n     later a justice and chief justice of the Arizona Supreme \n     Court; Morris Udall was followed to Washington by his son \n     Mark Udall, elected in 2008 as a senator from Colorado, the \n     same year that Tom Udall was elected.\n       But Tom Udall said that in recent years his father had \n     become greatly concerned over the state of politics in the \n     country, worrying ``we were losing the bipartisanship in the \n     environmental area.''\n       He added that Mr. Udall had recently written a letter to \n     his grandchildren, urging them to focus on ``trying to \n     transform our society to a clean energy and clean job \n     society.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1787-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1787-S1790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the reconciliation \nlegislation the Senate will be considering later this week. Similar to \nmany of my colleagues, I first read this legislation when it was hot \nfiled in the House last week. One of my first thoughts was, what a \ndifference 15 months makes. This week the Senate will debate \nlegislation that will increase health care costs for working Americans \nand wipe out a successful bipartisan 45-year-old student loan program \nwithout a single committee hearing or even a markup.\n  This bill is an attempt to fix what is perceived to be the problem \nwith health reform legislation that the Senate passed on Christmas Eve \nof last year. These fixes are being considered because the American \npeople overwhelmingly opposed that legislation. Unfortunately, this \nbill, the reconciliation bill, does nothing to fix the problem that \nprompted this opposition. Nothing in the bill we are going to be \nconsidering will prevent $\\1/2\\ trillion from being cut from the \nMedicare Program to create a brandnew entitlement program for the \nuninsured. If this bill is passed, millions of Medicare beneficiaries \nwill lose the extra benefits they currently receive. In fact, this bill \nwill actually make matters worse, cutting even more money than the \nprovisions in the Senate bill. One out of every four Medicare \nbeneficiaries is already enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan, and \nevery one of them will see their benefits reduced.\n  If this bill is passed, the care of Medicare beneficiaries across the \ncountry will still be put at risk because of the unsustainable payment \ncuts to hospitals and nursing homes. The President's own Chief Medicare \nActuary said these costs could jeopardize Medicare's beneficiaries' \naccess to care. He said, as a result of these cuts, roughly 20 percent \nof all hospitals and nursing homes in the country would become \nunprofitable which, of course, could lead them to end their \nparticipation in the Medicare Program. It is either end it or go broke.\n  If you can't go to a hospital or get a doctor to treat you, you do \nnot have health care. But this bill does nothing to fix the Medicare \npayment cuts in the Senate health reform bill passed on Christmas Eve. \nThis bill will still cause health insurance premiums to increase. The \nCongressional Budget Office said the Senate bill would increase \npremiums by 10 percent to 13 percent for individuals. They said that 10 \npercent to 13 percent increase is above what would happen if we do \nabsolutely nothing. Yes, escalating health care costs are a problem, \nbut this bill passed by the House last night, with these supposed fixes \nthat are in here, will increase premiums 10 percent to 13 percent for \nindividuals over what would have been done if nothing would have \nhappened. It does not sound like a solution to me. There are solutions \nout there.\n  The bill also contains provisions that will increase premiums for 85 \npercent of Americans who already have health insurance. This bill does \nnothing to stop health care costs from increasing our national debt. \nThe CBO estimates of the bill are required to ignore the issue of \nMedicare payments to physicians. Let's see, how many times have we \nignored the Medicare payments to physicians? That is right, never. How \ndo we fix it? We just need to come up with 300 billion more dollars. We \nhad a chance to do that through the bill, keeping Medicare money for \nMedicare. But no, we took the Medicare money, and we decided to put \nthat into new programs, new programs for the uninsured.\n\n[[Page S1788]]\n\n  There are solutions out there for making sure the uninsured are \ncovered, too, and it did not have to come out of Medicare.\n  The CBO estimates of the bill are required to ignore the issue of \nMedicare payments to physicians. The bill also does nothing to fix the \nscheduled Medicare payments to the other health providers. Does the \nmajority believe the Medicare payments to doctors will be cut 21 \npercent later this year? Not if history keeps itself up. But let me \ntell you, that $132 billion that it is supposed to reduce the deficit \nin the first 10 years in the Senate-passed bill is ignoring the need \nfor $300 billion to fix the doctors. If we fix the doctors, we are $170 \nbillion in the hole. The President did not visit China and Secretary \nGeithner, on a separate trip, didn't visit China to go see the Great \nWall. They were told to come over there by China so they could explain \nhow we were ever going to pay for our bonds. Last month, they dropped \nabout $38 billion in our bonds, and I noticed today we have this clamor \nthat we want them to adjust their yuan, the value of their money \ncompared to our money, and they said: You have to be kidding me, we own \nyou. They didn't say it in quite those words, but that is what they \nmeant.\n  In addition to assuming massive reductions in Medicare payments to \ndoctors, the health care reform bill also relies on budget gimmicks and \nother unsustainable payment cuts to allow its sponsors to argue it will \nnot increase the deficit. As Ruth Marcus wrote recently in the \nWashington Post, claims that the bill will reduce the deficit are \n``premature at best and delusional at worst.''\n  Rather than creating this new entitlement, we should be using the \nsavings from Medicare to pay to fix Medicare's problems. These payments \nissues are not going away, and this, or a future Congress, is going to \nhave to pay for them or increase the debt.\n  We have maxed out our credit cards already. People coming in--this is \nthe season for it--they come in and ask for increases in the programs \nthey already have or they ask for new programs and the funding to go \nwith that program because, of course, the Federal Government is known \nas the great piggy bank in Washington, and they know we just print \nmoney. They didn't know there could be a limit to how much money we \nprint. I suggest those people kind of save their travel money and use \nit in their program because we are going to have to tell people that \nnot only is the money not there to expand programs and to add new \nprograms, we are going to actually have to cut programs. We are going \nto have to cut programs to stay solvent.\n  They are looking at changing our bond rating. That means it would be \nless favorable for people to buy U.S. bonds.\n  The reconciliation bill that will be before us this week, also raises \ntaxes by $569 billion. If you can believe it, that is $50 billion more \nin new taxes than the original Senate-passed bill. So the ``fix-it'' \nbill we will have in front of us, will put even more pressure on small \nbusiness owners and entrepreneurs who could help lead our Nation's \neconomic recovery.\n  This bill also does nothing to stop the billions of dollars in new \njob-killing taxes created by the Senate health reform bill. \nUnfortunately, the policies in this bill will only make this situation \nworse for workers and for businesses across America. This bill \nincreases to $52 billion the new taxes imposed on employers, which will \neliminate millions of American jobs and reduce wages for millions of \nother American workers.\n  The Nation's unemployment rate is 9.7 percent. Millions of Americans \nhave lost their job and millions more go to work every day worried \nabout keeping the job they have. Businesses of all sizes are struggling \nto keep their doors open and are finding it harder and harder to make \nends meet.\n  We have shed more than 3.5 million jobs since January of last year \nand the average work week is now down to 33 hours for the American \nworker. Yet the bill we will have before us will actually make that \nsituation worse. The Congressional Budget Office has told us that new \njob-killing taxes in the Senate bill will lower wages across this \ncountry.\n  Rather than addressing the issue and enacting reforms that would \nlower health insurance costs, the majority's health care bill instead \nincreases the taxes these businesses will have to pay, taking money \naway from hiring new workers.\n  When I am home in Wyoming, which is almost every weekend, my \nconstituents are asking me: What does health care reform mean for me?\n  Unfortunately, I have to tell them when the Senate bill becomes law, \ntheir jobs and their paychecks will be in danger. I also found it \nironic that on the day the President signed a so-called jobs bill, \nSpeaker Pelosi released a reconciliation bill that contained $52 \nbillion in job-killing taxes.\n  These problems are the real reasons the American people oppose the \nSenate health reform bill. Unfortunately, the bill that will be before \nus fails to address any of the fundamental problems with that bill. If \nthe legislation we are about to debate is enacted, taxes will still be \nraised by $569 billion, $525 billion will still be cut from the \nMedicaid Program, wages will still be reduced, and jobs eliminated for \nmillions of Americans. Health insurance premiums will still be driven \nup--driven up more than if we did nothing at all--and 23 million people \nwill still be left without insurance coverage. We need to do better \nthan that. I believe we can.\n  While most of the discussion this week will focus on health care, we \nmust not forget that the reconciliation bill drastically alters decades \nof education and labor policy.\n  Specifically, I am speaking about eliminating the 45-year-old family \nfriendly bank loans for education program, called FFEL. I put initials \non when it has something to do with government. This is one that works \nthrough the banks, which has successfully helped millions of Americans \nrealize the dream of a college education, and the shift to a \nWashington-run direct loan program. This radical change is happening \nwithout a single Senate hearing, or a single markup in the HELP \nCommittee, where I serve as ranking member, or any other committee.\n  The administration and the majority have been promising students \nsince the beginning of this Congress that their Pell grants would be \nincreased dramatically so that college would be affordable. Even with \nthis bill, this promise rings hollow. What does the transfer of $36 \nbillion to the Pell grant program get for students? Yes, $36 billion.\n  First, it kicks the can down the road by only partially filling the \nunmet Pell obligation for this year which was promised in the so-called \nstimulus bill. The remainder only modestly increases the maximum Pell \ngrant awarded by $50 a year. How much do you think tuition is going up?\n  The Senator from Tennessee explained that every time we add people to \nMedicaid, that costs the States, and the only place the States have to \ncut is tuition, college tuition. If college tuition is cut, the board \nof the college has to raise the tuition. I will have a chart out here \none of these times that will show what the difference is between how \nfast college tuition is rising compared to health care costs, compared \nto the cost of living.\n  So we are going to kick the can down the road and only increase the \nmaximum Pell grant by $50 a year. In exchange, students are forced into \nthe one-size-fits all, government-run direct loan program while \nCongress continues to do nothing about the real problem, which is the \nrunaway cost of college education.\n  Schools have had the choice of switching to the direct loan program \nfor nearly 20 years, but most, just over 4,000 as of March 1, have \nchosen to remain in the family friendly bank loan program for \neducation. Why? Because the family friendly program provides services \nthat meet individual student needs far better than the cookie-cutter \napproach of a government-run direct loan program.\n  We have enough things the government is running, more this last year. \nThis rushed and dramatic shift puts at risk the availability of \nguaranteed loans for thousands of students this fall. Under the terms \nof this bill, all 4,000-plus institutions of higher education, the \nfamily friendly program will be required to participate in the \nbureaucratic direct loan program as of July 1, 2010, a few months away, \nless than 4 months from today.\n\n[[Page S1789]]\n\n  I do not believe these schools or the Department of Education have \nthe time or capacity to successfully meet that deadline, and the \nexperts at the Department seem to agree. According to a February 20, \n2010, Department of Education procurement document, schools need \nbetween 4 and 6 months to successfully switch to the direct loan \nprogram.\n  As a result, many schools will not have in place what it takes to get \nneeded aid to students this fall. Yes, it is true that reconciliation \nhas been used to affect student loans in the past. However, in those \ninstances, it was used to level the playing field between the two loan \nprograms and provide greater access by students to loans.\n  This bill is nothing more than a government takeover that will turn \nthe Department of Education into one of the largest banks in the \nNation--probably not under the financial reform requirements either--\nand transfer billions of dollars from middle-class students and \ntaxpayers to pay for only a modest expansion of the Pell grant program \nwhich does nothing to lower the cost of a college education.\n  I will propose amendments that address out-of-control education \ncosts, that give schools time to thoughtfully switch to the direct loan \nprogram, that make transparent the actual costs of the direct loan \nprogram, that fund an authorized and proven access and completion \nprogram, and put real money toward debt reduction.\n  The majority will tell you what they are doing is being done at no \ncost to the taxpayer. Do you think America believes that? I, as the \naccountant in the Senate, disagree with this assertion. In the family \nfriendly program, private lenders provide the capital necessary to fund \nbillions of dollars to student loans each year. With the direct loan \nprogram, the Treasury will provide all the capital for these loans, \nwhich amounts to nearly $100 billion a year. Where does the money come \nfrom? It comes from increasing the public debt of the American \ntaxpayers, many of whom do not have a college education. Shifting the \nfinancial burden from those who directly benefit from a college \neducation raises concerns about equity, and again does nothing to \naddress the larger problem of rapidly increasing costs for college \neducation.\n  This bill also removes safeguards against fraud and abuse from the \nBlack Lung Benefits program. The Black Lung Benefits Act provides \nmonthly payments and the cost of medical treatment to coal miners \ndisabled from pneumoconiosis, black lung, arising from their employment \nin or around the Nation's coal mines, and provides monthly payments to \nsurviving spouses and other dependents. This bill will establish a \nretroactive presumption of causation and entitle individuals to \nlifelong benefits which will be paid for by the employers, insurers \nand, in cases where the employer is already out of business, by the \ntaxpayers directly.\n  Taxpayers have already paid more for this program than they expected. \nThe estimated benefits costs when it was enacted in 1975 were $3 \nbillion. However, by 2004 the Federal Government had paid out over $42 \nbillion. Last year, the taxpayers kicked in another $6.5 billion to \nrefinance the program. The changes in this bill will send the program \nback into a debt spiral by eliminating any need to prove causation. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from three \nprominent West Virginia doctors who also oppose the provision because \nit ``does not take into account the current state of diagnosis and \ntreatment of Black Lung.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Offices of the Insurance Commissioner, State of West \n           Virginia,\n                                 Charleston, WV, November 6, 2009.\n     Jane L. Cline,\n     Commissioner, WV Offices of the Insurance Commissioner, \n         Charleston WV.\n       Commissioner Cline: We are writing this letter to comment \n     on the changes proposed in the health care reform bill \n     regarding the Federal Black Lung benefits program. We are \n     concerned that the proposed changes to the benefits program \n     do not have sound medical basis and are inconsistent with the \n     stated purpose of the bill. The bill is intended to improve \n     access to health care for all Americans, to improve quality \n     of care and to reduce cost by emphasizing preventive care, \n     management of chronic diseases and utilization of the \n     principles of evidence-based medicine.\n       The proposed Federal Black Lung changes would reinstate a \n     rebuttable presumption regarding the diagnosis of Black Lung \n     based on tenure in the mines and X-ray criteria. The proposed \n     changes would also restore the rebuttable presumption related \n     to death attributable to Black Lung as it affects surviving \n     spouse benefits.\n       We have concerns about the proposed amendments because they \n     do not take into consideration the current state of diagnosis \n     and treatment of Black Lung and other diseases. It is very \n     clear that our medical knowledge and expertise in diagnosis \n     and treatment have expanded dramatically in the past 25 \n     years. Our understanding of dust-related disease end other \n     pulmonary conditions has evolved significantly. Today chronic \n     diseases like diabetes, coronary artery disease, chronic \n     obstructive pulmonary disease and renal failure have become a \n     major focus of medical attention because they claim so many \n     lives. One in three individuals develops some type of cancer. \n     While the rebuttable presumption could have been appropriate \n     many years ago, our many advancements in diagnosis and \n     treatment render it unnecessary today and into the future.\n       The West Virginia rules governing the medical care of \n     workers with occupational pneumoconiosis have increasingly \n     relied on functional parameters (like forced vital capacity, \n     expiratory volumes and diffusion capacity) in determining the \n     need for medical services. We still consider the exposure \n     data and ILO B-reading a critical piece of the picture; but \n     we view function as the issue that matters most to the \n     affected worker. We strive to apply sound medical evidence to \n     assure that all miners who have contracted Black Lung receive \n     prescribed benefits and that the funds are preserved for \n     those claimants. The inclusion of a rebuttable presumption \n     will hinder the achievement of that goal.\n       In our opinion, changes in the Federal Black Lung benefits \n     program should take into account advances in our \n     understanding of the science and medicine of the disease, \n     Black Lung. We are most interested in seeing strong programs \n     to prevent disease through safety controls and education. \n     Access to medical services is critical for those already \n     affected. Though the diagnosis of Black Lung is statutorily \n     defined, there is an indisputable logic to basing the \n     diagnosis on the medical facts as we currently understand \n     them.\n       We recommend consideration of significant changes in the \n     wording of this section of the bill to make this document \n     more than just a change in benefits programs. Ideally, it can \n     be a medically sound and forward looking document, consistent \n     with the issues of health care reform in general.\n       Thank you for considering our comments.\n     James Becker, MD,\n       Medical Director, West Virginia Offices of the Insurance \n     Commissioner.\n     Dominic J. Gaziano, MD,\n       Board Certified Pulmonologist, Chairman of the Permanent \n     Total Disability Board, State of West Virginia.\n     Jack L. Kinder, MD,\n       Chairman of the Occupational Pneumoconiosis Board, West \n     Virginia.\n\n  While everyone supports providing these benefits to qualified miners \nand their families, we should not strip out safeguards against fraud, \nwaste and abuse in this program that were specifically added to the \nprogram by Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support.\n  I have said numerous times during my tenure in public service that \nthe first role of the government is to do no harm. While I know many \npeople are well versed on the intricacies of how these programs \noperate, I have studied these issues in depth for years, and have a \ntrack record of legislative success on both the health and education \nfront, because I first listen to my colleagues and regularly work \nacross party lines. This legislation falls short on many fronts, has \nnot been the subject of Senate hearings, is being jammed through this \ninstitution too quickly, and should be rejected by the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent to address the Senate as in \nmorning business for approximately 10 minutes, not more than 10 \nminutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I come to the floor to obviously comment on the events of \nthe last couple of days in the other body. The Nation watched as the \nprocess went forward and the votes were\n\n[[Page S1790]]\n\ncast. My understanding is, according to the media reports, champagne \nwas poured and the celebration went on inside the beltway.\n  Outside the beltway, in the homes and offices and all of the \nresidences and places where people gather across the country, there is \na sense of outrage, and a sense of betrayal because, for the first time \nin history, we have enacted a major reform on a strictly partisan basis \nabout which the process has angered the American people as much as the \nproduct.\n  The deals that were made behind closed doors for individuals, the \nnames of which we have all become familiar with--the ``Cornhusker \nkickback,'' the ``Louisiana purchase,'' the ``Gator aid,'' and also the \npurchases made of the various entities in the health care industry in \nAmerica--most egregious probably is that of Pharma, but the list goes \non, the AMA, the Hospital Association, it goes on and on.\n  Americans are disillusioned and are angry and Americans are not going \nto forget it. There seems to be an inside-the-beltway liberal media \nview that, well, it is done, the American people will forget about it; \nthey will appreciate it; and what a magnificent victory this is. It may \nbe in the view of some a victory for the President of the United \nStates. What it is is a defeat of the American people, because the \noverwhelming majority of American people, by 2-to-1 margins, said stop \nand start over. They said they did not want this and they did not like \nthis process. They do not like the behind-the-closed doors foolishness \nthat went on, that, in many peoples' minds represented an unsavory \nsausage-making process.\n  This morning's Wall Street Journal opinion is entitled: ``Inside the \nPelosi Sausage Factory'' and ``Michigan Rep. Bart Stupak Sold His Anti-\nabortion Soul For a Toothless Executive Order.''\n\n       Never before has the average American been treated to such \n     a live-action view of the sordid politics necessary to push a \n     deeply flawed bill to completion. It was dirty deals, open \n     threats, broken promises and disregard for democracy that \n     pulled ObamaCare to this point, and yesterday the same \n     machinations pushed it across the finish line.\n\n  Then this same article goes on to describe how.\n\n       For those who needed more persuasion: California Rep. Jim \n     Costa bragged publicly that during his meeting in the Oval \n     Office, he'd demanded the administration increase water to \n     his Central Valley district.\n\n  By the way, a move that I strongly favored.\n\n       On Tuesday, Interior pushed up its announcement giving the \n     Central Valley farmers 25 percent of water supplies, rather \n     than the expected 5 percent allocation. Mr. Costa, who denies \n     there was a quid pro quo, on Saturday said he'd flip to a \n     yes.\n       Florida Rep. Suzanne Kosmas (whose district is home to the \n     Kennedy Space Center) admitted that in her own Thursday \n     meeting with the president, she'd brought up the need for \n     more NASA funding. On Friday she flipped to a yes. So watch \n     the NASA budget.\n\n  Democrats inserted a new provision providing $100 million in extra \nMedicaid money for Tennessee. Retiring Tennessee Rep. Bart Gordon \nflipped to a yes vote on Thursday.\n  The list goes on and on. And those are the ones we know about. Those \nare the ones that have been publicized. We know about Pharma. We know \nabout the deal they got and about $100 million or so that they have \nspent on advertisements and paid ads touting this legislation, which \nwill get them billions of dollars in profits, the same Pharma that \nchanged the administration position on reimportation of drugs from \nCanada that is in direct contradiction of the position that then-\nSenator Obama had, that we should be able to reimport drugs from \nCanada, the same administration that supported competition amongst \npharmaceutical companies for Medicare enrollees and now changed that \nposition as well. There will be months, even years, where we will find \nout what went on behind closed doors, either in the majority leader's \noffice, the Speaker's office, or the White House.\n  There are those who believe the attention span of the American people \nis rather short. I disagree. I was back in my home State of Arizona on \nSaturday, two townhall meetings, hundreds of people packed into the \ntownhall meetings.\n  Every one of them is angry about what this will do, what this will do \nto companies and corporations such as Caterpillar that announced it \nwould cost them, in only 1 year, $100 million in additional taxes.\n  People have figured out the gimmickry of imposing taxes and cutting \nbenefits for 4 years before a single beneficiary receives any help, the \nmyth that we will actually cut 21 percent from doctors' payments for \ntreating Medicare enrollees that will take place this fall. Is there \nanyone who believes we are going to cut doctors' payments by 21 \npercent? If so, I would like to meet them and hear from them. We are \nnot. The word is out: Don't worry. We will fix it. And they will fix it \nbecause we can't do that to physicians. But yet they use that $271 \nbillion reduction in physicians' payments for treatment of Medicare \nenrollees as a way to disguise the true deficit. In fact, that alone \nwould show that this legislation would have resulted in an increase in \ncost rather than a decrease.\n  I haven't got that much time except to say that I want to make clear \nthat the people I represent in Arizona are not going to sit still for \nthis. They are going to want this repealed. We will challenge this in \nthe courts. We will challenge this in the towns. We will challenge this \nin the cities. We will challenge this on the farms. We will challenge \nthis all over America. The will of the people will be heard. They do \nnot like this process, and they do not like this product. We will \nprevail over time. I am confident of that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (Disturbance in the Visitors' Galleries)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, this evening, there is a vote scheduled on \nthe Ensign amendment, which would amend an archaic regulation, called \nthe DCA perimeter rule, that has limited competition and travel options \nfor those who fly in and out of Ronald Reagan Washington National \nAirport or DCA, as it is called.\n  More specifically, the DCA perimeter rule restricts the departure or \narrival of nonstop flights to or from airports that are beyond 1,250 \nmiles from DCA. This restriction effectively forces passengers who are \ncoming from the Western States or going to the Western\n\n[[Page S1791]]\n\nStates to use Dulles International Airport or to connect in some other \ncity and then come on in. Obviously, this is inconvenient and \ndiscriminatory.\n  The rule was first codified as a Federal statute in 1985. But \nactually it goes back to 1962. It first had existed as a Federal rule \nin its various iterations since the 1960s when Dulles was first built. \nThe original purpose of the DCA perimeter rule was to establish Dulles \nas the long-haul airport serving the Washington area, and that has \nworked.\n  In 1962, Dulles only served about 52,000 passengers. But today Dulles \nis thriving. In 2009, the airport served approximately 23 million \npassengers. According to the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority:\n\n       Dulles has emerged as one of the fastest growing airports \n     in the world and a major East Coat gateway for domestic and \n     international travelers as well as cargo activities.\n\n  Given the success of Dulles and the improvement in technology, \nincluding quieter jet engines, over the years, Congress has granted a \nlimited number of exemptions to the DCA perimeter rule because the \ntraveling public is eager for air travel options. Yet, today, there are \nonly a dozen nonstop flights between Ronald Reagan National Airport and \nthe entire Western United States. There are four to Denver, three to \nPhoenix, two to Seattle, one to Las Vegas, one to Los Angeles, and one \nto Salt Lake City. That is it.\n  To put that number in perspective, that is 12 flights beyond the \nperimeter at DCA out of approximately 400 flights daily. The beyond-\nthe-perimeter flights represent 3 percent of all daily domestic \noperations at DCA. Just 3 percent of all flights out of DCA serve our \nNation's largest cities such as Phoenix, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, and \nSan Antonio.\n  A 1999 study by the Transportation Research Board found that \nperimeter rules ``no longer serve their original purpose and have \nproduced too many adverse side effects, including barriers to \ncompetition.'' The study found, further, that such rules ``arbitrarily \nprevent some airlines from extending their networks to these airports'' \nand that ``they discourage competition among the airports in the region \nand among the airlines that use these airports.''\n  There is also recent legislative precedent that supports the argument \nthat the DCA perimeter rule should be repealed. The Wright Amendment of \n1979 was a Federal law restricting flights at Dallas's Love Field \nAirport. It originally limited most nonstop flights from Love Field to \ndestinations within Texas and neighboring States. In 2006, Congress \npassed the Wright Amendment Reform Act, which issued a full repeal of \nthe Love Field perimeter rule with certain conditions. Lifting the \nrestrictions at Love Field gave the traveling public more flight \noptions. It also cut prices and made traveling more efficient.\n  The Ensign amendment would amend the DCA perimeter rule by allowing \nany carrier which currently holds slots at DCA to convert those \nflights--flights now serving large hub airports inside the perimeter--\nto flights serving any airport outside the perimeter. This is referred \nto as ``the slot conversion provision;'' in other words, no more \nflights simply converting a flight that exists to go to a different \ncity. The Ensign amendment would cap the number of flights that could \nbe converted to 15 roundtrip flights per carrier.\n  The slot conversion provision ensures that service to small and \nmedium hub airports within the perimeter would not be affected. There \nis no restriction, however, on converting a flight that currently \nserves a large hub airport within the perimeter to a small or medium \nhub airport beyond the perimeter. So presumably the Ensign amendment \ncould expand service to small and medium hub airports beyond the \nperimeter. Indeed, I know some of the airlines do intend to use some of \nthese conversion slots to go to their hubs outside the perimeter.\n  It is also important to note that the amendment would not alter the \nslot regulations at DCA or increase the number of allowable flight \noperations at the airport. The number of flights currently serving DCA \nwould remain the same. Residents around the airport would not hear an \nincrease in noise from takeoffs or landings and would not see larger \nplanes operating at DCA. The only change is that a few of the planes \nwould have a different destination.\n  Let me speak to how this amendment would or would not affect Dulles. \nAs I mentioned, the conversion provision is capped at 15 roundtrip \nflights per carrier. It is expected that only 5 carriers could take \nadvantage of this provision, making the total maximum number of new \nflights that could go beyond the perimeter to 75. But not all of the 5 \nairlines will make full use of all 15 slots. It is estimated that the 5 \neligible airlines would only convert to perhaps 30 flights.\n  So how could flights, say, 30, at DCA that go beyond the perimeter \naffect Dulles? Well, according to the latest figures from the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority, Dulles has 401 daily \nflights. So 30 additional beyond the perimeter would have a negligible \neffect on the operations at or demand for service at Dulles.\n  According to a recent GAO study:\n\n       GAO did not find evidence in passengers or fare data that \n     would indicate that the new service between Reagan National \n     and the six beyond perimeter cities----\n\n  The current 12 exemptions that exist----\n\n     had substantially affected service from Dulles or Baltimore-\n     Washington International airports to these cities.\n\n  There is no reason to believe that 30 additional beyond the perimeter \nflights would be any more consequential to Dulles Airport.\n  The bottom line is, the Ensign amendment is not about changing the \ncharacter of Dulles International Airport as to the long-haul airport \nfor the region or increasing the amount of flights at DCA. It simply \nwould allow a limited number of direct flights out of DCA to reach the \nWestern States so that passengers have more choice. It would also allow \nmore tourists and business travelers from around the country another \noption for visiting the Nation's capital and its surrounding States, \nsuch as the State of Virginia.\n  My colleagues realize a lot has changed in 50 years, and they realize \nthe need that has previously existed to protect Dulles Airport has \nlessened due to its own success. Thanks to a recognition of this fact, \nand some assurances that have been made by Senators Dorgan and the \nActing President pro tempore, the Senator from Virginia, a vote on the \nEnsign amendment may not be needed tonight. Instead, it is my \nunderstanding that Senator Dorgan and other conferees will make a good-\nfaith effort to modify the DCA perimeter rule when the FAA \nreauthorization bill is conferenced with the House. I know my friend \nfrom North Dakota intends to pursue this matter in conference, and I \nappreciate what he has said on this matter.\n  I also very much appreciate the spirit by which the Acting President \npro tempore has approached this issue. As his predecessors have done, \nhe has very much acted out of concern both for the traveling public and \nalso the airports in his State of Virginia, and I would expect him to \ndo nothing less. But I appreciate the open mind he has in trying to \ndeal with an issue that we out West have that, hopefully, could be \nworked out in such a way that it would be a win-win and recognize the \nfact that times have changed since the early 1960s.\n  Mr. President, unless the Senator from West Virginia has anything, I \nwill suggest the absence of a quorum, and I do.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n     in praise of mary klutts, donna scheeder, and ronald o'rourke\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise to share the stories, once again, \nof some of our Nation's great Federal employees.\n  All throughout March, libraries across America have been celebrating\n\n[[Page S1792]]\n\nNational Reading Month. Children from coast to coast have been learning \nabout the importance of books, and schools have been promoting literacy \nas a tool for academic advancement.\n  This month-long celebration of reading--from Dr. Seuss's classic \n``The Cat in the Hat'' to Joyce's ``Ulysses''--reminds us not only of \nthe joy found in the written word but also of the critical role \nlibraries play in all our communities.\n  Libraries have long been a staple of American life, dating back even \nto our early colonial days. In the decades before the Revolution, \nAmerica's first libraries enabled the dissemination of the very ideas \nthat inspired our founding patriots. In the eighteenth century, the \nathenaeums of New England and the shareholder libraries of Benjamin \nFranklin served as precursors to our robust, modern network of free \npublic libraries.\n  In 1800, our predecessors in the Sixth Congress established a \nresearch library to help those in government carry out their work with \naccess to scholarly volumes on every subject. Today, the Library of \nCongress is the largest library in the world, and its ornate reading \nroom remains an awe-inspiring cathedral of learning.\n  I have chosen today to honor three public servants who work at the \nLibrary of Congress.\n  Mary Klutts began her Federal career as a U.S. Marine. In 1990, she \ncame to the Library of Congress as a budget analyst, and in her 20 \nyears there she has become an expert in every aspect of the Library's \noperating budget.\n  Since 2007, when Mary was named budget officer, she has set out to \ntransform the way the Library's budget proposals and funding \njustifications are formulated. Her work has helped make the Library's \nbudget and operations more transparent, and its funding proposals are \nmore concise. Now Library of Congress budget proposals are often cited \nas the model for the legislative branch. As a result of Mary's efforts, \nthe Library received strong support from Congress in appropriations for \nthe last two fiscal years.\n  During this time of economic challenges, Mary has helped demonstrate \nwhere every dollar of taxpayer money for the Library goes and why.\n  Another outstanding Library of Congress employee is Donna Scheeder, \nwho has worked there for over 40 years. Having worked in a number of \nroles throughout her career at the Library, Donna was an early champion \nof integrating computers into libraries, and she introduced the idea of \nelectronic briefing books for Congress.\n  She is recognized as a leader in the information management field, \nand she has guest-lectured around the world on the topic of legislative \nlibrary management. Donna is also a former president of the Special \nLibraries Association.\n  Until recently, Donna was serving as the Acting Law Librarian of \nCongress, and she was awarded the Federal Librarians Achievement Award \nin 2009.\n  An active member of the Washington, DC, community, she serves as \nChair of the Eastern Market Community Advisory Committee and on the \nBoard of the Old Naval Hospital Foundation. When not spearheading \ninnovative initiatives at the Library, Donna spends time relaxing at \nher home on the Delaware shore.\n  One of the branches of the Library of Congress most familiar to those \nof us who serve in this chamber is the Congressional Research Service, \nor CRS. This nonpartisan office houses scholars who prepare reports on \nevery policy issue and the effects of proposed and enacted legislation. \nThey are our ``go-to guys'' for information on every topic, and they \nare truly great at their jobs.\n  The third person I am honoring today has been an analyst with the CRS \nsince 1984.\n  When Ronald O'Rourke joined the CRS as a naval analyst, he arrived \nwith an impressive background as a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of the Johns \nHopkins University. He was also valedictorian of his class at the Nitze \nSchool of Advanced International Studies, where he obtained his \nmaster's degree.\n  At CRS, Ronald quickly distinguished himself as a leading expert on \nnaval strategic and budgetary issues, and he frequently briefs members \nof Congress and their staffs on defense programs and appropriations. He \nhas even been called to testify as an expert at congressional hearings.\n  Though he already had a busy schedule as a specialist in naval \naffairs, he stepped in when the CRS's expert in military aviation \npassed away suddenly last year. Ronald took responsibility for that \nportfolio in addition to his own, and his reports on high-profile \naviation programs proved invaluable during the congressional debates on \ndefense spending in the 2010 budget.\n  Mary Klutts, Donna Scheeder, and Ronald O'Rourke continue their work \nin public service at the Library of Congress to this day. They are just \nthree of the many talented and dedicated men and women whose work \nbenefits not only those of us in Congress but also the tens of millions \nwho access resources from community libraries throughout our Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in recognizing the important \ncontribution made by the employees of the Library of Congress.\n  They are all truly Great Federal Employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3528\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the McCain \namendment No. 3528. I understand we are scheduled to consider that \namendment in a series of votes beginning at 5:30 p.m. The amendment \ndeals with commercial air tours over Grand Canyon National Park. I wish \nto take a few minutes to explain the reasons for my opposition.\n  The Grand Canyon, of course, is one of the crown jewels of the \nNational Park System. It is one of the earliest areas that was set \naside for conservation purposes--originally in 1893 as a forest \nreserve; later designated as a national monument by President Theodore \nRoosevelt in 1908; and in 1919, it was designated by Congress as a \nnational park. The Colorado River winds its way over 275 miles through \nthe park, forming one of the most spectacular series of canyons \nanywhere in the world.\n  The park is one of the most heavily visited sites in our country, \nwith just under 4.4 million visitors last year. Visitors come not only \nto see the awe-inspiring views or to float down the Colorado River but \nalso to experience the quiet and the solitude that much of the park \noffers.\n  In recent years, however, experiencing the natural quiet has become \nmore difficult as noise associated with aircraft flights over the park \nhas resulted in increased noise on the ground in the park.\n  Recognizing this fact, in 1987 Congress enacted the National Parks \nOverflight Act. This law included a finding that ``noise associated \nwith aircraft overflights at Grand Canyon National Park is causing a \nsignificant adverse effect on the natural quiet and experience of the \npark . . .'' The 1987 Park Overflight Act directed the Secretary of the \nInterior to submit to the Federal Aviation Administration \n``recommendations regarding actions necessary for the protection of \nresources in the Grand Canyon from adverse impacts associated with \naircraft overflights.''\n  It also went on to say:\n\n     . . . and shall provide for substantial restoration of the \n     natural quiet and experience of the park and protection of \n     the public health and safety from adverse effects associated \n     with aircraft overflight.\n\n  Importantly, the act also directed the FAA to implement the \nSecretary's recommendations unless the FAA Administrator determined \ndoing so would adversely affect aviation safety.\n  In response to the 1987 law, the National Park Service developed \nrecommendations which were implemented by the FAA and which remained in \nplace for several years. However, by 1996, both the Park Service and \nthe FAA concluded that the policies in place were not achieving the \ngoal of restoring the natural quiet in the Grand Canyon. In addition, \nthe projected increase in commercial air tours over the park would \nresult in even more noise at the park.\n  Since then, the agencies attempted to finalize new rules to improve \nnoise\n\n[[Page S1793]]\n\nconditions in the park, but those rules were challenged in court, both \nby air tour operators who thought the rules were too restrictive and by \nenvironmental groups who thought the rules did not go far enough to \nlimit aircraft noise. The challenges went to the court of appeals on \ntwo separate occasions. This is in the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Following clarification of the law from the court in its most recent \ndecision in 2002, the agencies refined key definitions and have worked \nwith affected stakeholders to be able to finally implement a rule that \nwill achieve the congressional directive to restore the natural quiet \nin the Grand Canyon. I am told that currently the National Park Service \nand the FAA expect to have the draft environmental impact statement for \nthe proposed rule ready this summer and the final environmental impact \nstatement completed and a record of decision implemented sometime next \nyear.\n  That is a lot of history. It has been 23 years since the National \nParks Overflight Act was enacted. I appreciate the frustration all \nparties have with the fact that a final rule is still not in place that \nmeets the goals and requirements of the 1987 law. However, as evidenced \nby the history of the process I have described, the delays are not the \nresult of inaction or of inattention to the law; rather, they are the \nresult of the difficulty establishing accurate models for acceptable \nnoise standards, as well as the multiple legal challenges that have \noccurred.\n  I have several concerns with the amendment Senator McCain has \nproposed. My principal objection is, however, that I do not believe it \nmakes sense to legislatively enact new standards when the National Park \nService is close to putting out its new recommendations, especially \nsince it has taken so long to get to this point. I believe the better \naction would be for us to wait and see what the agencies actually \npropose. Then, if there is disagreement with the new proposed rule, we \ncan enact legislation to correct it.\n  Besides the fact that I believe the timing of the amendment is \npremature, I also have concerns about many of the specific provisions \nthe amendment would legislate. Some of these get somewhat detailed.\n  Let me indicate that there is a concern I have with the definition in \nthis legislation for ``substantial restoration of the natural quiet.'' \nWhat does that mean? The legislation would establish a certain \ndefinition of that which is significantly different from what has been \nassumed and worked with for a long time by a great many people.\n  The amendment also prohibits the National Park Service from \nconsidering aircraft sound from sources other than commercial tour \noperators, which will significantly limit the ability to control \naircraft noise over the park.\n  The amendment prohibits the allocation for commercial air tours over \nthe Grand Canyon from being reduced, notwithstanding any other \nprovision of law, regardless of the noise effects over the park. It \ngoes even further and directs that the FAA begin a rulemaking to \nincrease the flight allocations over the park.\n  Because the proposal has not been through a standard committee \nprocess--as, to my knowledge, there have not been hearings on this \nproposal--and input from affected agencies and stakeholders have not \nbeen solicited, the potential impact of several other provisions in the \namendment remain unclear, at least to this Senator. For all these \nreasons, I believe we should not proceed with this amendment, and I \nwould urge my colleagues to oppose it.\n  Let me mention also a very good editorial on this issue that appeared \nin the Arizona Republic yesterday. It is entitled ``Congress Should Not \nFoil Process,'' and its first couple of sentences say:\n\n       The plan to reduce aircraft noise at the Grand Canyon is \n     finally wrapping up. Suddenly, there's an attempt in Congress \n     to make a last-minute end-run around the process. This makes \n     no sense. The draft environmental document is weeks away from \n     being released. Multiple stakeholders have weighed in. After \n     years of work, we are on the verge of a plan to restore \n     natural quiet to one of the most majestic places on Earth.\n\n  Then it goes on to discuss, in very substantial detail, what the \namendment of Senator McCain would try to do. It ends by saying:\n\n       Congress should hold off. A plan to restore quiet at the \n     Grand Canyon is so close to completion. Let the process go \n     forward.\n\n  That sums up my sentiments exactly. I hope we will heed the good \nadvice contained in the editorial, and I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record the article from the Arizona Republic.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Arizona Republic, Mar. 21, 2010]\n\n                    Congress Should Not Foil Process\n\n       The plan to reduce aircraft noise at the Grand Canyon is \n     finally wrapping up. Suddenly, there's an attempt in Congress \n     to make a last-minute endrun around the process. This makes \n     no sense. The draft environmental document is weeks away from \n     being released. Multiple stakeholders have weighed in. After \n     years of work, we're on the verge of a plan to restore \n     natural quiet to one of the most majestic places on Earth.\n       But last week, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., introduced \n     legislation that would unilaterally set out rules for air-\n     tour operations at the Grand Canyon.\n       The measure, an amendment to another bill, was co-sponsored \n     by his fellow Arizona Republican, Jon Kyl, and Nevada's \n     senators, Democrat Harry Reid and Republican John Ensign.\n       McCain has been a longtime champion of park tranquillity. \n     He helped pass the National Park Overflights Act in 1987, \n     which directed the Federal Aviation Administration and the \n     National Park Service to reduce noise from low-flying \n     aircraft at the Grand Canyon.\n       Since then, the process of adopting a noise-management plan \n     often seemed to move at the same geological pace as the \n     forces shaping the Canyon. As 23 years rolled by, McCain \n     repeatedly expressed impatience. And we agreed.\n       But now is not the time for Congress to step in. The draft \n     environmental-impact statement, which will identify a \n     preferred noise-reduction strategy, is expected to be out by \n     the beginning of May. It will address such issues as the \n     number of flights, requirements for quieter aircraft and \n     hours of operation.\n       The public will have a chance to comment before a final \n     choice is made. The Federal Aviation Administration will then \n     adopt rules, which should be in place by early 2011.\n       We must achieve a delicate balancing act at the Grand \n     Canyon: giving visitors access, including by air, while \n     preserving as much of its wild solitude as possible.\n       Many groups and individuals from all sides have contributed \n     countless hours to the process, hunting for the best balance.\n       The amendment would ignore their efforts and set into law \n     such issues as operating hours, air-corridor routes and \n     flight allocations.\n       It would prohibit reducing the number of flights currently \n     allowed. It would exclude any consideration of noise from \n     regular commercial air traffic. It would decree that natural \n     quiet is restored if for at least 75 percent of the day, 50 \n     percent of the park is free of sound from authorized air \n     tours.\n       Years of work on the environmental review may indicate that \n     different rules or more flexibility are in order. But if the \n     amendment passes, anything that doesn't conform to it will go \n     into the waste basket.\n       In his floor statement in the Senate, McCain said the \n     amendment reduces excessive aircraft noise ``without waiting \n     another 23 years for progress.''\n       But we don't have years to wait anymore. We'll see a noise-\n     management proposal within weeks.\n       Why the rush? Are air-tour operators--with a heavy presence \n     in Las Vegas--pushing to get rules to their liking in place, \n     trumping whatever is in the environmental-impact statement?\n       Congress should hold off. A plan to restore quiet at the \n     Grand Canyon is so close to completion. Let the process go \n     forward.\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as we approach a final vote on the \nFAA reauthorization, which we are doing slowly--that will take place at \nabout 5:30--I wish to talk briefly about why I think this is so \nimportant. I see my distinguished colleague from Texas is here, whom I \nam going to praise so much in my final comments, but she will have to \nwait for that. I wish to discuss why we have spent so much precious \ntime in the middle of a national debate on health care and jobs and the \neconomy to work on this bill, which we have been doing now for several \nyears. As I have often pointed out, it was sort of pushed forward 11 \ntimes without a final resolve. We want a final resolve\n\n[[Page S1794]]\n\nthis evening, and we believe we are going to get one.\n  We are here today because FAA reauthorization is about so much more \nthan aviation. It has everything to do with safety for our people, it \nis about jobs, it is about our economy, it is about, frankly, our self-\nesteem as a nation in the world of aviation. Fifty percent of all the \nflights that take place in the world are American planes, but we are \nbehind, in some ways, and we shouldn't be. The Congress has allowed us \nto be behind because we haven't been able to put attention on this \nbecause time is hard to get on the floor. So I appreciate Leader Reid's \nwillingness to give us this time, even as these momentous matters are \ngoing on.\n  To me, this is all about improving commercial aviation air service to \nsmall and rural counties, communities. You would expect that from me. I \nrepresent my State. But as chairman of the committee, I represent the \ncountry, too, as does my distinguished ranking member. It is also very \nmuch about establishing better consumer rights protections for the \npeople who fly, whom we call passengers and whom we also call \nconsumers. But ultimately it is about improving safety and about \nmodernizing our system, which I have taken very seriously for years and \nabout which we have done precious little. In other words, it is about \npeople's lives every day.\n  I can remember years ago I could say a relatively few percentage of \nthe folks from my State flew. They just didn't fly. I mean a lot did \nbut most didn't. That has changed now. You can't do business in West \nVirginia, and West Virginians can't do anything without getting on an \nairplane, if you can find one to get on and if you cram yourself into \none--which would be a problem for the Presiding Officer as well as the \npresent speaker. In other words, our utmost priority always has to be \nsafety in the skies and for the passengers and their families. They \nhave to trust us to get this right.\n  There is a lot that goes wrong. There is a lot that isn't noticed \nthat goes wrong, but we do notice and we haven't corrected it and we \nhave a moral obligation to correct it. So let me say a word about \nsafety.\n  Statistically, as everybody says, we have the safest air \ntransportation system in the world. I always bridal a little bit when I \nhear that. It is true. Our airlines talk about it, politicians talk \nabout it. But it is so much less safe than it could easily be if we \nwere to be a bit more farsighted and energetic. We have done that in \nthe Commerce Committee, and we have put forward a bill which does that \nand creates a much more wholesome story and I will get into that.\n  It has been a little more than a year since the tragic crash in \nBuffalo, NY, of flight 3407 that took the lives of 50 people. It is \nclear we need to take serious steps to improve pilot training, to \naddress flight crew fatigue, which seems to be an esoteric subject \nuntil you look at it. Senator Byron Dorgan, who is the chairman of our \nsubcommittee, had some charts which brilliantly showed what pilots in \nsome of these commuter airlines have to go through to get to work and \nsometimes then go two nights with no sleep before they fly. Well, it \ndoesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that is dangerous. And \nthen you have chatter in the cockpits. We have even had one instance of \nan 8- or 11-year-old kid helping to land a plane. I mean it is \nridiculous. It is pathetic. It exists. We are trying to get rid of all \nthat.\n  Our bill does a lot to address these problems. We need to have \nresources for all our airports, both large and small. This legislation \nis about equality among airports and economic stability among airports. \nWe have to provide adequate resources to airports, both large and \nsmall, both urban and rural. When people think of California, they \nthink of San Francisco and Los Angeles, but they don't think of the \ndozens of places in between and above and below that are rural or the \ninner part of California, where people need air transportation but have \na hard time.\n  The continuing economic crisis has hit the U.S. airline industry very \nhard. That is easy to say, but it has been devastating for our legacy \nairlines. They have been in and out of bankruptcy, mergers have taken \nplace, and they are always on the edge. I remember at one point they \nwere showing how they were going to move the seats about an inch closer \nto each other and there was an uproar. So the pillows disappeared and \nthe pretzels and the potato chips disappeared and we have come to \nunderstand that. They are not doing that because they want to treat us \nbadly. They are doing that because every penny is desperate for them, \nand they have overwhelming problems with the recession. Even before the \nrecession, they were having overwhelming problems.\n  That is the whole question with the deregulation of airlines. A lot \nof things happened, not all of them good. I can remember--and I hope my \nranking member will indulge me--when I went to West Virginia in 1964, \nand I drove there, actually, but there were Eastern Airlines jets, \nthere were United Airlines jets, there were American Airlines jets, and \nall the big jets at that time. Within 3 weeks of deregulation, they \nwere all gone. Now I take my 6 feet 6\\1/2\\ inches and pray I get an \nexit row. I am a master at working the exit system, should that ever be \nnecessary, but I have to have that exit row, which is always No. 7, or \nelse I am in big trouble.\n  The continuing economic crisis has hit the U.S. airline industry \nextremely hard and this affects the future of hundreds of our \ncommunities and particularly rural communities because the rural \ncommunities are always at the end of the food chain. When you are at \nthe end of the food chain, it is akin to being at the end of the line. \nYou are the one who is cut out. No more seats in the house, you are cut \nout, cut off. I have witnessed that a lot in West Virginia and it \nhurts. It hurts. I have seen, time and time again, how important a \nlifeline it is for local communities, and therefore it continues to \nhurt.\n  The Federal Government needs to provide additional resources and \ntools for small communities to attract adequate airline service. That \nis possible. It is not just a matter of the Federal Government \nsupplying a certain amount of money or the essential air service, it is \na matter of the local airports taking themselves very seriously as a \nproduct. We discovered that in West Virginia. Others have discovered \nit, perhaps before us or after us, but it makes no difference, you have \nto market yourself. An airport is not just a place where planes land, \nit is a consumer product and it has to be marketed.\n  It used to be that lots of our people drove to Cincinnati and took \nSouthwest, and there was nothing we could do about it. Of course, there \nwas something we could do about it, and that was to market our airport \nin Charleston, WV, and we did that. They marketed on the air, in the \nnewspapers, and they marketed it in every way possible. Gradually, the \npeople who had been going to Cincinnati stopped going to Cincinnati \nbecause they discovered they didn't have to spend the money on gasoline \nand the overnight motel rooms. They could simply go to Charleston, to \nYeager Airport, and get to Huntington or Parkersburg or wherever it \nwas.\n  So it is a tough fight for local communities. It is easy if you are \nin a big city. It is hard if you are in a small State, and the \nPresiding Officer is familiar with that. So our legislation \naccomplishes this business of new resources by building on the existing \nprograms and strengthening them.\n  There are some very good programs. I will not go into all of them \nnow, but there are some very good programs. The Airport Improvement \nProgram was started a number of years ago. It is absolutely superb at \nwhat it does. It allows airports to expand, to build parking garages, \nto expand runways, and build those sort of off-ramp safety places, as \nthey do for trucks, so that when they are speeding too much and \nsuddenly there is something which shoots up the hill. Airports have \nsomething called EMASS, which is the same thing. At the end of a \nrunway, if the plane lands on a short runway--because most of our \nairports are on the tops of hills--and they overshoot a little bit, \nthey can end up in an EMASS and they are safe. It is soft concrete \nblocks. We had 34 lives saved in the last month and a half because of \nthat EMASS system which happened to be there, and that has to be \nutilized all over the country.\n  Consumer rights. This bill also strengthens passenger protections by\n\n[[Page S1795]]\n\nincorporating elements of the Passenger Bill of Rights to deal with the \nmost egregious flight delays and cancellations. We are rather specific \nabout that. You never know exactly how things work out, but we have set \nsome rules. We have said nobody can wait more than 3 hours without \nfood, without medical attention, without bathroom facilities. They have \nto take the passengers back, get them to unload so you don't have these \n9-hour, 8-hour, 7-hour waits that always become national stories \nwhenever they happen. That is not a question of being practical, it is \na question of being humane. It makes sense. It takes away people's \nanger, and it makes them more likely to want to fly.\n  Passengers, frankly, have really had it with endless delays--they \nreally have had it. They do not like the way they are being treated, \nespecially when they are stuck on a tarmac in the summertime. People \nfeel bad sometimes when they are just in an airplane--the white-knuckle \nsyndrome even if they are not flying, just being in an airplane. The \nair is not always so good. People can come close to a point of panic. \nYou don't want that. We deal with that in this legislation. We do have \na responsibility to bring their rights back into the equation and take \nthem seriously.\n  Modernization. Our system is outdated. It is strained beyond its \ncapacity. I feel very passionate about this one and I have for years. \nAmerica's air traffic control system is literally using a World War II \ntechnology. We are the only ones in the industrialized world who do \nthat. It is embarrassing beyond belief, it is costly beyond belief, it \nis climate-unfriendly beyond belief, and it is dangerous beyond belief \nbecause everything is based on radar. It is ancient, World War II. We \nhave not changed. Everybody else has. Mongolia has done it. We have \nnot.\n  On the committee, we decided we were going to get into it in a very \nbig way. The Next Generation Air Transportation System, called \nNextGen--that is what we call it--will save our economy billions by \ncreating additional capacity and more direct routes, allowing aircraft \nto move more efficiently. Why? Because it will be GPS, it will be \ndigitalized, and it will be real-time streaming of where airplanes are. \nIt will help the ground controllers. They will have to put equipage in \nthe airlines themselves so the pilots and the ground-control people \nwill know exactly where they are at all times. That means maybe they \nwill be able to bring planes closer together and can land more often or \nfly a little closer together--things that cause the whole system to \npurge itself of inefficiencies, but not unsafely but safely because you \nare using a digitalized system which the rest of the world is already \nusing.\n  It has the further advantage, which I have indicated, of reducing \ncarbon emissions and noise emissions. Noise emissions are very \nimportant. The noise emissions can be overestimated by some; \nnevertheless, if people feel strongly about it, they feel strongly \nabout it, and people do feel strongly about it. You see that in our \nlocal area here. So we want to be helpful on that.\n  A modern air traffic control system will provide pilots and their air \ntraffic controllers with a better situational awareness--I have said \nthat, but it is so important--giving them the tools to see other \naircraft, both at the same time, both streaming information real time. \nAlso, the weather maps, so they have precise knowledge--not just visual \nknowledge of where there might be a thunderstorm but precise knowledge.\n  This kind of modernization requires sustained focus and substantial \nresources. We have worked that out in our bill, and we will have a \nnationwide system by, I believe it is, 2025. It seems like a long way \noff, but considering where we are starting--we only have one in place, \nin the gulf, which is working. We have to do the whole system. It costs \nmoney, both by the Federal Government and by airlines--which are not \ngoing to love that, but it is part of the deal. This authorization \ntakes steps to make sure we begin all of this now.\n  In closing, we have to move boldly. This is a huge subject. It is a \nhuge part of our economy. I guess 700 million people fly today, each \nyear. In the next 10 years, it will go over 1 billion, maybe 1.2 \nbillion people in the air over the course of a year. At any given \nmoment, there are 36,000 planes in the skies. How do you keep track of \nthem all? How can you be sure that they are safe, that they are not \ngoing? How do you shut off the chatter business where pilots are just \ntalking to each other about things. How far do you go on that without \ninvading privacy rights? On the other hand, if you don't go far enough, \nyou are invading consumer and passenger safety, and I lean in that \ndirection.\n  Last week, I spoke a little on the floor about the main four goals we \nset out to achieve with this bill. No. 1 is to address critical safety \nconcerns. No. 2 is to establish a roadmap to implement NextGen, that \nis, the modern system, so we can catch up with Mongolia and accelerate \nthe FAA's key modernization programs. No. 3 is to invest in airport \ninfrastructure. It is so important. If you look at what is happening at \nDulles Airport--that is sort of an extreme example because that is \npreparing for the 23rd century, not for the 21st or 22nd. But they have \nit right, they have all the land out there, they have bonding \nauthority, and they can do what they want. They have a good board. It \nworks very well for them. It needs to work for other airports, also, in \nsmall communities as well. No. 4 is to continue improving small \ncommunities' access to the nation's aviation system. You know I will \nnever deviate from that, coming from the State of West Virginia.\n  Frankly, I am proud of how far we have come and prouder still that we \ngot here in a truly bipartisan fashion. It is refreshing. It was quite \nwonderful, working with Senators--obviously Senator Hutchison being the \nkey; Senator Dorgan, a terrific chairman of the aviation subcommittee, \nabsolutely terrific; also, Senator DeMint--toward a vibrant, strong \naviation system so fundamental to our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to give the FAA the tools, the resources, the \ndirection, and the deadlines to make sure the agency can provide \neffective oversight of the aviation industry. This is a big-ticket item \nthat appears not so dramatic as events of the recent days, but over the \ncourse of our country, it is extraordinarily dramatic.\n  I will at the proper time urge my colleagues to support \nreauthorization. As I say, we have put this off now 11 different times. \nThis will last for 2 years after conference--it may be 3 years. I would \ntake more than that, myself. But we cannot afford to wait any longer.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3528, Withdrawn\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, on behalf of the Senator from Arizona, \nMr. McCain, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3528 be \nwithdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me say that I know Senator \nRockefeller and I will have a little time toward the vote to do a \nsummation of the bill. But while we are at this stage, I do wish to say \nthat I think we have taken a major step forward in FAA reauthorization. \nAs many who have worked on this project know, we have had 11 extensions \nof FAA reauthorization since 2007--short-term extensions because we \nhave not been able to get the agreements that are necessary to propel \nthis bill from the floor.\n  There are some very important provisions of this bill that I hope we \nwill eventually have final passage and that we can all support. \nHowever, we are not there yet. We are at the stage of getting it from \nthe Senate floor, but there are still some issues that will have to be \nresolved even before we go to conference.\n  I think before we appoint conferees there will have to be some \nagreements that have not yet been clearly reached. One of those is the \nperimeter rule. I am going to talk a little bit more about that when my \ncolleague, Senator Ensign, comes because his amendment is the pending \namendment on that on the bill. But besides the perimeter rule, there \nare issues that are addressed in this bill that are so important, that\n\n[[Page S1796]]\n\nwill take us a major step forward for the traveling public in our \ncountry.\n  There are safety provisions in this bill addressing issues throughout \nall sectors of the aviation community. I think they are major \nimprovements in our airline safety, although we know we have the safest \nsystem we have ever had. There are very few accidents. But I do think \nthe accidents we have had are still teaching us what can be done in the \narea of fatigue of pilots and human factors, which has always been the \nhardest part of the aviation system to address. We do have some \nstandards and a way forward that I think will improve aviation safety \nbecause none of us wants to have anything less than 100 percent \naviation safety. That is what we are striving for.\n\n  The bill will also modernize our air traffic control system. Our air \ntraffic control system is using technology that is probably based back \nin the 1960s. It is time for us to have a satellite-based system. This \nis going to be expensive. Having the startup of this NextGen system is \nessential for our country to stay in the forefront of efficient use of \nour air traffic control system, and also eventually, hopefully, when it \nis all in place, we will also be able to open more airspace so we can \nbetter utilize our air traffic control system.\n  The bill will provide infrastructure funds for our airports. That is \none of the reasons we need to get this bill from the floor and assure \nour airports that the airport trust fund money is available, it is \nstable, and they can count on the funds flowing from the airport trust \nfund in an orderly way so that the improvements to our airports can be \ndone.\n  The bill will improve rural access to aviation through the Essential \nAir Service Program. This is a very important part of our whole system. \nNot only do we have a great general aviation community, which does so \nmuch for capabilities for volunteers and recreational pilots to use our \nairspace, but also the business aviation--the smaller aviation \nfacilities that are private but also very important. And then, of \ncourse, our regional airlines are a very important part of our overall \nair service, and we will have improvements in those sectors.\n  The bill will improve passenger and consumer protections. There is no \ndoubt that the Passenger Bill of Rights is long overdue, and I think we \nhave come to a good place to protect passengers from sitting on the \ntarmac for 5 hours without the ability to get off an airplane. Issues \nsuch as that that have cropped up are being addressed in our new \nPassenger Bill of Rights. It will strengthen aeronautics and aviation \nresearch as well.\n  There is a lot that is good in this bill, and we still have a long \nway to go to finish it, but I do look forward to working through \ntonight, getting the bill passed from the Senate, and then working on \nthese issues that are not yet completely agreed to before we go to \nconference. Then, from there, I hope we can take the next step, which \nis not going to be an easy one, and that is resolving the differences \nbetween the House and Senate bills. The differences are pretty big, so \nI think we are going to have our jobs cut out for us. It means we are \nnot anywhere close to being finished yet, but we are certainly in a \nbetter place than we have ever been since 2007 when FAA \nreauthorization, the previous bill, lapsed, and we have been doing \nshort-term extensions since then.\n  I look forward to more after wrap-up and more of a discussion of the \nperimeter rule as soon as Senator Ensign arrives.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                 Boise Terminal Radar Approach Control\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I appreciate the fact that the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee have created an Air \nTraffic Control Modernization Board and tasked it with reviewing and \nevaluating the Federal Aviation Administration facility and service \nrealignment proposals.\n  The Idaho delegation has been raising serious concerns with the FAA's \nproposed transfer of the Boise Terminal Radar Approach Control, TRACON, \nfor several years. Despite the years of requests for transparency and \ndetailed cost and safety data, the agency has failed to clearly \ndemonstrate that the radar transfer would result in improved air \ntraffic control services for Boise air traffic users. In fact, the \nevidence that the Idaho delegation has seen continues to indicate that \nservices would be diminished and efficiency and operational costs could \nalso be impacted.\n  The Idaho delegation requested the Department of Transportation's \nOffice of the Inspector General to initiate a study of the costs \nassociated with this radar transfer. In addition we have asked the Air \nTraffic Safety Oversight Service, AOV, to determine whether FAA safety \nrisk management procedures have been followed in the proposed move.\n  The Idaho delegation remains unconvinced that physically relocating \nthe radar would be cost effective and question the assumptions that \nhave driven the FAA's proposal. Because these concerns have not been \nadequately addressed, we believe the consolidation should be halted \nuntil the new Air Traffic Control Modernization Oversight Board \ncompletes its recommendations for realignment.\n  As I read the new section 308 language, the bill will halt the \nconsolidation of the Boise TRACON into the Salt Lake City TRACON until \nafter the board completes its recommendations for realignment even \nthough the FAA has sent an article 46 notification to move the Boise \nTRACON to Salt Lake City. At this point, I ask to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from the National Air Traffic Controllers Association, \nNATCA, that agrees with this position.\n  The letter follows.\n\n                                              National Air Traffic\n\n\n                             Controllers Association, AFL-CIO,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 18. 2010.\n       Dear Senators Crapo and Risch: We write today to thank you \n     for your continued leadership in the U.S. Senate on behalf of \n     the air traffic controllers in Idaho.\n       As you know, the National Air Traffic Controllers \n     Association has a strong track record of support of \n     consolidations that do not compromise safety. Unfortunately, \n     the FAA has failed to collaborate with the controller \n     workforce during its most recent round of facility and \n     service realignments, including the agency's intentions to \n     remove local radar services from Boise. Your support for the \n     controllers in Idaho during this dispute has been critical \n     and has not gone unnoticed.\n       The language in Section 308 of the substitute amendment to \n     H.R. 1586, legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, will protect the Boise TRACON and the city's \n     air traffic control facilities from the FAA's current plans \n     to transfer these services to Salt Lake City despite the \n     FAA's Article 46 notification of its intent to move forward \n     with the proposed transfer.\n       This language will ensure the local radar services will \n     remain at Boise until the Air Traffic Control Modernization \n     Oversight Board's recommendations are complete, or with the \n     full participation of and collaboration with the air traffic \n     controllers at Boise. Similarly, we at NATCA will not move \n     forward with negotiations with the FAA on the Boise TRACON \n     transfer without full cooperation with the Idaho \n     Congressional Delegation and other key stakeholders. Full \n     collaboration will ensure that this and all future ATC \n     facility and service realignments will only be considered if \n     the proposals serve the public good by improving safety, \n     efficiency and service.\n       The inclusion of this provision in the substitute amendment \n     is a direct product of your tireless efforts to compel the \n     FAA to work collaboratively with the air traffic controllers \n     and other vital aviation stakeholders in Boise. On behalf of \n     the air traffic controllers in Boise and throughout the \n     country, we want to thank you for your continued leadership \n     on this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     Patricia Gilbert,\n       National Executive Vice President.\n     Mark Griffin,\n       President, Boise NATCA Local.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I completely agree with the distinguished \nsenior Senator from Idaho, and I associate myself with his statements \nfully. Senator Crapo and I want to confirm with the chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee that section 308 \nprohibits the FAA from proceeding with the consolidation of the Boise \nTRACON into the Salt Lake City TRACON until after the board completes \nits recommendations concerning all air traffic control facility \nrealignments and consolidations nationwide. From where we stand, it is \nnecessary to have a thorough review of the Boise consolidation and an \nindependent determination of the cost effectiveness of transferring the \nBoise TRACON to Salt Lake City.\n\n[[Page S1797]]\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Yes, that is correct. The FAA article 46 \nnotification of its intent to move forward with the proposed transfer \nwould be stopped if section 308 is enacted into law, unless the \naffected employees execute a written agreement regarding the proposed \nrealignment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I concur with the Senator from West Virginia. No \nrealignments will be allowed to continue before the completion of the \nboard's recommendations, unless the affected employees and the FAA \nagree in writing to do so.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Per this colloquy, Senator Risch and I will follow up with \nthe FAA that it is the clear intent of the Senate for the FAA to halt \nits consolidation of the Boise TRACON until after the new board \ncompletes its recommendations for realignment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, FAA authorization expired in Octobeer of \n2007.\n  For more than 2 years, we have been operating on short-term \nextensions.\n  I thank Chairman Rockefeller and Senators Hutchison, Dorgan and \nDeMint for working together to bring this bill to the floor.\n  The bill before us will improve the safety of air travel, modernize \nour air traffic control system, boost the economy and create thousands \nof jobs.\n  Senator Dorgan and Senator Rockefeller have had many hearings over \nthe last few years on aviation but each hearing had one theme: safety.\n  This bill will improve safety by creating an Aviation Safety \nWhistleblower Investigation Office that can catch problems before they \nresult in serious accidents.\n  The bill also requires the FAA Administrator to re-evaluate flight \ncrew training and certification.\n  We also require FAA to establish safety standards for training \nprograms for flight crew members and aircraft dispatchers.\n  Another key component of this bill is NextGen.\n  NextGen is the term we use to describe our transition to a more \nmodern, satellite-based air traffic control system.\n  NextGen will give pilots and air traffic controllers the ability to \nccurately pinpoint aircraft in the sky--to avoid problems, to monitor \ntraffic, to move things more smoothly, safely and efficiently.\n  The FAA released its aviation forecast study last Tuesday.\n  Last year, we saw 704 million passengers carried on U.S. airlines. \nSoon, hose numbers will increase significantly. The FAA reports we will \nsee more than 1 billion air passengers by 2023 and more than 1.2 \nbillion passengers by 2030. We just do not have the capacity with our \ncurrent air traffic control sstem to handle this increase in traffic. \nBut with NextGen, we hope to triple the capacity of our national \naviation system.\n  This technology will allow planes to fly the straightest, quickest \nroute from point A to point B. And with more precise information and \nbetter communication between the ground and the cockpit, we can fit \nmore planes safely in our airspace. Doing so will save airlines at \nleast 3.3 billion gallons of fuel a year or more than $10 billion \nannually by 2025. NextGen should also reduce airport delays \nsignificantly.\n  Chicago's Midway Airport was ranked dead last in January for on-time \ndepartures among the nation's 29 busiest airports. Chicago's O'Hare \nairport has won that dubious distinction more than once. One of the \nmain reasons for these delays is the lack of capacity in airspace. \nFully implementing NextGen should reduce delays by half.\n  This is a great investment. This bill will help airports and air \ntravelers in Illinois and nationwide save time and money.\n  In Illinois, we are in the middle of the largest airport expansion \nproject in U.S. history at O'Hare airport.\n  This $6.6 billion project will completely reconfigure the runways at \nO'Hare to make sure we can move more traffic in and out of Chicago more \nefficiently. Moving this project along means a lot to the people of \nChicago and Illinois. O'Hare already generates 450,000 jobs and $38 \nbillion in economic activity for the Chicago region and the State of \nIllinois. The O'Hare modernization project will create 195,000 more \njobs, and another $18 billion in annual economic activity. This bill \nwill allow O'Hare to keep moving forward by streamlining the passenger \nfacility charge application process.\n  And it isn't just O'Hare. Airports in Illinois will benefits from \nmore than $4 billion per year for the airport improvement program, AIP.\n  Last year, airports in the Quad Cities, Rockford, Decatur and \nSpringfield all used AIP funds to make critical improvements to their \nairfields.\n  Keeping this funding flowing will allow these airports to handle the \ntraffic of today and the future increases of tomorrow.\n  The bill helps rural areas keep the commercial air service they have \nnow and attract new service in the future. For a long time, the \nEssential Air Service, EAS, program was relegated to the back bench at \nthe Department of Transportation.\n  In Illinois, two air carriers provided subpar service for too long.\n  In 2007, the EAS carrier providing service from Quincy, Decatur and \nMarion, IL, to St. Louis was shut down by the FAA. The next carrier \npromised each community four round-trips each day and codeshare \nagreement with a major airline. That carrier broke those promises and \nleft town as soon as they could. This administration is taking a \ndifferent approach and so is this Congress.\n  This bill fully funds the EAS program and puts in place important \nreforms so the Department of Transportation works with businesses, \nlocal communities and the airline industry to start and retain quality \nair service to rural communities.\n  Without a robust EAS program, many rural communities would have no \ncommercial air service at all, and residents of smaller cities would \nhave to travel significant distances for flights. But with reliable and \nsafe commercial air service, communities can retain and attract \nbusinesses.\n  The bill also helps smaller airports gain new commercial air service \nby increasing funding for the Small Community Air Service Grant \nprogram.\n  This program has helped airports in Illinois, including Rockford and \nSpringfield, bring new routes to their cities.\n  I want to thank Senator Rockefeller for including the Essential Air \nService and Small Community provisions in this bill and for creating an \nOffice of Rural Aviation within DOT to make sure rural areas are not \nforgotten.\n  Safety, efficiency, capacity and even the connectivity in smaller \ncommunities--all of these aspects of the FAA reauthorization also \ngenerate jobs.\n  The FAA estimates commercial aviation is responsible for 5.2 percent \nof gross domestic product and generates $1.142 trillion in economic \nactivity.\n  The aviation industry provides $346 billion in earnings and 10.2 \nmillion jobs.\n  And this bill will help grow those numbers. In 2010, DOT estimates \nthis legislation will support 150,000 jobs. The economist Mark Zandi \nsaid, ``Aviation is the glue that keeps the global economy together.''\n  This bill will boost our economy now and lay the foundation to keep \nthe United States competitive in the global marketplace moving forward.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise in support of this legislation to \nmodernize our Nation's aviation system and I am especially pleased that \nit includes Senate Amendment No. 3534 to protect the pristine beauty \nand quiet of Crater Lake National Park.\n  This amendment offered by Senator Merkley and I would bring an end to \nthe bureaucratic stalemate that exists between the Federal Aviation \nAdministration and the National Park Service over implementation of the \nNational Parks Air Tour Management Act of 2000.\n  That act required the FAA and the Park Service to work together in \nregulating air tours over national parks. Unfortunately, that is not \nhappening. After nearly a decade, these two agencies have yet to \ncomplete a single required air tour management plan for those parks \nwith air tours.\n  Meanwhile, parks where air tours applications are pending are in \nlimbo over whether tours will operate and where. Efforts to provide \nadequate safeguards to protect the parks' resources have stalled, \nleaving places such as Oregon's Crater Lake National Park--the 6th \noldest national park in the Nation--lingering in needless uncertainty. \nIn short, the law is not working as it was intended and providing no \nbenefit to anyone.\n  When an air tour company applied last year for permission to fly \ntours\n\n[[Page S1798]]\n\nover Crater Lake National Park, the public outcry in my state and \nelsewhere was swift and dramatic--and for good reason. Anyone familiar \nwith Crater Lake knows that it is one of the crown jewels of the \nNation's system of national parks. It is a place that my constituents \ncare deeply about. It is visited by countless Oregonians and tourists \nalike every year who come to see its deep-blue lake, dramatic lava \nflows, towering trees and, perhaps most of all, to experience its \nquiet.\n  While we cannot agree on what to do about air tours over every single \nnational park, we can agree that if we are going to ban them anywhere \nit should be Crater Lake. Such a ban will guarantee future generations \nthe same pristine solitude that exists today.\n  Since Crater Lake represents one of the few places to escape the din \nof everyday life, I and many others have serious concerns over what the \nproposed helicopter over flights would do to that tranquility.\n  Yet that concern isn't able to be considered by the FAA and the Park \nService under the requirements found in the current National Park Air \nTour Management Act of 2000. Parks such as Crater Lake must go through \nthe costly and time-consuming process of attempting to craft an air \ntour management plan before being able to deny an application for air \ntours. As no such plans have been completed for any park in 10 years, \nthere is little prospect of getting any certainty any time in the near \nfuture. This is uncertainty for air tour operators and for parks \nvisitors alike. Will there be over flights or won't there? The way \nthings work now, we'll never know and our treasured parks don't get the \ncertain protection they need.\n  My amendment would provide needed clarity regarding the \nresponsibilities of the FAA and the National Park Service so that air \ntour management plans can finally be completed. It will speed \nimplementation of the act by ensuring that air tour management plans \nare not required at Crater Lake, where it is clear that having them \nwould be unacceptable to park resources or visitor experiences.\n  I am pleased that Senator Rockefeller has worked with me to include \nthis amendment in the managers' package. I thank my colleagues Senator \nMerkley who cosponsored this amendment and Senator Alexander who also \nlent his support. This amendment will help ensure that our parks' \nresources are protected.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate will vote on final \npassage of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and Safety \nImprovement Act. This 2-year reauthorization of FAA's programs provides \nimportant funding increases and program improvements that will enhance \nthe safety and efficiency of our Nation's aviation system. In so doing, \nit makes key investments in our Nation's aviation infrastructure and \ncreates jobs with these investments.\n  Our global economy depends on the smooth and efficient movement of \ngoods, services, and people from city to city and across international \nborders. A safe and efficient aviation system goes hand in hand with a \nstrong economy. We are fortunate to have the best aviation system in \nthe world, and we must continue to make the necessary investments and \nupgrades to keep it as such. The FAA reauthorization bill helps us to \ndo this by addressing problems of capacity, congestion, and delays that \nhave emerged to ensure our aviation system can adequately handle the \nprojected growth in airlines passengers.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill will create much needed jobs by \nproviding the funding and directives for safety improvements at our \nairports and in the aviation industry. For instance, the FAA is \nbuilding two new air traffic control towers in Michigan: at Kalamazoo \nand Traverse City. The FAA is also repaving two runways and various \ntaxiways at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. The FAA is also \nconstructing a new terminal building at Kalamazoo/Battle Creek \nInternational Airport, and it is designing a new building for aircraft \nrescue and firefighting and snow removal equipment at Pellston Regional \nAirport in Emmet County. These are much needed upgrades and will make \nflying into and around Michigan safer and easier.\n  A key component of this bill is to modernize our air traffic control \nsystem by building the Next Generation Air Transportation System, \nNextGen, of satellite-based navigation. The NextGen system will be more \naccurate and more efficient than the current radar based air traffic \ncontrol system. It will also result in significant fuel efficiencies \nand time savings by allowing aircraft to fly more direct routes. This \nis good for the environment, good for air carrier's bottom line, and \ngood for the flying public. This bill accelerates the process and moves \nthe NextGen modernization process forward. The bill also provides \nflexibility to airports regarding how Airport Improvement Program funds \ncan be utilized as well as studying ways to raise revenue for airport \nprojects through a pilot program.\n  I will vote in support of the FAA reauthorization bill, and I urge \nits quick adoption and enactment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I stand to talk about health care on this significant \nday, the day after the House passed the ObamaCare bill and the day \nbefore the reconciliation bill comes here to the Senate.\n  Needless to say, I am deeply disappointed by the House's action for \nall of the reasons I and so many others have raised, the concerns we \nhave raised previously on the Senate floor.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, could I ask the Senator to yield for a \nparliamentary inquiry?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, I will yield.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I wanted to ask my colleague from Virginia, because \nhe has been on the floor, I think seeking recognition, and I wanted to \nmake sure that we ask him--that we protect his place following Senator \nVitter--how much time does the Senator from Virginia want to use?\n  Mr. WEBB. I thank the Senator for inquiring. I wish to speak for up \nto 10 minutes about the Ensign amendment.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask unanimous consent that following the remarks by \nthe Senator from Louisiana, the Senator from Virginia be recognized for \nup to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, it was my understanding that the Ensign \namendment was going to be called up at 4:30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WEBB. Would that not be the proper topic of discussion on the \nfloor? I have been waiting since 4:15 when I was slated to speak.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would be happy to call up the Ensign \namendment, after which Senator Vitter had had the floor, and did give \nme the right to protect you. So, if possible, I wish to call up the \namendment, ask that Senator Vitter be allowed to speak up to 10 \nminutes, and then, following that, I wish to protect the Senator from \nVirginia's time.\n  Mr. WEBB. May I ask for a courtesy from the Senator from Texas and \nthe Senator from Louisiana? I have a commitment I cannot break back in \nmy office that was supposed to begin at this moment. Would you feel it \nappropriate if I were to ask that my statement be printed in the Record \nat this point with respect to the Ensign amendment, once you called it \nup?\n  Mr. VITTER. I have no objection.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Let me ask the Senator from Louisiana, would he be \nable to allow the Senator from Virginia to go forward?\n  Mr. VITTER. I am afraid I cannot for exactly the same reason. I am \nlate for a meeting in my office. But I certainly would have no \nobjection to placing his comments in the Record and regaining the floor \nat a future time.\n  Mr. WEBB. I appreciate that courtesy. If there is opportunity for me \nto come back later, I will try.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, if the Senator does come back, I will \ndo everything I can to give him a chance to speak, because I know this \nis very important to his State, and I wish for him to have his views \nknown.\n  Senator Ensign is on his way, and I will do everything possible to \ngive him some time.\n  Mr. WEBB. I also wish to thank the Senator from Louisiana for \nyielding for this exchange.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3476, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n\n[[Page S1799]]\n\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mrs. Hutchison], for Mr. Ensign, \n     proposes amendment numbered 3476, as modified, to amendment \n     No. 3452.\n\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 279, after line 24, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 723. PRESERVATION AND EXPANSION OF ACCESS TO THE \n                   NATIONAL CAPITAL FOR SMALL COMMUNITIES.\n\n       Section 41718 is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(g) Slot Usage.--Notwithstanding section 49109 or any \n     other provision of law, any air carrier that holds or \n     operates air carrier slots at Ronald Reagan Washington \n     National Airport (DCA) as of January 1, 2010, pursuant to \n     subparts K and S of part 93 of title 14, Code of Federal \n     Regulations, which are being used as of that date for \n     scheduled service between DCA and a large hub airport may use \n     such slots for up to 15 round trip flights between DCA and \n     any airport located outside of the perimeter restriction \n     described in section 49109.''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, again like so many Americans, I was deeply \ndisappointed by last night's House vote. At its core, that health care \nreform legislation will put the government between us and our doctors. \nIt will raise health care costs significantly. That is not me saying \nthat, that is nonpartisan sources such as the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  It will try to be ``paid for'' through a $\\1/2\\ trillion raid on \nMedicare, another $\\1/2\\ trillion set of tax increases. And, of course, \nthat is the cause of pushing up health care costs. Then, to add insult \nto injury for so many Americans, including so many Louisianans, it will \nprovide taxpayer funding of abortion.\n  It was truly a sad day for our country, in my opinion. But I take the \nfloor today not so much to focus on that but to focus on the continuing \nfight and to focus on the future. My message is very simple. Speaking \nfor one Senator, for myself, this fight is not over by a long shot. I \nwill be on the floor regularly all this week fighting the separate \nreconciliation bill. Certainly, if any House Democrats thought all \naspects of that bill would pass into law, to ``fix'' certain portions \nof the underlying Senate ObamaCare bill, I think this week they will be \nsadly disappointed.\n  There are many aspects of that bill that are subject to serious \nchallenges that will require 60 votes, and will not get them here on \nthe Senate floor. We will have a number of important debates and \namendments.\n  I will also continue the fight to try to repeal this very \ncounterproductive legislation. Today at 2 o'clock, as soon, as \nabsolutely soon, as it was in order, I filed a bill to repeal \nObamaCare, to repeal what has passed already through the process. I am \njoined with so many other Members, so many other Americans across the \ncountry to fight to that end, however long it takes. It may not be this \nCongress, but I believe that day will come, because the great majority \nof Americans, certainly including the great majority of Louisianans, \nwant that to happen. They want us to act instead in a focused, positive \nway, attacking real problems with real solutions, not a 3,000-plus-page \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If neither side yields time, the time will be \nequally charged to both sides.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, \nand I ask unanimous consent the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Stewart L. Udall\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when we reflect on the great families in \nAmerican politics--we have had our fair share--we certainly think of \nJohn Adams and John Quincy Adams and what they gave to America. In our \ntime one thinks of the Kennedy family and how much those brothers gave \nto this Nation. Some of us were honored to serve with Ted Kennedy and \nthe sons and daughters of those great Senators of the past. But there \nis another family from the West who has given so much to us. That would \nbe the Udall family.\n  I was blessed to serve in the House of Representatives with Morris \nUdall. He was a joy, not only a great man of principle but a great \nsense of humor. It was fun to be around Mo Udall. He had an ill-fated \nrun for the Presidency which probably generated more one-liners than \nany race in American political history. But he was one of two brothers, \nStewart Udall being his brother before him who had served as well in \nthe House of Representatives from the State of Arizona and backed a man \nfor President named John Kennedy in 1960. Because of his early support \nof John Kennedy, when President Kennedy was elected, he called on \nStewart Udall to serve as his Secretary of the Interior.\n  Last Saturday, Stewart Udall passed away. I came to the floor this \nafternoon to say a few words about this great man and the great \ncontributions he made to America. He was one of the first real \nactivists as Secretary of the Interior. I want to read, if I may, some \nof the things he managed to achieve in the time he served as Secretary \nof the Interior under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson: the acquisition \nof 3.85 million acres of new holdings, four national parks--Canyonlands \nin Utah, Redwood in California, North Cascades in Washington State, \nGuadalupe Mountains in Texas--six national monuments, nine national \nrecreation areas, 20 historic sites, 50 wildlife refuges, and eight \nnational seashores. He had an interest in preserving historic sites and \nhelped to save Carnegie Hall from destruction. What an amazing legacy \nStewart Udall left as the leader of America's efforts toward \nconservation.\n  He was an extraordinary man too, a real Renaissance man in his \ninterests. He held evening meetings at the Interior Department and \ninvited the likes of Carl Sandburg and the actor Hal Holbrook, as well \nas Wallace Stegner, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author, who he invited \nto become the Department's writer in residence.\n  It was Stewart Udall who suggested that John Kennedy invite Robert \nFrost to recite a poem at Mr. Kennedy's inauguration, which is one of \nthe most celebrated moments in history in the last century when Robert \nFrost stood before that frozen crowd on Inauguration Day for John \nKennedy.\n  I think back too of his work when it came to the environment. In the \nearly days Rachel Carson was the inspiration for many. Her book ``The \nSilent Spring'' inspired Stewart Udall to look beyond conservation to \nprotecting the world we live in.\n  He did so many things that were ahead of their time. Under the \nKennedy administration, he began efforts to establish the Nation's \nfirst national seashores, and it wasn't welcomed by a lot of the people \naffected. People living in Cape Cod, MA, Cape Hatteras in North \nCarolina, and Point Reyes in California objected to taking coastal \nlands out of private hands, saying it would ruin the local economy. \nExactly the opposite occurred. When these became protected areas, they \ndrew more tourism and more economic development than anyone had ever \nbefore realized.\n  Stewart Lee Udall was born on January 31, 1920, in St. Johns, AZ, a \nsmall community in Apache country. His family had strong ties to the \nMormon Church. They used to say that you could find Udalls all over the \npolitical history of the West. His brother Morris, of course, \nrepresented the State of Arizona for so many years. I remember one \nstory I read recently in Sports Illustrated. I mentioned it to Tom \nUdall, his son, who now represents the State of New Mexico. It is a \nstory that isn't well known, and it goes back to the early 1960s, when \nStewart Udall, as Secretary of the Interior, decided to challenge the \nWashington Redskins football team. It turned out in the early 1960s it \nwas an all-white team, and the man who owned the team, Mr. Marshall, \ntook great pride in the fact there were no black players on the \nWashington Redskins football team. Stewart Udall contacted the \nPresident and said: Mr. President, it turns out the Federal Government \nhas the lease on the stadium that Mr. Marshall is using for his \nfootball games, and we want to make it clear to him that he better \nintegrate that team.\n  Well, Mr. Marshall wouldn't hear anything about that. He was going to\n\n[[Page S1800]]\n\nfight him all the way. There were pickets and protests and \ndemonstrations and harsh words back and forth. But in the end, Stewart \nUdall and President Kennedy prevailed. The Washington Redskins were \nintegrated. In fact, some of their first Black players ended up in the \nHall of Fame. Interior Secretary Udall did the Washington Redskins and \ntheir fans quite a favor. That was in the early 1960s. Those who know \nthe fight song for the Washington Redskins may be surprised to learn \nthat the refrain that talks about ``fight for old DC'' before this \nbattle used to say ``fight for old Dixie.'' Things have changed in the \ncapital city, and Stewart Udall was part of that change.\n  In his life too he was a man who relished physical challenges, as his \nson still does, my colleague Senator Tom Udall and his cousin Mark \nUdall of Colorado. He was an all-conference guard on the University of \nArizona basketball team, climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and Mount Fuji, \nheaded up American delegations to many regions. At the age of 84, \nStewart Udall, at the end of his last rafting trip on the Colorado \nRiver, hiked up the steep Bright Angel trail from the bottom of the \nGrand Canyon to the south rim, a 10-hour walk at age 84. And it says in \nthe New York Times:\n\n       . . . he celebrated at the end with a martini.\n\n  What an amazing man, an amazing life, a great contribution to \nAmerica. His passing is a reminder of some of the greats who have \nserved in so many different ways and have left a mark, an indelible \nlegacy, and a heritage.\n  Stewart L. Udall was one of those men, and among his legacy items \nwould include not only a great family but a great colleague in the \nSenate, his son, Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico. We should honor his \nservice, note his passing, and remember his inspiration. His leadership \nmade America a better place. His legacy in conservation will serve \ngenerations to come. We need more like Stewart Udall.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I want to thank Senate leadership for \nbringing this bill to the floor. Our Nation's air traffic control \nsystems are in serious need of modernization, and this bill is the \nright step forward in addressing those challenges. Improved safety, a \nreduction in flight delays and more efficient routes resulting in less \nfuel burned are all possible with a modern, 21st century air traffic \ncontrol system. I commend Chairman Rockefeller, Ranking Member \nHutchison and the Senate Commerce Committee for their commitment in \naddressing these issues.\n  I want to take a few moments today to talk about an issue that is \nimportant to me, the communities near Washington Reagan National \nAirport and those communities throughout America who currently have \nreliable service to the Nation's Capital. I am deeply concerned with \nany attempts to modify the current agreement on the perimeter and slot \nrules that currently apply to Reagan National Airport.\n  In 1987, Congress created the Metropolitan Washington Airports \nAuthority to run Reagan National and Washington Dulles International \nAirports. The creation of the Airports Authority established a \nprofessional organization to operate the airports efficiently and \nrepresented a commitment to the surrounding communities regarding \naircraft noise and traffic. I think that bears repeating. Congress made \na commitment to the residents of Alexandria, Arlington and Fairfax \nCounty on the operation of Reagan National Airport when it transferred \nauthority to the Airports Authority. Those commitments were codified by \nCongress in the so-called perimeter and slot rules. Changes to these \nrules threaten to seriously degrade service to Reagan National, Dulles \nInternational, and Baltimore-Washington International airports. And \nthey break the commitment made to our surrounding communities.\n  The amendment that the Senator from Nevada has offered seeks \nessentially to do away with the existing 1,250 mile perimeter rule that \ngoverns flights into and out of Reagan National Airport. The Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. Kyl, has argued that this will have a limited impact \non existing flights at DCA. On the contrary, if this amendment passes, \nup to 75 existing flights that currently fly from DCA to other large \ncities within the perimeter could be lost. Shifting these flights would \nnot only have a direct impact on the cities that stand to lose the \nroutes they currently have, but it would also have follow-on effects to \nflights in smaller markets, as well as flights that now service Dulles \nand BWI.\n  Furthermore, the flights that would be added at Reagan National would \nbe long-haul flights, which means bigger planes and more passengers. \nThat in turn means more congestion around and inside the airport: worse \ntraffic, longer lines at security, more difficulty parking large planes \nat already crowded gates.\n  There are basic physical constraints at Reagan National Airport that \ncannot be ignored, and the original slots and perimeter rules were \ncarefully crafted to take that into consideration. If you have ever \ntried to fly out of Reagan National Airport during peak hours, you know \nthat parking can be impossible, ticket counters can be incredibly \ncongested and the number of gates for jets to park is limited.\n  More than 10 years ago, the Airports Authority rebuilt much of Reagan \nNational Airport, transforming it into one of the most efficient \nairports in the Nation as the facilities constructed were matched to \nthe number of flights established by law. It did so with the slot and \nperimeter restrictions in mind. Any significant change in those rules \nwill overburden critical airport facilities and infrastructure, causing \nserious disruptions. New flights will create more demand for parking \nwhere none is available. At the same time, gate access at Reagan \nNational Airport is limited, as airlines are currently sharing gates in \nsome areas. Flights coming and going would be delayed, an important \nissue we happen to be addressing in this bill. We have laid out \npolicies to reduce the inconvenience of delays and sitting in grounded \naircraft because of air traffic congestion in this very bill.\n  These are significant issues that the Senate must consider before \nmaking any changes to the perimeter rule. When members consider this \nissue in the context of additional flights for them to get back to \ntheir constituents, keep in mind there is a significant risk of greater \ndelays and, for many Senators here, a possible reduction in services to \ntheir communities. With a change in the current structure at Reagan \nNational Airport, there will be potential impact for communities inside \nthe perimeter who could see their access reduced or eliminated. Flights \nto cities like Miami, FL; Chicago, IL; New York City; and Boston, MA \ncould lose many of the flights they now have. Communities like \nCharleston, WV; Des Moines, IA; Jackson, MI; Lexington, KY; Madison, \nWI; Manchester, NH; or Omaha, NE; could eventually lose their access as \nwell, as airlines backfill their flights to more profitable routes.\n  It strikes me that the desire to change the slot and perimeter rules \nat Reagan National Airport is not being driven by market demand, but \nrather by a few airlines seeking a competitive advantage over others. \nAllowing airlines to swap flights from hub airports inside the \nperimeter to hub airports outside of the perimeter could be seen as a \nspecial interest earmark for a select group of carriers, as the pool of \nbeneficiaries is identifiable and limited. By allowing existing rules \nto be altered for a select class, Congress will be allocating this \nscarce resource for the convenience of a few rather than the larger \ncommunity need. This is fundamentally anticompetitive behavior and we \nneed to end this periodic and detrimental practice.\n  Congress added 24 new slots in 2000 and another 22 slots in 2003. If \nwe get rid of the perimeter rule, or modify it in such a way that \ncauses loss of service or diminished service to communities inside the \nperimeter, the affected communities will be back before Congress \nseeking more slots to make up for lost service. The communities of \nNorthern Virginia should not have to continually suffer for the \nconvenience of a relative few. We have seen examples of service in \nother congested airspaces where reasonable slots restrictions have \ncontrolled or reduced growing delays in flight times.\n  The convenience of Reagan National comes at a heavy price for many \nairport neighbors in the form of aircraft noise and airport related \ntraffic in Arlington, Alexandria and southern Fairfax County. Changing \ncurrent law only\n\n[[Page S1801]]\n\nfurther breaks the bond that was created with the neighbors of the \nairports and unfairly burdens them for the sake of the convenience of \nothers. With some foresight in this body, we can avoid any greater \ncongestion whether in the air, on the tarmac or on our roads. The \nposition that the Senators from Maryland, Mr. Warner, and I hold is \nconsistent with local communities groups of Northern Virginia and that \nof many previous Governors of the Commonwealth.\n  With regard to the perimeter rule, its value is evident in the \ndevelopment taking place at Dulles Airport today. Because Dulles is \nbetter situated to handle the demands of long-haul flying, Congress \nwisely established the perimeter rule to move long-haul traffic to \nDulles where the space exists to handle the necessary parking and \ninfrastructure expansion. The multibillion-dollar Dulles Development \nprogram, and the investments in rail service to Dulles, are all \npredicated upon Congress keeping its word on the perimeter rule. \nEliminating or changing the perimeter rule will not only overburden \ncapacity at Reagan National Airport by overwhelming the facilities but \nwould significantly change the infrastructure improvements needed at \nDulles International Airport, many of which are already under \nconstruction. Sizable business interests have located their operations \nin Fairfax and Loudoun Counties based on their proximity to Dulles and \non assumptions about the stability of the slot and perimeter rules.\n  Service will suffer, infrastructure will be strained and the \ncommunities surrounding the airport will face more noise and more \ntraffic. That is the last thing we need for Northern Virginia, or the \nNation's Capital.\n  I have laid out only the most significant arguments against changes \nto the slot and perimeter rules. But here is one more: it is not \nappropriate for Congress to meddle and manipulate the airports in my \nhome State. Congress no longer maintains this kind of silent hand in \nthe operations at any airports in my colleagues' home states. Let us \nlet the Airports Authority run Washington's airports as Congress agreed \nto. I urge my colleagues to vote against the Ensign amendment and \nreject changes to the perimeter rules at Reagan National Airport.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a March 17, \n2010, letter to me from the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                           Metropolitan Washington\n\n\n                                           Airports Authority,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2010.\n     Hon. James H. Webb,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Webb: The Metropolitan Washington Airports \n     Authority (Airports Authority) is aware of several proposed \n     amendments to H.R. 1586, the legislative vehicle for the \n     Federal Aviation Administration Air Transportation \n     Modernization and Safety Improvement Act, which address \n     flight rules at Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport \n     (Reagan National). The Airports Authority would like to \n     reiterate our commitment to maintaining the current High \n     Density Rule (or ``Slot'' Rule) and ``Perimeter Rule'', which \n     direct the allocation of a very scarce resource--take offs \n     and landings--at Reagan National.\n       Congress initially mandated the Slot and Perimeter rules in \n     1987, balancing the physical limitations of Reagan National \n     with the growth potential of Washington Dulles International \n     Airport (Dulles International) and Baltimore/Washington \n     Thurgood Marshall International Airport (Baltimore/\n     Washington). Over the years, Congress has made modest changes \n     to these rules, and Reagan National has been able to operate \n     with a high degree of arrival and departure reliability. Over \n     the past two decades, tremendous capital investments have \n     been made at Dulles International, as annual air traffic has \n     grown substantially.\n       Reagan National's facilities were rebuilt in the 1990s, at \n     a cost of $1 billion, to match the capacity established by \n     Congress in the Slot and Perimeter rules. Drastic changes to \n     the Slot and Perimeter rules that are currently under \n     discussion will add significant flight activity with the \n     potential to result in surface traffic congestion, passenger \n     delays, and security screening back-ups. Further, increases \n     in flights and passenger volumes could stress the air traffic \n     control system during poor weather, ground facilities, \n     baggage, gate and other terminal services. The Airports \n     Authority is also concerned about the possible, or perceived, \n     noise-related impact on the region resulting from additional \n     flights at Reagan National.\n       The Airports Authority urges the Congress to reject the \n     temptation to add flights to Reagan National without regard \n     to the ability of Reagan National to absorb this increase, or \n     to the impact on the neighboring community, and Dulles \n     International and Baltimore/Washington Airports.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 James E. Bennett,\n                            President and Chief Executive Officer.\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as we conclude this debate on this \nreauthorization of the Federal Aviation Administration, I wish to thank \nmy colleagues for their hard work, and I wish to do so with some \nspecificity.\n  First, I thank Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, the ranking member of \nthe Commerce Committee. Senator Hutchison and I, in a sense, kind of \ngrew up together on the Commerce Committee. We have worked together, in \nmy judgment, entirely successfully on aviation issues. For much of the \nlast decade, Senator Hutchison and I have served as either chair or \nranking member of the Aviation Subcommittee. In 2009, I assumed the \nchairmanship of the Commerce Committee, and she assumed the ranking \nmember position on the committee.\n  But, more importantly, we have a long history of producing strong, \nbipartisan aviation legislation and working well, generally, starting \nwith the landmark AIR 21 bill in 2000--which greatly increased funding \nfor our aviation system--through the chaotic days after September 11, \n9/11--which culminated in the Aviation and Transportation Security \nAct--to this important reauthorization we are considering today.\n  I am profoundly proud of our work together over the years. I respect \nher professionally. I respect her personally. I think our work is a \nlegacy we both can be very proud of. I know I am. She is an \nextraordinary Senator who is deeply committed to making sure the United \nStates has the finest aviation system in the world. She has many other \ninterests, but that is one of them. Our Nation's aviation system is \ndemonstrably safer and more secure because of her efforts.\n  I also thank my good friend, Senator Byron Dorgan. In 2009, Senator \nDorgan became the chair of the Aviation Subcommittee--just a year ago--\nbut he has attacked it with such ferocity and intensity, typical of \nhim, that it seems like much longer than that. He has been a \nmagnificent chairman of that subcommittee. His laserlike focus on \nmaking our aviation system safer has become a cornerstone of this bill. \nHe held, for example, eight hearings on aviation safety over the last \n15 months. Eight hearings in 15 months does not seem like a lot, but \ngiven our schedule around here, it is. He was totally focused, such as \non what happened in Buffalo and all other aspects.\n  As with every issue in which he is engaged--and there are many of \nthem--he has made a lasting contribution. I personally regret he has \nchosen to retire at the end of this year. Not only will I miss him as a \nfriend, but the people of North Dakota and this country will lose one \nof their most passionate and effective advocates. He should be \nenormously proud of his work on this bill. I know I am.\n  I also recognize the work of Senator DeMint, who has championed a \nnumber of important safety provisions and has been a strong advocate of \nmoving this bill forward. It is important to say, very important to \nsay.\n  Senator Baucus worked hard to develop a revenue title for this bill. \nThrough his efforts, the aviation system will have resources it needs \nto build the modern digital air traffic control system our Nation \ndemands. We will be spending about $500 billion a year.\n  As with every bill that moves through this body, much, much, much of \nthe work is done by our staff who put in extraordinary hours.\n  First and foremost, I would like to recognize, among other people, \nGael Sullivan of my staff. Gael has served as a professional staff \nmember for the Aviation Subcommittee for almost a decade. For 3 years, \nGael has worked tirelessly on this bill. It would not be a reality \nwithout his efforts.\n  I would also like to recognize Rich Swayze and Adam Duffy of my \nstaff, in addition to Jim Conneely, a detailee from the FAA, as it \nturns out, to the Commerce Committee. He has been of invaluable \nassistance.\n  I would like to thank Jarrod Thompson and Ann Begeman of Senator \nHutchison's staff. They are true and total professionals, without whose \nwork the bill would not be possible.\n\n[[Page S1802]]\n\n  I would also like to thank Margaret McCarthy of Senator Dorgan's \nstaff, who worked seamlessly with the committee staff.\n  As always, Senator Baucus's staff was critical to getting the revenue \ntitle in place.\n  Finally, I would be kind of remiss if I did not mention the hard and \nconstant work of Ellen Doneski, the staff director of the Commerce \nCommittee, who was my legislative director in a former life; Mr. James \nReid, who sits beside me, my deputy staff director; and the Commerce \nCommittee press team, Jamie Smith and Jena Longo.\n  The staff never gets enough credit. We talk about it. We say it. I \nthink they know we mean it. I wonder if they can guess how much we do \nmean it--the hours they put in; their selflessness; their willingness \nto work together; their willingness to work across party lines, where \nsometimes their Members cannot as easily. So I am fortunate to have so \nmany talented people working with me and with Senator Hutchison.\n  But most of all, I thank Senator Hutchison.\n  Mr. President, I want to say just a few words about two very \nimportant programs at the Federal Aviation Administration, FAA--the \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise and the Airport Concessions \nDisadvantaged Business Enterprise Airport Improvement Programs.\n  These programs have been critically important in helping to level the \nplaying field for minority and women owned businesses in the airport \nindustry and continue to be instrumental in addressing ongoing \ndiscrimination. While it is true that our nation has made tremendous \nprogress against discrimination in the past five decades, there \ncontinues to be a good deal more work to do.\n  Discrimination in the lending, bonding, and bid process, as well as \ndisparities in the treatment of DBE subcontractors once a contract is \nawarded are real life problems faced by these businesses. For this \nreason, I strongly support the provisions in this bill to improve the \nDBE program, including provisions to adjust the personal net worth cap \nfor inflation and to require certification training for those who \nreview DBE applications.\n  We must not forget the true impact of DBE firms on the economy. \nMinority and women owned businesses not only improve the vitality of \nthe airport industry, but they are important economic contributors to \ntheir communities.\n  The statistical and qualitative evidence of discrimination is clear \nand has been compiled in disparity studies that are conducted by state \nand local governments around the country. These studies are well \nconstructed third party examinations that shed light on whether \nqualified DBE firms in the area are being utilized, examine the \ncontracting and business activities of the state or local government, \nreview the corresponding private markets in the same geographic area, \nand analyze anecdotal reports about discrimination from actual \nstakeholders.\n  These studies, many examples of which were received during the \nCommerce Committee's May 2009 hearing, and during a hearing in the \nHouse of Representatives in March 2009, demonstrate that progress has \nbeen made and that our efforts here in Congress are still necessary.\n  For example, studies have showed that airports operated by Denver, \nCO, Phoenix, AZ, and the State of Maryland all have made progress, but \nthat significant hurdles remain. These studies demonstrate that \ndiscrimination continues to exist in both the public contracting \nprocess and in the private sector, such as in access to credit markets.\n  The inclusion of the DBE provisions in the bill will provide an \nimportant on-the-ground benefit to businesses by helping to level the \nplaying field and enabling fairer competition. I am pleased that \nCongress has recognized the continued need for these programs and these \nnew provisions as integral to the reauthorization of the FAA.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, let me say how much I appreciate the \nremarks of the chairman. It has been truly delightful working with the \nchairman on this bill. He and I used to be the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Aviation Subcommittee. Now we are the chairman and \nranking member of the full committee. So I think our views on \naviation--its importance, the importance of the NextGen air traffic \ncontrol system, the importance of safety, the Passenger Bill of \nRights--are one and the same, and I appreciate working with him.\n  I do have some closing remarks, but I wish to let Senator Ensign talk \nabout his amendment. It is the pending business. So I think I am going \nto put my remarks to the side for now and let Senator Ensign speak on \nhis amendment. I do have comments, following his comments, on his \nperimeter amendment. Then, if we have time, I would like to make my \nclosing statement. But if not, in order for us to stay on time, I will \nstay and do it after the vote.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Utah--I am sorry, the Senator \nfrom Nevada.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, tourism is the backbone of the economy of \nmy State of Nevada. It has taken a nosedive over the last year with the \ncrash of the Nation's economy. More than ever, the industry has needed \na lifeline that was recently given to my State when the legislation I \nauthored with Senator Dorgan, the Travel Promotion Act, was signed into \nlaw by the President. Our legislation will revitalize the tourism \nindustry across our country and in my State of Nevada by reintroducing \nour rural class destinations to people all over the world.\n  On the piece of legislation before us, I have offered two important \namendments to the FAA bill that will also help tourism in my State and \nwill create jobs in this important industry.\n  Last week, Senator Reid and I sponsored an amendment that will \nencourage more construction on land around McCarran International \nAirport in Las Vegas, which will ultimately create more jobs for the \narea. Our legislation lifts an outdated deed restriction for land \nsurrounding McCarran International Airport which previously prevented \ndevelopment on this land because of an agreement with the Bureau of \nLand Management that enforced noise mitigation for airlines flying \noverhead.\n  However, because of technology, aircrafts are not as noisy as they \nwere 10 years ago, when this restriction was put in place. While our \namendment does not alter the noise threshold in the area, it does \nbroaden the types of buildings that can be constructed on the land \nbecause airline noise no longer threatens to violate the threshold.\n  Clark County can now sell the lands to be used for hotels, arenas, \nauditoriums, and concert halls. Not only are we making this land more \nattractive and more valuable, we are creating jobs by increasing \nconstruction in the area and increasing the use of the land. I was \nhappy this amendment was accepted by both the majority and the \nminority.\n  The second amendment Senator McCain has been working on for a long \ntime, as well as myself, Senator Reid, and others was unfortunately \npulled, but it deals with the issue of flights--helicopter flights, \nespecially, and fixed-wing flights--over the Grand Canyon, which is \nsomething I have been working on since I was in the House of \nRepresentatives. I thought we were close to getting this amendment \nfinalized because it is very important not only for tourism, but it is \nalso important for those who cannot necessarily hike the Grand Canyon, \nwho cannot experience the wonderful aspects of it--those in \nwheelchairs, the elderly--and this amendment would have made sure they \nwould have continued to have access.\n  I hope we can work on that and get that amendment either in \nconference or in some other way. It is not only good for the economy, \nbut it is also good for those who are disabled or those who for other \nreasons cannot go and enjoy the Grand Canyon such as hikers and others \ncan.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3476, as Modified\n\n  The last piece I wish to talk about is the amendment we have before \nus today. It is called the DC perimeter amendment. Once again, this is \nsomething I have been working on for many years. The initial rule was \nput into place in 1966, to put a limit on how far flights could fly out \nof Reagan, then\n\n[[Page S1803]]\n\nknown as Washington National Airport. It was to divert air traffic over \nto the new Dulles Airport, basically making National a short-haul and \nDulles a long-haul airport.\n  To carry out this purpose, there was a restriction of 1,250 miles put \nfrom National Airport. While Congress has granted certain limited \nexceptions to the perimeter rule over the years, the rule continues to \nplace arbitrary limits that restrict air traffic between the airport \nand the Western United States. Today, there are only a dozen nonstop \nflights between Reagan National and the entire Western United States. I \nencourage my colleagues to work on this amendment in conference. In a \nlittle while, we are probably going to be withdrawing the amendment, \nbut we want to work on it in conference so that more areas, more places \nin the United States will have direct access to Reagan National \nAirport, which is much more convenient to use than Washington Dulles or \nthe Baltimore airport.\n\n  I will say this: It really is a matter of fairness. Should only the \neast coast or the Midwest have access to Reagan National or should the \nrest of the country have the convenience of flying into Reagan \nNational?\n  My amendment actually would not have increased the number of landing \nslots available. My amendment would have allowed airlines to take the \nslots. They fly from certain airports, the large hub airports, and \ntransfer those to other slots that work better for their business plan \nas well as gives other people in America the right to fly into Reagan \nNational Airport, which is, as I mentioned, so much more convenient.\n  So after 40 years of implementation of the perimeter rule, it is \noutdated. The last time I checked--and I fly Dulles all the time--\nDulles is thriving. As a matter of fact, it is packed. I circled for \nover an hour today because of the number of flights coming into Dulles. \nIt is an extremely busy airport. I don't think we have to make sure \nDulles stays busy any longer. It has more than it can actually handle. \nBut it is time to scale back the perimeter restrictions at Reagan \nNational.\n  So I really hope in conference we can get together and work on \nreasonable changes to the DC perimeter rule that will give other \nAmericans, other than those living within the perimeter rule today, \naccess to the closest airport to our Nation's Capital.\n  With that, I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nwillingness to work with us on this amendment as well as generally. \nThis is important legislation they have worked on. We have a lot of \noutdated technology in our current FAA system, and this is a very \nimportant piece of legislation. I applaud the efforts they have made in \nbringing the legislation to this point.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, expanding air service to metropolitan \nairports is always a very contentious issue. I believe it is important \nthat we give due consideration to local interests when considering the \naddition of slots, particularly at National Airport. Senators Warner \nand Webb have significant reservations about moving forward on any \nchanges to existing policy at this time, and I have worked to address \nthese concerns.\n  I believe the agreement reached between Senators Dorgan, Warner, \nHutchison, Kyl, Ensign, and DeMint is a reasonable way forward. It will \nallow us to balance the desire for additional slots against the \nopposition from local residents.\n  Pursuing a more abrupt policy change such as eliminating the \nperimeter rule altogether has significant implications for competition, \nsmall community air service, congestion, and delay. Going forward, we \nneed to make sure there are not unintended consequences from such \nchanges and that service to small communities is preserved. Obviously, \nservice to small communities is very important to me.\n  I also wish to make clear that the Federal Government's role in this \nprocess is specific. Air carriers sometimes treat airport slots as \nthough they are their own property. It is not. It is their privilege. \nThe air transportation system is operated for the benefit of the public \ninterest, not for the private interests. Too often, the air carriers \nabuse the rights they have been granted. They schedule too many flights \nat congested airports, and the result is gridlock. This is part of the \nreason there is a cap on slots at National.\n  The air transportation network requires that capacity be managed \ncarefully so the entire system functions rationally. It is the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to make sure it operates well, \nand I take this role very seriously. If the air carriers cannot manage \ntheir slots in an effective manner, the Federal Government will have to \nstep in and do it for them.\n  Crafting a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the FAA has been my long \nand difficult journey, together with the ranking member, Senator \nHutchison. I recognize that many of my colleagues have a strong \ninterest in expanding service at National. I appreciate the work they \nhave done. But I do believe that what has been discussed here and will \nbe discussed later in conference is a balanced approach. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues in a conference with the House that will \nachieve an appropriate agreement that is acceptable to everybody.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleagues for \ntheir work on the Reagan National perimeter rule issue.\n  Last week, I sat down with several interested colleagues in an effort \nto try to find a path forward on this issue, and the result is the \nmodified Ensign amendment before us. I wish to say a few words about \nthe intent of the amendment.\n  I sympathize with the concerns of my friend from Virginia, Senator \nWarner, who is also a member of the Senate Commerce Committee, and our \ncolleague, Senator Webb. While in a somewhat different position in the \npast, I have had similar issues raised concerning my home State of \nTexas with Love Field and DFW Airport, and I recognize the impact of \ndealing with the decision to change the status quo. It is difficult.\n  I also recognize the views of western State Senators concerned about \nthe few opportunities for their constituents to have direct access to \nReagan National Airport. There are now only 12 flights a day. That \nreally should be expanded, but it needs to be expanded in a way that \ndoes not have the harmful effects on National and the Virginia \nresidents who live in and around the airport.\n  With that in mind, I think we have come up with a compromise proposal \nthat meets the concerns of the western State colleagues and others, as \nwell as addressing the concerns of the Virginia Senators. The modified \nEnsign amendment is a simple solution that allows air carriers with \nexisting inside-the-perimeter large hub airport slots into Reagan \nNational the ability to convert those slots to any community outside \nthe perimeter, with each air carrier being kept at 15 roundtrip \noperations eligible for conversion. By utilizing the conversions, we \ndon't add any new flights at all to the airport, but we do give the air \ncarriers the opportunity to better utilize their networks. I am hopeful \nwe can take that concept and message to the House in the next round of \nthe legislative process on this bill.\n  I thank Senators Ensign and Kyl, Senators DeMint, Boxer, McCain, \nRockefeller, Dorgan, and Warner for their work on this very important \nissue. I remain hopeful that the final version of this FAA \nreauthorization bill will include a consensus agreement on this issue \nthat allows the opportunity for direct service to our Nation's Capital \nfor a number of our communities that are eager for that service. It is \ntime for some expansion, but I think we can do it in a way that will \nnot impact the quality of life in and around Washington National \nAirport.\n  I also wish to take a moment to commend my colleagues who have worked \nso hard on this bill. We are coming to the point when we will pass this \nbill out of the Senate. We have been able to accommodate the amendments \nthat have been offered, both relevant to the bill as well as those that \nare outside the purview of the bill. It has been an open process. It \nhas been a whole week, but we have been able to make slow progress and \naccommodate the amendments that have been offered, and I think we are \nat a very good place now with everyone's cooperation.\n\n[[Page S1804]]\n\n  I mentioned that it has really been a very good experience working \nthis bill because we have been able to work out some of the problems \nthat are on both sides of the aisle, and I think in a constructive way.\n  With the passage of this bill, we will now go to work with the House. \nWe are very different from the House in many respects, but in FAA \nreauthorization we are in many more respects very different from the \nHouse in that they have passed a bill and we are getting ready to pass \na bill that is very different. So we still have a long way to go on \nthis legislation. But I think we can do it. With the same cooperation \nwe have seen in the Senate, I hope we can get a bill agreed to that the \nSenate will approve as well as the House.\n\n  I thank Senator Rockefeller and his staff. They have been very \ndiligent in this process. As I said, we have worked since 2007 to get \nthis bill done. I think we are in a very good position now. Ellen \nDoneski has been great, his chief of staff of the committee; James \nReid, Gael Sullivan, Rich Swayze, Jim Conneely, and Adam Duffey on \nSenator Rockefeller's staff are to be commended.\n  Senator Dorgan, the chairman of the aviation subcommittee, has been \ngreat. I appreciate all he has done on this bill to keep it moving, to \nwork with both Senator Rockefeller and myself and Senator DeMint. I \nappreciate Senator Dorgan's work and his commitment to this. When he \nleaves the Senate at the end of the year, I hope he will have this \nsignificant FAA reauthorization as one of his achievements he can \nclaim. His staffer, Margaret McCarthy, has been also very helpful.\n  Senator DeMint is the ranking member of the aviation subcommittee, \nand he, too, has been very constructive in this effort, moving the bill \nforward along with his staff and Tom Jones, who has really helped move \nthe ball forward on this bill that is right out of their subcommittee.\n  On my staff, Jarrod Thompson has been wonderful. He knows this issue \nbackward and forward and has worked on many of these aviation \nreauthorizations through the years on the Commerce Committee. I look to \nhim for the knowledge he has gained over the years in all facets of \nFAA, including safety, NextGen, and all of the relevant issues that \ncome under this subcommittee and this bill. My chief of staff for the \ncommittee, Ann Begeman, has been solid as a rock, helping to move the \nball forward, going through the different issues and settling many of \nthem. She has been great, as well as Dan Neumann; Patrick Mullane, also \nin my office, who does all of my transportation work; Brian Hendricks, \nthe general counsel of the Commerce Committee on our side, the ranking \ngeneral counsel; and Matt Acock, my legislative director, who also is \ngoing to be leaving in a few weeks. This is something he has worked on \nand he knows about as much as any of us, and he has done a great job as \nwell.\n  Having said all of that, I thank the distinguished chairman and look \nforward to having a vote in just a few minutes, as soon as we dispose \nof the Ensign amendment and move forward to final passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, may I ask the Senator what does the amendment \ndo?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The amendment allows any carrier which currently has \nslots at DCA to convert flights now serving large hub airports inside \nthe perimeter into flights serving any airport outside the perimeter.\n  This would mean that more passengers travelling from the West could \nfly into and out of National, avoiding the inconvenience and additional \nexpense associated with getting into the city from Dulles.\n  Mr. KYL. Does the amendment add any flights to DCA?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The amendment does not reduce the number of flights \nbetween DCA and small cities within the 1,250-mile perimeter; it does \nnot affect the slot regulations at DCA; it does not increase the number \nof allowable flight operations at the airport; and it does not impact \nthe small and medium size airports inside the perimeter.\n  Rather, the amendment is a reasonable pro-competition solution that \ngives tourists and business travelers from around the nation another \noption for visiting the nation's Capital.\n  Mr. KYL. How many flights at DCA are currently exempted from the \nperimeter rule?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. There are only a dozen nonstop flights between Ronald \nReagan National Airport and the entire western United States. To put \nthat number in perspective, that is 12 beyond the perimeter flights at \nDCA out of approximately 400 flights daily. The beyond the perimeter \nflights represent just 3 percent of all daily, domestic operations at \nDCA.\n  Mr. KYL. Does Dulles need to be protected by the perimeter rule?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. No. In 1962, Dulles only served approximately 52,000 \npassengers. Today, however, Dulles is thriving. In 2009, the airport \nserved approximately 23 million passengers. According to the \nMetropolitan Washington Airports Authority, ``Dulles has emerged as one \nof the fastest growing airports in the world and a major East Coast \ngateway for domestic and international travelers as well as cargo \nactivities.''\n  Mr. KYL. Is there any legislative language to support amending the \nDCA perimeter rule?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes, the Wright amendment of 1979 was a Federal law \nrestricting flights at Dallas' Love Field Airport. It originally \nlimited most nonstop flights from Love Field to destinations within \nTexas and neighboring States. In 2006, Congress passed the Wright \nAmendment Reform Act, which issued a full repeal of the Love Field \nperimeter rule with conditions. Lifting the restrictions at Love Field \ngave the traveling public more flight options, cut prices, and made \ntraveling more efficient.\n  Mr. KYL. How does the Ensign amendment affect service to small and \nmedium hub airports inside the perimeter?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. The slot conversion provision ensures that service to \nsmall and medium hub airports within the perimeter would not be \naffected. There is no restriction, however, on converting a flight that \ncurrently serves a large hub airport within the perimeter to a small or \nmedium hub airport beyond the perimeter. So, presumably the Ensign \namendment could expand service to small and medium hub airports beyond \nthe perimeter.\n  Mr. KYL. Does the Ensign amendment increase slot allocations at DCA?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. No. The number of flights currently serving DCA remains \nthe same. Residents around the airport will not hear an increase in \nnoise from takeoffs and landings and will not see larger planes \noperating at DCA. The only change is that a few of the planes would \nhave a different destination.\n  Mr. KYL. Do you intend to withdraw your amendment?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes, because Senator Dorgan and our other colleagues have \nagreed to address the DCA perimeter rule as the FAA reauthorization \nprocess moves forward.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong concerns \nover efforts to expand service at Washington-Reagan National Airport--\nNational. I would first like to remind my colleagues that this Congress \npassed legislation in 1986 to create the Metropolitan Washington \nAirports Authority so that a professional group of aviation experts \nwould manage both National and Dulles airports. The Airports Authority \nhas done its job well: Dulles has blossomed as an international gateway \nto the region and National remains an efficiently run airport.\n  I recognize the value of National Airport and the critical role it \nplays in serving our Nation's Capital. It is a key component of the \ntransportation system in this region and it provides excellent access \nto the rest of the country for my colleagues.\n  At the same time, the citizens of my State are the ones who are most \ndirectly affected by National's operations, and we must take a balanced \napproach in considering any changes at the airport. My constituents are \nthe ones who have to deal with the consequences of any decision--\nadditional aircraft noise, growing traffic congestion, and airport \nemissions that will affect them on a daily basis.\n  I appreciate that some of my colleagues want direct service from \nNational to destinations in their State, but we must be even-handed in \nmoving forward on this issue. We must avoid making wholesale changes \nthat would have an impact on the important economic balance between \nNational, Dulles and BWI. The airport authorities\n\n[[Page S1805]]\n\nthat manage these airports, and the airlines that fly to them, have \nmade long-term investment decisions based on the current rules. \nDramatic changes to the rules would have a negative financial and \neconomic impact on those airports and the communities that depend on \nthem for economic growth.\n  In addition, any new capacity must be allowed through a fair process \nthat does not favor any one airline or class of airlines. The limited \nnew capacity needs to be allocated in an open and transparent process \nthat benefits the most potential passengers, promotes competition and \ndoes not tip the scales for any airline or class of airlines.\n  I believe strongly that the rules currently in place at National \nAirport serve my state and our region well. I also recognize and \nrespect the interests of the sponsors of the Ensign amendment and will \nwork with Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison to try to \naddress them in conference.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Expanding air service to metropolitan airports is \nalways a contentious issue and I believe it is important that we give \ndue consideration to local interests when considering the addition of \nslots at National Airport. Senators Warner and Webb have significant \nreservations about moving forward on any changes to existing policy at \nthis time, and I have worked to address these concerns.\n  I believe the agreement reached between Senators Dorgan, Warner, \nHutchison, Kyl, Ensign and DeMint is a reasonable way forward. It will \nallow us to balance the desire for additional slots against the \nopposition from local residents.\n  Pursuing a more abrupt policy--change such as eliminating the \nperimeter rule altogether--has significant implications for \ncompetition, small community air service, and congestion and delay.\n  Going forward we need to make sure that there are not unintended \nconsequences from such changes, and that service to small communities \nis preserved. Service to small communities is critical to me, and I \ncannot support any proposal that will adversely affect such service.\n  I also want to make the Federal Government's role in this process \nclear. Air carriers treat airport slots like it is their own property--\nit is not--it is a privilege. The air transportation system is operated \nfor the benefit of the public interest--not the private interest. Too \noften the air carriers abuse the rights they have been granted--they \nschedule too many flights at congested airports and the result is \ngridlock. This is part of the reason why there is a cap on slots at \nNational.\n  The air transportation network requires that capacity be managed \ncarefully so the entire system functions efficiently. It is the \nresponsibility of the Federal Government to make sure it operates well, \nand I take this role seriously. If the air carriers cannot manage their \nslots in an effective manner the Federal Government will have to step \nin and do it for them.\n  Crafting a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the FAA has been a long and \ndifficult journey. I recognize many of my colleagues have a strong \ninterest in expanding service at National. I appreciate the work they \nhave done to reach a compromise on this issue.\n  It is a balanced approach and I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues in conference with the House that will achieve an \nappropriate agreement that is acceptable to everyone.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The issue of slots and the perimeter rule at Reagan \nNational Airport has a long and very complicated history. Many of my \ncolleagues have interests on both sides of this debate. I have been \npleased to work closely with Senator Warner, a member of the Aviation \nSubcommittee that I chair, on this matter, which has the most immediate \nimpact on his constituents in Virginia. I can also sympathize with my \ncolleagues from Western States who would like the opportunity for their \nconstituents to be able to access National Airport.\n  The FAA reauthorization bill that was approved by the Senate Commerce \nCommittee and is before the Senate today does not make any changes at \nNational Airport. However, the House FAA reauthorization bill does \nincrease the number of slots at National Airport. So we know that this \nis an issue that will need to be addressed in conference with the House \nand that the end result will be some change to the status quo.\n  But after spending more than 5 days on this FAA reauthorization bill \nin the Senate, I fear that a protracted debate on this contentious \nissue will derail the good bipartisan bill we are so close to passing. \nA number of my colleagues have filed amendments on slots and the \nperimeter rule. We understand that the Senate position needs to address \naccess for citizens outside the current perimeter.\n  We cannot forget that this bill is about the safety and modernization \nof our nation's aviation system. This legislation takes important \nstrides to bring our air traffic control system into the 21st century \nwith the Next Generation Air Transportation System, NextGen. It \nincludes provisions to ensure one high level of safety across the \nentire industry. After 11 extensions instead of a reauthorization bill \nthat addresses these issues, it is time for the Senate to pass this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. DeMINT. The current perimeter rule at Ronald Reagan Washington \nNational Airport stands as an artificial and antiquated barrier to \ncompetition and an impediment to choice. I am strongly supportive of \nthis amendment and others that provide travelers with more choices in \nair travel.\n  The Ensign amendment provides a needed improvement by allowing \ncarriers traveling out of DCA to respond to market demands and provide \ntheir customers with the air travel choices they demand most, instead \nof being confined by an antiquated statutory restriction. I am \noptimistic that as this bill moves forward that we can keep customer \nchoice at the forefront and continue to open the skies to competition.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3476, as Modified Withdrawn\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my amendment \nNo. 3476, as modified, be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfollowing the vote on the legislation to speak briefly about the FAA \nreauthorization.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from West Virginia.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3527\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, notwithstanding the order of March \n19, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. 3527 not be withdrawn; \nthat it be considered when the managers' package is presented.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\nAmendments Nos. 3469, 3488, 3492, 3494, 3511, 3479, as Modified; 3483, \n as Modified; 3506, as Modified; 3514, as Modified; 3520, as Modified; \n3538, as Modified; 3543, 3527, as Modified; 3541, as Modified; 3539, as \n        Modified; 3532, 3525, as Modified; and 3534, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

DESIGNATION OF FORMER MILITARY AIRPORTS.\n\n       Section 47118(g) is amended by striking ``one'' and \n     inserting ``three'' in its place.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, the vote just taken was unanimous, which \nis interesting. We were able to work on this for 5 days here on the \nfloor of the Senate. But I also want to say we always talk about good \nstaff work. We do have an exceptionally fine staff at the Commerce \nCommittee and I want to say that Senator Rockefeller's work and Senator \nHutchison's work was so important in order to move us in this direction \nto get this completed.\n  I think they would agree as well that the staff director Ellen \nDoneski, deputy staff director James Reid, Gael Sullivan, Rich Swayze \non the Aviation Subcommittee staff, and I know Senator Hutchison's \nstaff, Ann Begeman, staff director, Jarrod Thompson, and Tom Jones for \nSenator DeMint, is a fine staff.\n  The reason I wanted to say a word about this piece of legislation--I \njust got off an airplane myself, just came back from North Dakota. But \nI wanted to say that this piece of legislation, while not getting the \nattention that some other pieces of legislation are getting these days, \nnotably health care, among others, is a very important piece of \nlegislation, and it has some very important critical changes that I \nthink will be beneficial and will save lives. I wanted to mention a \ncouple of them.\n  No. 1, for the irritants that exist in air travel these days, and \nthere are a lot of them, this includes the Passenger Bill of Rights--a \nlot of people probably do not know that, but just common sense, sound \nthinking about what are the rights of passengers here.\n  We worked with the airlines and the passenger groups and so on. This \nincludes the Passenger Bill of Rights, the 3-hour limit. If you are on \nan airline some place and they want to have you sit on the end of a \nrunway or on the tarmac for 5 or 6 hours, it is not going to happen, \nnot when this legislation passes. We have a 3-hour limitation. That is \njust the start of it. But the Passenger Bill of Rights is important.\n  Most important to me are the safety issues. I held a number of \nhearings on safety in our subcommittee, and I appreciate very much the \nwork of Senator Rockefeller. He was very interested in making sure that \nwe pursue these safety issues in order that they can become a part of \nthe FAA reauthorization bill.\n  A significant part of this bill is modernization of the air traffic \ncontrol system. But this bill also is about aviation safety, and so I \nwant to mention the safety provisions. We held a number of hearings to \ntry to understand what could we learn from the tragedy that occurred at \nthe Colgan crash in Buffalo, NY. We learned a lot, and a lot of things \nthat were frankly, to me, very troubling. We have addressed a number of \nthose provisions in this legislation.\n  Pilot training and experience. Frankly, were it not for the families \nof the victims of the Colgan crash who have witnessed here at every \nopportunity, in every circumstance, where there has been a hearing or \nsomething in which aviation safety was discussed, they were here \npushing and prodding and asking the right questions.\n  We do advance the interests of aviation training and experience in \nthis legislation. The FAA must revisit flight and duty-time limitations \nto address pilot fatigue in this legislation.\n  We do not yet and have not addressed the commuting issue which I \nthink is an issue, but we have not yet addressed that, and could not in \nthis bill, but that will continue to be an issue we will work on. We \nhave an FAA-required report to the Congress now, annually every year, \nof all of the safety recommendations from the NTSB, and which have been \nfollowed and which have not.\n  This issue of the most-wanted list of safety recommendations, which \nin some cases has been on the list for 10 and 15 years, it is \nunforgivable that that has happened. We are not going to let that \nhappen again.\n  Obviously, we prohibit the use of wireless communications devices and \nlaptop computers in the cockpit that are not used for the purpose of \nthe operation of the airplane. When I say obviously, an airplane that \noverflies its destination with a couple of pilots working on laptops, \noverflying the destination by 150 miles or so, does not make much sense \nto me that we do not have a prohibition in the FAA manuals to prohibit \nin every circumstance the use of these kinds of personal wireless \ncommunications devices for personal use in the cockpit during flight.\n  We enhance safety oversight of foreign repair stations, which is very \nimportant. It mandates two inspections per year by the FAA. A lot of \npeople do not understand that a lot of the maintenance now is being \ndone in some cases overseas, and in other cases, they are being done, \nfarmed out and contracted out, to someone outside of the airline \nitself.\n  We require the disclosure of the airline operating flights. When a \nconsumer buys a ticket on an airline, we want them to understand who is \nthe company that is carrying them, not what is the brand on the \nairline, but what company is this, so they have some sense of who is in \ncharge of that flight.\n  Access to all pilots records. You know regarding the captain in the \nColgan flight, the CEO of Colgan Air said: Had I known the failures of \nthat captain in certain exams and tests along the way, in certifying \nthese various licenses, we would not have hired that captain. And yet \nthe company did not know. That will not be the case in the future.\n  Those are just some, not all, of the safety issues. They are very \nimportant. I am convinced that lives will be saved. I do not suggest \nthis is the entire set of issues that has to be resolved. More remains \nto be done and we will remain on the case to do that. We will continue \neven now with additional hearings.\n  Finally, I want to say on the issue of modernization, this too is so \nimportant. It relates to safety, but it relates to other things. It \nrelates to the reduced use of fuel, more direct routing, better \ntimelines for trips for passengers, because they will get to their \ndestination more quickly; less spacing between airplanes in the sky. \nThat is because, rather than fly to the old ground-based radar system, \nwhere you know about where an airline is, you only know about where it \nis when the transponder flashes a dot on that screen in front of the \nair traffic controller, and the next 7 or so seconds that airplane is \nsomewhere else.\n  Well, using the GPS system which all of us, or at least some of us--I \ndo not have, but many people use it in their car, use it on their cell \nphone. The common use of the GPS is all over the world these days, \nexcept we do not use it, by and large, for commercial airlines, and we \nshould.\n  Air traffic control modernization means ground-based systems that \nneed to be built, it means protocols that have to be developed, it \nmeans equipage in the cockpit. But we must get there not in 15 or 20 \nyears, we must get there soon. So this piece of legislation \ndramatically advances those timelines.\n  Some talk about waiting and finishing this job in 15 years. We \nsubstantially truncated the time to say: No, let's get this done. So \nthose are the significant issues.\n  Again, I want to thank Margaret McCarthy on my staff, along with the \nother staff I have previously mentioned.\n  I especially again want to say, I have served on the Commerce \nCommittee for\n\n[[Page S1810]]\n\na good many years, and we have worked on a lot of issues. It has such a \nwide jurisdiction, a wide range of interests and issues. Senator \nRockefeller assumed control of the Commerce Committee just this \nCongress, and I think has done an extraordinary job. I appreciate his \nleadership. I appreciate the fact that he gave us not only directions \nbut the reins to work in the subcommittee, and then he and the ranking \nmember worked very hard at the full committee to put this piece of \nlegislation together.\n  It is rare indeed in this day and age to find a piece of legislation \nthat passes the Senate in a record vote, that is a piece of legislation \nof great consequence, that deals with many issues, some of them \ncontroversial, to be passed by the Senate with no negative votes at \nall. Think of that. No negative votes cast on this bill today.\n  Would not it be nice if we could see more of that kind of \ntogetherness, coming together on public policy that all of us think is \ngood for this country and its future.\n  I wanted to again say how proud I am of this legislation and how \nimportant it is to this country. I am pleased that this is the next \nstep, an important step, and then we would conference with the House \nand bring a conference report back, and it will be signed by the \nPresident. We will have all done something to advance safety and \nmodernization in aviation in this country; not just for commercial \naviation, but for general aviation, which is an increasingly important \npart of our aviation system.\n  Madam President, I also want to take this opportunity to say a few \nwords about the Disadvantaged Business Enterprise--DBE--Program and the \nAirport Concessions Disadvantaged Business Enterprise--ACDBE--Program, \nor the DBE Programs. As the Senate is well aware, this program was \noriginally enacted by Congress to level the playing field for minority \nand women contractors working in airport related businesses.\n  While we have made considerable progress toward that goal over the \nyears, unfortunately a good deal more work remains. The Commerce \nCommittee examined disparity studies documenting the existence of \ndiscrimination in public contracting while considering and drafting FAA \nreauthorization legislation. We concluded that the DBE Program remains \nnecessary to thwart ongoing discrimination and determined that several \nimprovements to the DBE Programs were necessary. I am pleased that the \nFAA Reauthorization bill includes provisions to adjust the personal net \nworth calculation for inflation, to require certification training of \nofficials involved in the review of DBE applications, to prohibit \nexcess bonding requirements, and to ensure that retirement savings are \nnot included in the personal net worth calculation.\n  The evidence of discrimination included in disparities studies makes \nclear that discrimination against minority and women owned businesses \nis still a serious problem in airport-related businesses and beyond. \nThis is unacceptable. The DBE and ACDBE Programs are the only current \nsafeguard against the problems of business discrimination in the \nairport context. I am encouraged that this bill includes provisions to \nensure the continued health of the program and to promote a level \nplaying field within the industry.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1810-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER.

Richardson\n\n  Mr. PRYOR. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that today I \nhonor U.S. Army Sgt. Jonathan J. Richardson from Bald Knob, AR, and pay \ntribute to his life and service to our country.\n  Sergeant Richardson was a fire support specialist who lost his life \nfrom wounds suffered when his unit came under fire in Khost Province, \nAfghanistan. He was a member of the C Company, 1st Battalion, 187th \nInfantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 101st Airborne Division, \nand had previously served in Iraq with the same unit. He was never \nafraid to go where the action was, knowing that the line of fire was \nwhere he was needed most.\n  Sergeant Richardson served both tours with courage and distinction, \nreceiving awards including the Army Commendation Medal, Iraq Campaign \nMedal, Global War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Good Conduct Medal, \nand National Defense Service Medal.\n  Sergeant Richardson graduated from Bald Knob High School in 2004, \nwhere he was a talented student and excelled on the football team. His \nfamily and friends described him as an honorable man, devoted to his \nwife and family. These qualities were readily apparent on the \nbattlefield, where his comrades called him ``the kind of leader \nsoldiers strive to emulate.'' He was committed to serving others, and \nwhile he could have done a great many things with his young life, he \nchose to serve our Nation in the military. This commitment to serve is, \nto me, what makes Sergeant Richardson a true hero.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with Sergeant Richardson's wife Rachel, \nparents, Sharon and Jeffery, and all those who loved him during this \nheartbreaking time.\n  As John 15:13 states: ``Greater love has no one than this, that one \nlay down his life for his friends.'' Sergeant Richardson had the \ngreatest love for his country, and his country will always remember his \nselfless service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1810-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1810-S1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I rise to bring attention to the crucial \nrole of health care professionals in providing quality health care \nacross our Nation. Other than being a father, grandfather, and husband \nnothing has been more personally satisfying for me than meeting and \ncaring for patients. As a practicing physician I have seen firsthand \nthe importance of each and every health care practitioner--not just \ndoctors and nurses--in meeting this country's diverse health care \nneeds. I am thankful for the contribution that dedicated health \nprofessionals have made to not just my medical practice, but all of our \ncommunities.\n  These professionals are found not only in hospitals and doctor's \noffices, but everywhere from local schools to athletic training \nclinics, long-term care facilities to rehabilitation centers, and \nproviding loving care in hospices and private homes. There are more \nthan 100 distinct allied health professions including respiratory \ntherapists, music therapists, athletic trainers, clinical laboratory \nscientists, radiologic technologists, medical assistants and many \nothers. They provide expert care in a number of therapeutic, diagnostic \nand preventive services in a multitude of settings. These professionals \npractice expertise in disease prevention and control, dietary and \nnutritional services, mental and physical health promotion, \nrehabilitation, and health systems management. Approximately 6 million \nindividuals are currently serving in allied health professionals, \nrepresenting about 60 percent of the healthcare workforce. According to \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics, 10 of the 20 fastest growing \noccupations for 2008--2018 are in the health professions.\n  As Congress continues to engage in a national debate on health care, \nI have consistently been offering patient-centered solutions that would \nallow individuals to access care tailored to their individual needs. \nConsumer choice, not government coercion, has made goods and services \nthat were once scarce affordable and accessible. For instance, in the \npast 18 months the number of unique iPhone applications available to \nconsumers has gone from 500 to more than 140,000--with 3 billion \napplications downloaded. If patients were empowered to take control of \ntheir health care spending, it would enable health care professionals \nto more freely exercise their immense talents--no\n\n[[Page S1811]]\n\ndoubt putting Apple and the iPhone to shame.\n  Regardless of the outcome of the health care debate, these health \ncare professionals will continue to make a difference in their \npatients' lives. I want to personally thank, and express my support \nfor, these vital health care professionals. Our system could not \nfunction without their tireless efforts. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing this important group of individuals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1811-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I am honored today to recognize the \nLeague of Women Voters for their 90 years of voter education and \nactivism, and specifically want to congratulate the League of Women \nVoters of Northwest Riverside. County.\n  In 1920, when passage of the 19th amendment appeared to be imminent, \nmembers of the National American Woman Suffrage Association met to form \nthe League of Women Voters. Carrie Chapman Catt first proposed the \ncreation of a League to ``finish the fight'' and work to end all \ndiscrimination against women. While initially concerned with the status \nand rights of women, the League of Women Voters gradually expanded its \ninterests to include issues affecting the whole community. I am sure \nsuffragettes would be pleased that every issue became a women's issue.\n  Today, the League works at all levels of government to address a wide \nvariety of concerns including health care, education, climate change, \nland use, ethics and election and campaign finance reform. Whether \nthrough voter guides or public forums, the League gives voters the \ninformation they need to play a critical role in our community and \ncountry.\n  For nearly 57 years, the League of Women Voters of Northwest \nRiverside County has made a difference--championing countless public \npolicy challenges, hosting candidate forums and public information \nmeetings, and distributing thousands of voter information guides.\n  The suffragettes who started the movement to give women the right to \nvote did not know if they would succeed. But, they persevered. Today, \nwith over 850 local Leagues, 50 State Leagues and the National League, \nthe League of Women Voters remains just as committed to improving our \ndemocracy and the quality of life for all our citizens.\n  Please join me in honoring the League of Women Voters for its \ndedication to the ideals of our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1811-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF JOHN G. LEVI\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, last Friday the Senate finally confirmed \nJohn G. Levi to be a member of the Board of Directors of the Legal \nServices Corporation. His nomination has been pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar since October 21 when reported favorably by the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n  Mr. Levi is a partner in the Chicago office of Sidley Austin LLP \nwhere he has spent more than 25 years specializing in employment \nlitigation, executive compensation, and labor-management relations. \nDespite the demands of his legal practice, he has always found time to \ngive back to the community.\n  In addition to leading his law firm's adopt-a-school program, where \nhe oversees lawyers and staff involved in mentoring activities in \npublic schools, Mr. Levi has been involved in juvenile justice and \naccess of justice issues, serving on both the Cook County Citizens' \nCommittee for the Juvenile courts, and the board of the Jane Addams \nJuvenile Court Foundation. He also serves on the advisory board for the \nNorthwestern University Law School Center on Wrongful Convictions. He \nis the immediate past president and longtime trustee of the Francis W. \nParker School in Chicago. He is the recipient of the 2004 Abraham \nLincoln Marovitz ``Lend A Hand'' volunteer award, and was awarded a \nhonorary diploma by the Parker School in 2003.\n  Considering Mr. Levi's strong commitment to public service, it is not \nsurprising that President Obama has appointed him to the Board that \noversees the vital work of the Legal Services Corporation, LSC. The LSC \nis the Federal agency that coordinates provisions to ensure that low-\nincome Americans have access to adequate legal representation. The \ncorporation employs lawyers who are experts in areas such as health \ncare, housing, Social Security, consumer problems, welfare, and \nemployment. These immensely important issues affect millions of \nAmericans each year; many of whom are unable to afford legal assistance \nwhen they need it most. I know that in my own State of Vermont, LSC has \nprovided legal assistance to many low income people in such matters and \nthat local legal aid lawyers rely extensively on their national support \ncenters.\n  The Legal Services Corporation plays a critical role in ensuring that \njustice is carried out in a manner consistent with the Constitution's \npromise, and when justice is served fairly, it benefits us all and \nstrengthens the integrity of our legal system.\n  I will always remember the important service to the country provided \nby his father, Attorney General Edward H. Levi, at a difficult time in \nour Nation's history. His is a family of outstanding lawyers. They have \nmade a significant contribution and make a significant difference to \nthe people who need the protection of the law. John Levi is a strong \naddition to LSC's board of directors. I congratulate him and his family \non his confirmation. I look forward to working with him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1811-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1811-S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM H. SATTERFIELD\n\n Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, today I pay tribute to William \n(Bill) Satterfield, counsel for Balch & Bingham LLP in Birmingham, AL.\n  Prior to his position at Balch and Bingham, Bill served as the \ngeneral counsel of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and as the \nAssociate and Deputy Solicitor of the U.S. Department of Interior in \nWashington, DC.\n  Bill has extensive experience with environmental, natural resources, \nenergy, and public utility law on both the Federal and State levels and \nhas been fighting the good fight for the State of Alabama on a myriad \nof environmental issues for over three decades. He has used his \nknowledge of the laws, regulations, and political climate to provide \ndirection on environmental and natural resource issues to individuals, \nsmall businesses, and large corporations in Alabama.\n  In a big part of this work, he has been a great advocate for port and \nwaterways issues in Alabama, serving as counsel to Alabama-Tombigbee \nRivers Coalition. This organization is made up of 34 members and \ncomposed of business, trade associations, and state agencies in Alabama \nand Mississippi, and it led the charge to challenge the Fish and \nWildlife's proposed listing of the Alabama sturgeon as an endangered \nspecies.\n  He is also the secretary and counsel of the National Waterways \nConference, which focuses on commonsense water resources policies that \nmaximize the economic and environmental value of our inland, coastal \nand Great Lakes waterways.\n  During his tenure as legal counsel for the National Waterways \nConference, a volunteer position, he invested countless hours to ensure \nthat the constitution and bylaws of the organization were preserved to \nensure the ongoing integrity of the National Waterways Conference as \nthe only water resources association representing the full spectrum of \nwater resources stakeholders, and thanks to his tireless efforts, the \nNational Waterways Conference continues to prevail as our Nation's \nleading multifaceted water resource organization.\n  The National Waterways Conference, which was founded in 1960, \ncelebrates its 50th anniversary this year and bestowed on Bill \nSatterfield the title of Counsel Emeritus of the National Waterways \nConference on March 9, 2010.\n  Through his work with the National Waterways Conference, he embodied \nthe spirit of our nation's frontiersmen on many occasions. In the \nceremony naming him counsel emeritus, he was presented a bronze statue \nwith the following quote:\n\n       This bronze statue of ``The Trooper on the Plains'' by \n     Frederic Remington is symbolic\n\n[[Page S1812]]\n\n     of the attributes Satterfield exhibited in every situation he \n     encountered throughout his career: Bravery, quick action, \n     strength, courage, and endurance. With a yank of the reins, \n     the rider in this statue is galloping full speed ahead \n     through dangerous territory with a pistol pointed across his \n     torso. The feet of his horse, in this scene, never touch the \n     ground, as he is always moving. He charges towards the enemy \n     camp, fearless and undaunted, with great courage and \n     resolution. His one goal: Achieve the aims set forth by his \n     commanding officer, and win ultimate victory for his army. \n     Colonel Bill Satterfield is a true ``Trooper of the Plains.''\n\n  Bill is a great lawyer, a proven professional, a superb public \nservant, a man of high principle who understands and loves this great \nRepublic which we serve and a good friend. I extend my heartiest \ncongratulations upon his receipt of this special and most deserved \nhonor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1812-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:06 p.m., a message from the House, delivered by Ms. Niland, one \nof its reading clerks, announced that the House has passed the \nfollowing bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 2788.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor the treatment of Department of Defense health coverage as minimal \nessential coverage; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill that speaks \ndirectly to the welfare of our military service members and their \nfamilies. TRICARE, TRICARE for Life, and the nonappropriated fund \nhealth plans are the programs that provide health care for our men and \nwomen in uniform, their families, retirees, and other eligible \nindividuals. These programs, as well as today's military veterans \nhealth care system, exceed the minimum essential coverage for \nindividual health insurance required by the health care reform bill \npassed yesterday by the House of Representatives.\n  I am pleased to offer a companion bill to one introduced last week by \nmy good friend, House Armed Services Committee Chairman Ike Skelton, \nthat explicitly protects TRICARE and NAF health plans. Representative \nSkelton's bill, which passed Saturday by a vote of 403 to 0, makes it \nperfectly clear that no TRICARE or NAF health plan beneficiary will be \nrequired to purchase additional coverage beyond what they already have.\n  My companion legislation to Chairman Skelton's provides a similar \nreassurance to our servicemembers and their families. It will amend the \nInternal Revenue Code of 1986 in a way that stipulates that Department \nof Defense TRICARE health-care coverage will be treated as minimal \nessential coverage under the health care reform bill when it is signed \ninto law by the President.\n  There has been a great deal of confusion over the past year \nsurrounding the future of TRICARE and other military health care \nprograms. False allegations have been raised, for example, that the \nadministration planned changes to TRICARE for Life that would \njeopardize its future or substantially raise its cost for \nbeneficiaries. It is important to set the record straight.\n  In my capacity as the chairman of the Personnel Subcommittee of the \nSenate Committee on Armed Services, I am committed to protecting the \nhealth care coverage programs in place for the military today.\n  Supporting this bill will reassure our service members that the \ncoverage provided by TRICARE and nonppropriated health plans is \nproperly protected in law as meeting the requirements for individual \nhealth insurance mandated by the new health care reform bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BEGICH (for himself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 3150. A bill to increase the mileage reimbursement rate for \nmembers of the armed services during permanent change of station and to \nauthorize the transportation of additional motor vehicles of members on \nchange of permanent station to or from nonforeign areas outside the \ncontinental United States; to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill entitled the \nService Members Permanent Change of Station Relief Act--or PCS Relief \nAct. I am proud to introduce this legislation and thank my cosponsor \nSenator Patty Murray. This bill will provide our servicemembers and \ntheir families much-needed financial relief during these hard economic \ntimes.\n  Like most families, our servicemembers are pinching their pennies \ntoo. Unfortunately, often they incur many unnecessary financial burdens \nrelated to their service and their sacrifice. For instance, right now, \nour servicemembers with spouses and children are only reimbursed for \nshipping one vehicle to or from Alaska, Hawaii, and Guam during a \npermanent change of station. This means if they get directed to move to \na military base in Alaska from Texas, or to Texas from Alaska, they \nmust pay to transport a second car themselves, or they must sell their \nvehicle and purchase a new car at the next location. This can be a \ncostly option.\n  However, many military families cannot afford to ship a second \nvehicle or purchase another car. Without a second vehicle, spouses and \nchildren who accompany a servicemember on a permanent change of station \nmay be unable to hold a job, run daily errands, or otherwise \nparticipate in their new communities. Many States have large military \nbases, such as Joint Base Elmendorf and Fort Richardson in Alaska. With \nhousing on one end and base services on another, some families cannot \neven get to the grocery store or take their children to a doctor in an \nemergency.\n  Colleagues, it is unacceptable that we put our military families in a \nposition where they have to make a choice between the inability to meet \ndaily needs and take care of their family in an emergency, or pay more \nthan $1,500 to ship a second vehicle. Under the PCS Relief Act, our \nmilitary families will be able to ship a second car to and from Hawaii, \nAlaska, and Guam to ease the hardships and alleviate needless costs.\n  To further alleviate needless costs, the legislation will increase \nthe gas mileage reimbursement rate during a permanent change in \nstation. Currently, when our personnel drive from one military base to \nthe next on their government-directed move, they are reimbursed less \nthan half the amount they get under temporary duty assignments. The \ntemporary duty reimbursement rate reflects the true cost of operating a \nvehicle. The current PCS reimbursement rate of 16 cents per mile does \nnot, creating yet another financial burden for servicemembers.\n  It doesn't make any sense that gas mileage reimbursement rates are \ndifferent amounts for PCS and TDY. Our servicemembers get official \norders to move. It is not optional.\n  They are both official business expenditures. We already ask so much \nof our servicemembers and their families. They are fighting two wars. \nThey move at the military services' direction, relocating themselves \nand their families to new military bases every few years. It is unfair \nwe are asking them to pay out of pocket on these government-directed \nmoves, or experience unwarranted and pointless hardships due to \nfinancial constraints.\n  In these tough economic times, it is more important than ever that we \nshow our support for our servicemembers and their families. Relieving \nstress and strain during a permanent change in station is the least we \ncan do. I ask my colleagues to support the Service Members PCS Relief \nAct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/22/senate-section/article/S1814-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1814-S1815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 463--RECOGNIZING THE CULTURAL AND HISTORICAL \n SIGNIFICANCE OF NOWRUZ, EXPRESSING APPRECIATION TO IRANIAN-AMERICANS \n FOR THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIETY, AND WISHING IRANIAN-AMERICANS AND \n                THE PEOPLE OF IRAN A PROSPEROUS NEW YEAR\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Webb, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. \nByrd, Mr. Burris, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Hatch, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. McCain, \nMr. Merkley, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Ms. \nKlobuchar, Mr. Levin, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Cardin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution;

Mr. President, a little earlier today, the President \nsigned the Democratic health spending bill into law, and he used the \noccasion to point out a number of things he wants people to know about \nit. Now he will travel around the country, talking up the bill to a \nskeptical public. Clearly, Democrats in Washington still do not get it. \nAmericans already know what is in this bill. That is precisely why they \ndo not like it.\n  Most Americans out there are not celebrating today. They are \ndumbfounded by the fact that Congress just passed this 2,685-page \nmonstrosity against their wishes, on the backs of their children and \ngrandchildren who they know will have to pick up the tab.\n  With all due respect, you do not pass a bill the American people did \nnot want and then try to sell them on it. You win their support first, \nthen pass it on a bipartisan basis, just as we have done on every other \npiece of major social legislation we have passed over the past 45 \nyears.\n\n[[Page S1820]]\n\n  People oppose this bill not because they do not know what is in it \nbut because they know exactly what is in it. But for some reason, \nDemocrats in Washington still think they can continue to spin the \npublic on this bill. They are still trying to sell it as the one and \nonly solution to problems that we all recognize exist in our health \ncare system.\n  They will say this is the only solution to controlling costs. They \nwill say this is the only solution to covering preexisting conditions. \nThey will say this is the only way to keep people from getting kicked \noff their insurance plans.\n  The American people are not stupid. They know these are false \nchoices.\n  They know you do not have to slash Medicare a $\\1/2\\ trillion to \nlower premiums.\n  You do not have to impose job-killing taxes to keep people from being \nkicked off their plan.\n  People know you will not save money on health care by spending \nanother $2.6 trillion on health care.\n  They know you can do these things without forcing taxpayers to cover \nthe cost of abortions.\n  They know you do not reduce the deficit by creating a massive new \ngovernment program that even Democrats have described as a Ponzi \nscheme.\n  They know you can go a long way toward doing all of these things \nwithout creating a brandnew entitlement at a time when we cannot even \ncover the cost of the entitlements we already have.\n  They know Democrats can claim to know the verdict of history all they \nwant, but that history will remember this past week not for giving \nAmericans a boost but from diverting us from the real task of enacting \ncommonsense health care reforms that actually lower the cost of care \nwithout undermining the health care system we already have.\n  Americans wanted us to get at the root of this problem, which is \ncost. Instead, Democrats are spending trillions more on a system that \nalready costs too much and forcing seniors, small business owners, and \nmiddle-class families to pay for it.\n  You can call that a lot of things. You might even call it historic. \nBut you cannot call it reform.\n  The fact is, this bill spends $2.6 trillion at a time of near double-\ndigit inflation, while putting the real problem off for another day. It \nkicks the can down the road.\n  Democrats in Washington can celebrate all they want, but the \ncelebration is going to be short lived. The American people are not \nfooled.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I agree with my distinguished counterpart, \nthe Senator from Kentucky. The American people are not stupid. What we \nare now going to be on shortly is something we do nearly every year. \nSince 1980, we have done it 20-some odd times; 80 percent of the time \nit has been done by Republicans. We are going to move forward and make \na good law we just passed and signed by the President today even \nbetter.\n  This legislation will reduce the deficit during the first 10 years by \nabout $140 billion, over the next 10 years by about $1.3 trillion. In \nNevada, 600,000 people will be able to have insurance who do not have \nit today; 24,000 small businesses in Nevada will be able to have \ninsurance for their employees. Why didn't they have it before? Was it \nbecause they were cheap or mean? No, they could not afford it. The \ninsurance companies had a lock on the system. They could not afford it.\n  There are so many good things, and I am not going to talk about all \nof them, in this law the President signed today, but let me talk about \none thing because it is very personal. This legislation now will allow \nsomeone who turns 24 to still be on their parents' insurance when they \nare in college. They don't even have to be in college--whatever they \ndo. The reason this is important is, Searchlight, NV, is a place where \na hard-working couple had a child somewhat late in life. They love that \nboy. He is going to school almost full time, working part time. He \nturned 23 and went off his parents' insurance.\n  Within weeks of his being 23 years old, he got sick and was diagnosed \nas having testicular cancer. He was real sick. He has had two \nsurgeries. He has had chemotherapy twice. This has been paid for by his \nparents, who did not have the money to do this. They exhausted their \nsavings. In America, that is not the way it should be. This law we now \nhave takes care of a lot of people just like Jeff Hill from \nSearchlight, NV.\n  For all senior citizens in Nevada who are on Medicare, we can close \nthe doughnut hole; that is, people will not have to be concerned about \narriving at a point with their health care delivery system where they \nno longer have coverage for prescription drugs. We take care of that in \nthis new law. There are bipartisan ideas to attack waste, fraud, and \nabuse. We expand Medicaid Programs. Doing nothing means double-digit \npremium increases as high as 60 to 70 percent.\n  This is a good law, and we are going to make it better.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I move that the Senate adjourn until 3:05 \np.m. today, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question is on agreeing to the \nmotion.\n  Is there a sufficient second? There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.
