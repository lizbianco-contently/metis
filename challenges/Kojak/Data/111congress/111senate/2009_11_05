Mr. President, one thing this body needs is more \nbipartisanship. The Presiding Officer has done a wonderful job in \nreaching out during his tenure as a Senator to other Senators, \nDemocrats and Republicans. Legislation is the art of compromise, \nconsensus building. The Presiding Officer certainly has filled that \nrole very well. I want to spend a few minutes talking about this.\n  We have had some dramatic developments take place in the last several \nweeks. That is as a result of two men who are working very hard to come \nup with something that would be landmark legislation. We are working so \nhard on health care reform. It has been extremely difficult to arrive \nat the point where we are. But we are further now than we have ever \nbeen since 1948 in coming up with health care legislation that will \nmake health care more available for all Americans.\n  Switching from health care to energy and the problems we have with \nthe warming of the Earth, I have known John Kerry for a long time. We \nwere both Lieutenant Governors. We came to the Congress the same year. \nAs a relatively new Senator, I was on a select committee he cochaired, \ndealing with prisoners of war and those missing in action. I noticed at \nthat time what a fine leader and fine legislator John Kerry was. As a \nresult of his good work with others on that committee, including Bob \nSmith of New Hampshire, we came up with an outstanding work product in \nthat committee. John Kerry, as we all know, became the Democratic \nnominee for President of the United States and came very close to being \nelected President. But he put that aside and went on\n\n[[Page S11132]]\n\nto become the fine Senator he is. He is filling that role now as \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He has worked so hard on \ndoing something on a bipartisan basis to move forward on this most \nimportant legislation. With what he has done in reaching out to \nRepublicans--I say that in the plural--we have had one brave Republican \nstep forward to work with him, Lindsey Graham. I first saw Lindsey \nGraham in action when we had the impeachment trial of President \nClinton. He was one of the impeachment officers from the House. He was \nvery good. I learned at that time what an outstanding trial lawyer he \nhad been in South Carolina. I recognized that from the presentation he \nmade right in the well of this Senate.\n  As we learned with the work we completed dealing with unemployment \ninsurance, net operating loss, first-time home buyers, it only takes \none person to break from the pack, for lack of a better description, to \ndevelop bipartisanship. That was done along with Senator Isakson from \nGeorgia. On this most important issue dealing with climate change, it \nis Lindsey Graham from South Carolina. He is bravely stepping forward.\n  What Senators Kerry and Graham have done is quite remarkable. They \nhave reached out to the coal interests. We have a number of coal \nSenators who have said: No way will we ever agree to anything, and they \nare working toward having them as part of the agreement. Nuclear power, \nwhich when this all started, I think it is fair to say, people on this \nside of the aisle wanted no part of that--most people on this side. Now \nthat will be part of the mix. The production of oil in our country--\npeople say, does that mean you have given up on all these great things \nwe believe in? Legislation is the art of compromise. We need to have \nlegislation that is bipartisan. I believe what Lindsey Graham and John \nKerry have done will allow us to move forward on this legislation. It \nis important that we do things on a bipartisan basis.\n  I compliment and applaud and recognize the good work these two brave \nmen are doing in setting an example for the rest of us in moving \nforward on legislation that will be dramatic not only for our country \nbut for the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11132-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the last 2 years haven't been easy ones \nfor the American people. Millions have lost jobs and homes, and many \nhave had the bitter experience of watching years of savings disappear. \nUnemployment stands at a 25-year high, and in many States it is worse. \nJust to take one example, in Kentucky unemployment rose in all 120 \ncounties from June 2008 to June 2009. A lot of Americans are hurting. A \nlot of them have been struggling for a long time. And despite the \noccasional piece of good news, the situation doesn't seem to be getting \na whole lot better for most people.\n  This is the situation now, and this was the situation when the White \nHouse announced its plan to undertake health care reform. Throughout \nthis debate, the need to do something about the economy has never been \nfar from our minds.\n  Indeed, from the very outset of this debate, the administration has \nrested its case for reform on the need to do something about the \neconomy. The economy was in bad shape, the argument went. And reforming \nhealth care would make it better.\n  All of us agree that health care costs are unsustainably high, and \nalleviating the burden of these costs on American families and \nbusinesses is something we should work together to do. But somewhere \nalong the way, the administration got off track. The original purpose \nof reform was obscured. And now we are hearing from one independent \nanalysis after another that a bill which was meant to alleviate \neconomic burdens will actually make these burdens worse. And the most \nsignificant finding is this: A reform that was meant to lower costs \nwill actually drive them up.\n  Americans are scratching their heads about all this, and rightly so. \nBusiness owners can't believe a reform that was meant to help them \nsurvive will end up costing them more in higher taxes. Seniors can't \nbelieve a bill that was meant to improve their care will lead to nearly \nhalf a trillion dollars in cuts to their Medicare. And families can't \nbelieve that they are going to have to pay higher health care premiums \nand taxes at a time when so many of them are already struggling to make \nends meet.\n  Higher taxes, higher premiums, cuts to Medicare. These are three of \nthe major blows this legislation would deal to the American people. And \nany one of them would be bad enough on its own. But let's just look at \none of the unexpected consequences of the Democrat health care plan for \na moment--let's look at the tax hikes.\n  The Senate bill we've seen targets individuals and businesses with a \nraft of new taxes, fees, and penalties. It imposes a 40-percent tax on \nhigh value insurance plans for individuals and families. It imposes \nbillions in fees on health plans that will inevitably be passed along \nto consumers. It imposes fees on the costs of medical devices and life-\nsaving drugs, fees that would be paid by consumers.\n  Millions of taxpayers managing chronic conditions and facing \nextraordinary medical expenses will be faced with even higher out of \npocket costs because the bill makes it more difficult to deduct these \nexpenses. And small businesses with as few as 50 employees would be \nrequired to buy insurance for all workers whether they could afford it \nor not, or pay a substantial tax for each of them.\n  Taken together, the health care plan we have seen would impose \nroughly half a trillion dollars in new taxes, fees, and penalties at a \ntime when Americans are already struggling to dig themselves out of a \nrecession. What's worse, an independent analysis by the Joint Committee \non Taxation suggests that nearly 80 percent of the burden would fall on \nmiddle-class Americans.\n  So a reform that was meant to make life easier is now expected to \nmake life harder. If you have insurance, you get taxed. If you don't \nhave insurance, you get taxed. If you're a struggling business owner \nwho can't afford insurance for your employees, you get taxed. If you \nuse medical devices, you get taxed.\n  This is not the reform Americans were asking for, Mr. President. And \nthat's precisely why more Americans now oppose this health care plan \nthan support it.\n  The administration didn't listen to the American people when it put \nthis plan together, but it can listen now, and the message it is going \nto hear is this: Put away the plan to raise premiums, raise taxes, and \ncut Medicare. Get back to the drawing board and come up with a \ncommonsense, step-by-step set of reforms. That is what people want, and \nthat is what they should get.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11132-3", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the United States spends $2.3 trillion \neach year on health care--the most per capita of all industrialized \nnations. Yet we still have higher infant mortality and lower life \nexpectancy than many of the other industrialized nations. Moreover, \nmedical errors kill 100,000 patients per year and cost the system tens \nof billions of dollars, and $700 billion is spent each year on \ntreatments that do not lead to improved patient health.\n  Today, my freshman Senate colleagues and I are going to speak about\n\n[[Page S11133]]\n\nthe need to reform our health care delivery systems. You will hear from \nall of us about innovative initiatives that are successfully bringing \ndown the cost of health care and at the same time improving the quality \nof care.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nColorado, Senator Mark Udall, to discuss accountable care \norganizations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from \nColorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North \nCarolina, Senator Hagan, for convening this important session this \nmorning where we will talk about the urgent need to reform health care \nin our country.\n  The unsustainable growth in health care costs and lack of stable, \naffordable coverage for millions of Americans continue to jeopardize \nnot only our Nation's fiscal well-being but also the physical well-\nbeing of our families and neighbors. One of the key ways we can help \nput our health care system and our economy on the right track is by \nencouraging value in the delivery of health care.\n  I have cited these numbers before--I know many of us have--but I want \nto emphasize them again. As a nation, we spend over $2 trillion per \nyear on health care--that is nearly one-fifth of our economy. Yet \nbetween 30 and 50 percent of these dollars are not contributing to \nbetter patient health. That is not a good deal for the American people.\n  Health reform is designed to address this staggering amount of waste \nin a number of ways. One way is to encourage providers to focus on the \nquality of care they provide and not just on the volume. And we can \nstart with Medicare.\n  I think the American people would agree that taxpayer dollars are \nbetter spent rewarding doctors for keeping patients healthy and not for \nperforming more tests or more procedures. Health reform legislation can \nmove us in this direction through the development of what are known as \naccountable care organizations, or ACOs. These organizations would \nencourage groups of health care professionals to team up and provide \nmore coordinated, streamlined care to Medicare patients. The idea is to \nhave these ACOs take responsibility for improving patient care while \nlowering cost and then sharing the savings that accrue. Research \nindicates that this idea of shared savings would help eliminate waste \nand spur changes in our health care delivery system to emphasize \npatient outcomes and value.\n  The idea for ACOs no doubt came from the great work being done by a \npatchwork of physician groups. Groups such as the Physician Health \nPartners, or PHP, in my home State of Colorado, and others across the \ncountry focused on care coordination and quality.\n  For example, PHP has seen great success in improving care for kids \nsuffering from asthma--the No. 1 cause of child hospitalization and \nschool absence. They developed treatment guidelines and promoted \ncollaboration among doctors, the Children's Hospital in Denver, and the \nColorado Allergy and Asthma Centers. As a result, they have reduced \nemergency room visits and improved families' ability to manage asthma \non their own.\n  PHP also has the Practice Health Project. This comprehensive effort \nbrings doctors together to share best practices and encourage the \nadoption of commonsense guidelines to improve quality and efficiency. \nThe goal of this team effort is to raise the standard and value of care \nand allow these physician groups to act as a model for Denver's \nphysician community as a whole.\n  I would also like to tout the PHP's Transitions of Care Program in \ncollaboration with Denver's St. Anthony Hospital and other local care \nproviders. The program dispatches nurse coaches to help Medicare \npatients make the transition from the hospital to their homes. The \nperiod immediately following a hospital stay is a very confusing time, \nparticularly for our seniors. Having someone help with this transition \nis crucial. PHP has had tremendous early success with this program, \nshowing the potential to reduce costly hospital readmissions by 40 to \n50 percent. At the same time, this program keeps patients healthy and \nit saves money.\n  The successes of groups such as Physician Health Partners demonstrate \nthat we already have the will and the know-how to change our system for \nthe better. But under our existing system there is no incentive for \nprograms like PHP to even exist. Under the status quo, a hospital \nstands to lose money if it decreases its admission rates. Primary care \ndoctors would be at a financial disadvantage if they spent time in the \ndevelopment and implementation of effective treatment plans for their \nasthmatic patients.\n  This is why health reform includes commonsense proposals such as \nencouraging groups such as Physician Health Partners to form \naccountable care organizations and paying them to coordinate care for \nMedicare patients. Promoting ACOs and other creative pro-consumer ideas \nwill increase quality for patients and value for the taxpayer.\n  Only by reshaping the way we do business in our health care system \ncan we truly change health care delivery in our country. I look forward \nto working with my colleagues here today and other Senators in the \ncoming weeks to promote the many ways we can accomplish that goal.\n  I thank Senator Hagan, and I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank Senator Udall. Accountable care organizations are \nextremely important in health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I would like to yield 5 minutes to my colleague from \nDelaware, Senator Ted Kaufman, to discuss Delaware's health information \nnetwork.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. First, Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Hagan not \njust for putting this on but for her leadership all along on health \ncare reform, and I look forward to working with her because of her \ngreat leadership. I appreciate the opportunity to join my colleagues on \nthe floor to highlight health care innovations in our home States that \ncan serve as models for national reform.\n  Delaware is a national leader in health care IT--information \ntechnology--and I want to take a couple of minutes this morning to talk \nabout a truly innovative approach to health care record keeping in my \nState. It is called the Delaware Health Information Network.\n  The Delaware Health Information Network, which we call DHIN, was \nauthorized 12 years ago and went live in 2007, becoming the first \noperational statewide health information exchange. A public-private \npartnership of physicians, hospitals, laboratories, community \norganizations, and patients, the DHIN provides for the fast, secure, \nand reliable exchange of health information among the State's many \nmedical providers. As a result of its early success, the DHIN was one \nof the nine initial health information exchanges selected to \nparticipate in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' \nnational health information network trial implementations. Among those \nnine, it was the first State to successfully establish a connection \nwith the trial.\n  Right now, more than 50 percent of all providers in the State--nearly \n1,300--participate in the DHIN. More than 85 percent of all lab tests \nare entered into the network, and 81 percent of all hospitalizations \nare captured by the exchange. As of June of this year, the DHIN held \nover 648,000 patient records, and it conducts 40 million transactions a \nyear.\n  Participating providers have a choice of three options to receive \nlab, pathology, and radiology reports, as well as admission face \nsheets: they can have them sent directly into a secure in-box, similar \nto an e-mail account, they can have them faxed to their office, or they \ncan get the results from an electronic medical records interface on the \nWeb. All three provide information in a timely manner that protects the \nprivacy of the patient.\n  Our State of Delaware receives four very tangible benefits from DHIN, \nand these are listed on this chart.\n  First, the DHIN provides a communication system between providers and \norganizations--something that did not exist previously. Individual \nphysician offices can now easily discover if hospitals, such as \nChristiana, Bayhealth, and Beebe Medical Center, have admitted their \npatients. Doctors and hospitals can also get lab results back\n\n[[Page S11134]]\n\nfrom the State's clinical laboratories in a timely manner.\n  Second, the information exchanged electronically through DHIN helps \nimprove the quality of care being delivered in the State. When \nproviders have access to better, faster information at the time and \nplace of care, either in a doctor's office or an emergency room, those \nproviders can make better decisions and reduce the chance of medical \nerrors. Knowing what medications a patient is on or what coexisting \nconditions a patient may have can give the provider more complete \ninformation when delivering care, reducing the chance of an adverse \noutcome.\n  Third, the DHIN can help reduce the cost of care within the health \ncare system. That is what we are all looking for out of health care \nreform--cost reduction. With nearly 650,000 patient records in the \nsystem, providers can know what tests and procedures have already been \nordered, cutting out inadvertent test duplication. In addition, the \nDHIN can help improve disease management by allowing multiple providers \ntreating a person to communicate and better align the treatments and \nprescriptions for a particular patient.\n  Finally, No. 4, the DHIN can enhance privacy within the medical \nhealth care system. The DHIN is a secure system that can only be \naccessed by participating providers and organizations. It contains \naccess controls, regulating who can use the network, and it contains \naudit requirements to ensure there are no breaches in patient privacy.\n  While the DHIN is still growing, it has already helped the patient \ncare delivery system in Delaware. As it moves to include all providers \nin the State and works with other States' information exchanges to \nshare ideas and successes, the DHIN will help lead our country to a \nwidespread adoption of health information technology.\n  The stimulus act contained $19 billion to promote the adoption of \nhealth IT nationwide, and the health reform effort promises to build on \nthis momentum with even more resources. I believe it is essential that \nhealth reform boost the integration of information technology such as \nthat provided by the DHIN throughout the health care system.\n  As I have said many times, it is time to gather our collective will \nand do the right thing during this historic opportunity by passing \nhealth care reform. We must include incentives to expand the \nutilization of health information technology. We can do no less. The \nAmerican people deserve no less.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank Senator Kaufman. A health information network is \ncritical to improving patient care and reducing health care costs.\n  Now I would like to yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Alaska, \nSenator Mark Begich, to discuss customer-driven care.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hagan for allowing me time \nthis morning. I am pleased to join my freshman colleagues to once again \nstate our case for health insurance reform in this country. It is truly \nlong overdue and very much needed.\n  I also wish to make a point. I have listened closely to the comments \nof my colleagues from the other side of the aisle over the last several \nweeks. A few weeks ago, I heard the Senator from North Carolina, Mr. \nBurr, talking on this floor about health reform. He acknowledged that \nwe need to change the health delivery system, which I agree with, but \nthen he said our Democratic ideas won't work. He said one reason is \nbecause government programs don't do enough innovation and wellness and \nthey won't help people make the lifestyle changes needed to get true \nsavings in the health system.\n  Quoting from the Congressional Record, here is what else he said:\n\n       Show me a government plan that pays for prevention, \n     wellness, and chronic disease management, and I will quit \n     coming to the floor and quit talking about the lack of \n     reform.\n\n  Mr. President, I have one. I have a great example of just such a \ngovernment plan that pays for all of those things, almost the whole \nthing, and gets incredible results. It comes from my home State, from \nan Alaska Native program called the Nuka Model of Care. It is based in \nAnchorage at the Southcentral Foundation, a nonprofit health system \nserving about 55,000 Alaska Natives.\n  The Nuka Model was developed about 10 years ago using the wisdom of \nNative leaders. They acted in response to what they saw as their own \nfailing health care system. Like many other health providers in this \ncountry, the foundation recognized an alarming contradiction: As health \ncosts continued to increase, the health status of their patients only \ngot worse. More dollars going to health care only resulted in worse \nhealth outcomes.\n  So they decided to change things. From the ground up, they built a \nsystem of customer-driven health care. That is their term, not mine--\n``customer driven.''\n  ``Nuka'' is a Native word associated with family, and that is \ncertainly the approach. The Nuka model creates teams of health \nproviders--doctors, nurses, medical assistants--to work with each \npatient. It requires doctors to listen to the patients, to really hear \nwhat customers are saying about their lifestyles, their jobs, their \nfamilies, everything that affects their overall health.\n  It makes medical access much easier, guaranteeing that you can see \nyour chosen provider for anything you want--same day. In person, via \nphone or e-mail--whatever is easier for the patient--same-day \nguarantee. Let me repeat that: same-day guarantee.\n  Here is another important point. Physician salaries are based on the \nteam's overall performance. I want to make sure my friend, Senator Burr \nfrom North Carolina, hears this part. The Nuka model is funded almost \nentirely by the Federal Government--half by Indian Health Services and \none-third by Medicaid or Medicare. It works, and it works very well.\n  This chart covers some of the most amazing results since the program \nstarted: a 50-percent drop in urgent care and emergency room visits; a \n53-percent reduction in hospital admissions; a 65-percent drop in the \nneed for expensive specialists; a childhood immunization rate of 93 \npercent, well above the State and national averages; much better \nmanagement of diabetes with 50 percent of patients kept in the \nprediabetes stage instead of worsening into full diabetes; and happy \ncustomers. The overall satisfaction rate among our patients for this \nprogram is 91 percent.\n  The Nuka model has attracted attention from all over the world, as it \nshould. Even as recent as last month, the former Speaker, Newt \nGingrich, recognized this great program.\n  I am sure there are similar government-backed success stories \nthroughout this country. I think I have made my point, and truly my \nremarks are not intended to single out any one Senator. But I will say \nthis: As we debate health insurance reform in this Chamber, let's arm \nourselves with the facts and with open minds. Let's not say no just \nbecause of partisan differences. Let's celebrate examples of innovation \nand excellence that work no matter where they come from, and let's use \nthe successful models to extend good, quality care to millions more \nAmericans.\n  I am proud of the Nuka model in Alaska, of the people who got it \nstarted a decade ago, and of the people who are making it work today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, Senator Begich's comments on customer-\ndriven care is certainly working in Alaska.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Colorado, Senator Michael \nBennet, for his discussion on transitional care.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from North Carolina \nfor organizing this discussion this morning and for the other freshmen \nhere yet again, week after week, to talk about the urgent need for \nhealth care reform in this country.\n  My colleague, Senator Udall from Colorado, did a wonderful job \ntalking about the models we have of transitional care in Colorado, \nwhere we see some providers able to have merely a 3-percent readmission \nrate just because of the way they manage patients, patient-centered \ncare, unlike the way we\n\n[[Page S11135]]\n\ndo it all across the country, which is the reason we are at a 20-\npercent readmission hospital rate in the United States.\n  If we would put in some of these commonsense practices and worry \nabout outcomes more and worry less about how many tests were given, in \nthis case we could reduce the expenditure by $18 billion annually and \nprovide better quality care. It is just one of the many ideas that is \nbubbling up from States all across the country.\n  I wish to spend a couple minutes today talking about the absurd waste \nof time that is caused by our current system of insurance in the United \nStates. We have two examples in Colorado that have recently been \ncovered by the newspapers out there. The first is a story about gender \ndiscrimination when it comes to insurance. It is about a woman in my \nstate, Peggy Robertson of Golden, CO, who was denied coverage because \nshe had what was called a preexisting condition, which was the C-\nsection that she had when she gave birth to her son. The insurance \ncompany said they would not cover her unless she became sterilized.\n  Peggy came and testified about this in the committee, and her story \nhas been repeated by many people across the State of Colorado. But it \ngot the attention of another person in our State named Matt Temme of \nCastle Rock, CO, who wrote a letter to the editor that I almost could \nnot believe when I read it.\n  We followed up with Matt, and it turned out that it was true. Matt \nwas denied coverage because his wife, who is insured--she has her own \ninsurance--was pregnant. Matt is a 40-year-old commercial pilot from \nCastle Rock. He was furloughed from his job at the end of June. His \nwife Wendy is a paralegal, and she is covered through her employer. \nThey have a 6-year-old son.\n  As I mentioned a minute ago, Wendy is pregnant. It was too expensive \nfor Matt and his son to join his wife's plan. Because he was \nfurloughed, he went out shopping for a new plan on the individual \nmarket, which he thought would be easy. He first checked with his \nprevious company's health insurance. He filled out all the paperwork \nfor himself and his son. He is healthy, he is 40 years old, and he is \nnot eligible for coverage because his wife found out she was pregnant. \nHe told the insurance companies: My wife is already covered by another \ninsurer.\n  They said to him: That is true, but if she suffers a fatality while \ngiving birth to her child, that child is going to become a dependent of \nyours and therefore will be on the insurance you buy and therefore we \nare not going to sell it to you.\n  So now Matt had to go out to the market again. They have three plans. \nThey have the plan his wife is on, already covered; they have another \nplan for his 6-year-old son; and now Matt is on a version of a public \noption that we have in Colorado called Cover Colorado.\n  When I read this letter, when we heard this story, when we talked \nwith Matt, it reminded me again of all the stories that I have heard--\nthat all of us have heard--over these many months when we have been \ndiscussing health care about all the wasted evenings and conversations \nand fights that people have over their telephone just to get basic \ninsurance for their families so they can have the kind of stability all \nof us want to have for our kids, for our grandkids, and for our \nfamilies.\n  That is what this insurance reform is about. It is time for us to set \naside the usual politics, the special interests that always have \nprevented us from getting something done, and deliver reform that \ncreates stability for working families all across our country, deliver \nreform that allows us to consume a smaller portion of our gross \ndomestic product than we are today, deliver reform that allows us to \nbegin to put this Federal Government back on a path of fiscal \nstability. It is high time to put this politics aside.\n  I know in this country we can do better than that. In the end, we \nwill do better. Our working families and small businesses will be real \nbeneficiaries of the reform that we pass.\n  I thank the Senator from North Carolina for giving me the opportunity \nto be here this morning. I appreciate her very important leadership on \nthis critical issue.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bennet for his comments on \ntransitional care and certainly the need to make sure no patients are \ndenied insurance coverage for preexisting conditions and in particular \nbecause a wife is pregnant.\n  I yield 5 minutes to myself. I take this opportunity to talk about \nhealth care reform and how it will improve the delivery of health care \nto Americans.\n  One successful delivery system that health care reform will expand \nupon is patient-centered medical homes which were pioneered in my State \nof North Carolina. Since 1998, North Carolina has been implementing an \nenhanced medical home model of care and its Medicaid Program called \nCommunity Care of North Carolina.\n  Under this model, each patient has access to a primary care physician \nwho is responsible for providing comprehensive and preventive care, \nworking in collaboration with nurses, physician specialists, and other \nhealth care professionals.\n  The primary care physician is the go-to doctor and the gatekeeper of \na patient's information. Within each network, patients are linked to a \nprimary care provider to serve as a medical home that provides acute \nand preventive care, manages chronic illness, coordinates speciality \ncare, and provides round-the-clock, on-call assistance. Case managers \nare integral members of the network and work in concert with the \nphysicians to identify and manage care for high-cost, high-risk \npatients.\n  As of May of this year, Community Care of North Carolina was \ncomprised of 14 networks that included more than 3,200 physicians and \ncovered over 913,000 Medicaid patients in North Carolina, accounting \nfor over 67 percent of the State's entire Medicaid population.\n  As an example of the benefits of a program such as this, consider the \nimpact on asthma patients because patients get to see the same doctor \nand get more consistent, coordinated care. Physicians are able to \nquickly recognize a condition such as asthma and can more quickly and \nefficiently determine the most appropriate treatment. The support \nnetwork then educates the patients and their families about the \nmanagement of their disease.\n  Due to the increased likelihood of complications when asthma patients \nget the flu, it is very important that they receive the flu vaccine. \nSince 2004, within the Community Care of North Carolina, there has been \na 112-percent increase in flu shots administered to asthma patients. \nMore than 90 percent of patients are using the most appropriate \nmedications.\n  Between 2003 and 2006, asthma-related hospitalizations were decreased \nby 40 percent, and emergency room visits decreased by 17 percent. That \nsaves all of us dollars.\n  Community Care of North Carolina has improved patient care and saved \nthe State money. An independent analysis by Mercer, which is a \ngovernment consulting group, found that this program saved between $150 \nmillion and $170 million in 2006.\n  A University of North Carolina evaluation of asthma and diabetes \npatients found that it saved $3.3 million for asthma patients and $2.1 \nmillion for diabetic patients between 2000 and 2002.\n  In addition to asthma patients, diabetic patients also had fewer \nhospitalizations, and they visited the primary care doctors more often \ninstead of specialists and had better health outcomes.\n  I would like to tell a story about how access to a medical home has \nhelped someone in North Carolina overcome the challenges of an illness.\n  Donald from Charlotte has type 2 diabetes. This diabetic condition of \nhis went untreated for a long time and, as a result, he began having \nministrokes, had to cut back on his work in landscaping, and he ended \nup in an emergency room. He was referred to a Charlotte-based medical \nhome program called Physicians Reach Out. He now has a primary care \ndoctor who has helped get him on a medication regimen, returning his \nblood sugar to a normal level which allowed him to work full time \nagain. His primary care physician was the key to teaching him how to \nmanage his diabetes. Without his medical home, he said getting his \ncondition under control would have been a ``wild goose chase.''\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee included two \nprovisions in the health care reform bill to\n\n[[Page S11136]]\n\nencourage patient-centered medical homes, such as we have in North \nCarolina. The Secretary of Health and Human Services will create a \nprogram to support the development of medical homes, and then the other \nStates will apply for grants.\n  The bill also provides grants for physician training programs, giving \npriority to those who educate students in these physician training \nprograms that are team-based approaches, including the patient-centered \nmedical home.\n  I have been focused on a reform bill that prevents insurance \ncompanies from turning patients away who have a preexisting condition, \nthat expands coverage, and ensures that if you like your insurance and \nyour doctors, you keep them. This bill actually will reduce our \ndeficit, and that, obviously, has been a requirement of mine all along. \nThis bill also encourages innovation in the delivery of health care to \nAmericans using successful programs, such as the Community Care of \nNorth Carolina and the Physicians Reach Out patient-centered medical \nhome as a model.\n  Mr. President, now I wish to yield 5 minutes to my colleague from New \nMexico, Senator Tom Udall, to talk about a model of community health \nservice delivery.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I thank Senator Hagan very much, and thank \nher for her statement today and leading us on the floor in this \ndiscussion of health care.\n  In my case, I want to talk a little bit about health care delivery \nsystems.\n  First, let me say I know when we talk about a health care delivery \nsystem it is a little bit of a wonky term. Most Americans' eyes \nprobably glaze over when experts, politicians, or pundits describe the \nproblems with our health care delivery system. They don't know what it \nhas to do with their health care experience, their doctors, or their \nlives.\n  The reality is health care delivery systems have everything to do \nwith all of that. These delivery systems determine how Americans \nreceive their care. They dictate how a doctor treats their patients, \nhow long a patient must wait for treatment, how much a hospital charges \nfor its services, and how the medical community is held accountable for \nits mistakes.\n  As we continue working to reform health care, we must take an honest \nlook at our current health care delivery system and ask ourselves some \nbasic questions, questions such as: Do the systems we currently use to \ndeliver health care work? Are we, as patients, businesses, and \ngovernments, getting the best value for our health care dollar? Do \nthese systems encourage efficient, coordinated care?\n  If you ask the experts on this subject, the answer you will likely \nget is a loud and resounding ``no.''\n  The way I look at the role of health care delivery systems is the \nsame way I look at building a house. To build a strong, solid, safe \nhouse, you have to start with a strong, solid, safe foundation. Our \nhealth care delivery systems are the foundation for all of our efforts \nin health care. If that foundation is off center or cracked or built on \nuneven ground, it does not even matter how straight the walls are or \nhow efficient the electrical system is, nothing is going to work right.\n  Right now, the vast majority of health care in America rests on shaky \nfoundations. It is our job to rebuild these foundations before more \nAmericans slip through the cracks. The good news is that across the \ncountry, communities are achieving success with innovative health care \ndelivery programs. We should look at these models as we continue our \nwork here in Washington.\n  There is one example I wish to highlight today. That example comes \nfrom my home State of New Mexico, from a county that makes up the boot \nheel of the southwestern corner. Hidalgo County is one of the most \nrural counties of my State, with a population of 5,000 people. Hidalgo \nfaces the same health care delivery problems as other rural areas. \nThere are not enough doctors. Patients must travel long distances for \ncare and, as a result, there are higher rates of chronic diseases and \nhealth problems that require specialized treatment.\n  To meet these challenges, the Hidalgo County medical community had to \nthink outside the box. What they came up with is the Hidalgo Health \nCommons. It uses four guiding principles in its approach to health \ncare.\n  First, they acknowledge that in rural areas, chronic health \nconditions are worsened by limited access to health providers and are \noften compounded by poverty.\n  Second, to respond to this challenge they established a one-stop shop \nfor medical and social services. At the clinic you can find doctors, \nnurses, and dentists, seek mental health treatment, fill a \nprescription, get Medicaid or Medicare, or apply for public assistance \nsuch as WIC.\n  Third, they work with the community to identify local health \npriorities and then align their services accordingly.\n  Finally, they are a source of local economic and social development \nby creating jobs, serving schools, and offering family support.\n  The health commons model has worked so well that it has grown to \nserve five sites across New Mexico and they are not stopping there. The \nnew Hidalgo initiative, which is still in development, will expand on \nthe success of the health commons. The goal is to enroll all 5,000 \nresidents of Hidalgo County into the health services program.\n  Hidalgo County is just one example of the innovative work going on \nacross the country and it serves as a lesson to all of us that faulty \nfoundations do not fix themselves. They require hard work and ingenuity \nand significant investment.\n  If we are going to fully transform our Nation's ailing health care \nsystem, we must first focus on the foundation. We must first reform our \nhealth care delivery systems.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall. His example of the \ncommunity health service delivery in New Mexico is excellent.\n  Now I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator \nJeanne Shaheen, to talk about reducing overutilization of emergency \ndepartments and reducing hospital readmissions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hagan for organizing the \neffort today and also for her great work on the HELP Committee to \ndevelop a health care reform bill that can be supported by this body.\n  Once again we are here to talk about health care reform and why it is \nso urgently needed. We are at a critical juncture because health care \ncosts are out of control. They are a threat to our families, our small \nbusinesses, our economy and, despite all the money we are spending on \nhealth care, we are not guaranteed better health outcomes. That means \nbecause we are spending money doesn't mean that people are healthier. \nThe truth is, we can control costs and improve quality. We can do this \nby promoting effective delivery models. Senator Udall did a great job \nof talking about what that term means in real language. We can promote \neffective delivery models that emphasize coordination and \nindividualized care.\n  As I have said on a number of occasions, I am proud of the \ninnovations that are changing health care delivery in New Hampshire, my \nhome State. One of those that has been recognized nationally is the \nDartmouth Atlas project, based in Hanover. Because of the work of the \nDartmouth Atlas project, we now know that there are significant \nvariations in the way health care resources are used and how money is \nspent depending on where we live.\n  Right now, providers are rewarded for volume rather than for value. \nThere is a chart here that shows that very clearly. It shows the \ndifference in spending among different regions of the country for \nMedicare patients. As you can see, the areas that are dark red are the \nmost expensive, these areas. The areas that are lightest are the least \nexpensive areas when it comes to cost per Medicare patient--from $5,280 \nto $6,600 in the lowest spending regions all the way up to $8,600 to \n$14,360 per Medicare\n\n[[Page S11137]]\n\npatient in these darkest regions of the country.\n\n  Unfortunately, the sad thing about this research is not the changes \nin cost, but it is the fact that because someone lives in an area where \nthe spending is higher doesn't mean they are going to have better \nhealth outcomes. Put very simply, more costly care does not mean better \ncare. This is a fundamental problem with our health care system. The \nway our health care dollars are being spent right now is analogous to a \nmedical arms race. That is not my term, that is by Dr. Elliott Fisher, \nfrom the Atlas Project. Too often we judge the quality of our \nhospitals, for example, based on a new expansion wing or the latest \nmedical device, and not on comparing the quality of care they provide.\n  Over the past several months, thousands of my constituents have \nexpressed their concerns about our health care system. Last week, Dr. \nJim Kelly, from Hollis, NH, was in my office sharing his concerns and \nfrustrations. Dr. Kelly is a family physician and, like so many of our \nhealth care providers, he is dedicated to doing the best job he can for \nhis patients. However, inefficiencies in our system often work against \nthe best efforts of our providers.\n  Dr. Kelly shared one of those experiences. He talked about one of his \npatients who was a 73-year-old woman with diabetes who came into his \noffice on a Friday morning with a swollen, red, and tender leg. In \naddition to her own illness, she is the sole caretaker for her 79-year-\nold husband who recently had a stroke. Dr. Kelly diagnosed her \ncondition, a relatively common one, as cellulitis, a skin infection \nwhich required IV antibiotics. Dr. Kelly gave her the first dose in his \noffice, but Medicare would not cover her infusion therapy at home. As a \nresult, Dr. Kelly was forced to send her to the local emergency room to \nreceive treatment over the weekend. As a result, she had to bring her \ndisabled husband, whom she couldn't leave at home alone, to the \nemergency room. Both of them were forced to sit in the crowded ER, \nexposing them to more germs and using resources that could be used much \nmore efficiently.\n  Unfortunately, our system does not always facilitate efficient and \ncoordinated care. This is too often true with our most vulnerable \npatients.\n  But there are innovative projects across the country that have \nadapted to meet the needs of these individuals. By providing increased \noutreach and care coordination, one pilot program was able to reduce \nvisits to the emergency room by almost two-thirds, after 2 years of \nparticipation.\n  I recently introduced the REDUCE Act, which is modeled after these \nsuccessful pilots, and which I believe will change the way care is \ndelivered to these high-risk patients with multiple chronic conditions. \nI think that is very important to point out.\n  The REDUCE Act will create demonstration projects in 10 States that \nare modeled off of these approaches that have been successful in places \naround the country. This is the type of delivery system reform that \nimproves quality and reduces costs simultaneously.\n  As I have said many times, the challenge we face is great, but we \nhave the resources and the tools we need to reform our health care \nsystem. We can do this in a fiscally responsible way. By improving the \nway we deliver care, we can maximize efficiency and we can improve \nquality. This is the type of reform all Americans deserve. This is the \ntype of reform we are working on here in the Senate. This is the type \nof reform I hope our colleagues will all support.\n  I thank Senator Hagan and I yield my time back to her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. She has made it \nabundantly clear that by reducing the overutilization of emergency \ndepartments, at the same time reducing hospital admissions, we can \nmaximize efficiencies and improve patient health and health care.\n  I yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Virginia, Senator Mark Warner, \nto talk about delivery system reforms in Virginia.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina \nfor organizing the freshmen one more time to talk about our vision for \nhealth care reform. We invite our colleagues not only on our side of \nthe aisle but our colleagues across the aisle to join us in this \nconversation about how to get health care reform right. I also commend \nmy colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen, on her comments about \nhow we can fix financial incentives in our current health care system. \nI think reforming our delivery system ought to be, clearly, part of any \noverall health care reform we take on.\n  I want to pick up, actually, where Senator Shaheen left off and talk \nabout how we can readjust our financial incentives system in health \ncare. We have them all wrong. We have a health care system right now \nthat rewards bad practices. We have a health care system that rewards \nhospitals for multiple readmissions rather than a low readmission rate. \nWe have a health care system that rewards volume of care rather than \nquality of care. Reforming the financial incentives in our delivery \nsystem has to be a key component of any health care reform going \nforward.\n  I join my colleagues in citing examples of delivery system reforms \nthat are happening now in my own state. I have three examples here from \nthe Commonwealth of Virginia.\n  In 2000, VCU Health System in Richmond, our capital, developed a \nsystem called Virginia Coordinated Care to manage health care services \nfor the uninsured. The uninsured often rely on emergency rooms to be \ntreated for their illnesses and then go back home until they get sick \nagain. There is no continuity of care and oftentimes that uninsured \nperson will end up back on an emergency room doorstep because, outside \nof being treated for the episodic incident, there was no management of \nthat patient's care during that period.\n  What VCU developed was a program that assigned a primary care \nphysician to oversee each uninsured patient's health. The goal was to \nincrease coordination between doctors and hospitals and, as a result, \nincrease accountability, improve quality of care, and lower costs.\n  The Virginia Coordinated Care program started with a few participants \nin 2000; by 2009, there were over 20,000 members. One of the most \nimportant outcomes of the program was a significant drop in emergency \nroom visits by enrolled patients. By increasing continuity of care, \nemergency room visits dropped 14 percent between 2000 and 2005. Costs \nwere reduced for Richmond area hospitals, as well as surrounding \nVirginia hospitals as fewer patients showed up at other emergency \nrooms. By treating the patient earlier in their illness the program \nachieved better quality of care, and better results for the health care \nsystem as a whole.\n  Another example of delivery system reform took place at another end \nof our State, at Sentara Healthcare, located in Norfolk, VA. In 1999, \nSentara studies found that intensive care units that were monitored by \na doctor full time had lower mortality rates and shorter length of \nstays than those that were not. In order to improve quality of care, \nSentara worked with a company called VISICU to install Web-based \ntelevision cameras in each patient's room. With this technology, a \nsingle physician in a central location can follow patients in multiple \nrooms at the same time. Again, this kind of logical approach produced \nmore efficient care at a lower cost. Sentara saw a 25-percent reduction \nin mortality among these patients, a 17-percent reduction in their \nlength of stay, and a 150-percent return on investment in the program.\n  Perhaps the best example is now being modeled by the Carilion Clinic \nin Roanoke, VA. Carilion Clinic is a multispecialty health care \norganization, with more than 600 doctors and 8 health care \norganizations.\n  In 2010, next year, Carilion Clinic will join with Engelberg Center \nfor Health Care Reform at Brookings and the Dartmouth Institute for \nHealth Policy and Clinical Practice to implement a new and innovative \nhealth care model that rewards providers for improving patient outcomes \nwhile also lowering costs. This Accountable Care Organization will \nencourage physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, and the\n\n[[Page S11138]]\n\ngovernment to work together to coordinate care, improve quality, and \nreduce costs. Under this model, providers will assume greater \nresponsibility not only for treating the patient's illness but for the \noverall quality and cost of care to be delivered. They will actually be \nincentivized to take steps to keep patients healthy, while avoiding \ncostly medications and procedures. Additionally, this model will \nencourage, and make it affordable, for doctors to finally practice \npreventive care. Carilion Clinic is doing the right thing: moving away \nfrom the current, and very flawed, fee-for-service system.\n  As long as our health care system--one-sixth of our economy--\ncontinues to reward providers simply based on quantity rather than \nquality of care, we are never going to get health care reform right. By \nincreasing coordination of care, and putting in place smarter financial \nincentives, we can have higher quality care at lower costs. We can \nfocus on the health of patients, rather than the number of procedures. \nChanging our payment mechanisms and restructuring financial incentives \nare a key part of health care reform.\n  I know my freshmen colleagues stand ready to work with our colleagues \non this side of the aisle, and I again invite our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to join us in this effort. Getting it right \nwill lead to improved quality of care, lower costs, and a healthier \nAmerica.\n  I thank our leader today, the Senator from North Carolina, for \ngranting me this time. I look forward to working with Senator Hagan and \nall my colleagues as we move forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank Senator Warner. It is obvious that coordinated \ncare will reduce costs and at the same time provide higher quality for \nour patients.\n  What Senator Warner has discussed is very similar to the patient \ncentered medical homes in North Carolina where we currently cover over \n900,000 Medicaid patients.\n  Finally, I yield 5 minutes of my time to my new colleague from \nMassachusetts, Senator Paul Kirk, to discuss some key national \nindicators.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Carolina. It \nis a privilege to be a member of her class and the class of \ndistinguished colleagues of freshmen, and I commend her as well for her \nleadership in this discussion this morning, adding onto the role the \nfreshman class is playing in advocating for health care reform for the \nAmerican people.\n  I would like to speak this morning about a key national indicators \nsystem.\n  As we know, America is said to lead the world in health innovation. \nIt can create the finest medical devices, the most effective drugs to \ntreat diseases and advanced processes and procedures to care for \npatients. It is this wide range of remarkable innovations that has \nresulted in today's $2.3 trillion health care industry. But despite all \nof our medical achievements and technologies and the private and public \nmoney we spend on health care, we do not lead the world in health \noutcomes.\n  We need to innovate not only in the way we treat patients but in the \nway we create and implement health care policy. For that reason, one of \nthe most promising provisions in the draft health reform measures about \nto come before us is the creation of a key national indicators system.\n  When illness strikes, we expect a health care team to carefully \ncollect information from the patient and then consult the wide range of \ninformation available to them to achieve the appropriate diagnosis and \ntreatment. That careful and complete process should yield the best \npossible course of treatment and recovery.\n  We need the same kind of approach in the creation of wise health care \npolicy. In particular, we need measures to identify what is wrong with \nour current health care system, including what is driving the \nincreasingly high cost of care. Abundant research and reports have \nanalyzed such questions. What is missing is a central, independent \norganization that can analyze all of the research performed by various \norganizations and make that information readily available to Congress, \nto the executive branch, and the American people. That is an \nindispensable part of successful health reform. It will give \ndecisionmakers easier access to all the knowledge available and \neliminate wasteful spending of the hard-earned dollars of American \nfamilies.\n  Senator Kennedy and Senator Enzi, in a strong, bipartisan effort, \nunderstood the need for this vital resource, and they designed a key \nnational indicators system to provide it. It will be a nonpartisan, \nindependent agency with a public-private partnership. It will foster \nbetter relations and relationships between members of the legislative, \nstatistical, and scientific communities and will lead to greater \ntransparency and accountability for spending on national health \nprograms. Without such a resource, we will be at a serious disadvantage \nin fully understanding emerging health risks and in assessing whether \nthe intended result is being achieved or adequate progress is being \nmade on the health care challenges facing us.\n  The key national indicators system will make all its data available \non a newly created, widely accessible Web site in the health care \ncontext. This unprecedented accessibility of data will assist the \npublic in understanding what information was used by politicians \nin creating health care policies. It will enable policymakers to see \nwhether progress is being made in health reform. And it will permit \npractitioners and researchers to use the information for the greater \nbenefit of patients and consumers of health and medical care.\n\n  Significant progress in this area has already been accomplished. Over \nthe years, the Institute of Medicine has been able to identify five \ndrivers of health care quality and costs: first, health outcomes; \nsecond, health-related behaviors; third, health system performance; \nfourth, social and physical environment; and fifth, demographic \ndisparities. The institute has recommended 20 specific indicators for \nmeasuring these five drivers of health care quality and cost. These \nindicators were carefully selected to reflect both the overall health \nof the Nation and the efficiency and effectiveness of our health care \nindustry. However, the institute lacks an implementation system that \ncan use these indicators effectively to guide future policy and \npractice. That is the goal and that is the mission of the new agency, \nthe key national indicators system, we propose.\n  Here is one example of how this legislation will improve our health \ncare system. A recent study conducted by the Harvard School of Public \nHealth found that using a simple checklist during surgical procedures \nresulted in a one-third reduction of complications from that surgery. \nReports such as these are made public, but you have to know where to \nlook in order to access this information. The key national indicators \nsystem will take these reports, compile them, disseminate them, and \nmake them available to the public. So any time a bill is being \ndeveloped, a congressional office can go to this Web site and see all \nof the research that has been conducted on the topic in order to make \neconomically sound decisions for the American people.\n  Currently, Congress and the executive branch continue to follow old \nhabits. We tend to reinvent the wheel with every major new bill that is \nintroduced. That approach leads to wasted time, wasted energy, and \nwasted money. Old habits are not good enough to achieve tomorrow's \ngoals. By developing this indicator system, a process will be in place \nso that the efficiency and effectiveness of government spending on \nshort-, medium-, and long-term problems can be determined quickly and \nin a fiscally responsible manner.\n  Our current system is unsustainable. It creates unnecessary confusion \nwhen Americans can least afford it. We need a system that will provide \ninsight, foresight, transparency, and accountability. We will not be \ndoing our job for the American people if we allow their money to be \nspent without assessing the cost-effectiveness of the various programs \nbeing developed.\n  By creating the key national indicators system, we can reassure all \nAmericans that we did our required due diligence and that our health \ncare reform bill will truly work for them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kirk. I thank him for his \ncomments and the discussion on the transparency and openness of the new \nkey national indicators system. I think\n\n[[Page S11139]]\n\nthis is critically important so that our public can see the progress we \nare making in improving health outcomes, healthy behavior, and cost-\neffectiveness.\n  In this last hour, we have heard from many of our new freshman \ncolleagues about the successful efforts to reform the way we deliver \nhealth care in our country. I thank my colleagues for sharing those \nideas with us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11139-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11139-S11141]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. I, too, would like to talk about health care. As we speak \nhere in the Senate, the House is preparing to debate and reportedly \nvote by late this week or early next week on a massive new health care \nbill that will dramatically expand the size of our government, \ndramatically increase taxes, and establish a government-controlled \ninsurance system.\n  While in the Senate we are not yet clearly aware of what the bill we \nwill be debating is because it is still being crafted behind closed \ndoors, we have an idea, and we are pretty sure some of the elements \nthat are going to be included in it are the same elements we debated in \nthe Finance Committee and the HELP Committee as those committees worked \non their product here. In that context, we expect we will see also here \nin the Senate a massive new expansion of the size of government, up to \n$1 trillion or more. If it is anything like what the Finance Committee \nbill was, we will see taxes increased on the American public by over \n$500 billion, we will see cuts in Medicare, which we discussed \nyesterday, of over $400 billion, and a significant expansion of the \ncontrol of the Federal Government over our health care economy. Today, \nI want to focus on just the tax piece of this situation.\n  One of the most common provisions we have seen here in the Senate \nthat we clearly expect will be in the final bill is the proposed 40-\npercent excise tax on high-cost or ``Cadillac'' health care plans. This \nhas been defined as health care plans that are valued at more than \n$8,000 for an individual or valued at more than $21,000 for a family.\n  It is important to note these thresholds are not indexed to the \nincreasing cost of health care spending but instead are indexed to \ninflation plus 1, which means that over time this will, similar to the \nalternative minimum tax, eat further and further into the American \npublic's health care plans, which will then be taxed.\n  The Joint Tax Committee has scored this tax to generate $201 billion \nof revenue to pay for that portion, $201 billion of this new Federal \nspending proposal. Many think that because it is called an excise tax \non health care plans, it is not going to impact them. They will be \nsurprised to learn that in my questioning of the Joint Tax Committee, \nwe were told the vast majority of this $201 billion tax is expected to \nbe collected directly from the middle class, individuals who will be \npaying more income and payroll taxes.\n  Let's figure out how that can be. It turns out that as we analyze the \nway this tax is going to work, employers that will face a 40-percent \nexcise tax on the health care they provide to their employees will \nbegin to adjust the value of their health care plans so they avoid the \ntax. As they do so, they will reduce the health care they are providing \nto their employees and, presumably--and we expect they will--increase \nthe wages they are paying to their employees so their employees' net \ncompensation is not changed. The result of that, though, is that since \nthe health care portion of the compensation is not taxed and the income \nportion of an employee's compensation is taxed, the employee will \nactually pay higher taxes, both on the income and on the payroll tax \nlevel.\n  Maybe a real-world example will demonstrate. In my State of Idaho, \nthe Census Bureau says the median household income is about $55,000 per \nyear. In this case, let's take an example of a single woman who \ncurrently earns $60,000 per year in annual compensation from her \nemployer. We have an example represented by this chart. Let's assume \nshe has a $10,000 valued health policy. Her total compensation package \nfrom her employer is going to be $60,000-$50,000 in wages and $10,000 \nin employer-provided health care benefits. She is taxed on $50,000 and \ngets the $10,000 health care benefit without taxation. What will happen \nin the bill, as I have indicated, is this $10,000 health care policy \nwill be subject to a 40-percent excise tax. In order to avoid that \nexcise tax, the company will simply react by reducing her health care \npolicy to below $8,000 and increase her income.\n  Let's put up another chart to see what the likely reaction of the \nemployer will be: Not to pay the insurance fee, as many here are \nsaying, but simply to skip that and direct her tax dollars to the \nFederal Government. If this new high-cost plan is to be enacted, the \ntheory is her employer will make the adjustments to change her overall \ncompensation package in a way that she ends up with higher wages.\n  Let's put the next chart up to show how this would work. Under this \nproposal, her health care benefits are going to go down. Let's assume \nthe company reduces her health care benefits from $10,000 in value to \n$6,000 in value and gives her the extra $4,000 in income. Her health \ncare benefits will go down. She will pay more taxes because she now has \n$4,000 more of her package that is subject to compensation. The net \nvalue of her compensation will go down because of increased taxes. The \nresult is, we are going to see millions of Americans pay this excise \ntax squarely in contravention of the President's promise that no \nindividuals who make less than $200,000 will pay income taxes or \npayroll taxes or, in the President's words, ``any other kind of \ntaxes.''\n  So we are clear on this, the estimates are that 84 percent of this \ntax is going to be paid by those who are earning less than $200,000 per \nyear. As a matter of fact, if we look at those who make less than \n$50,000 a year, we expect somewhere in the neighborhood of 8 million \nAmericans will fall into this category. If we look at the number who \nmake less than $200,000 per year, we expect that number will be above \n25 million Americans who will be paying more taxes, both payroll and \nincome taxes, and receiving less health care benefits from their \nemployer.\n  The net result is, the President's promise that one can keep their \nhealth care if they like it will not be honored because of this \nprovision. People will see, necessarily, that their employers will \nbegin reducing health care packages to make them fit the tax structure \nthis bill will create.\n  Secondly, there is the President's promise that if you make less than \n$200,000 as an individual or $250,000 as a family, you will pay no \ntaxes under this proposal. As we have seen with this one example--and \nthere are a number of other examples in the proposal being developed--\nin this one example of $201 billion worth of the new taxes in the bill, \nthose making less than $200,000 will pay over 80 percent of it, and it \nwill come directly out of their pockets and their compensation package \nwith their employer.\n  In the time I have remaining, I wish to focus on one additional \nelement. There is also a proposal to increase the bar for deductions of \nhealth care expenses. In other words, those who deduct their expenses \nand itemize their deductions can today deduct that portion of their \nincome over 7.5 percent of their income that is represented by their \nhealth care expenses. This bill will increase that to 10 percent and \ngenerate over $15 billion of additional taxes in that format. Who is \nthe most likely to pay these taxes? People who have relatively low \nhealth care costs are going to end up not meeting that 7.5-percent \nthreshold, now to be brought to 10 percent, and probably will not be \nable to benefit from the deductibility of their health care. But those \nwho face medical crises, those who have health care expenses that \nexceed the value of 10 percent, will see their deductibility reduced \nagain by these proposals. The net result: Millions of Americans making \nless than $200,000 a year will pay more taxes.\n  I encourage the Senate, as we move forward in the debate, to \nrecognize that the tax provisions contained in it are squarely going to \nhit those in the middle class.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Iowa.\n\n[[Page S11140]]\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am sorry the Presiding Officer, the \nSenator from Virginia, has to listen to me twice on the same subject.\n  When I am referring to a bill, I am referring to the 2,000-page House \nbill.\n  Small business is very vital to the health of our economy. The \nPresident and I agree that 70 percent of new private sector jobs are \ncreated by small business. Small business is the employment machine of \nthe American economy. However, where the President and I differ is, I \nbelieve small business taxes should be lowered, not raised, to get our \neconomy back on track. You will hear from my discussion, this 2,000-\npage bill raises taxes on small business.\n  The President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nproposed increasing the top marginal tax rates from 35 percent to 39.6 \npercent, respectively. We can see that on the chart under the proposed \nObama budget, 39.6 percent is where they would raise them. They have \nalso proposed increasing the tax rates on capital gains and dividends \nto 20 percent and providing for an estate tax rate as high as 45 \npercent and an exemption of that estate tax of $3.5 million. Also, the \nPresident and congressional Democrats have called for fully reinstating \nthe personal exemption phase-out. I will refer to the personal \nexemption phase-out as PEP. They would do that for those making more \nthan $200,000 a year. In addition, they have called for fully \nreinstating the limitation on itemized deductions, which is known as \nPease after a former Congressman Pease of Ohio, for those making also \nmore than $200,000.\n\n  Under the 2001 tax law, PEPs and Pease are scheduled to be completely \nphased out in 2010. That means the tax rate for current 35-percent-rate \ntaxpayers would go up, as we can see on the chart, to 41 percent. For \nthe vast majority of people who earn less than $200,000, raising taxes \non high earners might not sound so bad. However, this means many small \nbusinesses will be hit with a higher tax bill. From the standpoint of \nit being where they create 70 percent of the new jobs, that is bad not \nonly for those taxpayers, that is bad for the entire economy.\n  As if this was not bad enough for small business, the tax increases I \nhave already talked about, the House Democrats, in this 2,000-page \nhealth care reform bill, have proposed a new surtax of 5.4 percent. \nWith this small business surtax, a family of four in the top bracket \nwill pay a marginal tax rate of 46.4 percent by the year 2011. So we go \nfrom current law of 35 percent to automatically, if Congress doesn't \nintervene, 39.6 percent; and then eliminate the PEPs and Pease, 41 \npercent; and then do what the House Democrats want to do, 46.4 percent, \na marginal tax rate that is very high and very negative to employment \nby small business.\n  This tax change would result, cumulatively, in an increase of \nmarginal tax rates of 33 percent, a 33-percent increase over what taxes \npeople pay right now.\n  Owners of the many small businesses, whether regular--which could be \nso-called C corporations--or other entities that receive dividends or \nrealize capital gains, would face a 25-percent rate increase under this \nHouse bill. So we have a 15-percent capital gains rate today on \ndividends going up almost 70 percent by January 1, 2011.\n  Campaign promises are pretty important. Candidate Obama pledged on \nthe campaign trail that:\n\n       Everyone in America--everyone--will pay lower taxes than \n     they would under rates Bill Clinton had in the 1990s.\n\n  That is quite a promise. That is good for business, if it is lower \nthan what Bill Clinton had. The small business surtax proposed by House \nDemocrats, however, violates President Obama's pledge he made as a \ncandidate. Therefore, I want Members to know I stand with President \nObama in opposing the small business surtax proposed by House Democrats \nin this bill, this 2,000-page bill.\n  According to the National Federation of Independent Businesses--they \nmade a survey--their data shows that 50 percent of the owners of small \nbusinesses that employ 20 to 249 workers would fall into the top \nbracket. The red bar shows 50 percent of all small employers fall into \nthat bracket. According to the Small Business Administration, about \ntwo-thirds of the Nation's small business workers are employed by small \nbusinesses with 20 to 500 employees.\n\n  Do we want to raise taxes on these small businesses that create new \njobs and employ two-thirds of all small business workers?\n  In his radio address a few months ago, the President noted small \nbusinesses are hurting. They are hurting because we are helping Wall \nStreet, but we are not helping Main Street with all the things we are \ndoing in Congress. Of course, there is no argument from this side of \nthe aisle on that point.\n  President Obama recognized in that speech the credit crunch on small \nbusinesses continues, despite hundreds of billions in bailout money to \nbig banks. With these small businesses already suffering from the \ncredit crunch, do we want to think it is wise to hit them with a double \nwhammy of a 33-percent increase in their marginal tax rate?\n  Just yesterday, we received data from the nonpartisan official \ncongressional tax scorekeepers, the Joint Committee on Taxation, that \nsaid $1 out of every $3 raised by the massive $461 billion House \nsurtax--and that is in this 2,000-page bill--would come from small \nbusinesses. That is a conservative, a very conservative estimate \nbecause other kinds of income that these business owners receive, such \nas capital gains and dividends, are not included in that figure.\n  If the proponents of the marginal rate increase on small business \nowners agree that a 33-percent tax increase for half--half--the small \nbusinesses that employ two-thirds of all small business workers is not \nwise, then they should either oppose these tax increases or present \ndata that shows different results.\n  This House bill of 2,000 pages and the surtax included in it piles on \nthe heavy taxes small businesses will face. In a time when many \nbusinesses are struggling to stay afloat, does it make sense to impose \nan additional burden on them by raising their taxes? Odds are, they \nwill cut spending. In other words, the small businesses will cut \nspending. They will cancel orders for new equipment, cut health \ninsurance for their employees, stop hiring, and lay off people.\n  Instead of seeking to raise taxes on those who create jobs in our \neconomy, our policies need to focus on reducing excessive tax and \nregulatory barriers that stand in the way of small businesses and the \nprivate sector making investments, expanding production, and creating \nsustainable jobs--creating sustainable jobs, which is what I refer to \nas small business being the job-creating miracle of our economy.\n  So I want you to know, regardless of this 2,000-page House bill, with \nthese big tax increases in it, I will continue to fight to prevent a \ndramatic tax increase on our Nation's job engine, the small businesses \nof America.\n  I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will follow \naccordingly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, backing up some of the figures I used in \nmy speech, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                  Joint Committee on Taxation,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, November 3, 2009.\n\n                               Memorandum\n\n     To: Mark Prater, Nick Wyatt, and Jim Lyons\n     From: Tom Barthold\n     Subject: Revenue Estimate\n       This memorandum is in response to your request of October \n     30, 2009, for an estimate of the percentage of revenue raised \n     from the 5.4-percent AGI surtax included in the ``Affordable \n     Health Care for America Act'' attributable to business \n     income.\n       For purposes of this analysis, business income consists of \n     income from sole proprietorships (Schedule C); farm income \n     (Schedule F); and income from rental real estate, royalties, \n     partnerships, subchapter S corporations, estates and trusts, \n     and real estate mortgage investment conduits (Schedule E), as \n     would be reported on lines 12, 17, and 18 of the 2008 Form \n     1040. We do not count as ``business income'' income from \n     interest, dividends, or capital gains that may flow through \n     certain pass-through entities but which is reported elsewhere \n     on an individual's return.\n       Under the ``Affordable Health Care for America Act,'' a \n     5.4-percent surtax would be imposed on adjusted gross income \n     (``AGI'') in excess of $500,000 ($1,000,000 in the case of a \n     married taxpayer filing a joint return). For purposes of \n     responding to your request, we have assumed that net positive \n     business income is ``stacked'' last relative to the other\n\n[[Page S11141]]\n\n     income components of AGI. For example, a married taxpayer \n     filing jointly with $2 million of AGI including $500,000 of \n     net business income would have one-half of the taxpayer's \n     $54,000 surtax liability under the ``Affordable Health Care \n     for America Act'' attributed to the taxpayer's net business \n     income.\n       We estimate that one-third of the $460.5 billion estimated \n     to be raised in fiscal years 2011-2019 from the 5.4-percent \n     AGI surtax under the ``Affordable Health Care for America \n     Act'' is attributed to business income.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY.

The Senator from Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11141-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11141-S11142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  START TREATY INSPECTIONS LEGISLATION\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to speak on S. 2727, the START I \nTreaty Inspections and Monitoring Protocol Continuation Act of 2009, \nwhich I introduced yesterday.\n  This bill provides authority that would allow the President of the \nUnited States to extend, on a reciprocal basis, privileges and \nimmunities to Russian arms inspection teams that may come to the United \nStates to carry out inspections permitted under the Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty or START I.\n  This bill is necessary because, on December 5--1 month from today--\nthe START I treaty will expire. This treaty, signed in 1991, is obscure \nto many in the Senate. Only 26 current Senators were serving at the \ntime we voted on the resolution of ratification in October 1992. But \nthe START I treaty has been vitally important to arms control efforts \nup to the present day because it contains a comprehensive verification \nregime that undergirds every existing United States-Russian treaty that \ndeals with strategic arms control.\n  It is essential to understand that a successful arms control regime \ndepends on much more than mutual agreement on the numbers of weapons to \nbe eliminated. Arms control agreements also must provide for \nverification measures, including seemingly mundane details, such as \ndelineating the privileges and responsibilities of verification teams \noperating in each other's countries, as well as the procedures for \nconducting those inspections.\n  These details require legal authorization that minimizes disputes and \nreinforces reciprocal expectations of how the verification regime will \nfunction. If the legal authorization for strategic arms control \nverification lapses, as it will in 1 month, we will be creating \nunnecessary risks for the national security of the United States and \nour working relationship with Russia.\n  It had been my hope that the previous and current administrations \nwould have made substantially more progress in ensuring the continuity \nof the START I verification system so the legal authorities I am \nproposing would not be necessary. But we have reached the point where \nboth the United States and Russia must take steps to ensure the \ncontinuity of verification mechanisms.\n  In 2002, the Senate considered the Moscow Treaty governing strategic \nnuclear forces. That treaty contained no verification mechanisms. \nInstead, it relied on the verification regime established in the START \nI treaty. During Senate consideration of the Moscow Treaty, I asked \nSecretary of State Colin Powell and Secretary of Defense Donald \nRumsfeld about the apparent gap in verification that could occur, given \nthat the Moscow Treaty extends to 2012, while the START I verification \nprovisions were set to expire on December 5, 2009, this year.\n  Secretary Powell stated:\n\n       It did not seem to be something that was pressing at the \n     moment.\n\n  He said that during negotiations on the Moscow Treaty, consideration \nwas given to extending the START verification regime past 2009 in a \nseparate negotiation or that the transparency measures under the Moscow \nTreaty could be maximized in some way to provide for enhanced \nverification. But Secretary Powell said, in 2002, that we had ``some 7 \nyears to find an answer to that question.''\n  Likewise, Secretary Rumsfeld was questioned about the verification \ngap created by the 2009 expiration of START. He stated:\n\n       There is [a gap], from 2009 to 2012, exactly. But between \n     now and 2009 . . . there is plenty of time to sort through \n     what we will do thereafter. . . .Will we be able to do \n     something that is better than the START treaty? I hope so. Do \n     we have a number of years that we can work on that? Yes.\n\n  I was pleased to play a role in securing ratification of the Moscow \nTreaty on March 6, 2003. But, at that time Senators were led to \nunderstand the Bush administration would begin work with Russia on \ncodifying a verification regime under the Moscow Treaty, either by \ncontinuing the START verification regime past 2009 or through other \nmeasures. Neither was accomplished.\n  The START treaty itself provides that the parties must meet to extend \nthe treaty ``no later than one year before the expiration of the 15-\nyear period'' of its duration. In 2008, we witnessed the conflict in \nGeorgia. December 5, 2008, was the date by which the United States and \nRussia would have to meet to satisfy the treaty's requirements. Many \nworried that the atmosphere created by the Georgia situation would \nprevent the United States and Russia from conducting such a meeting. \nBut to the Bush administration's credit, a meeting was held that \nprovided us the possibility of extending the treaty. But the clock kept \nticking.\n  I noted during Secretary Clinton's confirmation hearings, on January \n13, 2009, it was vital that the START treaty be renewed. At that time, \nshe assured the committee that ``we will have a very strong commitment \nto the START Treaty negotiation.'' I do not doubt that commitment. I am \nhopeful the capable negotiators we have deployed to Geneva will achieve \na new treaty in the remaining 30 days before expiration. But even if \nthat happens, the time required for a thorough Senate consideration of \nthe treaty ensures that it will not be ratified before START I expires.\n  At the core of the START treaty rests its verification regime--a \nsystem of data exchanges and more than 80 different types of \nnotifications covering movement, changes in status, conversion, \nelimination, testing, and technical characteristics of new and existing \nstrategic offensive arms. This data is further verified through an \ninspection regime. The START I treaty inspection protocol permits no \nless than 12 different types of inspections pursuant to the treaty.\n  According to a fact sheet released by the Department of State in July \n2009, the United States has conducted more than 600 START inspections \nin Belarus, Kazakhstan, Russia, and Ukraine. Russia has conducted more \nthan 400 inspections in the United States. These intrusive, onsite \ninspections permit the United States to verify the kinds and types of \nRussian weapons being deployed, as well as to examine modified versions \nof Russia's weapons. It is this ability, in addition to our own \nnational technical means, that gives us the capabilities and confidence \nto ensure effective verification of the treaty.\n  Some skeptics have pointed out Russia may not be in total compliance \nwith its obligations under START. Others have expressed opposition to \nthe START treaty on the basis that no arms control agreement is 100-\npercent verifiable. But such concerns fail to appreciate how much \ninformation is provided through the exchanges of data mandated by the \ntreaty, onsite inspections, and national technical means. Our \nexperiences, over many years, have proven the effectiveness of the \ntreaty's verification provisions and served to build a basis for \nconfidence between the two countries when doubts arose. The bottom line \nis, the United States is far safer as a result of these 600 START \ninspections than we would be without them.\n  Testifying before the Foreign Relations Committee on the INF Treaty \nin 1988, Paul Nitze provided the definition of ``effective \nverification.'' He stated:\n\n       What do we mean by effective verification? We mean that we \n     want to be sure that, if the other side moves beyond the \n     limits of the Treaty in any militarily significant way, we \n     would be able to detect such a violation in time to respond \n     effectively and thereby deny the other side the benefit of \n     the violation.\n\n  In a similar vein, Secretary of Defense Bob Gates testified in 1992, \nwhen he was Director of Central Intelligence, that the START treaty was \neffectively verifiable and that the data it provides would give us the \nability to detect militarily significant cheating.\n  The Senate has repeatedly expressed confidence in the START I \nverification procedures. It approved the START I treaty in 1992, by a \nvote of 93 to 6. In\n\n[[Page S11142]]\n\n1996, it approved the START II treaty, which relied on the START I \nverification regime, by a vote of 87 to 4. Likewise, the Moscow Treaty \nwas approved by a vote of 95 to 0.\n  The current administration has employed a capable team in Geneva. \nJust last week, National Security Adviser Jim Jones went to Moscow to \nunderscore the importance of achieving agreement on a successor to the \nSTART treaty. The administration has publicly stated it seeks a new \ntreaty that will ``combine the predictability of START and the \nflexibility of the Moscow Treaty, but at lower numbers of delivery \nvehicles and their associated warheads.''\n  This predictability stems directly from START's verifiability.\n  So far, most of the public discussion surrounding a potential \nsuccessor agreement has focused on further reductions in strategic \nnuclear weapons. Scant attention has been paid to the verification \narrangements for such a follow-on agreement. Informally, we understand \nthat we will yet again be relying on START's verification regime in the \nnew agreement. For me, this will be the key determinant in assessing \nwhether a follow-on agreement that comes before the Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the Senate furthers the national interest.\n  For the moment, we know only the outlines of such an agreement. What \nis certain is that after December 5, no legally binding treaty will \nexist that provides for onsite inspections.\n  My bill is not a substitute for a treaty, but without it, it is \nunclear how we can permit and by extension carry out any inspection \nactivities. This might not appear troubling to some, but allowing a \nbreak in verification is not in the interests of the United States or \nRussia. Such a break could amplify suspicions or even complicate the \nconclusion of the START successor agreement.\n  I believe it is incumbent upon the United States and Russia to \nmaintain mutual confidence and preserve a proven verification regime \nbetween December 5 and the entry into force of a new agreement. If we \nare to do so, the legal tools that are contained in the bill I have \nintroduced are essential. There is nothing in my bill that requires the \nadministration to admit Russian inspection teams in the absence of \nreciprocity by Moscow, nor does the bill expand verification beyond \nthose already conducted under the START protocol. The authorities in \nthe bill would terminate on June 5, 2010, or on the date of entry into \nforce of a successor agreement to the START treaty.\n  We must ensure that needed verification tools will exist in the \nperiod between START's expiration and entry into force of a new treaty. \nI am hopeful that Congress will take action on S. 2727 in the near \nfuture and that both the Obama administration and the Russian \nGovernment will take steps to maintain inspection until ratification of \na START successor agreement is completed.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11142-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11142-S11144]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I stand today to highlight the tax \nhammer, as I would describe it, that is being brought down on the \nAmerican people relative to the health care bills that are making their \nway to the floor of the Senate and literally are about to be debated on \nthe House side.\n  In the Finance Committee bill, there are over $500 billion in \nadditional taxes and fees and fines and penalties. In the House bill, \nthere are over $750 billion in new taxes, et cetera. If you shrug your \nshoulders thinking: Well, that is a tax on those wealthy people; I \ndon't have anything to worry about; I am not one of them--you are \nmissing something. Actually, nothing could be further from the truth.\n  In my judgment, these taxes will stifle small business. They are \ngoing to shock families who think there is no way their modest income \ncould possibly be taxed more by the Federal Government.\n  The House bill, let me start there. The first tax is a 5.4-percent \nsurtax on what are referred to as the high-income earners. It raises \ntaxes by about $460 billion. This is a gigantic tax increase. But \nsupporters of it make the case that, again, this is the rich people, \ncreating the feeling that somehow you don't have to worry about that if \nyou are not making a lot of money. But what they don't want to \nacknowledge is that this is a tax on business and small businesses. In \nfact, I would suggest if you wanted to be fair in this debate, you \nwouldn't call it the millionaire tax; you would call it by the proper \nname--the small business tax.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation released a letter yesterday. It found \nthat one-third of the tax--one-third of the tax--will be from business \nincome. The Wall Street Journal has said this recently, and I am \nquoting:\n\n       The burden will mostly fall on small businesses that have \n     organized as Subchapter S or limited liability corporations, \n     since the truly wealthy won't have any difficulty sheltering \n     their incomes.\n\n  In the United States, there are over 6 million small businesses. Last \ncount, the last available information I could get my hands on, there \nwere over 41,000 small employers in my home State of Nebraska. I have \nwalked through many of these small businesses. I have visited with the \npeople who are trying to keep these businesses going, and they are \nfacing challenges to make the payroll.\n  Many of these small businesses exist in small communities in my \nState, and their employees are not just faceless people, people without \nnames. These are people with whom they went to high school. These are \npeople with whom they worship on Sunday, they see at the grocery store. \nOur small businesses don't want to lay off these people.\n  Now, what would a 5.4-percent tax do to their bottom line, to their \nemployees, to any potential of hiring in the future, to the communities \nthey support? Well, one can see the impact it will have.\n  Shawne McGibbon, a former Small Business Administration official, \nsaid it very well and, again, I am quoting:\n\n       Nebraska depends on small businesses for jobs and economic \n     growth. During this time of financial stress and economic \n     instability, policymakers need to remember that the State's \n     small businesses provide the economic base for families and \n     communities.\n\n  Maybe to some from big cities or States that are mostly urban, the \nloss of 50 jobs is not a big deal. I can tell my colleagues it is a big \ndeal to me. It is a big deal to my State. Fifty jobs in a community of \n1,000 people is absolutely devastating. Those paychecks no longer spent \non Main Street can literally bring Main Street to its knees.\n  Making matters worse, this tax is not indexed for inflation, so what \ncan we predict? What is the most certain thing we can predict about \nthis tax? It is going to have the AMT problem all over again. Each year \nit is going to creep down, every year capturing more and more people in \nthe middle class.\n  The second tax I wish to talk about today is the 8-percent penalty on \nemployers who don't offer insurance. Eight percent of their payroll or \npay, at least 72.5 percent of workers' premiums, that is what they are \nfaced with. Again, no matter how one sugarcoats it, this is going to \ncut into wages. For those who pay the 8 percent, that is going to total \n$135 billion more in taxes taken out of our economy.\n  The Wall Street Journal, again, I think said it very well recently:\n\n       Such ``play or pay'' taxes always become ``pay or pay'' and \n     will rise over time, with severe consequences for hiring, job \n     creation, and ultimately growth.\n\n  I look over there at the House and they sure seem very determined to \nthrottle the backbone of our economy--our small businesses. I will just \ntell them as somebody who has represented my great State as a Governor \nand now as a Senator: You take those jobs out of small communities and \nyou will bring those small communities to their knees.\n\n  I pay attention to the wisdom conveyed back home. That is why we do \nour townhall meetings and we walk in parades and we do everything we \ncan to listen to the people.\n  A constituent from Pierce, NE, a small community, a great community \nin our State, said it very well:\n\n       With my husband self-employed, around 30 percent of our \n     income is required to pay income taxes. If these income taxes \n     weren't so high, we would be able to afford and choose our \n     own insurance coverage. More taxes for public health care is \n     not the answer.\n\n\n[[Page S11143]]\n\n\n  I wish to reference the Senate bill and a third tax--the penalty tax \non individuals without insurance. It provides that if you don't have a \ngovernment-approved health plan, you will pay a penalty of $750 for \nsingles and $1,500 for married couples. The Congressional Budget Office \nhas analyzed this penalty. Almost half of those paying the penalty tax \nwould be between 100 and 300 percent of the poverty level. In some \nStates, these good folks qualify for government assistance programs. So \nwe are going to tax them or penalize them and then give them subsidies. \nBoy, only here could somebody make an argument that is rational. It \nmakes no sense to the people back home.\n  Listen to this: A family of four earning between $23,000 and $68,000 \nin 2013 would be saddled with the new tax. We are literally talking \nabout taxing not just the middle class but even below that level.\n  I remember a pledge being made. Last year, President Obama said:\n\n       No one making less than $250,000 a year will see any form \n     of tax increase.\n\n  Yet a family of four earning $25,000 will be hit with a tax within a \nfew years. Boy, that is a long way away--$25,000 from $250,000.\n  Nebraskans believe they can make better decisions about their own \nhealth care than the Federal Government. Let me repeat that. Nebraskans \nbelieve they can make better decisions about their own health care for \nthemselves and their families than can the Federal Government. I stand \nhere today to tell my colleagues I agree with them.\n  A constituent from Kearney, NE, said:\n\n       Is there anything I can do to take a stand against what I \n     consider a huge tax burden and a loss of freedoms?\n\n  The individual mandate--just one more example of government intrusion \ninto people's lives.\n  I have covered three of the tax hikes pervasive in the bills, but it \nis the tip of the iceberg. There are new taxes, penalties, and fees as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  There is a very fitting quote from John Marshall. He said: ``The \npower to tax is the power to destroy.'' The power to tax is the power \nto destroy.\n  As the health care debate continues, all of us should remember Chief \nJustice Marshall's wise words. Make no mistake about it. These various \nbills raise taxes and put burdens upon the American people at a \nbreathtaking pace. Don't be fooled that this is all about taxing the \nrich people and the millionaires. This is really about taxing and \ntaking from the American people, and Americans are seeing the truth.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time remains on the Republican \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. Will you let me know when 3 \nminutes remain?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the President.\n  Mr. President, we have a lot of unusual things happening in the \nSenate, the Congress, and the world today, but apparently we are about \nto be presented with a rare opportunity that very few Senators ever \nhave a chance to vote on. The Democratic congressional health care bill \nwill present Senators--it is still being written from behind closed \ndoors, but from what we can tell from the other bills--with an \nopportunity to vote for one-half trillion dollars in Medicare cuts and \n$900 billion-plus in new taxes at the same time. It is very rare that \nany Senator has a chance to vote for Medicare cuts that big and new \ntaxes that big all at once.\n  It is not an opportunity that many, if any, Republicans will take \nadvantage of, but that is the proposal that is coming. It caused my \ncolleague from Tennessee to say on the Senate floor yesterday that if \nRepublicans were to propose the same thing--a one-half trillion dollars \ncut in Medicare, a 60-percent increase in premium costs, which is the \nestimated increase to Tennesseans who have insurance premiums, \naccording to Senator Corker, plus taxes of $900 billion when fully \nimplemented, it wouldn't get a single Democratic vote. I think Senator \nCorker is probably right about that.\n  Whenever we say this, this brings a deep concern from the other side \nof the aisle. The Senator from Ohio came to the Senate floor and \nengaged in a colloquy with the assistant Democratic leader yesterday \nafter I left the floor and said:\n\n       Imagine this, the Republican Senator from Tennessee is \n     saying that Democrats are about to cut Medicare. Why would \n     they say that? It makes me incredulous to hear the Senator \n     say that Democrats are going to cut Medicare and we are going \n     to use Medicare cuts to pay for health care reform.\n\n  The only reason we and everybody else who reads their bill is saying \nthat is because it is true. The proposal is to cut grandma's Medicare \nand spend it on their proposal, to cut nearly one-half trillion dollars \nin Medicare spending and not spend it on making Medicare solvent.\n  We know the Medicare trustees have said the program is going to go \nbroke in 2015 to 2017, yet we are going to spend that money on a new \ngovernment program into which many Americans who now have employer-\nbased insurance will find their way. It is not Republicans who are \nscaring seniors about Medicare cuts; it is the Democratic health care \nbills that are scaring seniors about Medicare cuts. They have a right \nto be concerned.\n  Just in case anybody who might be listening thinks we are making this \nup on the Republican side of the aisle, I brought with me a few \narticles from reputable sources that describe the Democratic health \ncare proposals and their proposed Medicare cuts.\n  Here is the New York Times on September 24, an article by Robert \nPear, who writes about this subject regularly. It says:\n\n       To help offset the cost of covering the uninsured, the \n     Senate and House bills would squeeze roughly $400 billion to \n     $500 billion out of the projected growth in Medicare over 10 \n     years.\n\n  That is the New York Times, Mr. President.\n  From the sanfranciscogate.com, this is an Associated Press article of \nSeptember 22:\n\n       Congress' chief budget officer on Tuesday contradicted \n     President Obama's oft-stated claim that seniors wouldn't see \n     their Medicare benefits cut under a health care overhaul.\n       The head of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, \n     Douglas Elmendorf, told senators that seniors in Medicare's \n     managed care plans could see reduced benefits under a bill in \n     the Finance Committee.\n       The bill would cut payment to Medicare Advantage plans by \n     more than $100 billion over 10 years.\n       Elmendorf said the changes ``would reduce the extra \n     benefits that would be made available to beneficiaries \n     through Medicare Advantage plans.''\n\n  Then there is the CBO, which in its October 7 letter to Senator \nBaucus talked about in detail the proposed Medicare cuts. Then there is \nthe Associated Press article of July 30, 2009, which says:\n\n       Democrats are pushing for Medicare cuts on a scale not seen \n     in years to underwrite health care for all. Many seniors now \n     covered under the program don't like that one bit.\n\n  That is not the Republican National Committee. That is the Associated \nPress reporting on what the bills say. It also says:\n\n       The House bill--the congressional proposal that has \n     advanced the most--would reduce projected increases in \n     Medicare payments to providers by more than $500 billion over \n     10 years, a gross cut of about 7 percent over the period. But \n     the legislation would also plow nearly $300 billion back into \n     the program, mainly to sweeten payments to doctors.\n       That still leaves a net cut of more than $200 billion--\n\n  Says the Associated Press, describing the Democratic health care \nplan--\n\n     which would be used to offset new Federal subsidies for \n     workers and their families now lacking health insurance.\n\n  In other words, we are taking money from Medicare and spending it on \nsomeone else.\n  The Senator from Kansas said it is like writing a check on an \noverdrawn bank account to buy a big new car. That is a pretty good \ndescription.\n  I have a couple more. This is the Los Angeles Times, which is not a \nRepublican publication. The headline on June 14 was, ``Obama to Outline \n$313 Billion in Medicare, Medicaid Spending Cuts.''\n  That is what Democratic Senators have always called such proposals, \nthat is what the Los Angeles Times calls the proposals, and that is \nwhat we call it because that is what they are. The article says:\n\n\n[[Page S11144]]\n\n\n       Reporting from Washington--Under pressure to pay for his \n     ambitious reshaping of the nation's healthcare system, \n     President Obama today will outline $313 billion in Medicare \n     and Medicaid spending cuts over the next decade to help cover \n     the cost of expanding coverage to tens of millions of \n     America's insured.\n\n  This is from an October 22 NPR report:\n\n       Over a decade, the committee would cut $117 billion from \n     the Medicare Advantage plans.\n\n  This is from an article in the Washington Post on October 23:\n\n       $500 billion in cuts to Medicare over the next decade.\n\n  That is the Washington Post.\n  This is the Wall Street Journal on September 8:\n\n       Other sources of funding for the Finance Committee plan \n     include cuts to Medicare.\n\n  Mr. President, the question is not whether there are going to be cuts \nto Medicare; that is the proposal. Maybe it is a good idea; maybe it is \na bad idea. But we don't need to come to the Senate floor and say that \nsomething that is, is not.\n  The proposal in these large expansive health care plans--the 2,000-\npage bill coming from the House soon--is that it is basically half \nfinanced by cuts in Medicare--not to make the program solvent--a \nprogram which has $37 trillion in unfunded liabilities over the next 75 \nyears--but to spend it on a new government program. Those are the \nfacts. That is why it is important that the American people have an \nopportunity to read the bill and know what it costs and know how it \naffects them.\n\n  The Republican leader and Senator Johanns have talked about taxes in \nthe bill. Rarely does a Senator have an opportunity to vote on so many \nMedicare cuts and so many new taxes, as we apparently will have when \nthis bill comes to us.\n  The taxes include a tax on individuals who don't buy government-\napproved health insurance. The Joint Committee on Taxation, our joint \ncommittee, and the CBO estimate that at least 71 percent of that \npenalty, that tax, will hit people earning less than $250,000. So it is \nnot just taxes on rich people. When you impose, as the Senate Finance \nCommittee bill would, $900 billion-plus in new taxes, when fully \nimplemented, on a whole variety of people and businesses that provide \nhealth care, what do they do?\n  According to the Director of the CBO, most of those taxes are passed \non to the consumers. Who are the consumers? The people who are paying \nhealth care premiums--250 million Americans. What does that mean? That \nwould mean that instead of reducing the cost of your health care \npremium, we are more likely to increase it.\n  I ask, Why are we passing a health care reform bill that increases \nthe cost of your health care premiums, raises your taxes, and cuts \nMedicare to help pay for that? There are increased taxes on health care \nproviders, manufacturers and importers of brand-named drugs, medical \ndevice manufacturers--these will all be passed on to consumers, \naccording to the Joint Committee on Taxation and CBO. The Finance \nproposal raises the threshold for deducting catastrophic medical \nexpenses, but eighty-seven percent of the 5.1 million taxpayers who \nclaim this deduction earn less than $100,000 a year. They are not \nmillionaires. They earn less than $100,000 a year. In fact, data from \nthe Joint Committee on Taxation and the former Director of the CBO \nshows, by 2019, 89 percent of the taxes--these new taxes--will be paid \nby taxpayers earning less than $200,000 a year.\n  The 2,000-page proposal from the House of Representatives would raise \ntaxes by $729 million. There is a tax on millionaires, but we know what \nhappens to that when it is not indexed. Forty years ago, we were \nworried about 155 high-income Americans who were avoiding taxes, so the \nCongress passed the millionaires tax--the alternative minimum tax. \nToday, if we hadn't patched it, as we say, in 2009, that tax would have \nraised taxes on 28.3 million Americans. The millionaires tax will hit \nyou if you keep earning money.\n  I have said quite a bit about Medicare cuts and taxes. I want to \nconclude my remarks by quickly saying what Republicans think should be \ndone. We believe the American people do not want this 2,000-page bill \nthat is headed our way. We want, instead, to start over in the right \ndirection, which means reducing costs and re-earning the trust of the \nAmerican people by reducing the cost of health care step by step.\n  Specifically, we would start with the small business health care \nplans. That is just 88 pages that would lower premiums, according to \nthe CBO. It could cover up to 1 million new small business employees, \nand it would reduce spending on Medicaid. Then we could take a step to \nencourage competition by allowing people to buy health insurance across \nState lines, and we can take measures to stop junk lawsuits against \ndoctors.\n  More health information technology could be a bipartisan proposal. We \ncan have more health exchanges. The number of pages are very small. \nWaste, fraud, and abuse are out of control--$1 out of every $10 spent \nin Medicaid. Our proposal would offer a choice--a couple hundred pages, \nnot 2,000--reducing premiums and debt and making Medicare solvent \ninstead of cutting it, with no tax increases instead of higher taxes, \nand reducing costs.\n  That is the kind of health care plan Republicans have offered and the \nkind we believe Americans will want. We hope over time that will earn \nbipartisan support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, I would like to speak on health care. I \nnote with interest the remarks of the Senator from Tennessee. I think \nthere is former bipartisan agreement, but everybody says let's go \nthrough this step by step. The Congress has had an extensive health \ncare debate. We in the HELP Committee have had extensive hearings, and \nwe had a markup of our bill that lasted more than 3 weeks and had over \n350 amendments, of which 75 percent were offered by the other side. We \noffered many of those amendments. When all was said and done, they \nvoted no. So we don't know when good would be good enough. It is one \nthing to disagree on policy; it is another thing to want to do a \nfilibuster by proxy, which is what we encountered in the committees \nwith the increased volume of amendments.\n  We need health care reform, and we need it now. We need it in a way \nthat accomplishes the goal of saving lives, improving lives and, at the \nsame time, controlling costs.\n  No. 1, I think we all agree, we need to save and stabilize Medicare. \nThe other thing we need to do is end the punitive practices of \ninsurance companies.\n  I am going to tell you a bone-chilling story. I held a hearing in the \nHELP Committee on how health insurance in the private sector treats \nwomen. First, we pay more and get less benefits. But also what happened \nand what emerged is that a woman who applied for health care who had a \nC-section was denied by a Minnesota company unless she got a \nsterilization.\n  Did you hear what I said? An insurance company told an American \nwoman, to get health insurance, she had to have a sterilization. Is \nthis fascist China, fascist Germany? Is this Communist China? This is \nthe United States of America. We were outraged.\n  I have been in touch with this insurance company. I got lipservice \npromises, blow-off letters from their lawyers, and stuff like that. I \nam ready with an amendment on the floor. We have to get rid of these \npunitive practices of denying health care on the basis of a previous \ncondition. And then, not only doing that because of a C-section, but \nthen to engage in a coercive way to force a sterilization.\n  So you think I want reform? You better believe I do. And I think I \nspeak for the majority of the country who feels this way and the good \nmen, such as the Presiding Officer, who will support us on it. I will \nhave an amendment to deal with this if the insurance company continues \nto blow me off.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11144-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11144-S11145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the motion to \nproceed to the motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was not \ninvoked on the committee-reported substitute to H.R. 2847 is agreed to, \nand the motion to reconsider that vote is agreed to.\n  Under the previous order, there will be 40 minutes of debate equally \ndivided and controlled as follows: 20 minutes under the control of the \nSenator from Louisiana and 20 minutes total under the control of the \nSenator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nShelby.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, very shortly, we will vote on cloture on \nthe CJS bill. As the chairperson of the committee, I wish to say that \nwe want to finish this today so we can move forward with the blessing \nand the business of funding--Mr. President, I have to yield the floor a \nmoment. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, reclaiming my time as the manager of the \nbill, I wish to bring to my colleagues' attention that at 12:25 p.m. \ntoday, we are going to vote on cloture of the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill. We wish to finish this bill today. When I say \n``we,'' I mean Senator Shelby, my ranking member, and myself.\n  This bill is the result of a rigorous bipartisan effort to fund the \nDepartment of Justice, including the FBI and DEA, the Commerce \nDepartment, and major science agencies that propel our country in the \narea of innovation and technology development, such as the National \nScience Foundation and the National Space Agency.\n  We want the Senate to be able to deal with this and then move on to \nother business.\n  After the cloture vote, it is our intention to dispose of any pending \namendments that are germane to the bill. This bill has been public \nsince June. It has been on the floor already for 4 days and over 20 \nhours. Senators have had ample time to draft and call up their \namendments. Senator Shelby and I hope to be able to move through the \namendments in a well-paced but brisk fashion.\n  We hope our colleagues will cooperate and have any decisions relating \nto the funding of these important agencies be decided on robust debate \nand the merits of the argument rather than delay and dither, delay and \ndither, delay-and-dither tactics of the other side. We don't want to \ndelay. We don't want to dither. We want to proceed, debate germane \namendments, and bring our bill to a prompt closure.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that when the \nSenate resumes consideration of H.R. 2847, that it be in order for me \nto offer amendment No. 2676, which is filed at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I object, Mr. President. The intention is to vote on \ncloture and dispose of pending germane amendments. The Senator's \namendment is not pending, so I do object, with all courtesy because of \nmy respect for the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I obviously am very disappointed to see \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle object to my amendment. It \nis a pretty simple, straightforward amendment.\n  We have voted several different times when appropriations bills have \nbeen on the Senate floor over the last couple of weeks, wherein the \nfolks on the other side of the aisle insist on allowing the transfer of \nprisoners from Guantanamo Bay to the United States for trial. My \namendment prohibits that. I simply think it is not appropriate to bring \nbattlefield combatants into article III trials inside the United States \nfor any number of procedural reasons relative to the treatment of \nGuantanamo Bay prisoners within our Federal courts. But even beyond \nthat, the potential for the release of those enemy combatants, once \nthey arrive on U.S. soil, certainly is increased.\n  This is not the way we need to be treating enemy combatants. Those \nmen who are at Gitmo are the meanest, nastiest killers in the world. \nEvery single one of them wakes up every day thinking of ways they can \nkill and harm Americans, both our soldiers as well as individuals. Some \nof them were involved in the planning and the carrying out of the \nSeptember 11 attacks. Others were arrested on the battlefield in Iraq \nand are at Guantanamo. We are not equipped nor have we ever in our \nhistory dealt with trials in article III courts of any enemy combatant \narrested on the battlefield. The FBI has not investigated cases prior \nto arrest. These folks were not given Miranda warnings because our \nsoldiers captured these individuals with AK-47s in their hands with \nwhich they were shooting at our men. These are not the types of \nindividuals that our criminal courts are designed to handle or can \nfeasibly handle.\n  I am disappointed we are not going to get a vote on this amendment. I \nwill continue to raise this issue as long as we possibly can between \nnow and the time that Guantanamo Bay is scheduled to be closed and, \nfrom a practical standpoint, until it is closed, if that ever does \nhappen. We have the courts at Guantanamo Bay equipped to handle and try \nthese individuals before military tribunals. Those tribunals have been \nestablished, just reauthorized. We are capable of handling the trials \nat Guantanamo Bay, and that is where they should take place.\n  I want to make sure the time I utilized is charged against Senator \nVitter, which has been agreed to by the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It will be so charged.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Georgia \nattempting to get a very important amendment on the floor. I wish to \nalso propound a unanimous-consent request for a related amendment, \nrelated to the terrorists in Guantanamo Bay.\n  This week, I was advised by the officials at the Air Force and Navy \nbase in Charleston----\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will in a second.\n  Yes, I will yield.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Is the Senator offering an amendment or giving a speech \nabout the desire to offer an amendment?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I desire to offer an amendment, and I will \npropound a unanimous-consent request to allow my amendment to be \nconsidered postcloture. I have a request. I will get to the request in \na moment. I wish to give a few seconds of background.\n  We know this is not an idle threat because inquiries have been made \nin Charleston for moving detainees from Guantanamo Bay to minimum \nsecurity brigs in Charleston.\n  I ask unanimous consent that when the Senate resumes consideration of \nH.R. 2847, it be in order for me to offer an amendment preventing the \ntransfer of known terrorists at Guantanamo to U.S. soil.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I object to the amendment. The intention \nis to vote on cloture and dispose of pending germane amendments. The \nSenator's amendment is not pending, so I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, this amendment has been filed as a second \ndegree. It makes no sense at this point for us to not have a short \ndebate about moving the most dangerous people in the world to American \nsoil. It is appropriate for us to allow at least a small amount of \ntime, as we rush these bills through, to talk about the issues that are \nimportant to Americans.\n  I am obviously disappointed that we will not allow the discussion of \nmy amendment or the amendment of the Senator from Georgia or others who \nare trying to get this issue in front of\n\n[[Page S11146]]\n\nthis body for discussion. It does not mean you cannot vote it down. But \nnot to allow a debate is certainly discouraging at this point.\n  I appreciate Senator Vitter giving us a few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2644\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise again in strong support of my \namendment No. 2644 to the Commerce-Justice-Science appropriations bill. \nIt is coauthored by the distinguished Senator Bennett from Utah, and it \nis strongly supported by many other Members.\n  There has been a lot said about this amendment, most of it \ninaccurate, so let me step back and start with what the amendment says. \nIt is pretty simple, pretty straightforward when you actually read it.\n  The amendment simply requires the census that we are set to take next \nyear to ask whether the respondent is a citizen. The amendment does not \ndo anything but that. It simply says: The census should ask folks if \nthey are citizens. It is very straightforward.\n  We should count every person in the United States. The census should \ninclude everyone, but in so doing, I am encouraging, and my amendment \nwould require, that the census ask if an individual is a citizen.\n  Compared to that statement of policy, that simple goal, it is \nabsolutely mind-boggling to me some of the statements that have been \nmade about it. First, the distinguished majority leader Senator Reid \nadmitted in several conference calls and statements to the press that \nhe is trying to invoke cloture on this bill specifically to block out \nany vote, any discussion of the Vitter amendment.\n  Secondly, in saying that, the majority leader called my amendment \n``anti-immigrant.'' I honestly don't see how any reasonable person can \nsay that when we take a census and we simply ask whether the respondent \nis a citizen or a noncitizen--and plenty of noncitizens are here \nlegally--that is anti-immigrant.\n  Third, and perhaps most outrageously, Senator Reid said my effort is \nakin to the activities in the 1950s and 1960s to intimidate Black \ncitizens and try to get them to stay away from voting in the voting \nbooth. I take personal offense to that. I think there is no reasonable \ncomparison, and I ask Senator Reid to apologize to me for that \noutrageous statement on the Senate floor.\n  As I said, what the amendment does is simple. It says that the census \nshould ask whether a respondent is a citizen or not. Why is that \nimportant? Well, for at least two reasons. First of all, the census is \nan enormously important tool we in Congress are supposed to use--\ninformation and statistics--as we tackle any number of significant \nissues and Federal programs. Certainly it is a very significant and \nimportant issue that we deal with the immigration problem and the issue \nof illegal immigration. And certainly it is useful to know, if we are \ngoing to spend $14 billion to do a census, who within that number are \ncitizens and who within that number are noncitizens.\n  Secondly, and even more important, the top thing the census is used \nfor, the first thing the census is used for is to reapportion the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, to determine after each census is done how \nmany U.S. House Members each State gets. The current plan is to count \neverybody and not ask whether a person is a citizen or a noncitizen. So \nthe current plan is to reapportion House seats using that overall \nnumber--using both citizens and noncitizens in the mix. I think that is \nwrong. I think that is contrary to the whole intent of the Constitution \nand the establishment of Congress as a democratic institution to \nrepresent citizens. I believe only citizens should be in that \nparticular calculation for the reapportionment of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  This is a significant issue for many States, including my State of \nLouisiana. It has a very big and direct and concrete impact on \nLouisiana and certain other States. It comes down to this: If the \ncensus is done next year and reapportionment happens using everybody--\ncitizens and noncitizens--Louisiana is going to lose a seat in the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives. We will lose one-seventh of our standing \nthere, our representation there, our clout. If the census was done and \nonly the number of citizens was used to determine reapportionment, \nLouisiana would not lose that House seat. We would retain seven seats. \nSo that has a very big and direct impact on my State of Louisiana.\n  I would also point out that it will have the same impact in seven \nother States: North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \nMississippi, Michigan, Iowa, and Indiana--excuse me, eight other \nStates. So a total of nine States are in this position, Louisiana being \none of them. So it is a very significant issue that directly impacts \nmany citizens and many States.\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to support getting a vote on the \nVitter amendment by denying cloture on the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill. However you may vote, this is an important issue, \nand however you may vote, we need a full debate and a vote. In \nparticular, I would urge my colleagues from North Carolina, South \nCarolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Mississippi, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, \nand, of course, Louisiana to vote no on cloture so we can examine this \nvery significant issue and so we can have a vote on the Vitter-Bennett \namendment.\n  There has been discussion in at least two areas that I wish to \nquickly address. One is some discussion in the press, including from my \ndistinguished colleague from Louisiana, Senator Landrieu, who has \nindicated that what I just laid out in terms of the impact on \nreapportionment isn't true. Well, I think every expert who has looked \nat this, every demographer who has looked at this agrees with what I \njust said, that this factor is the difference between Louisiana losing \na House seat or not and these other States losing a House seat or not.\n  I would point out three experts, but there are many others. Dr. \nElliott Stonecipher, demographer from Louisiana, has been leading the \ncharge on this issue. I compliment him for his tenacity and his hard \nwork. But there are others as well. In an October 27, 2009, New York \nTimes article, my numbers were again confirmed by Andrew Beverage, \nprofessor of sociology at Queens College, New York. He did an \nindependent analysis and said exactly the same thing, that, yes, this \nissue of whether we use citizens and noncitizens in reapportionment \ndoes make that huge difference for those States. And last week, my \nanalysis and my numbers were confirmed yet again by an independent and \nwell-respected demographic expert--again in my State of Louisiana--Greg \nRigamer with GCR and Associates. And that is very significant.\n  Secondly, I wish to briefly address this cost issue. It is \ninteresting that in this debate, the other side has been flailing \naround for an argument against my amendment, though nobody has argued--\nor nobody whom I have heard--that reapportionment should be done \ncounting citizens and noncitizens, and that is more consistent with the \nnotion of Congress being the representative body of citizens of the \nUnited States. So folks on the other side are wildly flailing around \nfor some argument, and the one they have come across is cost: Oh my \ngoodness, the census would have to incur additional cost to add this to \nthe form.\n  Well, it is certainly true that it would cost some more. I can't give \nyou a precise dollar figure, but it would cost something more. It is \ncertainly true it would have been better for this to have been caught \nand debated earlier rather than later. Unfortunately, the committee of \njurisdiction, the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs, which reviews the census forms, did not bring this issue up in \na significant way. I agree with that. I don't agree with this wild \nfigure that it would cost $1 billion.\n  Let me point out a couple of things. First of all, the cost of the \ncensus has ballooned from the last census. The last census was $3.4 \nbillion; this census is going to be $14 billion. So the first thing I \nwould say, quite honestly, is that it is pretty ironic for an agency \nthat has had a budget balloon from $3.4 billion in the last census to \n$14 billion this census to say they can't squeeze in that question, \nthat they can't do it right for $14 billion.\n\n[[Page S11147]]\n\n  Secondly, quite frankly, the Census Bureau has a horrendous record in \nterms of cost estimates. When they threw out this very large, very \nround figure of it costing an additional $1 billion, I called them and \nsaid: OK, can you give us the rationale for that, the background on \nthat cost estimate? After 3 weeks of asking for the data behind that $1 \nbillion claim, they sent us one piece of paper with 10 bullet points on \nit, all very general statements and suggestions, with a final bottom \nline being a nice even round figure of $1 billion--very unimpressive, \nin my opinion, in terms of any precise accounting for $1 billion.\n  I would also draw everyone's attention to an October 7, 2009, GAO \nreport delivered to the Subcommittee on Federal Financial Management, \nGovernment Information, Federal Services, and International Security. \nIt was about the census. In that report, the GAO said:\n\n       Given the Bureau's past difficulties in developing credible \n     and accurate cost estimates, we are concerned about the \n     reliability of the figures that were used to support the 2010 \n     budget.\n\n  In another example, the Office of the Inspector General filed a \nreport in 2008 about the census. In that report, the office inspected a \nparticular cost estimate from the Census Bureau that came up to $494 \nmillion for a certain portion of their activity, and they said: We \nthink this is a wildly inflated figure, and we can immediately identify \ncost savings that bring it down to $348 million--a significant savings \nof almost $150 million. When the Census Bureau was confronted with \nthat, they had to agree and they had to adopt the lower figure.\n  So, Mr. President, the bottom line is simple: We do a census every 10 \nyears. It is a very important event. We need to do it right, and to do \nit right, we need a full debate and a vote on this central question \nembodied by the Vitter-Bennett amendment. So I urge all of my \ncolleagues to vote no on cloture of the Commerce-Justice-Science \nappropriations bill to demand a reasonable debate and vote on the \nVitter-Bennett amendment. This is an important question, and we simply \nshouldn't forge ahead. Americans have a fundamental problem with not \neven asking the citizenship question and therefore forging ahead with a \nplan to reapportion the entire U.S. House of Representatives by putting \nnoncitizens in the mix, when the whole notion of our representative \ndemocracy and of Congress is to represent the citizens of the country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support that position, and I thank my \ncolleagues who have done so thus so far. In particular, I urge my \ncolleagues from North Carolina, South Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, \nMississippi, Michigan, Iowa, Indiana, and certainly Louisiana to stand \nup for their States, to stand up for their interests, to stand up for \ntheir clout and their representation in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I object to the Senator's amendment, and \nI object to the arguments he has made.\n  First of all, we adopt cloture so that we can proceed on amendments \nthat are germane. Second, in terms of the inaccurate accusation that we \nare plowing ahead and forging forward, we were on this bill for 4 days, \nwith over 20 hours of debate. There was plenty of time to talk about \nthis amendment, and I was here and ready to engage.\n  The other thing is that there have been other times--since my bill \nwas pulled from the floor--called morning business, when a Senator \ncould talk for any length of time on any topic he or she wants. Yet \nsilence, silence, silence. So don't use the cloture vote as a way to \nsay there wasn't enough time.\n  Now let's go to being asleep at the switch. Two accusations were \nmade--the ballooning of the census cost. Well, one of the reasons and \nthe main reason the cost is exploding is that the party in power prior \nto 2008 was asleep at the switch with the census. They completely \ndropped the ball on the new technology for being able to go door to \ndoor to get a count. It turned into a big techno-boondoggle. It finally \ntook the Secretary of Commerce to uncover that under that rock was \nanother rock, and under that rock were a lot of buckets of \nmalfunctioning microchips. So we had to bail out Secretary Gutierrez \nand the census because of the techno-boondoggle because the other party \nwas asleep at the switch in maintaining strict quality controls.\n  Now let's go to the asking of another question. The Senator from \nLouisiana says he wants to stand up for his State. I agree, we have to \nstand up for the States, but the time to stand up was in April of 2007. \nDid you know that the Census is mandated by law to submit the \nquestionnaires to Congress--and they did? So for 1 year, from April 1, \n2007, to the close of the review by Congress 1 year later, April 2008, \nthere was plenty of time to say: We don't like the questionnaire; we \nwant to add a citizenship question. That was the time and the place. \nWhen you are going to stand up for your State, stand up at the right \ntime to make a difference and not try to amend the law in a way that is \ngoing to create administrative havoc.\n\n  We can debate the merits of the question, but I am here as an \nappropriator on the process. The Census Bureau did meet its statutory \nresponsibility. It submitted the questionnaire to the Congress on April \n1, 2007. It did not come by stealth in the night, it was not written in \ninvisible ink, it was written in English here for all to see--and also \nin other languages we could test and use--to say: Do you, Congress, \nlike this questionnaire? Do you have any comments? For all those who \nwant to stand up, that was the time to do it and the time to make a \nchange.\n  Let's talk about the consequences. It will delay the census so we \ncould essentially not meet our constitutional mandate of having the \ncensus done in a timely way. No. 2, it will cost, if we did not do it, \nanother $1 billion and wreak, again, administrative havoc.\n  Let's go into this whole claim about citizens and noncitizens. The \ncensus already tracks the number of citizens and noncitzens through a \nseparate survey. We could talk about what this will mean in \nreapportionment and so on. Those questions are for debates that lie \nwith the Judiciary Committee.\n  We are not going to vote up or down on the Vitter amendment, we are \ngoing to vote on cloture. Why is cloture important? So we do not have \ndistracting amendments that are better offered on the appropriate \nsubstance of the bill. We have to fund the State, Commerce, Justice, \nScience agencies. The FBI needs us to fund this agency. The Marshals \nService needs us to fund this agency. Federal law enforcement, our \nFederal prisons--you might not like whom the Obama administration puts \nin Federal prisons, but we need Federal prisons. So we need to pass \ncloture so we can dispose of germane amendments and move democracy \nforward.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland has 7\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I wish to reserve my time. Did the Senator from Kansas \nhave a question?\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I would be delighted to respond to my good friend from \nMaryland. I am in a position to yield back all the minority's time. We \nhave no more speakers.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we are not prepared to yield back any \ntime. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the distinguished Senator yield?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Certainly.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Today, the U.S. Marine Corps is celebrating its \nbirthday. As I speak, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, the Drum and \nBugle Corps and various and assorted marines are over in the Russell \nBuilding. I am to cut the cake, and I am getting into deeper and deeper \ntrouble if we delay the ceremonies to the degree they could be delayed. \nIf somebody wants to talk, obviously, you have 7 minutes, but I \nappreciate any consideration you might be able to give us.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. That is one heck of an argument, I respond to the \nSenator from Kansas. I have great admiration for the Marine Corps. If \nthe Semper Fi guys call and you need to cut the cake, I will certainly \nbe willing to cooperate.\n  Seriously, our congratulations to the U.S. Marine Corps on their \nbirthday. We value them for what they have done in their most recent \nconflicts and their incredible history. They are truly Semper Fi. In \nthe spirit of what I hope will be the comity of the day, the civility \nof\n\n[[Page S11148]]\n\nthe day, we yield back our time in order to permit the vote.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. I tell the Senator Semper Fi, and on behalf of the \nminority, I yield back all our time.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.

Mr. President, the Food and Drug \nAdministration is proposing a rule that will basically eliminate raw \noysters from the Gulf of Mexico. There have been 15 people in the past \nyear who have died from a bacterial infection that comes out of raw \noysters. But what has been discovered is that the people had a \npreexisting condition prior to eating the oysters that made their \nimmune system wear down so they were much more susceptible. In a \nsweeping administrative executive branch decision trying to correct a \nproblem, they are suddenly proposing that they are going to stop the \nrest of America eating raw oysters from the Gulf of Mexico. This is \nlike saying: If you have a food allergy to peanuts, we are going to ban \nyou eating peanuts unless you cook them.\n  There is a thriving industry along the coast of America, particularly \nthe gulf coast, that has a delicacy known as raw oysters that people \nenjoy. Apalachicola oysters, the creme de la creme, are shipped all \nover the world. And in some of the fanciest restaurants you get \nApalachicola oysters on the half shell. The Food and Drug \nAdministration is about to basically ban raw oysters from the Gulf of \nMexico. Some of us in the Senate are going to try not to let it happen.\n  Senator Landrieu and I, who both have some interest in this because \nit affects our States, are filing a bill today that would utilize the \nappropriations means of not letting an appropriation be enacted or used \nfor the purpose of the FDA implementing such a rule that would \nbasically ban raw oysters from the Gulf of Mexico. This is trying to \nkill a gnat with a sledgehammer. If people were, because of a \npreexisting condition, already subject to coming down with an illness, \nthere is simply no sense. This is government run amok. This is \ngovernment out of control. This is government trying to kill a gnat \nwith a sledgehammer. We are not going to let it happen.\n  I inform the Senate today that we are filing this legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n\n[[Page S11149]]\n\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to be recognized as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it goes without saying that \nNASA, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, is at a \ncrossroads. It is an agency that has been starved of funds, so it finds \nitself in the position that its human-rated capable vehicle, the space \nshuttle, will be ceasing to fly after six more flights that will \ncontinue to build the space station and equip it.\n  This last flight will probably not be until the first quarter of \n2011. But the crossroads NASA is facing is because it has been starved \nof funds over the course of the last half a dozen years, it will not \nhave a new human-rated vehicle to take our crews to the International \nSpace Station. As a matter of fact, there is a great deal of \nconsternation and conflict within NASA itself as to what that vehicle \nshould be. So the President, recognizing this earlier when he appointed \nthe new NASA Administrator, GEN Charlie Bolden, set up a blue ribbon \npanel headed by Norman Augustine.\n  They have now reported, and the strong inference of their extensive \nand detailed report is that the vehicle that was planned to fly but was \nobviously going to be delayed because it hadn't been developed quickly \nenough, the Ares I--by the way, the same vehicle that had a very \nsuccessful test flight a week ago--the strong inference of the \nAugustine Commission Report is that the Ares I would not even be ready \nto fly astronauts until the year 2017. Its sole purpose would be, \naccording to the Augustine Commission Report, to get astronauts to and \nfrom the space station, and that would be, in the Augustine report's \ninference, too late. So they are recommending, or at least the strong \ninference of the recommendation in the Augustine report, is that \ncommercial vehicles be developed to take cargo and crew to the \nInternational Space Station. The Augustine Commission Report is \nsuggesting the space station certainly should be kept alive until the \nyear 2020, but to now start to reap some of the science from the \nexperiments that just now the space station is getting equipped to be \nable to do, in the nodule that is now designated as a national \nlaboratory on the International Space Station.\n  If what I have said sounds confusing, indeed it is. That is why NASA \nis at a crossroads. NASA is even more at a crossroads because NASA \ncan't do anything unless it gets some serious new additional money, and \nthat is the strong recommendation of the Augustine Commission Report. \nWhat they are saying is that NASA should have $1 billion extra over the \nPresident's request in this fiscal year, the fiscal year that started \nOctober 1 known as fiscal year 2010, and that the next fiscal year it \nshould have an additional $2 billion over the President's baseline \nrecommendation in the budget, and that thereafter, for the decade, it \nshould have an additional $3 billion per year to fill out the decade so \nthat NASA can do what it does best.\n  What does it do best? It explores the unknown. It explores the \nheavens. What should that architecture be? I don't think our Senate \ncommittee can decide that. I don't think the White House can decide \nthat, but the White House can give direction and our committee can give \ndirection to NASA to go figure it out: Figure out what that \narchitecture is to do what NASA does best, which is explore the \nheavens. That direction is certainly recommended in the Augustine \nCommission Report as: Get out of low Earth orbit. Expand out into the \ncosmos, with humans, to explore.\n  So what I am hoping the President of the United States, Barack Obama, \nis going to do, now that he has received the Augustine Commission \nReport--it is my hope, it is my plea to the President that he will take \ntheir recommendations seriously and that he will do three things. \nFirst, even in the midst of an economic recession, when the budgets are \nvery constrained and tight, he will say that a part of America we are \nnot going to give up is our role as explorers and that he will commit \nto recommend in his budgets the additional money as recommended by the \nAugustine Commission, and in this first year, this fiscal year we are \nin now, fiscal year 2010, that is a lot easier because you can get that \nadditional $1 billion out of the unused money in the stimulus bill. But \nit gets tougher as we get on down the line. That is the first thing.\n  The second thing the President should say to his administrator of \nNASA, General Bolden, is convene the guys and determine the \narchitecture of how we should go about and what is the mission we are \ngoing to explore. I can tell my colleagues that this Senator thinks the \ngoal should be to go to Mars. It may not be to the surface of Mars; it \nmay be first to Phobos, one of the moons of Mars; we would have to \nspend so much less energy in getting down to the surface of that moon \nbecause of the gravitational pull instead of going all the way to the \nsurface of Mars. The science that we could gain from that would be \nextraordinary.\n  Therefore, the President's direction, I would hope, to NASA would be: \nFigure out the architecture. Does that mean we are going to take the \nAres I and make it into an Ares V?\n  Is that going to be the heavy lift vehicle to get the hardware up to \nexpand out into the cosmos, be it to Phobos, be it to an astroid, be it \nto the Moon? My hope is that the President would give that direction: \nFigure out that architecture and what are the steps along to the goal \nof getting to Mars. That would be the second thing.\n  The third thing I hope the President would do is give direction to \nNASA that since NASA is at this crossroads and since there is going to \nbe disruption in the workforce because there is not another human-rated \nrocket ready after the space shuttle is shut down, then you have to \nhelp the workforce. You have to move work around among the NASA \ncenters. You have to bring in new kinds of research and development, of \nwhich NASA is a good example of an R agency.\n  It is through the direction of those three things that I think we can \nget NASA out of this fix it finds itself in at this crossroads point. \nGive the direction, No. 1, for the additional funding that NASA needs; \nNo. 2, direct NASA to produce that architecture for exploring the \nheavens; and No. 3, take care of the workforce in the meantime.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today because I am deeply \nconcerned that just over 1 year since the collapse of Lehman Brothers, \na failure that helped send us to the brink of depression, Wall Street \nis essentially unchanged. Congress and the SEC have not enacted any \nreform, and the American people remain at risk of another financial \ndebacle--not just because the same practices that led to the crisis 14 \nmonths ago are continuing but from new practices that are leading to \nnew problems and new systemic risks.\n  Last year, the financial world almost came to an end. Yet most of \nWall Street then believed that no government review or additional \nregulation was necessary--right up until the moment government had to \nstep in and save it.\n  We had been assured that the system was sound. We were assured that a \nhost of checks and balances were in place that would suffice. We were \nassured that companies have to report their financial holdings with \nfull disclosure and transparency. We were assured that accountants have \nto verify those assets. We were assured that due diligence is conducted \non every deal and transaction. We were assured that boards of directors \nhave a fiduciary duty to undertake prudent risk management. We were \nsure that management wanted their companies to thrive\n\n[[Page S11150]]\n\nover the long term. Most important, we were assured that regulatory \nbodies and law enforcement agencies are in place to police the system. \nBut those safeguards did not prevent the disaster.\n  In the past 10 years or more, one of the most important safeguards--\nthe regulators--had simply given up on the importance of regulation. We \nbelieved and they believed that markets could police themselves, they \nwould self-regulate, and so in effect we pulled the regulators off the \nfield.\n  We now know the confluence of events that led to the disaster, and \nthere is blame enough to go around. We failed to regulate the \nderivatives market. Government-backed agencies, such as Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, pushed to make housing available for greater numbers of \npeople; unscrupulous mortgage brokers pushed subprime mortgages at \nevery opportunity; and investment bankers pooled and securitized those \nsubprime mortgages by the trillions of dollars and sold them like \nhotcakes. Rating agencies, left unmonitored by the SEC, incredibly \nstamped these pools with AAA ratings.\n  The SEC, which changed the capital-to-leverage ratio level for \ninvestment banks from 30-and-50-to-1, allowed these banks to buy huge \npools of these soon-to-be toxic assets, and investment banks wrote \ncredit default swaps and then hedged those risks without any central \nclearinghouse, without any understanding of who was writing how much or \nwhat it all meant--all of this, incredible to believe, without any \nregulation or oversight.\n  This chart conveys that banks were involved in high-risk return \ninvestments that were largely unregulated. Then, crash--the housing \nbubble burst and a disaster of truly monumental proportions struck. \nAmericans lost $20 trillion in housing and equity value during the \nensuing financial meltdown. The economy lurched into free fall, and the \nGDP shrunk by a staggering percentage not seen since the 1950s.\n  What happened next? The American taxpayer, the deep-pocket lender of \nlast resort, had to ride to the rescue. We can barely even count the \ntrillions of dollars in taxpayer money that have gone into bailing out \nthe banks, AIG, and a number of other financial institutions. That is \nnot including the billions of taxpayer dollars we had to spend to \nstimulate the economy.\n  We must never let this happen again. Yet here we are 1 year later, \nwith no immediate crisis at hand, and we are falling back into \ncomplacency. The credit default swap market remains unregulated. The \ncredit rating agencies have not yet been reformed. The banks are back \nto their old habits--paying out billions of dollars in bonuses for \nemployees who are still engaged in high-risk, high-reward practices.\n  What is the great lesson we should have learned from the financial \ndisaster of 2008? When markets develop rapidly and change dramatically, \nwhen they are not regulated, and when they are not fully transparent, \nit can lead to financial disaster. That is what happened in the credit \ndefault swap market--rapid and dramatic change in the market, no \nregulation, and opaqueness, which equaled disaster. This must never \nhappen again.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to regulate the \nderivatives markets, to ensure that credit default swaps are traded on \nan exchange or at least cleared through a central clearinghouse with \nappropriate safeguards enforced, and to enact meaningful financial \nregulatory reforms.\n  At the same time, we need to be looking carefully to see if these \nthree deadly ingredients--rapid technological development, lack of \ntransparency, and a lack of regulation--are appearing again in other \nmarkets. There is no question in my mind that in today's stock markets, \nthose three disastrous ingredients do exist.\n  Due to rapid technological advances in computerized trading, stock \nmarkets have changed dramatically in recent years. They have become so \nhighly fragmented that they are opaque--beyond the scope of effective \nsurveillance--and our regulators have failed to keep pace.\n  The facts speak for themselves. We have gone from an era dominated by \na duopoly of the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq to a highly \nfragmented market of more than 60 trading centers.\n  Dark pools, which allow confidential trading away from the public \neye, have flourished, growing from 1.5 percent to 12 percent of market \ntrades in under 5 years.\n  Competition for orders is intense and increasingly problematic. Flash \norders, liquidity rebates, direct access granted to hedge funds by the \nexchanges, dark pools, indications of interest, and payment for order \nflow are each a consequence of these 60 centers all competing for \nmarket share.\n  Moreover, in just a few short years, high-frequency trading, which \nfeeds everywhere on small price differences in the many fragmented \ntrading venues, has skyrocketed from 30 percent to 70 percent of the \ndaily volume.\n  Indeed, the chief executive of one of the country's biggest block \ntrading dark pools was quoted 2 weeks ago as saying that the amount of \nmoney devoted to high-frequency trading could ``quintuple between this \nyear and next.''\n  Let's put the last chart back up for a second. Again, we have learned \nthat if you have rapid and dramatic change, opaqueness, and no \neffective regulation, which is exactly what exists in the high \nfrequency trading markets, we have a disaster. We should look at this \nin terms of high-frequency trading. We have no effective regulation in \nthese markets.\n  Last week, Rick Ketchum, the chairman and CEO of the Financial \nIndustry Regulatory Authority--the self-regulatory body governing \nbroker-dealers--gave a very thoughtful and candid speech, which I \napplaud. In it, Mr. Ketchum admitted that we have inadequate regulatory \nmarket surveillance.\n  His candor was refreshing but also ominous:\n\n       There is much more to be done in the areas of front-\n     running, manipulation, abusive short selling, and just having \n     a better understanding of who is moving the markets and why.\n\n  Mr. Ketchum went on to say:\n\n       [T]here are impediments to regulatory effectiveness that \n     are not terribly well understood and potentially damaging to \n     the integrity of the markets . . . The decline of the primary \n     market concept, where there was a single price discovery \n     market whose on-site regulator saw 90-plus percent of the \n     trading activity, has obviously become a reality. In its \n     place are now two or three or maybe four regulators all \n     looking at an incomplete picture of the market--\n\n  And this is important--\n\n     and knowing full well that this fractured approach does not \n     work.\n\n  At the same time that we have no effective regulatory surveillance, \nwe have also learned about potential manipulation by high-frequency \ntraders.\n  Last week, the Senate Banking Subcommittee for Securities, Insurance, \nand Investment held a hearing on a wide range of important market \nstructure issues. At the hearing, Mr. James Brigagliano, co-acting \ndirector of the Division of Trading and Markets, testified that the \nCommission intends to do a ``deep dive'' into high-frequency trading \nissues due to concerns that some high-frequency programs may enable \npossible front-running and manipulation.\n  Mr. Brigagliano's testimony about his concerns was troubling:\n\n       . . . if there are traders taking position and then \n     generating momentum through high frequency trading that would \n     benefit those positions, that could be manipulation which \n     would concern us. If there was momentum trading designed--or \n     that actually exacerbated intra-day volatility--that might \n     concern us because it could cause investors to get a worse \n     price. And the other item I mentioned was if there were \n     liquidity detection strategies that enabled high frequency \n     traders to front-run pension funds and mutual funds, that \n     also would concern us.\n\n  Reinforcing the case for quick action, several panelists acknowledged \nthat it is a daily occurrence for dark pools to exclude certain \npossible high-frequency manipulators. For example, Robert Gasser, \npresident and CEO of Investment Technology Group, asserted that \nsurveillance is a ``big challenge'' and that improving market \nsurveillance must be a regulatory priority.\n  He said:\n\n       I can tell you that there are some frictional trades going \n     on out there that clearly look as if they are testing the \n     boundaries of liquidity provision versus market manipulation.\n\n  But none of the panelists, when asked, felt responsible to report any \nof their suspicions of manipulative activity to the SEC. That is up to \nthe regulators and their surveillance to stop, they believe.\n\n[[Page S11151]]\n\n  Finally, at the end of the hearing, Subcommittee Chairman Reed asked \nabout the reported arrest of a Goldman Sachs employee who allegedly had \nstolen code from Goldman used for their high-frequency trading \nprograms.\n  A Federal prosecutor, arguing that the judge should set a high bail, \nsaid he had been told that with this software, there was the danger \nthat a knowledgeable person could manipulate the markets in unfair \nways.\n  The SEC has said it intends to issue a concept release to launch a \nstudy of high-frequency trading. According to news reports, this will \nhappen next year. I do not believe next year is soon enough. We need \nthe SEC to begin its study immediately. Where is the sense of urgency?\n  Our stock markets are also opaque. Again, I refer to Chairman \nKetchum's speech:\n\n       There are impediments to regulatory effectiveness that are \n     not terribly well understood and potentially damaging to the \n     integrity of the markets.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We need more information on the entities that move \n     markets--the high frequency traders and hedge funds that are \n     not registered. Right now, we are looking through a \n     translucent veil, and only seeing the registered firms, and \n     that gives us an incomplete--if not inaccurate--picture of \n     the markets.\n\n  Senator Schumer echoed this theme at last week's hearing. He said:\n\n       Market surveillance should be consolidated across all \n     trading venues to eliminate the information gaps and \n     coordination problems that make surveillance across all the \n     markets virtually impossible today.\n\n  Let me repeat: `` . . . market surveillance across all the markets \nvirtually impossible today.'' I totally agree with that, and none of \nthe industry witnesses disagreed with Senator Schumer. That is why the \nSEC must not let months go by without taking meaningful action. We need \nthe Commission to report now on what it should be doing sooner to \ndiscover and stop any such high-frequency manipulation.\n  Where is the sense of urgency?\n  We must also act urgently because high-frequency trading poses a \nsystemic risk. Both industry experts and SEC Commissioners have \nrecognized this threat. One industry expert has warned about high-\nfrequency malfunctions:\n\n       The next LongTerm Capital meltdown would happen--\n\n  And get this--\n\n     in a five-minute time period . . .\n\n  ``The next LongTerm Capital meltdown would happen in a five-minute \ntime period.''\n\n       At 1,000 shares per order and an average price of $20 per \n     share, $2.4 billion of improper trades could be executed in \n     [a] short timeframe.\n\n  This is a real problem. We have unregulated entities--hedge funds--\nusing high-frequency trading programs, interacting directly with the \nexchanges.\n  As Chairman Reed said at last week's hearing, nothing requires that \nthese people even be located within the United States. Known as \n``sponsored access,'' hedge funds use the name of a broker-dealer to \ngain direct trading access to the exchange but do not have to comply \nwith any of the broker-dealer rules or risk checks.\n  SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter has recognized this threat:\n\n       [Sponsored access] presents a variety of unique risks and \n     concerns, particularly when trading firms have unfiltered \n     access to the markets. These risks could affect several \n     market participants and potentially threaten the stability of \n     the markets.\n\n  Let me repeat that:\n\n       These risks could affect several marketing participants and \n     potentially threaten the stability of the markets.\n\n  This is from a member of the SEC. Even those on Wall Street \nresponsible for overseeing their firms' high-frequency programs are not \nup to speed on the risks involved, according to a recent study \nconducted by 7city Learning. In a survey of quantitative analysts who \ndesign and implement high-frequency trading algorithms, two-thirds \nasserted their supervisors ``do not understand the work they do.''\n  And though the quants and risk managers played a central role \nexacerbating last year's financial crisis, 86 percent of those surveyed \nindicated their supervisor's ``level of understanding of the job of a \nquant is the same or worse than it was a year ago,'' and 70 percent \nsaid the same thing about their institutions as a whole.\n  I agree with the market expert and 7city director Paul Wilmott who \nsaid:\n\n       These numbers are alarming. They indicate that even with \n     the events of the past year, financial institutions are still \n     not taking the importance of financial education seriously.\n\n  Let me repeat that.\n\n       . . . They indicate that even with the events of the past \n     year, financial institutions are still not taking the \n     importance of financial education seriously.\n\n  Where is the urgency? Time is of the essence. We must act now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Specter pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n339 are printed in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, our colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator \nSpecter, just gave an eloquent speech on why the Supreme Court should \nbe televised and how it would provide greater openness and transparency \nwere decisions being made in the public's eye. I think that argument \nwas very interesting. But there is one institution that is absolutely \non television already, and that is the Congress of the United States. \nThrough C-SPAN, what goes on in this Chamber and often in the committee \nrooms goes out all over America. We get phone calls, in many instances, \nfrom the C-SPAN watchers. I think it is an outstanding tool.\n  Someone watching what is going on all day would wonder: What are they \ndoing? We have kind of lost sight, given some of the amendments that \nwere offered, of just what is the pending business on the floor of the \nSenate today. As the person who chairs the Appropriations Subcommittee \non Commerce, Justice and Science, I would like to remind the American \npeople watching, and my colleagues, what is the pending business.\n  The pending business is how should we best fund those important \nagencies at the Commerce Department that promote trade and scientific \ninnovation; also the Justice Department, rendering impartial justice, \nenforcing the laws that are on the books; to important science \nagencies, such as the American space program. What the appropriations \nbill does is it determines what goes in the Federal checkbook to fund \nthese programs.\n  I am very proud of the way we, in our subcommittee, have worked on a \nbipartisan basis to bring a bill to the Senate floor that we believe \nreflects national priorities. I have worked hand in hand with my \nranking member, the Republican Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, and we \nwrote good legislation.\n  What do we like about it? First of all, what we like about it is that \nwe want to promote innovation and competition in our society. We are in \na terrible economic mess. Our economy is rocking and rolling. The fact \nis, we still do not have jobs. What about these jobs? What do we do? I \nwant to talk about the role of the Commerce Department in coming up \nwith new ideas, making sure we have innovation from the government. \nInnovation is important because it is the new ideas that create the new \nproducts that create the new jobs.\n  I note the Presiding Officer is from the State of Ohio. There, as in \nmy State, manufacturing has been very hard hit. Many of the traditional \nways of life are not there. We have to look ahead to what is promoting \ninnovation-friendly government. Right there in the Commerce Department \nis the Bureau of Industry and Security, which makes sure we are able to \nprovide exports of our technology. We have the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, which is guardian of our intellectual property around the \nworld. It protects ideas and those who come up with inventions as \nprivate property, the hallmark of capitalism--the ability to own \nprivate\n\n[[Page S11152]]\n\nproperty and benefit from the fruits of your labor in an open and \ncompetitive marketplace. We would fund that.\n  When you come up with new products, you also have to have standards \nso a yardstick is the same in the United States as in any other \ncountry--or the metric system. What the National Institute of Standards \ndoes is it sets standards for products that will enable the private \nsector to compete among themselves and around the world. I am proud of \nthem. They are located in Maryland, but even if they were located in \nUtah or Wyoming I would be proud of them because it is there that they \nset the standards which help set the pace for America to compete.\n  Much is said about our arms race, but one of the races we have been \nin is the race for America's future. One of the agencies that is the \ngreatest inventor of technology has been the National Space Agency. We \nhave all been thrilled to watch our astronauts go into space. Many of \nus, particularly this summer, were excited about the bold and \ncourageous astronauts because they were able to retrofit Hubble with \nnew batteries and a new camera so we could do the scientific work \nneeded to send Hubble on its final journey. It is at the National Space \nAgency, though, that so much invention of new technology occurs.\n  As someone who has spoken out so much for women's health, and also \nthe desire to prevent breast cancer, one of the things I am proud of is \nout of NASA's x-ray technology we have been able to develop other \nproducts for the civilian population, such as digital mammography.\n  A few months ago I broke my ankle and then wore a boot that looked \nlike a space boot. It looked like a space boot because it maybe was--\nwell, not mine. I would love to wear a space boot worn by Sally Ride or \none of the great women astronauts. But the fact is, it is because of \nthe technology that was developed to protect our astronauts that we now \nknow how to protect us on Earth. This is what we are talking about.\n  Should we fund these agencies? Should we be able to make public \ninvestments that lead to private sector jobs? While we are fighting \nover should we have this prisoner over at Gitmo or other kinds of \nprovocative social questions, we have a duty to promote those agencies \nthat promote private sector jobs.\n  The other area I am very proud of in this bill is our support of law \nenforcement. Yes, we support Federal law enforcement, our FBI, our \nMarshal Service, as well as our Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms \nand Explosives. But I am also proud that we support that thin blue line \nof local law enforcement. For many of our communities, mayors and \ncounty executives are stretched to the limit. Sometimes people who \ncommit crimes are better armed and have the latest technology, more \nthan our cops on the beat. Through a program called the Byrne grants \nthey are able to apply for Federal funds to be able to modernize \nthemselves.\n  We don't want to hold up the funding. We want this bill to go ahead. \nWe want things to happen. That is what this bill is. We have worked \nhard. Senator Shelby and I held hearings, we held meetings, we met with \nlocal law enforcement.\n  We took the time to meet with people who have been victims, battered \nwomen. We fund the Violence Against Women Act. Do you know, since Joe \nBiden created that program, over 1 million people have called on the \nhotline; that we have protected over 1 million women from being abused \nand maybe even facing violence of such a degree that it threatened \ntheir lives?\n  This is not only about spending. These are about public investments \nthat protect our communities and protect American jobs. I hope my \ncolleagues will come and agree to complete discussion on their \namendments so we can complete votes and bring this to a close so we can \ngo to a conference with the House.\n  I note the Senator from Louisiana is on the Senate floor. I want to \nsingle her out, as they say in the colloquial: Do a shout-out. The \nSenator is well known for her work on adoption, and I salute her for \nthat. Also, international adoption, making sure the laws are made and \nmaking sure, as people seek international adoption, there is not the \nexploitation of those children. We work with that in our bill. We also \nmake sure we protect missing and exploited children in their own \ncountry.\n  You know, we see horrific, ghoulish, and grisly things done to young \npeople who have been picked up. But thanks to the Adam Walsh Act, the \nMissing Children and Exploitation Act, we are stopping that. We have \ntough laws now against sexual predators and a way to keep them off the \nstreets and to keep them registered. We have the money in the Federal \ncheckbook to do that.\n  I really like this subcommittee because it does protect American \njobs. It does protect American communities. It does protect the \nAmerican people. I hope that today we can conclude our debate on the \nfive pending amendments, move to a vote and try to get our country and \nour economy back again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Louisiana \nbe recognized for 3 minutes and then I follow with the 30 minutes I had \nallotted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments from our \nleader, Senator Mikulski from Maryland, who does a magnificent job as a \nmember of the Appropriations Committee, and particularly in this area \nshe feels passionate about. I look forward to continuing to work with \nher in all sorts of criminal justice areas, particularly as it relates \nto the protection of children. I thank her for those comments.\n  I thank the Senator for giving me a chance to speak very briefly, to \ndo two things: one, to give a statement on an amendment that was \nproposed on this bill by Senator Vitter, that related to adding a \nquestion to the Census. I have submitted a letter on this to him \npersonally.\n  Senator Vitter contends that the founding fathers only believed that \ncitizens should be counted by Census officials for the purposes of \ncongressional apportionment.\n  He argues that the inclusion of noncitizens in the census will result \nin Louisiana losing a congressional seat since the population of States \nlike California and Texas could be inflated by millions of illegal \nimmigrants, making their population growth relatively greater than \nours.\n  Should noncitizens be included in the calculation that determines the \nallocation of seats in the House of Representatives? I believe that the \nanswer is no.\n  But merely adding a question to the Census will not fix that. That \nchange requires an amendment to the Constitution, which states: \n``Representatives shall be apportioned among the several States \naccording to their respective numbers, counting the whole number of \npersons in each State''.\n  I think that the Constitution is clear. But my staff has checked with \nthe Nation's foremost constitutional scholars at Yale, Stanford, and \nUCLA to name a few. They have checked with scholars from the political \nright and scholars from the political left. So far, every single \nscholar agrees: If you want to exclude noncitizens you must amend the \nConstitution.\n  Professor Eugene Volokh, a well-regarded constitutional law scholar \nat UCLA, and a staunch conservative, has written publicly that the \nnotion would be unconstitutional.\n  Were the founders wrong to create the formula for congressional \napportionment in that way? That is a very serious question for all 50 \nStates, but it is far from the most important challenge confronting \nLouisiana today.\n  The fact is that if Louisiana does not bolster law enforcement, our \ncommunities will not be safe enough to attract new residents. If we do \nnot improve our failing public schools, families will not want to call \nLouisiana home, and businesses would not have the employment base that \nwill grow our economy.\n  The truth is that our State has seen more outward migration than any \nother in the Union. Only Louisiana and North Dakota lost population \nthis decade, and Louisiana's population was reduced by a much higher \ndegree.\n  Illegal immigration is a very serious problem. but it is not \nresponsible for Louisiana's loss of representation. Andrew Beveridge, a \nsociologist at Queens\n\n[[Page S11153]]\n\nCollege and the Graduate Center of the City University of New york, has \nshown that even if all illegal immigrants were excluded, Louisiana \nwould still lose a seat.\n  Here is our real problem: Decades of stagnant economic growth drove \nmany Louisianians elsewhere, and that was before Hurricanes Katrina, \nRita, Gustav and Ike severely impacted our populous coastal \ncommunities.\n  Demonstrating that Louisiana means business when it comes to \nreforming our schools and our police departments and our basic \ninfrastructure takes serious work. That is the work that I engage in \nevery day.\n  Blaming immigrants for our problems does not take much effort, but it \nwill not make our State a better place to live either.\n  Secondly, quickly, since Puerto Rico does not have a Senator, as it \nis still a territory and not a State, I wanted to take the opportunity \nto express to the people of Puerto Rico our sadness about a terrible \nexplosion that happened recently, on October 24. It occurred at one of \ntheir major refineries.\n  This came to my attention for two reasons. One, we also have a lot of \nrefineries in Louisiana, so we are sensitive that accidents such as \nthis can happen, but also as the Chair of the Subcommittee on Disaster \nResponse, I wanted to talk a minute about this. The fire burned for 24 \nhours. It destroyed 22 of the 40 storage tanks. Thankfully and \namazingly, no one was killed.\n  I come to the floor to congratulate the local officials, the \nGovernor, the FEMA representatives, the law enforcement that responded \nto this horrific disaster. Some 1,500 people were evacuated, 596 people \nwere sheltered outside of the impacted area. There were 130 \nfirefighters and National Guard troops who worked to bring the inferno \nunder control. The good news is that they did.\n  The purpose of this comment for the Record is to say that training \nand preparedness help. The Members of this body, both Democrats and \nRepublicans, supported additional funding in last year's bill for FEMA \nfor local training. Congress recognized the importance of training. \nSince 2007 we have appropriated over $250 million each year in grants. \nThe post-Katrina emergency management reform gave FEMA regional \nadministrators specific responsibility for coordinating that training.\n  I am encouraged that FEMA seems to have learned some of the lessons \nfrom Hurricane Katrina and also from September 11, which is now several \nyears behind us, but nonetheless still on our minds. So I wanted to say \nthat training, the appropriate amount of investment in training, works. \nAgain, no one was killed.\n  I want to give credit to FEMA and the Governor of Puerto Rico, Luis \nFortuno, for their quick action in keeping people safe, in responding \nto this situation. Hopefully we will continue to refine our processes, \nmake our disaster response even better for disasters such as this. For \nhurricanes, for earthquakes, or for anything else that comes our way, \nwe will be ready and able to respond.\n  I yield the floor and I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for being \ngracious with his time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to spend about 20 minutes \ntalking about amendments I have that are germane and we will be voting \non. But they are small amendments. There is nothing big here. They are \namendments that are designed to make a point.\n  We ran, by a factor of two, the largest deficit in the history of \nthis country. Of the money we spent in the 2009 fiscal year, we \nborrowed 43 percent of it: 43 cents out of every dollar we expended, 43 \ncents we borrowed from our children and our grandchildren.\n  We have before us a bill, the Commerce-Justice-Science bill, that \nwill go up almost 13 percent, 12.6 percent this year, on the back of a \n15.5-percent increase last year. The latest inflation numbers are \ndeflation, a minus four-tenths of 1 percent.\n  The question America has to ask itself, after we pass $800 billion of \nstimulus spending for which this agency got billions which are not \nreflected in any of these increases, is how is it that when we can \nspend $1.4 trillion we do not have, we can come to the floor and \ncontinue to have double-digit increases in almost everything we pass?\n  It does not take a lot of math to figure out that if we keep doing \nwhat we are doing, in 4\\1/2\\ years the size of the Federal Government \ndoubles. If you do this for another 4 years, we will double the size of \nthe Federal Government. So there is absolutely no fiscal restraint \nwithin the appropriations bills that are going through this body with \nthe exception of one, and that is the Defense Department, probably the \none that is most important to us in terms of our national security, in \nterms of where there is no question we have waste but where we need to \nmake sure that we are prepared for the challenges that face us.\n  If you look at what we passed through the body, and you look at 2008, \n2009, you go 10, 9.9, 9.4, 13.0, 13.3, 14.1, 15.7--that was last year--\nand now we are going to go 5.7, 7.2, 1.4, 12.6, 22.5, 16.2, and 12.6.\n  Not only are we on an unsustainable course as far as mandatory \nprograms such as Social Security and Medicare--by the way, we have now \nborrowed from Social Security, stolen from Social Security, $2.4 \ntrillion which we do not even recognize we owe. We do not put it on our \nbalance sheet. We have stolen $758 billion from the Medicare trust \nfund, which we do not even recognize. So we borrowed $3 trillion from \nfunds that were supposed to be there for our seniors and our retirees \nwhich our children--not us; our children and our grandchildren--will \nhave to repay.\n  I saw this the other day on the Internet. It speaks a million words \nto me. Here is a little girl, a toddler with a pacifier in her mouth. \nShe has got a sign hanging around her neck. She says: I am already \n$38,375 in debt and I only own a doll house.\n  The problem with that is that she way understates what she is in debt \nfor. That is just the recognized external debt. That does not count \nwhat we borrowed internally from our grandchildren. It does not count \nthe unfunded liabilities she through her lifetime will never get any \nbenefit from but will pay because we have stolen the benefit for us, \nwithout being good stewards of the money that has been given to us.\n  If you go through this and you look at it, by the time she is 40, she \nwill be responsible for the $1,119,000 worth of debt we have \naccumulated for payments for Medicare, Social Security, and Medicaid \nthat she got absolutely zero benefit from.\n  Then if you think about a $1 million debt for a little girl like this \nand what it costs, what the interest is to fund that debt, if you just \nsaid 6 percent, she has got to make $60,000 first to pay the interest \non that debt before she pays any taxes, her share of the taxes, and \nbefore she has the capability to have a home and have children and have \na college education, own a car. We are absolutely, with bills such as \nthis, strangling her. We are strangling her.\n  I am reminded what one of our Founders said, and it is so important. \nI love the Senator from Maryland. She said we had plenty of money in \nthe checkbook to do this. We do not have plenty of money in the \ncheckbook to do this. What we have is an unlimited credit card that we \nkeep putting into the machine and saying, we will take the money and \nour kids will pay later. That is what we are doing.\n  Thomas Jefferson said, ``I predict future happiness for Americans if \nthey can prevent the government from wasting the labors of the people \nunder the pretense of taking care of them.''\n  When we are seeing 12.6 and 15 percent increases in the nonmandatory \nside, the non-Social Security, the non-Medicare, the non-Medicaid side \nof the budget, we have fallen into the trap Thomas Jefferson was \nworried about.\n  I know my colleagues are sick of me talking about this. But you know \nwhat, the American people are not sick of us talking about it. They get \nit. They realize that we refuse to make hard choices. Every one of them \nis making hard choices today with their families about their future \nbased on their income. Yet we have the gall to bring to the floor \ndouble-digit spending at a time when people, 10 percent of Americans, \nare out of work, seeking work, another 5 percent have given up, and we \nare saying, that is fine if we have a 12-percent increase. It is fine. \nNo problem. There is plenty of money in the checking account.\n\n[[Page S11154]]\n\n  There is no money in the checking account. We are perilously close to \nhaving our foreign policy dictated to us by those who own our bonds, \npeople outside of this country. The time to start changing that is now.\n  I have two little amendments, and one is very instructive. The \npolitical science community is hot and bothered because I would dare to \nsay that maybe in a time of $1.4 trillion deficits, maybe at a time \nwhen we have 10 percent unemployment, maybe at a time when we are at \nthe worst financial condition we have ever been in our country's \nhistory, maybe we ought not spend money asking the questions why \npoliticians give vague answers, or how we can do tele-townhall meetings \nand raise our numbers. Maybe we ought not to spend this money on those \nkinds of things right now.\n  You see, it is instructive because those who are getting from the \nFederal Government now do not care about their grandchildren. What they \nwant is what they are getting now. Give me now; it doesn't matter what \nhappens to the rest of the generations that follow us.\n  So we have the political science community all in an uproar, not \nbecause I am against the study of political science but because I think \nnow is not the time to spend money on that. Now is the time to spend \nmoney we absolutely have to spend, on things which are absolute \nnecessities, as every family in America is making those decisions \ntoday. We do not have the courage to do it because it offends \nindividual interest groups that are getting money from the Federal \nGovernment for a priority that is much less than the defense of this \ncountry, protecting people, securing the future, taking care of their \nhealth care, and making sure we have law and order.\n  You see, Alexander Tyler warned of this as he studied why republics \nfail. He said, ``All republics fail.'' They fail because when people \nlearn they can vote themselves money from the public treasury, all of \nthe other priorities go out the window. They become totally self-\nfocused, self-centered on what is in it for them, with no long-range \nvision, only parochial vision, no vision for the country as a whole, \nbut only what is good for them. It is called self-centeredness. It is \ncalled selfishness. And we perpetuate it in this body by bringing bills \nto the floor that are resistant to amendments that say: Maybe this is \nnot a priority right now.\n  I would bet if you polled the American public and said, we are going \nto run another $1.4 trillion deficit this year, we probably would not \nwant to spend $12 million telling politicians how to stay elected. We \nprobably would not.\n  The fact is, it is major universities that get this small amount of \nmoney are in debt in excess of $50 billion.\n  They have plenty of money to fund this if they wanted, but they don't \ndo it because they are getting from the person who is out of work. They \nare getting from the person who didn't get that job because the economy \nis on its back, because we are borrowing $1.4 trillion and competing \nwith the capital that is required to create a job. It is just a small \namount of money. It by itself won't make any difference. But supporting \nthis amendment will build on confidence with the American people that \nsays, he is right, we ought to be about priorities.\n  We ought to be about doing what is most important first and cutting \nout what is least important because the times call for discipline so we \ndon't further hamstring the generation of children to which this young \nlady belongs. If you take $5 or $6 million and do it once, pretty soon, \nif you have done it 10 times, you have $60 million. You do it another \n10 times, you have $600 million. Pretty soon, we have billions of \ndollars we are not spending because it is low priority and we are not \nborrowing it against our children. All of a sudden, the value of the \ndollar starts to rise. Confidence around the world in the dollar starts \nincreasing. Competition for capital by the Federal Government competing \nin the private sector for the capital goes down. The cost of capital \ngoes down. Credit flows and job opportunities are created. We don't \nconnect that because we have always done it that way. We have a budget \nallocation. As long as we are under that budget allocation, everything \nis fine.\n  Where is the leadership in our country today that says we are going \nto model a leadership that we know the American people expect of us--\nmake hard choices, take the heat to eliminate things that are lower \npriority so that we can preserve the priority of this child and those \nof her generation? The fact is, that leadership is nonexistent. There \nis no reason for anyone to doubt why confidence in the Congress is at \nalltime lows. We are not realists. We are not listening.\n  The message out there, the No. 1 concern with fear isn't health care; \nit is economic. Am I going to have a job tomorrow? Am I going to be \nable to pay my bills? Will I be able to pay my mortgage? There are \nthousands of items in every appropriations bill just like this one, \njust like that amendment that we could eliminate tomorrow. It might \ncreate some small hardship but nothing compared to the hardship we are \ntransferring to the following generation.\n  I have no doubt of the outcome of the votes on my amendments. I \nunderstand we are a resistant, recalcitrant body that refuses to \nrecognize the will and direction of the American people in terms of \ncommonsense priorities. I understand that. But what we must understand \nis, they are awake now, they are listening, and they are watching. It \nis time to respond to the desires of the American people and stop \nresponding to the special interests of those who are getting money from \nthe Federal Government that are low priority in terms of what really \ncounts and really matters for our future.\n  I have one other amendment we will be voting on that transfers money \nto increase the money at the inspector general. It will not slow down \nthe conversion of the Hoover Building at all. We have been told that. \nBut it will help to make good government.\n  Part of our problem in government is about 10 percent of everything \nwe do is pure waste, pure fraud, or pure duplication. If we are going \nto invest dollars in something, we ought to invest in the transparency \nand accountability mechanisms we have already set up.\n  I find myself encouraged by the attitude of the American people, yet \ndiscouraged by the attitude of my colleagues. Nobody wants to take and \nmake the hard choices, the hard choices that say we are going to get \nheat if we start prioritizing. The easiest is to do nothing. The \neasiest is to continue to let the programs run whether they are high \npriority or not. That is easy. But America is having a rumble right \nnow. The ground is shaking. The American people are paying attention. \nThey are going to watch votes just like this one. Then we are going to \nbe called to account as to, why won't you make priority choices, why \nwon't you take the heat.\n  If there ought to be any political science study done, it is, why are \nMembers of Congress such cowards? That is the thing we ought to study. \nWe ought to study why we refuse to do the right thing because it puts \nour job at risk. We ought to be doing the right thing when it does put \nour job at risk and when it doesn't.\n  I will finish up by reminding us of what our oath is. Our oath never \nmentions our State. Our oath never mentions our special interest. Our \noath never mentions our campaign contributors. What our oath mentions \nis that we are Senators of the United States--not from Oklahoma, not \nfrom Delaware, not from Maryland, not from Ohio. We are Senators of the \nUnited States; we just happen to be from those places. Our oath is to \nthe long-term best interest of the country, never a parochial interest.\n  As you go through these bills, what you see are parochial interests \ntrumping the long-term best interests of the country. That is not to \ndemean the fine job the Senator from Maryland has done. She came in \nwith the number that was given her. There is no question that she \nprobably made some tough choices as she did that. But we haven't made \nenough. This kind of increase in this kind of bill is absurd. It is \nobscene. It is obscene at a time when the average family's income is \ndeclining, their ability to have the freedom to make choices, relaxed \nchoices about what they do versus very stern choices about what is a \nnecessity. We have not gotten the message.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n[[Page S11155]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2669\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of amendment No. 2669 that \nhas been offered by Senator Graham, with Senators Webb, McCain, and \nmyself as cosponsors. It is a pending amendment.\n  The purpose of this amendment is quite straightforward. It would \nprevent the use of any funds made available to the Department of \nJustice by this appropriations bill from being used to prosecute any \nindividual suspected of involvement in the 9/11/01 attacks against the \nUnited States in an article III court--that means essentially a regular \nFederal court created pursuant to article III of our Constitution.\n  Why would we feel we need to do such a thing? It is because the \ncurrent protocol governing the disposition of cases referred for \npossible prosecution of detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba, the current protocol of the U.S. Department of Justice governing \nthe referral of these detainees from Guantanamo Bay, says as follows:\n\n       No. 2, Factors for Determination of Prosecution. There is a \n     presumption that, where feasible, referred cases will be \n     prosecuted in an Article III court in keeping with \n     traditional principles of federal prosecution.\n\n  It is because we who are sponsoring this amendment think there is a \nfundamental error of judgment--in fact, in its way, an act of \ninjustice--that these individuals, suspected terrorists being held at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, suspected in this case, according to our \namendment, of having been involved in the attacks of 9/11 on the United \nStates which resulted in the deaths of almost 3,000 people, that these \nindividuals would be tried in a regular U.S. Federal court as if they \nwere accused of violating our criminal laws. They are not common \ncriminals or uncommon criminals; they are suspected of being war \ncriminals. As such, they should not be brought to prosecution in a \ntraditional Federal court along with other accused criminals.\n  Citizens of the United States have all the right to the protections \nof our Constitution in the Federal courts, article III courts of the \nUnited States. These are suspected terrorist war criminals who are not \nentitled to all the protections of our Constitution and whose \nprosecution should not be confused with a normal criminal law \nprosecution. They are war criminals. They ought to be tried according \nto all the rules that prevail for war criminals, including, of course, \nthe Geneva Conventions.\n  This Congress has established a tradition and improved in recent \ntimes a system of military commissions, a system adopted by both Houses \nof Congress, signed into law by the President, which provides standards \nof due process and fairness in the trial of suspected war criminals, \nnot just in compliance with the Geneva Conventions and the Supreme \nCourt of the United States but well above the standards that have been \nrequired by both the Supreme Court and the Geneva Conventions.\n  Those who are accused of committing the heinous, cowardly acts of \nintentionally targeting unsuspecting, defenseless civilians in an act \nof war as part of a larger declared war of Islamic extremists against, \nfrankly, anybody who is not like them--the most numerous victims of \nthese Islamic terrorists around the world are fellow Muslims who don't \nagree with their extremism. They have killed many people of other \nreligions. When they struck us in the United States on 9/11, they \nkilled an extraordinary classically American diverse group of people. \nThe only reason they were targeted was that they were in the United \nStates. The terrorists, these people who are suspected of being \nterrorists participating in and aiding the attacks of 9/11, are war \ncriminals, not common criminals. They should, therefore, be tried by a \nmilitary commission system, which goes back as long as the \nRevolutionary War in the United States. There is a proud and fair \ntradition. We have upgraded and strengthened all the due process and \nlegal protections of them after 9/11. So why would we take these war \ncriminals, suspected war criminals, and bring them into the criminal \ncourts of the United States and give them the rights of the \nConstitution. I don't understand.\n  Every Member of the Senate received a letter today from quite a large \nnumber of families of the victims of 9/11, 140-plus at last writing. I \nwant to read briefly from the letter. The letter is in support of the \namendment Senators Graham, Webb, McCain, and I have offered.\n\n       The American people were rightly outraged by this act of \n     war. Whether the cause was retribution or simple recognition \n     of our common humanity, the words ``Never Forget'' were \n     invoked in tearful or angry rectitude, defiantly written in \n     the dust of Ground Zero or humbly penned on makeshift \n     memorials all across this land.\n       The country was united in its determination that these acts \n     should not go unmarked and unpunished.\n       Eight long years have passed since that dark and terrible \n     day.\n\n  Remember, Mr. President, this is written by people who lost dear ones \non 9/11.\n  They continue:\n\n       Sadly, some have forgotten the promises we made to those \n     whose lives were taken in such a cruel and vicious manner.\n       We have not forgotten. We are the husbands and wives, \n     mothers and fathers, sons, daughters, sisters, brothers and \n     other family members of the victims of these depraved and \n     barbaric attacks, and we feel a profound obligation to ensure \n     that justice is done on their behalf.\n\n  They continue:\n\n       It is incomprehensible to us that Members of the United \n     States Congress would propose that the same men who today \n     refer to the murder of our loved ones as a ``blessed day'' \n     and who targeted the United States Capitol for the same kind \n     of destruction that was wrought in New York, Virginia and \n     Pennsylvania, should be the beneficiaries of a social compact \n     of which they are not a part, do not recognize, and which \n     they seek to destroy: the United States Constitution.\n\n  So they say:\n\n       We adamantly oppose prosecuting the 9/11 conspirators in \n     Article III courts, which would provide them with the very \n     rights that may make it possible for them to escape the \n     justice which they so richly deserve. We believe that \n     military commissions . . . are the appropriate legal forum \n     for the individuals who declared war on America.\n\n  Mr. President, I know there will be further debate on this amendment, \nbut I ask my colleagues to join in this. We are doing it not just \nbecause of the protocol I cited at the beginning but because of stories \nthat are emanating that perhaps as early as next week, the Department \nof Justice will announce they are going to bring Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed, the man who planned the 9/11 attacks, who is in our custody, \nto trial in a Federal court. This man is, from all that I know, one of \nthe devils of history, an evil man who wrought terrible destruction and \nsuffering on our country, and he ought to be given due process, but he \nought to be given due process in a forum reserved for suspected war \ncriminals, and that is the military commissions.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The senior Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nLieberman. Along with Senator Graham and Senator Webb, we are strongly \nsupporting this amendment.\n  Senator Lieberman made reference to a letter that has currently been \nsigned by 214 9/11 family members. Mr. President, I ask unanimous \nconsent that this letter be printed in the Record, along with an \narticle from the Wall Street Journal dated October 19, 2009, entitled \n``Civilian Courts Are No Place To Try Terrorists'' by Michael B. \nMukasey, the former Attorney General of the United States of America.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 November 5, 2009.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     The U.S. Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On September 11, 2001, the entire world \n     watched as 19 men hijacked four commercial airliners, \n     attacking passengers and killing crew members, and then \n     turned the fully-fueled planes into missiles, flying them \n     into the World Trade Center twin towers, the Pentagon and a \n     field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania. 3,000 of our fellow human \n     beings died in two hours. The nation's commercial aviation \n     system ground to a halt. Lower Manhattan was turned into a \n     war zone, shutting down the New York Stock Exchange for days \n     and causing tens of thousands of residents and workers to be \n     displaced. In nine months, an estimated 50,000 rescue and \n     recovery workers willingly exposed themselves to toxic \n     conditions to dig out the ravaged remains of their fellow \n     citizens buried in 1.8 million tons of twisted steel and \n     concrete.\n       The American people were rightly outraged by this act of \n     war. Whether the cause was retribution or simple recognition \n     of our\n\n[[Page S11156]]\n\n     common humanity, the words ``Never Forget'' were invoked in \n     tearful or angry rectitude, defiantly written in the dust of \n     Ground Zero or humbly penned on makeshift memorials erected \n     all across the land. The country was united in its \n     determination that these acts should not go unmarked and \n     unpunished.\n       Eight long years have passed since that dark and terrible \n     day. Sadly, some have forgotten the promises we made to those \n     whose lives were taken in such a cruel and vicious manner.\n       We have not forgotten. We are the husbands and wives, \n     mothers and fathers, sons, daughters, sisters, brothers and \n     other family members of the victims of these depraved and \n     barbaric attacks, and we feel a profound obligation to ensure \n     that justice is done on their behalf. It is incomprehensible \n     to us that members of the United States Congress would \n     propose that the same men who today refer to the murder of \n     our loved ones as a ``blessed day'' and who targeted the \n     United States Capitol for the same kind of destruction that \n     was wrought in New York, Virginia and Pennsylvania, should be \n     the beneficiaries of a social compact of which they are not a \n     part, do not recognize, and which they seek to destroy: the \n     United States Constitution.\n       We adamantly oppose prosecuting the 9/11 conspirators in \n     Article III courts, which would provide them with the very \n     rights that may make it possible for them to escape the \n     justice which they so richly deserve. We believe that \n     military commissions, which have a long and honorable history \n     in this country dating back to the Revolutionary War, are the \n     appropriate legal forum for the individuals who declared war \n     on America. With utter disdain for all norms of decency and \n     humanity, and in defiance of the laws of warfare accepted by \n     all civilized nations, these individuals targeted tens of \n     thousands of civilian non-combatants, brutally killing 3,000 \n     men, women and children, injuring thousands more, and \n     terrorizing millions.\n       We support Senate Amendment 2669 (pursuant to H.R. 2847, \n     the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act of 2010), \n     ``prohibiting the use of funds for the prosecution in Article \n     III courts of the United States of individuals involved in \n     the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.'' We urge its \n     passage by all those members of the United States Senate who \n     stood on the senate floor eight years ago and declared that \n     the perpetrators of these attacks would answer to the \n     American people. The American people will not understand why \n     those same senators now vote to allow our cherished federal \n     courts to be manipulated and used as a stage by the \n     ``mastermind of 9/11'' and his co-conspirators to condemn \n     this nation and rally their fellow terrorists the world over. \n     As one New York City police detective, who lost 60 fellow \n     officers on 9/11, told members of the Department of Justice's \n     Detainee Policy Task Force at a meeting last June, ``You \n     people are out of touch. You need to hear the locker room \n     conversations of the people who patrol your streets and fight \n     your wars.''\n       The President of the United States has stated that military \n     commissions, promulgated by congressional legislation and \n     recently reformed with even greater protections for \n     defendants, are a legal and appropriate forum to try \n     individuals captured pursuant the 2001 Authorization for the \n     Use of Military Force Act, passed by Congress in response to \n     the attack on America. Nevertheless, on May 21, 2009, \n     President Obama announced a new policy that Al-Qaeda \n     terrorists should be tried in Article III courts ``whenever \n     feasible.''\n       We strongly object to the President creating a two-tier \n     system of justice for terrorists in which those responsible \n     for the death of thousands on 9/11 will be treated as common \n     criminals and afforded the kind of platinum due process \n     accorded American citizens, yet members of Al Qaeda who \n     aspire to kill Americans but who do not yet have blood on \n     their hands, will be treated as war criminals. The President \n     offers no explanation or justification for this \n     contradiction, even as he readily acknowledges that the \n     9/11 conspirators, now designated ``unprivileged enemy \n     belligerents,'' are appropriately accused of war crimes. We \n     believe that this two-tier system, in which war criminals \n     receive more due process protections than would-be war \n     criminals, will be mocked and rejected in the court of world \n     opinion as an ill-conceived contrivance aimed, not at \n     justice, but at the appearance of moral authority.\n       The public has a right to know that prosecuting the 9/11 \n     conspirators in federal courts will result in a plethora of \n     legal and procedural problems that will severely limit or \n     even jeopardize the successful prosecution of their cases. \n     Ordinary criminal trials do not allow for the exigencies \n     associated with combatants captured in war, in which evidence \n     is not collected with CSI-type chain-of-custody standards. \n     None of the 9/11 conspirators were given the Miranda warnings \n     mandated in Article III courts. Prosecutors contend that the \n     lengthy, self-incriminating tutorials Khalid Sheikh Mohammed \n     and others gave to CIA interrogators about 9/11 and other \n     terrorist operations--called ``pivotal for the war against \n     Al-Qaeda'' in a recently released, declassified 2005 CIA \n     report--may be excluded in federal trials. Further, unlike \n     military commissions, all of the 9/11 cases will be \n     vulnerable in federal court to defense motions that their \n     prosecutions violate the Speedy Trial Act. Indeed, the judge \n     presiding in the case of Ahmed Ghailani, accused of \n     participating in the 1998 bombing of the American Embassy in \n     Kenya, killing 212 people, has asked for that issue to be \n     briefed by the defense. Ghailani was indicted in 1998, \n     captured in Pakistan in 2004, and held at Guantanamo Bay \n     until 2009.\n       Additionally, federal rules risk that classified evidence \n     protected in military commissions would be exposed in \n     criminal trials, revealing intelligence sources and methods \n     and compromising foreign partners, who will be unwilling to \n     join with the United States in future secret or covert \n     operations if doing so will risk exposure in the dangerous \n     and hostile communities where they operate. This poses a \n     clear and present danger to the public. The safety and \n     security of the American people is the President's and \n     Congress's highest duty.\n       Former Attorney General Michael Mukasey recently wrote in \n     the Wall Street Journal that ``the challenges of terrorism \n     trials are overwhelming.'' Mr. Mukasey, formerly a federal \n     judge in the Southern District of New York, presided over the \n     multi-defendant terrorism prosecution of Sheikh Omar Abel \n     Rahman, the cell that attacked the World Trade Center in 1993 \n     and conspired to attack other New York landmarks. In addition \n     to the evidentiary problems cited above, he expressed concern \n     about courthouse and jail facility security, the need for \n     anonymous jurors to be escorted under armed guard, the \n     enormous costs associated with the use of U.S. marshals \n     necessarily deployed from other jurisdictions, and the danger \n     to the community which, he says, will become a target for \n     homegrown terrorist sympathizers or embedded Al Qaeda cells.\n       Finally, there is the sickening prospect of men like Khalid \n     Sheikh Mohammed being brought to the federal courthouse in \n     Lower Manhattan, or the courthouse in Alexandria, Virginia, \n     just a few blocks away from the scene of carnage eight years \n     ago, being given a Constitutionally mandated platform upon \n     which he can mock his victims, exult in the suffering of \n     their families, condemn the judge and his own lawyers, and \n     rally his followers to continue jihad against the men and \n     women of the U.S. military, fighting and dying in the sands \n     of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan on behalf of us all.\n       There is no guarantee that Mr. Mohammed and his co-\n     conspirators will plead guilty, as in the case of Zacarias \n     Moussaoui, whose prosecution nevertheless took four years, \n     and who is currently attempting to recant that plea. Their \n     attorneys will be given wide latitude to mount a defense that \n     turns the trial into a shameful circus aimed at vilifying \n     agents of the CIA for alleged acts of ``torture,'' casting \n     the American government and our valiant military as a force \n     of evil instead of a force for good in places of the Muslim \n     World where Al Qaeda and the Taliban are waging a brutal war \n     against them and the local populations. For the families of \n     those who died on September 11, the most obscene aspect of \n     giving Constitutional protections to those who planned the \n     attacks with the intent of inflicting maximum terror on their \n     victims in the last moments of their lives will be the \n     opportunities this affords defense lawyers to cast their \n     clients as victims.\n       Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his co-conspirators are asking \n     to plead guilty, now, before a duly-constituted military \n     commission. We respectfully ask members of Congress, why \n     don't we let them?\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     (214 Family Members).\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 19, 2009]\n\n             Civilian Courts Are No Place To Try Terrorists\n\n                        (By Michael B. Mukasey)\n\n       The Obama administration has said it intends to try several \n     of the prisoners now detained at Guantanamo Bay in civilian \n     courts in this country. This would include Khalid Sheikh \n     Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks, and other detainees allegedly involved. The Justice \n     Department claims that our courts are well suited to the \n     task.\n       Based on my experience trying such cases, and what I saw as \n     attorney general, they aren't. That is not to say that \n     civilian courts cannot ever handle terrorist prosecutions, \n     but rather that their role in a war on terror--to use an \n     unfashionably harsh phrase--should be, as the term ``war'' \n     would suggest, a supporting and not a principal role.\n       The challenges of a terrorism trial are overwhelming. To \n     maintain the security of the courthouse and the jail \n     facilities where defendants are housed, deputy U.S. marshals \n     must be recruited from other jurisdictions; jurors must be \n     selected anonymously and escorted to and from the courthouse \n     under armed guard; and judges who preside over such cases \n     often need protection as well. All such measures burden an \n     already overloaded justice system and interfere with the \n     handling of other cases, both criminal and civil.\n       Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the places \n     of both trial and confinement for such defendants would \n     become attractive targets for others intent on creating \n     mayhem, whether it be terrorists intent on inflicting \n     casualties on the local population, or lawyers intent on \n     filing waves of lawsuits over issues as diverse as whether \n     those captured in combat must be charged with crimes or \n     released, or the conditions of confinement for all prisoners, \n     whether convicted or not.\n       Even after conviction, the issue is not whether a maximum-\n     security prison can hold these defendants; of course it can. \n     But\n\n[[Page S11157]]\n\n     their presence even inside the walls, as proselytizers if \n     nothing else, is itself a danger. The recent arrest of U.S. \n     citizen Michael Finton, a convert to Islam proselytized in \n     prison and charged with planning to blow up a building in \n     Springfield, Ill., is only the latest example of that \n     problem.\n       Moreover, the rules for conducting criminal trials in \n     federal courts have been fashioned to prosecute conventional \n     crimes by conventional criminals. Defendants are granted \n     access to information relating to their case that might be \n     useful in meeting the charges and shaping a defense, without \n     regard to the wider impact such information might have. That \n     can provide a cornucopia of valuable information to \n     terrorists, both those in custody and those at large.\n       Thus, in the multidefendant terrorism prosecution of Sheik \n     Omar Abdel Rahman and others that I presided over in 1995 in \n     federal district court in Manhattan, the government was \n     required to disclose, as it is routinely in conspiracy cases, \n     the identity of all known co-conspirators, regardless of \n     whether they are charged as defendants. One of those \n     coconspirators, relatively obscure in 1995, was Osama bin \n     Laden. It was later learned that soon after the \n     government's disclosure the list of unindicted co-\n     conspirators had made its way to bin Laden in Khartoum, \n     Sudan, where he then resided. He was able to learn not \n     only that the government was aware of him, but also who \n     else the government was aware of.\n       It is not simply the disclosure of information under \n     discovery rules that can be useful to terrorists. The \n     testimony in a public trial, particularly under the probing \n     of appropriately diligent defense counsel, can elicit \n     evidence about means and methods of evidence collection that \n     have nothing to do with the underlying issues in the case, \n     but which can be used to press government witnesses to either \n     disclose information they would prefer to keep confidential \n     or make it appear that they are concealing facts. The \n     alternative is to lengthen criminal trials beyond what is \n     tolerable by vetting topics in closed sessions before they \n     can be presented in open ones.\n       In June, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the \n     transfer of Ahmed Ghailani to this country from Guantanamo. \n     Mr. Ghailani was indicted in connection with the 1998 bombing \n     of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was captured in \n     2004, after others had already been tried here for that \n     bombing.\n       Mr. Ghailani was to be tried before a military commission \n     for that and other war crimes committed afterward, but when \n     the Obama administration elected to close Guantanamo, the \n     existing indictment against Mr. Ghailani in New York \n     apparently seemed to offer an attractive alternative. It may \n     be as well that prosecuting Mr. Ghailani in an already \n     pending case in New York was seen as an opportunity to \n     illustrate how readily those at Guantanamo might be \n     prosecuted in civilian courts. After all, as Mr. Holder said \n     in his June announcement, four defendants were ``successfully \n     prosecuted'' in that case.\n       It is certainly true that four defendants already were \n     tried and sentenced in that case. But the proceedings were \n     far from exemplary. The jury declined to impose the death \n     penalty, which requires unanimity, when one juror disclosed \n     at the end of the trial that he could not impose the death \n     penalty--even though he had sworn previously that he could. \n     Despite his disclosure, the juror was permitted to serve and \n     render a verdict.\n       Mr. Holder failed to mention it, but there was also a fifth \n     defendant in the case, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim. He never \n     participated in the trial. Why? Because, before it began, in \n     a foiled attempt to escape a maximum security prison, he \n     sharpened a plastic comb into a weapon and drove it through \n     the eye and into the brain of Louis Pepe, a 42-year-old \n     Bureau of Prisons guard. Mr. Pepe was blinded in one eye and \n     rendered nearly unable to speak.\n       Salim was prosecuted separately for that crime and found \n     guilty of attempted murder. There are many words one might \n     use to describe how these events unfolded; ``successfully'' \n     is not among them.\n       The very length of Mr. Ghailani's detention prior to being \n     brought here for prosecution presents difficult issues. The \n     Speedy Trial Act requires that those charged be tried within \n     a relatively  short time after they are charged or captured, \n     whichever comes last. Even if the pending charge against \n     Mr. Ghailani is not dismissed for violation of that \n     statute, he may well seek access to what the government \n     knows of his activities after the embassy bombings, even \n     if those activities are not charged in the pending \n     indictment. Such disclosures could seriously compromise \n     sources and methods of intelligence gathering.\n       Finally, the government (for undisclosed reasons) has \n     chosen not to seek the death penalty against Mr. Ghailani, \n     even though that penalty was sought, albeit unsuccessfully, \n     against those who stood trial earlier. The embassy bombings \n     killed more than 200 people.\n       Although the jury in the earlier case declined to sentence \n     the defendants to death, that determination does not bind a \n     future jury. However, when the government determines not to \n     seek the death penalty against a defendant charged with \n     complicity in the murder of hundreds, that potentially \n     distorts every future capital case the government prosecutes. \n     Put simply, once the government decides not to seek the death \n     penalty against a defendant charged with mass murder, how can \n     it justify seeking the death penalty against anyone charged \n     with murder--however atrocious--on a smaller scale?\n       Even a successful prosecution of Mr. Ghailani, with none of \n     the possible obstacles described earlier, would offer no \n     example of how the cases against other Guantanamo detainees \n     can be handled. The embassy bombing case was investigated for \n     prosecution in a court, with all of the safeguards in \n     handling evidence and securing witnesses that attend such a \n     prosecution. By contrast, the charges against other detainees \n     have not been so investigated.\n       It was anticipated that if those detainees were to be tried \n     at all, it would be before a military commission where the \n     touchstone for admissibility of evidence was simply relevance \n     and apparent reliability. Thus, the circumstances of their \n     capture on the battlefield could be described by affidavit if \n     necessary, without bringing to court the particular soldier \n     or unit that effected the capture, so long as the affidavit \n     and surrounding circumstances appeared reliable. No such \n     procedure would be permitted in an ordinary civilian court.\n       Moreover, it appears likely that certain charges could not \n     be presented in a civilian court because the proof that would \n     have to be offered could, if publicly disclosed, compromise \n     sources and methods of intelligence gathering. The military \n     commissions regimen established for use at Guantanamo was \n     designed with such considerations in mind. It provided a way \n     of handling classified information so as to make it available \n     to a defendant's counsel while preserving confidentiality. \n     The courtroom facility at Guantanamo was constructed, at a \n     cost of millions of dollars, specifically to accommodate the \n     handling of classified information and the heightened \n     security needs of a trial of such defendants.\n       Nevertheless, critics of Guantanamo seem to believe that if \n     we put our vaunted civilian justice system on display in \n     these cases, then we will reap benefits in the coin of world \n     opinion, and perhaps even in that part of the world that \n     wishes us ill. Of course, we did just that after the first \n     World Trade Center bombing, after the plot to blow up \n     airliners over the Pacific, and after the embassy bombings in \n     Kenya and Tanzania.\n       In return, we got the 9/11 attacks and the murder of nearly \n     3,000 innocents. True, this won us a great deal of goodwill \n     abroad--people around the globe lined up for blocks outside \n     our embassies to sign the condolence books. That is the kind \n     of goodwill we can do without.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, who will be made \naware of a letter from Mr. Holder and Secretary Gates, who are urging \ndefeat of this amendment, to look at the views of the previous Attorney \nGeneral of the United States, which are diametrically opposed.\n  The 9/11 families say--and I am sure they represent all of the 9/11 \nfamilies--\n\n       We adamantly oppose prosecuting the 9/11 conspirators in \n     Article III courts, which would provide them with the very \n     rights that may make it possible for them to escape the \n     justice which they so richly deserve. We believe that \n     military commissions, which have a long and honorable history \n     in this country dating back to the Revolutionary War, are the \n     appropriate legal forum for the individuals who declared war \n     on America. With utter disdain for all norms of decency and \n     humanity, and in defiance of the laws of warfare accepted by \n     all civilized nations, these individuals targeted tens of \n     thousands of civilian non-combatants, brutally killing 3,000 \n     men, women and children, injuring thousands more, and \n     terrorizing millions.\n\n  I would be glad to respond to a question from the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona. I would \nask the Senator if he would be kind enough to ask unanimous consent \nthat I could follow him, speaking after his remarks.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Illinois follow me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, these are the 9/11 families. All Americans \nwere impacted by 9/11, the 9/11 families in the most tragic fashion. \nThis is a very strong letter from them concerning the strong desire \nthat these 9/11 conspirators not be tried in article III courts but be \ntried according to the military commissions.\n  The 9/11 victims experienced an act of war against the United States, \ncarried out not on some distant shore but in our communities on the \nvery symbols of our national power. Because it involved attacks on \ninnocent civilians and innocent civilian targets, it is a war crime. It \nis a war crime that was committed by the 9/11 terrorists. It is \nimportant that we call things what they are and not gloss over the \nessence of these events, even though they occurred 8 years ago.\n  In response to the attacks, the Congress quickly and overwhelmingly \npassed the Authorization for Use of\n\n[[Page S11158]]\n\nMilitary Force giving the President the authority to ``use all \nnecessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, \nor persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the \nterrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001. . . .'' The \nSenate passed this legislation unanimously.\n  The Authorization for Use of Military Force recognized the true \nnature of these attacks and committed the entire resources of the \nUnited States to our self-defense in light of the grave threat to our \nnational security and foreign policy. The United States does not go to \nwar over a domestic criminal act, nor should it. It was clearly \nunderstood at that time that far more was at stake. We sent our sons \nand daughters off to war, where they have been bravely risking their \nlives and futures on our behalf for the last 8 years.\n  Given the facts and history of the \n9/11 attacks, we should not deal with the treachery and barbarism of \nthe slaughter of thousands of innocent civilians as a matter of law \nenforcement in the ordinary sense. To do so would belittle the events \nthat transpired, the symbolism and purpose of the attacks, the huge \nnumber of lives that were lost, and the threat posed to the United \nStates--which continues in the caves and sanctuaries of al-Qaida to \nthis day.\n  During my life, I have been a warrior, although that seems a long \ntime ago now. I have some experience in the reality of combat and the \nsuffering it brings. I know something of the law of war, having fought \nconstrained by it and having lived through it, with the help of my \ncomrades and my faith, times when my former enemy felt unconstrained by \nit.\n  No, the attacks of 9/11 were not a crime; they were a war crime. \nTogether with my colleagues in Congress, I have worked closely with the \nPresident to provide a means to address war crimes committed against \nthis country in a war crimes tribunal--the Military Commissions Act of \n2009. It was designed specifically for this purpose. It should be used \nnot to mete out a guilty verdict and sentence that could not be \nachieved in Federal criminal court but to call things what they are, to \nbe unshakable in our resolve to respond to the unprecedented attacks of \n9/11 consistent with the Authorization for Use of Military Force and to \ntell this and any future enemy that when they attack our innocent \ncivilians at home, we will not be sending the police after them to make \nan arrest.\n  By denying funds to the Department of Justice to prosecute these \nhorrendous crimes in article III courts, I do not mean these outrages \nagainst our country and its citizens should go unpunished. In fact, I \nhave long argued that justice in these cases was long overdue and that \nprosecutions should be pursued as expeditiously as possible. Rather, my \nsupport for this amendment is based on my unshakable view that these \nevents were acts of war and war crimes and that the proper forum for \nbringing the war criminals to justice is a military tribunal consistent \nwith longstanding traditions in this country that date back to George \nWashington's Continental Army during the founding of the Republic.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment so \nthat the prosecution of war crimes will take place in the traditional \nand long-accepted forum of a military tribunal, as the Congress \noverwhelmingly enacted in 2006 and which the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for 2010 amended and improved in a statute that was \nenacted into law by President Obama just days ago.\n  Again, I hope we will, as we have in the past, listen to the families \nof 9/11. From the trauma and sorrow of the tragedy they experienced in \nthe loss of their families, they became a force. They became a force \nthat without them we would have never had the 9/11 Commission, we would \nhave never been able to make the reforms that arguably have made our \nNation much safer.\n  Now, today, the families are standing up and saying: Try these war \ncriminals according to war crimes which they committed--the heinous \nacts of 9/11, which I know Americans will never forget.\n  Mr. President, I hope we will vote in favor of the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I have great respect for my colleagues \nfrom Arizona and Connecticut, but I respectfully disagree with them on \nthis amendment.\n  If this amendment passes, it will say that the only people in the \nworld who cannot be tried in the courts of America for crimes of \nterrorism are those who are accused of terrorism on 9/11. Think about \nthat for a moment. The argument is being made that we should say to the \nPresident and Attorney General that when they plot their strategy to go \nafter the men and women responsible for 9/11, we will prohibit them, by \nthe language of this amendment, from considering the prosecution of \nthese terrorists in the courts of America.\n  What are the odds of prosecuting a terrorist successfully in the \ncourts of America, our criminal courts, as opposed to military \ncommissions, commissions that have been created by law, argued before \nthe Supreme Court, debated at great length? What are the odds of a \nsuccessful prosecution of a terrorist in the courts of our land as \nopposed to a military commission? I can tell you what the odds are. \nThey are 65 to 1 in favor of prosecution in our courts. Mr. President, \n195 terrorists have been prosecuted in our courts since 9/11. Three \nhave been prosecuted by military commissions. But the offerers of this \namendment want to tie the hands of our Department of Justice and tell \nthem: You cannot spend a penny, not one cent, to pursue the prosecution \nof a terrorist in an American court.\n  Who disagrees with this amendment? It is not just this Senator from \nIllinois. It would be our Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, and our \nAttorney General, Eric Holder. Here is what they said in a letter to \nall Members of the Senate about this amendment:\n\n       We write to oppose the amendment proposed by Senator Graham \n     (on behalf of himself and Senators McCain and Lieberman). . . \n     . This amendment would prohibit the use of Department of \n     Justice funds ``to commence or continue the prosecution in an \n     Article III court of the United States of an individual \n     suspected of planning, authorizing, organizing, committing, \n     or aiding the attacks on the United States and its citizens \n     that occurred on September 11, 2001.''\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       As you know, both the Department of Justice and the \n     Department of Defense have responsibility for prosecuting \n     alleged terrorists. Pursuant to a joint prosecution protocol, \n     our departments are currently engaged in a careful case-by-\n     case evaluation of the cases of Guantanamo detainees who have \n     been referred for possible prosecution, to determine whether \n     they should be prosecuted in an Article III, court or by \n     military commission. We are confident that the forum \n     selection decisions that are made pursuant to this process \n     will best serve our national security interests.\n       We believe it would be unwise, and would set a dangerous \n     precedent, for Congress to restrict the discretion of either \n     department to fund particular prosecutions. The exercise of \n     prosecutorial discretion has always been and should remain an \n     Executive Branch function. We must be in a position to use \n     every lawful instrument of national power--including both \n     courts and military commissions--to ensure that terrorists \n     are brought to justice and can no longer threaten American \n     lives.\n       For these reasons, we respectfully request that you oppose \n     this amendment.\n\n  This amendment would hinder President Obama's efforts to combat \nterrorism. That is why the Secretary of Defense and the Attorney \nGeneral have written to each one of us urging us to vote no.\n  The Graham amendment would be an unprecedented intrusion into the \nauthority of the executive branch of our government to combat \nterrorism.\n  There is a great argument. For 8 long years, Republicans argued it \nwas inappropriate to interfere in any way with President Bush's \nCommander in Chief authority. Time and again, we were told by our \nRepublican colleagues that it is inappropriate and even \nunconstitutional for Congress to ask basic questions about the Bush \nadministration's policies on issues such as Iraq, Guantanamo, torture, \nor warrantless wiretapping. Time and again, we were told that Congress \nshould defer to the Defense Department's expertise.\n  Let me give one example. On September 19, 2007, the author of this \namendment, Senator Graham, said, and I quote:\n\n       The last thing we need in any war is to have the ability of \n     535 people who are worried about the next election to be able \n     to micromanage how you fight the war. This is not only \n     micromanagement, this is a constitutional shift of power.\n\n\n[[Page S11159]]\n\n\n  Just 2 years later, a different President of a different party, and \nmy Republican colleagues have a different view. My colleagues think \nCongress should not defer to that very same Defense Secretary, Robert \nGates, and they think it is not only appropriate but urgent for \nCongress to tie the hands of this administration, making it more \ndifficult to bring terrorists to justice. Clearly, there is a double \nstandard at work.\n  Some of my Republican colleagues argue that Federal courts are not \nwell suited to prosecute terrorists, and terrorists should only be \nprosecuted by military commissions. But look at the facts. Since 9/11, \n195 terrorists have been convicted in Federal courts. Three have been \nconvicted by military commissions. Again, the odds are 65 to 1 that if \nwe want to find a terrorist guilty and be incarcerated for endangering \nor killing Americans, it is better to go to a regular court in America \nthan to a military commission. That is the record since 9/11.\n  According to the Justice Department, since January 1 of this year, \nmore than 30 terrorists have been successfully prosecuted or sentenced \nin Federal courts. I would like to ask my colleagues behind this \namendment and their inspiration, the Wall Street Journal: Was this a \nmistake, taking accused terrorists into our courts and successfully \nprosecuting them under the laws of America?\n  Clearly, it was not. The Department of Justice made the right \ndecision effectively prosecuting these individuals and, equally \nimportant, showing to the world we would take these people accused of \nterrorism into the very same system of justice that applies to every \none of us as American citizens, hold them to the same standards of \nproof, give them the rights that are accorded to them in our court \nsystem, and come to a just verdict.\n  That is an important message. It is a message which says we can treat \nthese individuals in our judicial system in a fair way and come to a \nfair conclusion and find justice, and we did--195 times since 9/11, 30 \ntimes just this year.\n  Recently, the administration transferred Ahmed Ghailani to the United \nStates to prosecute him for involvement in the 1998 bombings of our \nEmbassies in Kenya and Tanzania. Those bombings killed 224 people, \nincluding 12 Americans. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nhave been very critical of this administration's decision to bring this \nman to justice in the courts of America. One of them, a House \nRepublican Member from Virginia, Eric Cantor, said, and I quote:\n\n       We have no judicial precedence for the conviction of \n     someone like this.\n\n  That is from Congressman Cantor. Unfortunately, the Congressman is \nwrong. There are many precedents for convicting terrorists in U.S. \ncourts. I will name a few: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 \nWorld Trade Center bombing; Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind \nSheikh; Richard Reid, the Shoe Bomber; Zacarias Moussaoui; Ted \nKaczynski, the Unabomber; and Terry Nichols, the Oklahoma City \ncoconspirator. They were all accused of terrorism. Some were citizens \nof the United States, some not. All were tried in the same article III \ncourts which this amendment would prohibit--would prohibit--our \nPresident and Attorney General from using.\n  In fact, there is precedent for convicting terrorists who were \ninvolved in the bombing of U.S. Embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, the \nsame attack in which Ahmed Ghailani was allegedly involved. In 2001, \nfour men were sentenced to life without parole at the Federal \ncourthouse in Lower Manhattan, the same court in which Mr. Ghailani \nwill be tried. To argue that we cannot successfully prosecute a \nterrorist in American courts is to ignore the truth and ignore history.\n  Susan Hirsch lost her husband in the Kenya Embassy bombing. She \ntestified at the sentencing hearing for the four terrorists who were \nconvicted in 2001. Mrs. Hirsch said she supports the Obama \nadministration's decision to prosecute Ahmed Ghailani for that same \nbombing that took the life of her husband. She said, and I quote:\n\n       I am relieved we are finally moving forward. It is really, \n     really important to me that anyone we have in custody accused \n     of acts related to the deaths of my husband and others be \n     held accountable for what they have done.\n\n  Mrs. Hirsch also said she believes it is safe to try Ahmed Ghailani \nin a Federal court. I quote her again: ``I have some trust in the New \nYork Police Department'' based on her experience at the 2001 trial.\n  Listen to what she said about the critics of this administration: \n``They're just raising fear and alarm.'' This is from the widow of a \nterrorist bombing where the terrorists have been brought to justice in \nthe courts of our land.\n  I agree with Susan Hirsch. I have faith in the New York Police \nDepartment. I have faith in our law enforcement agencies, I have faith \nin our courts, and I have faith in our system of justice.\n  We know how to prosecute terrorists, and we know how to hold them \nsafely. We have living proof in 195 prosecutions since 9/11 and 350 \nconvicted terrorists being held today in America's jails across the \nUnited States.\n  The Graham amendment is not about whether military commissions are \nsuperior to Federal courts. The amendment doesn't just express a \npreference for one over the other. The amendment expressly prohibits \nthis administration and the Department of Justice from trying a \nterrorist in a Federal court.\n  The truth is, President Obama may choose to try the 9/11 terrorists \nin military commissions. That should be the President's decision. If it \nis his decision that it is in the interests of the security of the \nUnited States or in a successful prosecution to turn to a military \ncommission over a regular Federal court in America, that should be the \nPresident's decision, the decision of his Attorney General, the \ndecision of the prosecutors, not the decision of Members of the Senate \nwho do not know the facts of the case and don't know the likelihood of \nprosecution.\n\n  Defense Secretary Gates and Attorney General Holder have developed a \njoint protocol to determine whether individual cases should be tried in \nFederal courts or commissions. The President worked closely with \nCongress to reform the military commissions so he would have another \nlawful tool to use in the fight against terrorism. The two lead \ncosponsors of the amendment before us, Senator McCain and Senator \nGraham, who is on the Senate floor, were very involved in that effort, \nas was Senator Levin of Michigan, the chairman of our Armed Services \nCommittee. They sat down to rewrite the rules for military commissions \nbecause, frankly, we haven't had a great deal of success with \nprosecutions of terrorists with military commissions. Only three cases \nhave gone before the Supreme Court, raising issues about military \ncommissions, the standard of justice, due process, and fairness.\n  Now there is a new effort by President Obama, with the bipartisan \nhelp of Members of the Senate. So I am not standing here in criticism \nof the use of military commissions, but I am standing here taking \nexception to the point of view that we should preclude prosecutions in \nany other forum than military commissions of the terrorists of \n9/11. President Obama may very well choose to try Khalid Sheikh \nMohammad and other terrorists in military commissions. That should be \nhis choice. Let him choose the forum, the most effective forum to \npursue justice and to protect America from future acts of terrorism.\n  In their letter to Senators Reid and McConnell, Secretary Gates and \nAttorney General Holder said it well, and I quote them again:\n\n       We must be in a position to use every lawful instrument of \n     national power, including both courts and military \n     commissions, to ensure that terrorists are brought to justice \n     and can no longer threaten American lives.\n\n  The decision may be reached at some future date by the \nadministration, with the concurrence of the Secretary of Defense and \nthe Attorney General, that it is a better forum to move to military \ncommissions for a variety of reasons. They could be issues of national \nsecurity. They could be issues of evidence.\n  But do we want to take away from them with this pending amendment the \nright to make that decision? Why would Congress choose to take away one \nof these lawful instruments from the President, our Commander in Chief? \nDon't we want the President to have the use of every lawful tool to \nbring these terrorists to justice?\n  One word in closing. I have the greatest respect for the families of \n9/11.\n\n[[Page S11160]]\n\nThose who have spoken out on behalf of this amendment, I respect them \ngreatly. They have been a force in America since the untimely and \ntragic deaths of members of their families. They forced on the previous \nadministration a dramatic investigation of 9/11 and where our \ngovernment had failed and what we could do to improve things. They have \nbecome a voice and a force in so many other respects since that awful \nday of 9/11. But they don't speak with one voice on this issue. Many \nsupport the pending amendment; others see it differently.\n  Susan Hirsch, whose husband was lost in a terrorism bombing in \nAfrica, clearly sees it differently than these survivors of 9/11. With \nthe greatest respect for those who support this amendment, I would say \nthere are others who see this in a much different light.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Graham amendment. It is an \nunprecedented effort to interfere with the executive branch's \nprosecutorial discretion and President Obama's genuine efforts to \ncombat terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I appreciate Senator Levin allowing me to \nspeak now. I know we are going back and forth. I appreciate that.\n  To my friend, Senator Durbin, it is my honest desire that as we move \nforward with what to do with Guantanamo Bay, we can find some \nbipartisanship and close the facility. I am one of the few Republicans \nwho expressed that thought, simply because I have listened enough to \nour commanders to know--General Petreaus, Admiral Mullen, and others--\nthat Guantanamo Bay has become a symbol for recruitment and propaganda \nusage against American forces in the war on terror.\n  It is probably the best run jail in the world right now, to those of \nus who have been down there. To the ground forces, I wish to \nacknowledge your patriotism and your service. It is a tough place to do \nduty because there are some pretty tough characters down there.\n  At the end of the day, I have tried to be helpful where I could, and \nI will tell you in a little detail why I am offering this amendment. \nBut my hope was that when President Obama was elected, we could find a \nway to reform Guantanamo Bay policy, detainee policy, because I have \nbeen a military lawyer for 25 years. I do understand detainee policy \naffects the war effort. If we mess it up, if we abuse detainees, we can \nturn populations against us that will be helpful in winning the war.\n  One of the great things that happened in World War II is that we had \nover 400,000 German prisoners, Japanese prisoners housed in the United \nStates. We took 40,000 hard-core Nazis from the British and put them in \nAmerican military jails in the United States. So this idea that we \ncan't find a place for 200 detainees in America, I don't agree with. We \nhave done that before. These people are not 10 feet tall. They are \ndefinitely dangerous, but as a nation I believe we could start over.\n  By closing Guantanamo Bay in a logical, rational way, we would be \nimproving our ability to effect the outcome of the war in the Mideast \nbecause we would be taking a tool away from the enemy.\n  President Obama and Senator McCain both, when they were candidates, \nagreed with the idea of closing Guantanamo Bay and reforming \ninterrogation policy.\n  To most Americans, it is kind of: Why are we worried about what we do \nwith these guys, because they would cut our heads off. You are \nabsolutely right. It is not lost upon me or any other military member \nout there that the enemy we are dealing with knows no boundaries and \nthey are barbarians and brutal.\n  The question is not about them but about us. The fact that we are a \ncivilized people is not a liability, it is an asset. So when you \ncapture a member of al-Qaida, I have always believed it becomes about \nus, not them. We need interrogation techniques that will allow us to \nget good intelligence and make the country safe. We need to understand \nwe are at war, and the people we are dealing with are some of the \nhardest, meanest people known since the Nazis.\n  But if you try to say, in the same breath, that anything goes to get \nthat information, it will come back to haunt you. So some of the \ninterrogation techniques we have used that come from the Inquisition \ngot us some information, but I can assure you it has created a problem. \nAsk anybody in the Mideast who has to deal with America. They will tell \nyou this has been a problem. You don't need to do that to protect this \ncountry. You can have interrogation techniques that get you good \ninformation but also adhere to all your laws.\n  As to the trials, some people wonder: Why do we care about this? They \nwouldn't give us a trial. You are absolutely right. The fact that our \ncountry will give the worst terrorist in the world a trial with a \ndefense attorney, for free; a judge who is going to base his decision \non facts and law and not prejudice; a jury, where the press can show up \nand watch the trial; and the ability to appeal the result, makes us \nstronger, not weaker. So count me in for starting over with Guantanamo \nBay, with a new legal process that recognizes we have had abuses in the \npast and we are going to chart a new course.\n  Regarding the Military Commission Act that just passed the Congress, \nI wish to say publicly that Senator Levin was a great partner to work \nwith. The military commission system we have in place today has been \nreformed. I think it is a model justice system that I will put up \nagainst any in the world, including the International Criminal Court at \nthe Hague, in terms of due process rights for detainees. It also \nrecognizes we are at war. This military commission system, while \ntransparent, with the ability to appeal all verdicts to the civilian \nsystem, has safeguards built in it to recognize we are at war and how \nyou handle evidence and access the evidence and intelligence sources \nare built into that military system that are not built into civilian \ncourts.\n  Since this country was founded, we have historically used military \ncommissions as a venue to try suspected war criminals caught on \nbattlefields. Why have I brought forth this amendment? I have been told \nby too many people, with reliable access, that the administration is \nplanning on trying Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--the mastermind of 9/11, the \nperpetrator of the attacks against our country in Washington, \nPennsylvania, and New York--in Federal court in the lower district of \nManhattan. If that is true, you have lost me as a partner.\n  Why do I say that? It would be the biggest mistake we could possibly \nmake, in my view, since 9/11. We would be giving constitutional rights \nto the mastermind of 9/11, as if he were any average, everyday criminal \nAmerican citizen. We would be basically saying to the mastermind of 9/\n11, and to the world at large, that 9/11 was a criminal act, not an act \nof war.\n  I do believe in prosecutorial discretion and executive branch \ndiscretion. I introduced this amendment reluctantly but with all the \npassion and persuasion I can muster to tell my colleagues: Act now, so \nwe will get this right later. Congress said we are not going to fund \nthe closing of Gitmo. Well, is Congress meddling in the ability of the \nCommander in Chief to run a military jail? Hell, yes, because we don't \nknow what the plan is. We have an independent duty as Members of \nCongress to make sure there is balance. This Nation is at war. It is OK \nfor us to speak up. As a matter of fact, it has been too much passing--\ntoo many passes during the Bush administration, where Congress sort of \nsat back and watched things happen. Don't watch this happen. Get on the \nrecord now, before it is too late, to tell the President we are not \ngoing to sit by as a body and watch the mastermind of 9/11 go into \ncivilian court and criminalize this war. If he goes to Federal court, \nhere is what awaits: a chaos zoo trial.\n  Yes, we have taken people into Federal court before for acts of \nterrorism. We took the Blind Sheik--the first guy to try to blow up the \nWorld Trade Center--and put him in civilian court. We treated these \npeople as common criminals. What a mistake we made. What if we had \ntreated them as warriors rather than a guy who robbed a liquor store? \nWhere would we have been in 2001 if we had the foresight in the 1990s \nto recognize that we are at war and these people are not some foreign \ncriminal cartel; they are warriors bent on our destruction who have \nbeen planning for\n\n[[Page S11161]]\n\nyears to attack this country and are planning, as I speak, to attack us \nagain?\n  We are not fighting crime. We are fighting a war. The war is not \nover. What happened in the Blind Sheik trial? Because it was a civilian \ncourt, built around trying common criminals, the court didn't have the \nprotections military commissions will have to protect this Nation's \nsecrets and classified information. As a result of that trial, the \nunindicted coconspirator list was provided to the defense as part of \ndiscovery in a Federal civilian criminal court. That unindicted \ncoconspirator list was an intelligence coup for the enemy. It went from \nthe defense counsel, to the defendant, to the Mideast. Al-Qaida was \nable to understand, from that trial, whom we were looking at and whom \nwe had our eye on.\n  During the 1990s, we tried to treat these terrorist warriors as just \nsome other form of crime. It was a mistake. Don't repeat it. If you \ntake Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, and put him in \nFederal civilian court, you will have learned nothing from the 1990s. \nYou will have sent the wrong signal to the terrorists and to our own \npeople.\n  Judge Mukasey, who presided over the Blind Sheik trial, wrote an op-\ned piece about how big a mistake it would be to put the 9/11 \ncoconspirators into Federal court. He went into great detail about the \nproblems you would have trying these people in a civilian court. He \nbecame our Attorney General. So if you don't listen to me, listen to \nthe judge who presided over the trial in the 1990s.\n  I don't know what they are going to do in the Obama administration. \nIf I believed they were going to do something other than take Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed to Federal court in New York, I would not introduce \nthis amendment. I know this is not a cavalier thing to do. I have taken \nsome grief for trying to help the President form new policies with \nGuantanamo Bay and reject the arguments made by some of my dear friends \nthat these people are too dangerous to bring to the United States. We \ncan find a way to bring them to the United States; we just have to be \nsmart about it.\n  To our military men and women who will be administering the \ncommission, my biggest fear has always been that the military \ncommission system will become a second-class justice system. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth. The men and women who administer \njustice in the military commission system are the same judge advocates \nand jurors who administer justice to our own troops. The Judge Advocate \nGeneral of the Navy said the new military commission system is such \nthat he would not hesitate to have one of our own tried in it.\n  We will gain nothing, in terms of improving our image, by sending the \nmastermind of 9/11 to a New York civilian court, giving him the same \nconstitutional rights as anybody listening to me in America who is a \ncitizen. The military commission system will be transparent. He will \nhave his say in court. He will have the ability to appeal a conviction \nto our civilian judges. He will be defended by a military lawyer--or \nprivate attorney, if he wants to be. He will be presumed innocent until \nfound guilty. It will be required by the ``beyond a reasonable doubt'' \nstandard for him to be found guilty of anything.\n  For those who are wondering about military commissions, I can tell \nyou the bill we have produced I will put up against any system in the \nworld. To those who think it is no big deal to send Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed to Federal court, I could not disagree with you more. What you \nwill have done is set in motion the dynamic that led to criminalizing \nthe war in the 1990s. You will have lost focus, yet again. You will \nhave been lured into the sense that we are not at war, that these are \njust a bunch of bad people committing crimes. The day we take the \nmastermind of 9/11 and put him in Federal court, who the hell are you \ngoing to try in the military commission? How can you tell that detainee \nyou are an enemy combatant, you are a bad guy? You are at war, but the \nguy who planned the whole thing is just a common criminal. What a \nmistake we would make.\n  It is imperative this Nation have a legal system that recognizes we \nare at war and that we have rules to protect this country's national \nsecurity balance against the interests and the rights of the accused \ndetainee. The military commission forum has created that balance. It is \na system built around war, a system built around the rules of military \nlaw, a system that recognizes the difference between a common criminal \nand a warrior, a system that understands military intelligence is \ndifferent than common evidence. If we do not use that system for the \nguy who planned 9/11, we will all regret it.\n  My amendment is limited in scope. It is a chance for you, as a Member \nof the Senate, to speak up about what you would like to see happen as \nthis Nation moves forward and our desire to correct past mistakes and \ndefend this Nation, which is still at war this very day. It is a chance \nfor you to have a say, on behalf of your constituents, as to how they \nwould like to see this Nation defend itself.\n  I argue that most Americans--not just the 9/11 families--would be \nvery concerned to learn that the man who planned the attacks that \nkilled 3,000 of our fellow citizens--who would do it again tomorrow--is \ngoing to be treated the same as any other criminal. No good will come \nfrom that. You will have compromised the military commission system \nbeyond repair. You will have adopted the law enforcement model that \nfailed us before, and we will not be a better people.\n  I, along with Senator Levin, was at Guantanamo Bay the day Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed appeared before the Combat Status Review Tribunal. We \nwere in the next room. We listened on a monitor. You could see him and \ncould hear the chains rattle next door when he went through great \ndetail about 9/11 and all the other acts of terrorism he planned \nagainst our country.\n  I never will forget when he told the military judge that he was a \nhigh-ranking commander in the al-Qaida military organization and he \nappreciated being referred to as a military commander. Some would say: \nYou don't want to elevate this guy. What I would say is you want to \nunderstand who he is. If you think he is a common criminal, no \ndifferent than any other person who wants to hurt people, you have made \na mistake.\n  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is bent on our destruction. He did not attack \nus for financial gain. He attacked us because he hates us. He is every \nbit as dangerous as the Nazis. These people we are fighting are very \ndangerous people. I am insistent they get a trial consistent with our \nvalues, that they do not get railroaded, that they get a chance to \ndefend themselves. The media will see how the trial unfolds and you can \nsee most of it, if not all of it. But I am also insistent that we not \ntake our eye off the ball. It has been a long time since we have been \nattacked. For a lot of people--those who were on the front lines of 9/\n11--they relive it every night. It replays itself over and over every \nnight of their lives.\n  For the rest of us, please do not lose sight of the fact that this \ncountry is engaged in an armed conflict with an enemy that knows no \nboundaries, has no allegiance to anything beyond their radical \nreligion, and is conspiring to attack us as I speak.\n  When we try them, we need to understand that the trial itself is part \nof the war effort. How we do the trial can make us safer or it can make \nus weaker. If we criminalize this war, it would take the man who \nplanned the attacks of 9/11 and put him in civilian court. It is going \nto be impossible with a straight face to take somebody under him and \nput him in a military court. And the day you put him back in civilian \ncourt, you are going to create the problems Judge Mukasey warned us \nagainst. You are going to have evidence compromised and you are going \nto regret it.\n  I hope to continue to work with the administration to find a way to \nclose Guantanamo Bay, to create a transparent legal system that will \nallow every detainee their day in court, due process rights they \ndeserve based on our law, not based on what they have done but based on \nwho we are as a people.\n  The 20th hijacker said this in Federal court--the victims were \nallowed to testify about the impact of 9/11. They had a U.S. Navy \nofficer talking about being at the Pentagon and the impact on her\n\n[[Page S11162]]\n\nlife and on her friends. During the testimony, the officer started to \ncry. Here is what the defendant said, Moussaoui, the 20th hijacker:\n\n       I think it was disgusting for a military person to pretend \n     that they should not be killed as an act of war. She is \n     military.\n\n  It was a Navy female officer.\n\n       She should expect that the people who are at war with her \n     will try to kill her.\n\n  This is the 20th hijacker in civilian court:\n\n       I will never, I will never cry because an American bombed \n     my camp.\n\n  If you have any doubt that we are at war, the one thing you ought to \nbe certain of, they have no doubt that they are at war with us.\n  The one thing the men and women who go off to fight this war should \nexpect of their government and of their Congress is to watch their back \nthe best we can. We would be doing those men and women a great \ndisservice if we put the mastermind of 9/11, who killed the friends of \nthis Navy officer, in a civilian court that could lead to compromising \nevents that would make their job harder. We would be doing them a \ndisservice to act on our end as if we are not at war.\n  Mr. President, I say to my colleagues, they have a chance to speak. \nThey have a chance to be on the record for their constituents to send a \nsignal that needs to be sent before it is too late. Here is what I ask \nthem to say with their vote: I believe we are at war and that the legal \nsystem we are going to use to try people who attacked this country and \nkilled 3,000 American citizens should be a military legal system, \nconsistent with us being at war. I will not, with my vote, go back to \nthe law enforcement model that jeopardized our national security back \nin the nineties. I will insist that these detainees have a full and \nfair trial and that they be treated appropriately. But I will not, with \nmy vote, take the mastermind of 9/11, the man who planned the attacks, \nwho would do it tomorrow, and give him the same constitutional rights \nas an average, everyday American in a legal system that is not built \naround being at war.\n  If they will say that, we will get a good outcome. If they \nequivocate, we are slowly but surely going to create a legal hodgepodge \nthat will come back to haunt us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the amendment that has been sponsored by \nSenators Graham, McCain, Lieberman, and Webb is wrong and it is \nunnecessary. It would, as Senator Graham said, prohibit the prosecution \nof any individual suspected of involvement with the September 11 \nattacks against the United States from being tried in our article III \ncourts.\n  The idea that we cannot try a terrorist and mass murderer in our \ncourts is beneath the dignity of this great country. Timothy McVeigh \nwas one of the greatest mass murderers this Nation has ever known and \nwe had no difficulty trying him and convicting him and executing him \nusing our laws and our article III courts.\n  The real intent of this amendment is clear, to ensure that the \ndetainees held at Guantanamo Bay, some who have been held for years \nwithout charge, can only be tried by military commissions.\n  As a former prosecutor, I find it deeply troubling that the Senate \nwould be asked to prohibit the administration from trying even \ndangerous terrorists in our Federal courts. These Senators should not \nuse an amendment that politicizes decisions about significant \nprosecutions as a backdoor to require the use of military commissions.\n  The administration has worked hard to revise the military commissions \nto make sure that they meet constitutional standards. However, their \nuse has been plagued with problems and repeatedly overturned by a \nconservative Supreme Court.\n  In contrast, our Federal courts have a long and distinguished history \nof successfully prosecuting even the most atrocious violent acts, and \nthey are respected throughout the world. When we use our Federal \ncourts, the rest of the world recognizes that we are following over 200 \nyears of judicial history of the United States of America. We earn \nrespect for doing so.\n  The administration strongly opposes this amendment. In a letter to \nthe Senate leadership the Secretary of Defense, Robert Gates, and the \nAttorney General of the United States, Eric Holder, warn that this \namendment would ``set a dangerous precedent'' by directing the \nExecutive Branch's prosecutorial determination.\n  They also point out this amendment would prohibit them from being \nable to ``use every lawful instrument of national power . . . to ensure \nthat terrorists are brought to justice and can no longer threaten \nAmerican lives.''\n  If we really want to stop terrorists, if we really want to make sure \nthey pay for their crime, why would we block off any of the avenues \navailable to us? Two senior administration officials, individuals \ndirectly responsible for the disposition of these detainees, are \ntelling us not to tie their hands in the fight against terrorism. This \nSenator is listening to them, and I believe all Senators should listen \nto them.\n  There has been an outpouring of opposition against this amendment \nincluding by numerous human rights groups such as Human Rights First, \nthe National Institute of Military Justice, Constitution Project and \nAmnesty International.\n  We have also seen a strong public declaration in support of trying \nterrorism offenses in Federal courts, signed by a bipartisan group of \nformer Members of Congress, high-ranking military officials and judges.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee has held several hearings on the issue \nof how best to handle detainees. Experts and judges across the \npolitical spectrum have agreed that our criminal justice system can \nhandle this challenge and indeed has handled it many times already.\n  We are a nation that fought hard to have a strong, independent \njudiciary, with a history of excellence. Do we now want to say to the \nworld that in spite of all of our power, our history, our strong \njudiciary, that we are not up to trying those who struck us in our \ntraditional federal courts? I think we should say just the opposite, \nthat we can and will prosecute these people in a way that will gain the \nrespect of the whole world and protect our nation. Republican \nluminaries, such as General Colin Powell, have agreed with this idea.\n  In fact, one of the things we tend to forget is since January of this \nyear alone, over 30 terrorism suspects have been successfully \nprosecuted or sentenced in Federal courts. Those federal courts have \nsentenced individuals directly implicated by this amendment, such as \nZacarias Moussaoui.\n  If this amendment were law Moussaoui, the so called ``20th hijacker'' \nwho was directly involved in the planning of September 11, would not \nhave been convicted by our federal courts and sentenced to life in \nprison. This amendment takes away one of the greatest tools we have to \nprotect our national security--the ability to prosecute suspects in \nFederal court. Instead, as the Justice Department has said in its \nopposition to it, the Graham amendment would make it more likely that \nterrorists will escape justice.\n  I believe as strongly as all Americans do that we should take all \nsteps possible to prevent terrorism, and we must ensure severe \npunishment for those who do us harm. As a former prosecutor, I have \nmade certain that perpetrators of violent crime receive serious \npunishment. I also believe strongly that we can ensure our safety and \nsecurity, and bring terrorists to justice, in ways that are consistent \nwith the laws and the values that make us a great democracy.\n  The administration has said where possible they will try individuals \nin Federal courts. When we unnecessarily preempt that option, we are \nsaying we do not trust the legal system on which we have relied for so \nlong. All that does is give more ammunition to our enemies. It further \nhurts our standing around the world, a standing which has already \nsuffered so much from the stain of Guantanamo Bay. Worse still it sends \nthe message to other countries that they do not have to use traditional \nlegal regimes with established protections for defendants if they are \nprosecuting American soldiers or civilians.\n\n[[Page S11163]]\n\n  Just as partisan Republicans were wrong in trying to hold up the \nconfirmation of Attorney General Holder to extort a pledge from him \nthat he would not exercise independent prosecutorial judgment--\nsomething I have never seen done before in 35 years here--it is also \nwrong to force an amendment politicizing prosecutions in the Commerce-\nJustice-Science appropriations bill. I opposed the effort by some \nRepublican Senators who wanted the Nation's chief prosecutor to agree \nin advance to turn a blind eye to possible lawbreaking before even \ninvestigating whether it occurred. Republicans asked for such a pledge, \na commitment that no prosecutor should give. To his credit, Eric Holder \ndidn't give that pledge.\n  Passing a far-reaching amendment that takes away a powerful tool from \nthe Justice Department in bringing terrorists to justice and usurps the \nAttorney General's constitutional responsibilities is not the path \nforward. All administrations should be able to decide who to prosecute \nand where they should be prosecuted. This amendment denies us the \nbenefit of using not only our Federal courts, with their successful \ntrack record convicting terrorists, but also from using our Federal \nlaws, which are arguably more expansive and better suited for use in \nterrorism cases than the narrower set of charges that can be brought in \na military commission. We should not tie the hands of our law \nenforcement in their efforts to secure our national security. Any \nformer prosecutor, any lawyer and any citizen should know it is not the \ndecision of or an appropriate role for the United States Senate.\n  It is time to act on our principles and our constitutional system. \nThose we believe to be guilty of heinous crimes should be tried, and \nwhen convicted, punished severely. Where the administration decides to \ntry them in Federal courts, our courts and our prisons are more than up \nto the task. I agree with the Justice Department that this amendment \n``would ensure that the only individuals in the world who could not be \nprosecuted under the criminal terrorist offenses Congress has enacted \nwould be those who are responsible for the most devastating terrorist \nacts in U.S. history.'' That means that the only people in the world \nwho could not be prosecuted under our terrorism laws are the people who \ncommitted the most devastating terrorist acts against us. That is Alice \nin Wonderland justice. It makes no sense to have tough terrorism laws, \nto have the best judicial system in the world and then, when terrorist \nacts are committed against us, to simply ignore that system and decide \nwe cannot use it to prosecute those acts. It makes no sense.\n  Let us put aside heated and distorted rhetoric and support the \nPresident in his efforts to truly make our country safe and strong and \na republic worthy of the history and values that have always made \nAmerica great.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I very much oppose the Graham amendment, \nand I want to take a few moments to explain why.\n  It has been argued that we are at war. Indeed, we are. I can't think \nof anything clearer, that any of us in this country understands than we \nare at war. And being at war, it totally mystifies me why we would deny \nourselves one of the tools that we could use against people who are \nattacking us, who have attacked us, who will attack us, who will kill \nus, who kill innocent people. Why would we deny ourselves one of the \ntools which are available to try these people, to lock them up, or \nexecute them and throw away the key? Why we would, by law, say this \nparticular group of people can't be tried in a Federal court, that they \ncan only be tried in a military commission, when we have tried so many \nterrorists in court, convicted them and executed them, is something I \ndo not understand.\n  I believe we ought to not only throw the book at these people, but I \nthink we ought to throw both books at these people. Why limit ourselves \nto one book--the book that sets the procedures for military \ncommissions? Why do we deny ourselves the opportunity, if it is more \neffective--for whatever reasons the Justice Department determines it is \nmore effective--to prosecute in a Federal court? Why would we deny them \nthat?\n  In fact, under this amendment, they could not even continue the \nprosecution they had begun. The language of the amendment says either \n``to commence or continue the prosecution in an Article III court.'' So \nthe question isn't whether these are the most dangerous people around--\nthey are.\n  I also went down to Guantanamo. I went with Senator Graham, and we \nwatched the proceeding against Khalid Shaikh Mohammed. I want us to use \nall of the tools. I want them all to be available. I want the Justice \nDepartment to be able to determine which is more effective, and not for \nus to decide in a political setting, in a legislative setting, that \nthey cannot use one of the tools which has been proven to be effective \nagainst dozens of terrorists.\n  What about the law of war? What about war crimes? The argument is \nthese are war crimes. As far as I am concerned, they are crimes; they \nare war crimes--both. War crimes can be prosecuted in an article III \ncourt. Let me repeat that because the argument is these are war crimes. \nWar crimes can be prosecuted in an article III court under our laws \nthat we adopted about 10 or 15 years ago. So Khalid Shaikh Mohammed \nneeds to be given justice. He needs to be dealt with as strongly as we \npossibly can and as effectively as we possibly can. I believe he was \nthe mastermind of 9/11. I don't think there is a Member of this body \nthat would not want to see him dealt with as strongly as can possibly \nbe done. But I don't know why we would tell the Justice Department that \nthey only can consider one of the two tools that they could use against \nhim; that they only can consider the military commissions but they \ncan't consider article III courts.\n  I have been deeply involved in rewriting the military commissions \nlaw. That law, when we first wrote it, was defective, and I argued \nagainst it because it was defective. This body adopted it. That is the \nway things work. The majority decided to go with it. It was not usable. \nSo we took a major step in the last few months to revise the military \ncommissions law. I helped to lead that effort, and I know how important \nit is. But it was never our intent to make that the exclusive remedy \nfor people who would attack us or attack this country. We want that \nremedy to be available if that is the most effective remedy. But there \nis nothing in that law that we wrote, or intended, that said this would \ndisplace article III courts if the Justice Department decided the most \neffective place to try an alleged terrorist was an article III court.\n  Are we actually, on the floor of the Senate, going to decide which \nterrorists should be tried in article III courts and which ones should \nbe tried in military commission courts? Why would we tie the hands of \nthe Justice Department in that way?\n  I know Senator Graham feels very strongly these should be tried in \nfront of military commissions, and if he were the Justice Department, \nor if he were the Attorney General, he may make that decision, assuming \nhe knows all the facts that go into the decision. He may make that \ndecision, and he could strongly recommend it to the Justice Department. \nBut why would we decide to displace the discretion of the Justice \nDepartment is a mystery to me. I find it unacceptable.\n  More importantly, the Attorney General and the Secretary of Defense \nfind it unacceptable. They have urged us not to do this. They have \nwritten our leaders--Senator Reid and Senator McConnell--opposing the \nGraham amendment.\n  They say in their letter that there is a joint prosecution protocol, \nand the departments are ``currently engaged in a careful case-by-case \nevaluation of the cases of Guantanamo detainees who have been referred \nfor possible prosecution, to determine whether they should be \nprosecuted in an Article III court or by military commission. We are \nconfident that the forum selection decisions that are made pursuant to \nthis process will best serve our national security interests.''\n  That is the Attorney General of the United States and the Secretary \nof Defense. Can we truly say in the Senate that we are going to \ndisplace that process which will determine what is the\n\n[[Page S11164]]\n\nmost effective way to prosecute these people? Can we and should we do \nthat? I hope not.\n  They end their letter of October 30 by saying the following:\n\n       The exercise of prosecutorial discretion has always been \n     and should remain an Executive Branch function. We must be in \n     a position to use every lawful instrument of national power--\n     including both courts and military commissions--to ensure \n     that terrorists are brought to justice and can no longer \n     threaten American lives.\n\n  If we adopt the Graham amendment, we are saying no; we are only going \nto use one instrument of national power. We are not going to consider \nboth instruments of national power, and that is truly not only limiting \nour options but tying one of our hands behind our back in the essential \nprosecution of these people.\n  Madam President, Zacarias Moussaoui, the so-called 20th hijacker, was \nconvicted in Federal court in May of 2006 for conspiring to hijack \naircraft and crash them into the World Trade Center. He was quoted by \nSenator Graham as saying that ``we are at war with you people.'' I \ndon't have the slightest doubt that he means it and if he were ever \nreleased he would go back to war.\n  But I also have no doubt about something else. He was saying this in \na Federal court, after being convicted in a Federal court of the \nterrorist acts that he perpetrated. He is now in a supermax facility in \nFlorence, CO. He is serving life imprisonment without parole. If the \nGraham amendment had been in place at the time that Moussaoui was being \nprosecuted--indeed, if the Graham amendment had come in the middle of \nthat prosecution--the prosecution would have had to have been \nsuspended.\n  This amendment, if it is adopted, is going to make it more difficult \nto bring some of the 9/11 terrorists to justice. Let me share some of \nthe reasons this possibility exists.\n  A court could decide that one of the 9/11 detainees does not meet the \ntest, under the military commissions law, of being an ``unprivileged \nenemy belligerent.'' In particular, a court could decide that one of \nthe 9/11 alleged terrorists did not participate in a ``hostility'' and \ntherefore was not subject--a belligerent subject to the laws of war. So \nwe are saying to the Justice Department: If you see the possibility \nthat someone could be let out or somebody could be found not guilty \nbased on that kind of a technicality, we are not going to let you go \nand try that person in a Federal court. You must try that person where \nthat person could escape justice based on a technicality.\n  Why would we want to do that? How can we possibly sit here and reach \na judgment on all of the possible factual situations which might allow \none of these people to escape justice? We cannot do that. That is what \nprosecutors are for. That is what a Justice Department is for. We \nshould be giving them tools, not denying them tools. We should be \nhanding them every possible tool we can give them to prosecute these \npeople instead of saying you can't use this tool or you can't use that \ntool.\n  A court could decide that the crimes committed by one of the 9/11 \ndetainees is not justiciable under the Military Commissions Act. So \ntherefore we are going to say you have to prosecute him there anyway? A \ncourt could decide that an offense under the Military Commissions Act \ncannot be retroactively applied to an offense that took place before \nthe enactment of the act. In our language, they can be tried even \nthough it is a retroactive application. What happens if that occurs and \nthen a court comes along, a court of appeals following a military \ncommission, and says: No, you can't do that. Why would we not want the \nJustice Department to be able to weigh all of these possible escape \nloopholes that a defendant could use and decide that they have a better \nchance of convicting somebody and making that conviction stick if they \nproceed in an article III court?\n  Maybe the procedural rights which we have written into our Military \nCommissions Act, which is now law--maybe a court will determine they \nare not adequate. Maybe they will throw out the entire process despite \nour best efforts to correct what we had previously done. We should not \npresume the outcome of the judicial process and throw away legal tools \nthat may be needed to bring the 9/11 terrorists to justice. We should \nnot be tying the hands of our prosecutors against these people.\n  Prosecutorial discretion is one of the cornerstones of the American \njudicial system. It is wrong for us to be limiting that discretion by \ndirecting cases to a particular forum. It denies our prosecutors the \nability to choose the forum that is best suited to a successful outcome \nin the case. The mechanism of cutting off funds for a prosecution, \nwhich is what this amendment does because Congress believes that a \nprosecution should take place in one forum or another, would set a \nterrible precedent. We should not be intervening in that kind of \ndecision through the appropriations act.\n  The determination of the proper forum for the trial of 9/11 \nterrorists should be made by the professional prosecutors based on the \ncircumstances of the case and their judgment as to where is the best \nchance to gain a successful prosecution. We should not decide where \nthese cases are going to be tried. I don't believe we should presume \nthey will be tried in one place or another.\n  There is a process underway, including both the Defense Department \nand the Justice Department, to make a determination as to which will be \nthe most effective place to try these terrorists. So that is the \nappropriate process, and we ought to let it continue without this kind \nof intervention by the Senate.\n  Before I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from the \nAttorney General and the Secretary of Defense to Senators Reid and \nMcConnell.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 30, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: We write to oppose the \n     amendment proposed by Senator Graham (on behalf of himself \n     and Senators McCain and Lieberman) to H.R. 2847, the \n     Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \n     Appropriations Act of 2010. This amendment would prohibit the \n     use of Department of Justice funds ``to commence or continue \n     the prosecution in an Article III court of the United States \n     of an individual suspected of planning, authorizing, \n     organizing, committing, or aiding the attacks on the United \n     States and its citizens that occurred on September 11, \n     2001.''\n       As you know, both the Department of Justice (in Article III \n     courts) and the Department of Defense (in military \n     commissions, reformed under the 2010 National Defense \n     Authorization Act) have responsibility for prosecuting \n     alleged terrorists. Pursuant to a joint prosecution protocol, \n     our departments are currently engaged in a careful case-by-\n     case evaluation of the cases of Guantanamo detainees who have \n     been referred for possible prosecution, to determine whether \n     they should be prosecuted in an Article III court or by \n     military commission. We are confident that the forum \n     selection decisions that are made pursuant to this process \n     will best serve our national security interests.\n       We believe that it would be unwise, and would set a \n     dangerous precedent, for Congress to restrict the discretion \n     of either department to fund particular prosecutions. The \n     exercise of prosecutorial discretion has always been and \n     should remain an Executive Branch function. We must be in a \n     position to use every lawful instrument of national power--\n     including both courts and military commissions--to ensure \n     that terrorists are brought to justice and can no longer \n     threaten American lives.\n       For these reasons, we respectfully request that you oppose \n     this amendment.\n     Robert M. Gates,\n       Secretary of Defense.\n     Eric H. Holder, Jr.,\n       Attorney General.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, most Americans recognize that our \ncontinued success in preventing another terrorist attack on U.S. soil \ndepends on our ability as a Nation to remain vigilant and clear-eyed \nabout the nature of the threats we face at home and abroad.\n  Some threats come in the form of terror cells in distant countries. \nOthers\n\n[[Page S11165]]\n\ncome from people plotting attacks within our own borders.\n  And still others can come from a failure to recognize the distinction \nbetween everyday crimes and war crimes.\n  This last category of threat is extremely serious but sometimes \noverlooked--and that is why Senators Graham, Lieberman, and McCain have \noffered an amendment to the Commerce, Justice and Science \nappropriations bill that would reassure the American people that the \nSenate has not taken its eye off the ball.\n  The amendment is simple and straightforward. It explicitly prohibits \nany of the terrorists who were involved in the September 11, 2001, \nattacks from appearing for trial in a civilian U.S. courtroom. Instead, \nit would require the government to use military commissions; that is, \nthe courts proper to war, for trying these men.\n  By requiring the government to use military commissions, the \nsupporters of this amendment are reaffirming two things: First, that \nthese men should have a fair trial.\n  And second, we are reaffirming what American history has always \nshowed; namely, that war crimes and common crimes are to be tried \ndifferently--and that military courts are the proper forum for \nprosecuting terrorists.\n  Some might argue that terrorists like Zacarias Moussaoui, one of the \n9/11 conspirators, are not enemy combatants--that they are somehow on \nthe same level as a convenience store stick-up man. But listen to the \nwords of Moussaoui himself. He disagrees.\n  Asked if he regretted his part in the September 11 attacks, Moussaoui \nsaid: ``I just wish it will happen on the 12th, the 13th, the 14th, the \n15th, the 16th, the 17th, and [on and on].'' He went on to explain how \nhappy he was to learn of the deaths of American service men and women \nin the Pentagon on 9/11. And then he mocked an officer for weeping \nabout the loss of men under her command, saying:\n\n       I think it was disgusting for a military person to pretend \n     that they should not be killed as an act of war. She is \n     military. She should expect that people who are at war with \n     her will try to kill her. I will never cry because an \n     American bombed my camp.\n\n  There is no question Moussaoui himself believes he is an enemy \ncombatant engaged in a war against us.\n  The Senate has also made itself clear on this question. Congress \ncreated the military commissions system 3 years ago, on a bipartisan \nbasis, precisely to deal with prosecutions of al-Qaida terrorists \nconsistent with U.S. national security, with the expectation that they \nwould be used for that purpose.\n  The Senate reaffirmed this view 2 years ago when it voted 94-3 \nagainst transferring detainees from Guantanamo stateside, including the \n9/11 planners.\n  We reaffirmed it again earlier this year when we voted 90-6 against \nusing any funds from the war supplemental to transfer any of the \nGuantanamo detainees to the United States.\n  And just this summer the Senate reaffirmed that military commissions \nare the proper forum for bringing enemy combatants to justice when we \napproved without objection an amendment to that effect as part of the \nDefense authorization bill.\n  Further, our past experiences with terror trials in civilian courts \nhave clearly been shown to undermine our national security. During the \ntrial of Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the first Trade Center \nbombing, we saw how a small bit of testimony about a cell phone battery \nwas enough to tip off terrorists that one of their key communication \nlinks had been compromised.\n  We saw how the public prosecution of the Blind Sheikh, Abdel Rahman, \ninadvertently provided a rich source of intelligence to Osama bin Laden \nahead of the 9/11 attacks. And in that case, we remember that Rahman's \nlawyer was convicted of smuggling orders to his terrorist disciples.\n  We also saw how the trial of Zacarias Moussaoui resulted in the leak \nof sensitive information.\n  And we saw how the trials of the East African Embassy bombers \ncompromised intelligence methods to the benefit of Osama bin Laden.\n  The administration calls these prosecutions ``successful.'' But given \nthe loss of sensitive information that resulted, former Federal judge \nand Attorney General Michael Mukasey has noted ``there are many words \none might use to describe how these events unfolded; `successfully' is \nnot among them.''\n  Trying terror suspects in civilian courts is also a giant headache \nfor communities; just look at the experience of Alexandria, VA, during \nthe Moussaoui trial. As I have pointed out before, parts of Alexandria \nbecame a virtual encampment every time Moussaoui was moved to the \ncourthouse. Those were the problems we saw in Northern Virginia when \njust one terrorist was tried in civilian court. What will happen to \nAlexandria, New York City, or other cities if several terrorists are \ntried there? You can imagine.\n  It is because of dangers and difficulties like these that we \nestablished military commissions in the first place. The administration \nhas now rewritten the military commission procedures precisely to its \nliking. If we can't expect the very people who masterminded the 9/11 \nattacks and went to war with us to fall within the jurisdiction of \nthese military courts, then who can we expect to fall within the \njurisdiction of these military courts?\n  The American people have made themselves clear on this issue. They do \nnot want Guantanamo terrorists brought to the U.S., and they certainly \ndo not want the men who planned the 9/11 attacks on America to be tried \nin civilian courts--risking national security and civic disruption in \nthe process.\n  Congress created military commissions for a reason. But if the \nadministration fails to use military commissions for self-avowed \ncombatants like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, then it is wasting this time-\nhonored and essential tool in the war on terror.\n  I would ask the opponents of the Graham amendment the following: what \nmaterial benefit is derived by bringing avowed foreign combatants like \nKSM into a civilian court and giving them all the rights and privileges \nof a U.S. citizen; and why should we further delay justice for the \nfamilies of the victims of 9/11?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I rise with some regret because I am in a \ncontradiction with our President and with many members of my own \ncaucus. I am a cosponsor of the Graham amendment. I have no regrets \nabout cosponsoring the amendment. I do regret that I am in \ncontradiction with a number of my colleagues on this side.\n  I believe this is an appropriate amendment. I believe it is the best \nway for us to move forward and bring a solution with respect to those \nwho are detained in Guantanamo.\n  I would start by saying I have consistently argued that the \nappropriate venue for trying perpetrators of international terrorism \nwho are, in fact, enemy combatants is a military tribunal. One of my \nprimary focuses in my time in the Senate has been to work toward a \nfairer and more efficient criminal justice system in the United States.\n  As all my colleagues know, we have an enormous backlog in many court \nsystems right now. Prisons are overcrowded. We have 2.3 million people \nin prison right now, 7 million people inside the criminal justice \nsystem. The process of trying enemy combatants in our already \noverburdened domestic courts, on the one hand, is not necessary and, on \nthe other, would introduce major logjams and work against our goals of \nimproving our criminal justice system.\n  As someone who served in the military, has spent 5 years in the \nPentagon, and is privileged to serve in this body, I would like to say, \nin my view, the Guantanamo Bay detainee situation is challenging, it is \ncomplicated, it involves balancing an entire host of considerations, \nincluding national security, constitutional due process requirements, \ninternational law, procedural and practical considerations, and the \nresponsibilities and authority of all three branches of government.\n  Given the complicated nature of this situation, I believe it is very \nimportant for us to move forward with a careful and considered \napproach. These are among the considerations we should be looking at: \nFirst, the Supreme Court has reviewed this issue a number of times and, \nin several cases, has given clear guidance on due process requirements.\n\n[[Page S11166]]\n\n  Second, taking into consideration these Supreme Court's decisions, \nCongress enacted new procedures for military tribunals. These new \npressures, which were included in the recently passed Defense \nauthorization bill, contain safeguards that protect detainees' due \nprocess and habeas rights.\n  President Obama, as a Senator, took part in the creation of these new \nprocedures. President Obama signed these new procedures into law. \nAdditionally, the facilities for properly holding and trying dangerous \ndetainees who are, in fact in many cases, enemy combatants, exist at \nthe cost of approximately millions of dollars in Guantanamo.\n  The Guantanamo debate has, in my view, improperly focused on place \nversus process over the past couple of years. The most important factor \nhas been to improve the process as we consider these different cases, \nnot simply whether this was Guantanamo or anywhere else.\n  Removing our detainees from Guantanamo to the United States is not \ngoing to solve the problem. The improved processes we have put in place \nis one of the key factors in addressing the problem.\n  The people we are seeking to prosecute--I think it needs to be said \nagain and again--are enemy combatants. They were apprehended during a \ntime of war, while hostilities are still ongoing. Prosecuting these \nindividuals in domestic courts gives rise to a host of problematic \nissues which are basically unnecessary because of the availability now \nof properly constituted military tribunals.\n  The problems with trying alleged detainees in domestic courts \ninclude: procedural, constitutional, and evidentiary rules in place to \nprotect civilian criminal defendants in our country. These protections \nwould require the production of classified materials. It could require \nmilitary and intelligence officers to be called from other duties, in \nsome cases from the battlefield, to testify.\n  This could lead to the exposure of sensitive material or, \nalternatively, to acquittal of enemy combatants who are guilty of these \ncrimes. In the U.S. legal system, when a defendant is acquitted he goes \nfree. In this complex scenario, it is unclear what will happen in our \ndomestic judicial system if one of those enemy combatants is actually \nacquitted.\n  This mixing of the legal and military paradigms, I believe, would \nconfuse our criminal justice system without a real upside. The burden \nof trying enemy combatants in a domestic court is overwhelming. Other \npeople have mentioned this. There is an issue, of course, of \nmaintaining security for the courtroom and for the jail facilities: the \nadditional security burdens to the U.S. Marshals Service and to local \npolice services, the security and procedural complexities would tie up \nour court system at a time when we need to move criminal cases forward.\n  I think it is very important for the understanding of this body, that \nwhile this amendment only applies to six detainees at Guantanamo Bay, \nit is long past time that we work to reach a consensus on how and where \nall these detainees are going to be tried and/or held. The \nadministration has consistently talked about three different categories \nof detainees: Those who have been found not to be a threat to the \nUnited States and can be released and a number of them have; those who \nare a threat and can be prosecuted, which takes up most of our \ndiscussion, but, importantly, a third group is those who we have reason \nto believe will continue to be a threat to the United States, but we \nmay not have sufficient admissible evidence to bring them to trial. \nThat is the category that is the most troubling when we start talking \nabout moving these detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States.\n  Every Member of this body should be concerned with the implications \nof confining such individuals indefinitely inside the United States \nwithout due process. I took the time, after a number of discussions, \nincluding a long discussion with the President about this, to read the \nHamdi case, the Supreme Court case that deals with indefinite detention \nof detainees.\n  There is a conundrum here, if you think about the reality of what we \nare doing. If you bring these people into the United States and do not \ntry them, you are going to put them in a civilian prison. There are \nonly two possibilities here: either as legally here in the United \nStates they have to be given a speedy trial or, as enemy combatants, we \ndo not have to give them a speedy trial until the end of hostilities. \nHow do we define the end of hostilities? We are simply going to be \nimporting a problem, affecting about 50 people at Guantanamo, from \nGuantanamo into the United States.\n  Again, it is not the place, it is the process. Ten years from now, \nfifteen years from now we don't want to find ourselves saying: There is \nan individual in a super-max prison somewhere in Illinois who has never \nbeen charged with a crime.\n  Why do we need to bring that into our system? Why do we need to bring \nthat into our country? We have to commit ourselves to examining that \nissue in detail and figure out a way to move forward. I am committed to \nworking with the administration. I have said this to the President in \nthe past and to Members of this body, we need to move forward and \ndevelop a final trial and detention plan.\n  But the bottom line is, we are a nation at war. The Supreme Court has \noutlined due process rights for detainees. Guantanamo Bay is the \nappropriate facility for holding the enemy belligerents, particularly \nsince we just passed these improvements in the Military Commissions \nAct. I hope this body will think seriously about the implications of \nbringing large numbers of Guantanamo Bay detainees into the United \nStates.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I see the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I will be speaking for only 4 or 5 \nminutes. I see Senator DeMint. I ask unanimous consent that I follow \nhim. But I will be considerably briefer than Senator Webb.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would be happy to let the Senator from Rhode Island go \nfirst, as long as I can follow him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I appreciate the Senator's courtesy. I wish to take a \ndifferent view than our distinguished colleague from Virginia. He comes \nfrom a military background and he views this from that lens. I come \nfrom a prosecutor's and lawyer's background. I see it through a \ndifferent lens.\n  I take exception to a number of the concerns the distinguished \nSenator from Virginia elucidated. My concern is, the balancing of those \nconcerns and the determination as to on which side, military \ncommissions or traditional law enforcement prosecution, the government \nshould come down on is one that should not be a legislative \ndetermination.\n  We have executive officials who are very capable of making this \ndetermination. It is at the soul of prosecutorial discretion to decide \nwhom to charge, what to charge, and in what forum to bring the charge. \nI think we are in the wrong location, trying to inject ourselves as the \nlegislative branch of government into the executive determination as to \nwhere a case should be brought.\n  It may very well be that a great number of these cases should indeed \nbe brought in military commissions. But I do not think it is up to us \nas Members of the Senate to force the executive branch's hands.\n  A second point is, we have had very bad luck with these military \ncommissions so far. Many believe the procedures for those commissions \ndid not afford adequate process to the accused, and, as a result, the \nperceived legitimacy of the commissions was undermined. That is the \nfinding of the Detention Policy Task Force.\n  Some of those shortcomings have been improved upon recently. But we \nare in a stage, at this point, in which article III courts--the Federal \nAmerican courts--have handled 119 terrorism cases with 289 defendants. \nOf those, 75 cases are still pending in our courts, but 195 defendants \nhave been convicted. Our conviction rate has been 91 percent.\n  Our Bureau of Prisons currently holds 355 terrorists in its \nfacilities, by it is own estimation, 216 international\n\n[[Page S11167]]\n\nterrorists, and 139 domestic terrorists. So regular, traditional \nAmerican law enforcement, prosecution by the Department of Justice, is \na tried-and-true vehicle for prosecuting and punishing terrorists.\n  By contrast, the Gitmo military tribunals have convicted three \ndetainees. After all those years of trouble and effort, 289 defendants \nconvicted in our criminal courts, three in our military commissions.\n  So I submit there may be very good logic for those military \ncommissions, but it is not a wise decision and not properly our \ndecision to force the hand of the executive branch of government and \nclose down the side of the war on terrorism that has been most \neffective at incarcerating and punishing our terrorist enemies.\n  I yield the floor and, again, thank the Senator for his courtesy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, I wish to associate myself with Leader McConnell and \nthank him for his leadership on the Guantanamo Bay issue. I know as the \nPresident looks to close this facility which costs the American \ntaxpayers $275 million, people around the country, including in my own \nState of South Carolina, are concerned that we will now move some of \nthe world's most dangerous people into a civilian area that is not \ndesigned for this type of security threat. I appreciate the leadership \nof Senator McConnell in trying to bring some rational thinking.\n\n\n                                Honduras\n\n  I wish to take a break from the discussion of Guantanamo Bay and the \nappropriations bills to discuss briefly the situation in Honduras. \nHonduras is one of America's best allies in this hemisphere. For the \nlast 4 months they have been involved in a constitutional crisis. I \nhave been very critical of the administration's handling of the \nHonduras situation. In fact, I have held two nominees, one to Latin \nAmerica and one to Brazil, in order to shine a spotlight on the \nsituation and get this administration and this Congress to focus on \nwhat I consider very bad policy toward a very close friend of the \nUnited States.\n  While I have been critical, it is important, when the administration \nchanges its view and puts things on the right course, to thank \nSecretary Clinton, Secretary Tom Shannon for their work in Honduras. I \nalso wish to talk a little bit about the situation.\n  As part of my talk, I want Senator Reid to know it is my intent to \nrelease my holds on the nominees so they can move forward, now that I \nbelieve the administration has set a good course for our allies in \nHonduras.\n  Let me take a few minutes to go through the background of the \nsituation. Not many people have paid much attention to it. Over 4 \nmonths ago, I believe our administration rushed to judgment in \ndeclaring the removal of President Zelaya from office as a military \ncoup. All branches of the Honduran Government agreed that he should \nhave been removed. The congress, the electoral tribunal, the attorney \ngeneral, the supreme court, all institutions of democracy in Honduras, \nagreed the president had violated the constitution and the law and \nneeded to be removed from office. For weeks leading up to his arrest, \nPresident Manuel Zelaya defied his nation's laws and attempted to \nillegally rewrite the Honduran constitution so he could remain in \noffice past his term. That probably sounds familiar because that is the \nsame course Hugo Chavez has taken in Venezuela and Ortega in Nicaragua. \nWe know about the Castros, of course. It is a pandemic in Latin America \nthat democracies elect leaders who change the constitution and become \ndictators. Zelaya was on the same course until the democratic \ninstitutions in Honduras stopped him short.\n  He attempted to force a national vote to allow himself to stay in \noffice. He went so far as to lead a violent mob to try to retrieve \nballots printed in Venezuela that had been confiscated by the Honduran \nauthorities so he could not have the national referendum he wanted. As \nI mentioned before, every Honduran institution supported his removal \nbecause of his open defiance of the laws and the constitution. The \npeople of Honduras have struggled too long to have their hard-won \ndemocracy stolen from them by a would-be dictator. The Honduran \nGovernment had little choice but to act in accordance with the Honduran \nconstitution and their own rule of law. They had to remove Zelaya from \noffice to protect their democracy.\n  Since June, the Law Library of Congress made public a thorough report \ndefending the actions undertaken by the Honduran institutions in \ncontradicting the claims made by the Obama administration. Our own \nState Department said they have secret legal memos of their own \nsupporting their actions, but they have refused our request to release \nthem and have kept them hidden from the public. Instead of siding with \nthe Honduran people, the administration decided to put their full \nsupport behind Mr. Zelaya, who is a close ally of Hugo Chavez and who \nthe State Department even said had undertaken provocative actions that \nled to his removal. Despite this admission, the Obama administration \nhas waged a war directly against the Honduran people by denying visas, \nterminating aid, and refusing to acknowledge that free and fair \nelections would solve the problems in Honduras.\n  The Presidential election is on schedule for November 29. It has been \nscheduled that way since 1982, when their constitution was put in \nplace. Under Honduras's one-term-limit requirement, Zelaya could not \nhave sought reelection anyway. The current president, Roberto \nMicheletti, whom I just got off the phone with, was installed after \nZelaya's removal per the constitution. He is not on the ballot either. \nHe is not seeking power in Honduras. The Presidential candidates were \nnominated in primaries over a year ago, and all of them, including \nZelaya's former vice president, expect these elections to be free and \nfair and transparent, as has every other Honduran election for almost a \ngeneration. I have been terribly disappointed with the administration's \npolicies on Honduras and have consistently argued that the upcoming \nNovember 29 elections are the only way out of this mess. We as a nation \nhave to send a signal that we will recognize these elections.\n  I personally visited Honduras last month and was satisfied as to the \nlegitimacy of the interim government of Micheletti and as to the \nlegitimacy of the long-scheduled Presidential elections that will be \nheld later this month. I am happy to report that after many months, \nSecretary Clinton and Assistant Secretary Shannon have led the Obama \nadministration back in the right direction. I met yesterday with \nAssistant Secretary of State of Latin America Tom Shannon and spoke \ntoday with Secretary Clinton. I can report that we now appear to be on \nthe right track. Both Assistant Secretary Shannon and Secretary Clinton \nassured me that notwithstanding any previous statements by \nadministration officials, the United States will recognize the November \n29 Honduran election, regardless of whether the Honduras Government \nvotes to reinstate Zelaya. They have made it clear the administration \nwill recognize the elections, regardless of whether the Honduran \nCongress votes on the Zelaya reinstatement before or after the November \n29 election.\n  The independence, transparency, and fairness of those elections has \nnever been in doubt. Thanks to the reversal of the Obama \nadministration, the new government sworn into office next January can \nexpect the full support of the United States and, I hope, the entire \ninternational community.\n  I applaud the administration. I am thankful they have ended their \nfocus on whom I consider a would-be dictator and are now standing \nfirmly with the Honduran people and for a Honduran solution to the \nproblem. Today starts a major step forward for the cause of freedom and \ndemocracy for the western hemisphere, for the United States, and \nespecially for the brave people of Honduras. They are proving that \ndespite crushing hardships and impossible odds, freedom and democracy \ncan succeed anywhere people are willing to fight for it. The \ncondemnation heaped on the free people of Honduras these last several \nmonths never had to happen. The Obama administration erred in its \nassessment of the situation in Honduras because of a rush to judgment \nbased on bad information. We have all learned a lesson about \ndistinguishing friends from foes and the\n\n[[Page S11168]]\n\nparamount importance of constitutional democracy to international \nstability.\n  For months I have made it clear I would continue to object to two \nState Department nominations until the United States reversed its \nflawed Honduras policy. My goal has been to get this administration to \nrecognize the November 29 elections. Now that this has happened, I will \nkeep my part of the bargain and release these holds. I will notify \nSenator Reid that these nominations can move ahead on his schedule. It \nis no secret that I have been critical of the administration on their \nhandling of these issues. But I take this opportunity today to thank \nSecretary Clinton and Assistant Secretary Shannon for reengaging the \nHonduran Government and working out a solution that President \nMicheletti and the government in Honduras, as well as the Honduran \npeople, feel is fair.\n  There are still a number of concerns. As I talked to President \nMicheletti moments ago, he is concerned that the Organization of \nAmerican States continues to support deposed President Zelaya and is \norganizing, along with Zelaya, a lot of mischief related to the \nupcoming elections, encouraging people to take to the streets and \nviolence. I hope the State Department and the Obama administration, \nalong with Congress, will continue to support the Honduran people and \nmake sure the Organization of American States and any other country \nwill support the agreement that has been signed by the people in \nHonduras and that we have agreed to.\n  I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this issue, to bring it \nto the attention of this Congress and the American people. I look \nforward to releasing the holds on these nominations and continue to \nfollow the situation closely, particularly the November 29 elections, \nas Honduras continues as a free and democratic nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as the chairman of the Commerce, \nJustice, Science Committee, I ask unanimous consent that all \npostcloture time be yielded back, except the 10 minutes specified for \ndebate as noted in this agreement; that the Senate now resume the \nCoburn amendments Nos. 2631 and 2667, and that prior to the votes in \nrelation to each amendment in the order listed, there be 2 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided and controlled in the usual form; that upon the \nuse or yielding back of time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthe amendments; that upon the disposition of the Coburn amendments, the \nSenate resume consideration of the Graham amendment No. 2669, and that \nprior to a vote in relation to the amendment, there be 4 minutes of \ndebate, equally divided and controlled between Senators Graham and \nLeahy or their designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, \nthe Senate proceed to vote in relation to the amendment; that upon \ndisposition of the Graham amendment, the Senate then resume the Ensign \namendment No. 2648, as modified; that there be 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form, prior to a vote in \nrelation to the amendment; that upon disposition of the Ensign \namendment, the Senate resume the Johanns amendment No. 2393; that the \namendment be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no amendments in order to the aforementioned amendments; \nthat no further amendments be in order; that the substitute amendment, \nas amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, \nand the Senate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon \npassage, the Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with \nthe House on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the \nChair be authorized to appoint conferees, with the subcommittee plus \nSenators Byrd and Cochran appointed as conferees; that if a point of \norder is raised and sustained against the substitute amendment, then it \nbe in order for a new substitute to be offered, minus the offending \nprovisions but including any amendments previously agreed to; that the \nnew substitute be considered and agreed to, no further amendments be in \norder, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, with the provisions \nof this agreement after adoption of the original substitute amendment \nremaining in effect; and that the cloture motion on the bill be \nwithdrawn; and that the order commence after the remarks of Senator \nChambliss.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n            Unanimous-Consent Agreement--Executive Calendar\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as in executive session, I ask unanimous \nconsent that upon disposition of H.R. 2847, the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and immediately proceed to vote on confirmation of \nthe nomination of Calendar No. 462, and that upon confirmation, the \nmotion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that \nno further motions be in order, the President be immediately notified \nof the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2669\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would like to speak, briefly, in \nsupport of Senator Graham's amendment dealing with the trial of 9/11 \nterrorists in Federal court. It, in effect, would prohibit the \nadministration from doing that by denying funding for any such trials.\n  This is a very important matter. One of the things we learned when 9/\n11 occurred was that this country had made a mistake in treating people \nwho are at war with the United States, who attempt to destroy the \nUnited States, as normal criminals and that they should be tried in \ncourt.\n  We learned the only effective way to deal with persons such as that \nis to treat them as prisoners of war or unlawful combatants, who are \npeople who violate the rules of war--and all these individuals do, \nbasically, with the way they conduct themselves. So we would try them \naccording to military commissions. The Constitution makes reference to \nmilitary commissions. They can be tried fairly in that method without \nall the rules and procedures we cherish so highly in Federal courts for \nthe trials of normal crimes that people are accused of in this country.\n  I spoke about al-Marri just last week, who came to the United States \non September 10. He had met bin Laden. He had been to a training camp \nin Afghanistan. He had a goal, pretty clearly, to participate in an \nattack on the United States. He seemed to be a part of that entire \neffort. He came 1 day before 9/11. He was tried by a Federal judge who \napparently gave a conviction but sentenced him to, in effect, 7 years. \nHe had training in bomb making and that kind of thing. He had done \nother acts that indicated an intent to kill American people, innocent \ncivilians, in a surreptitious way, contrary to the laws of war. So as a \nresult of that, I think he should have been tried by a military \ncommission, and he was not.\n  As one of the professors said in commenting on this case, it raises \nquestions about the ability of our normal Federal court system to try \nthese people who may be subject to having the courthouse attacked in an \nattempt to free them. Jurors may feel threatened because they are \nwilling to kill to promote their agenda--or their allies are. \nCourthouses have to be armed with guards all around and with people on \ntop of the courthouse to protect the courthouse throughout the trial.\n  They can be tried effectively by military commissions. So Senator \nGraham is serving the national interest in raising this issue. It is \nnot a little bitty matter. It is correct. He has a good idea about it. \nHe has focused it narrowly on the 9/11 issue and on those who \nparticipated in that attack. I think that is at least what we should do \ntoday.\n  We need to have a sincere analysis of the determination by this \nadministration to try more and more cases in Federal court when they \nhave been\n\n[[Page S11169]]\n\ncaptured by the military. In fact, they say there is a presumption in \ntheir commission report to date that they would be tried in Federal \ncourts rather than military commissions. I think that is very dangerous \nbecause military people do not give them Miranda warnings when they are \narrested. They do not do the kinds of things that are necessary to \nmaintain change of custody or to admit evidence into trials in a way we \nwould normally do. These kinds of procedures could cause a trial to be \nextremely difficult. They could bring witnesses from the battlefield \nand the like.\n  It is not the way, I am aware, any country tries people who are at \nwar with them--any country. All countries provide for military \ncommissions against unlawful combatants.\n  I see my friend, Senator Chambliss, in the Chamber. I know he wants \nto speak on this issue.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the Graham \namendment, and I wish to echo the sentiments expressed by my friend \nfrom Alabama, who, like me, has had extensive experience in trying \ncases for many years.\n  In this country, over our 225-plus years, we have been involved in \nmany different military conflicts. In each of those conflicts, dating \nback to the early years, there have always been prisoners captured, and \nwe have always had a procedure whereby we incarcerated and ultimately \ntried those individuals who were captured on the battlefield.\n  The process of how we operate from an article III criminal standpoint \nrelative to criminals in America who commit offenses against the United \nStates of America is one thing. The process we have always used to deal \nwith those individuals whom we capture on the battlefield has been \nentirely different and all for the right reasons.\n  I know there are those who have gotten up here over the past several \nweeks and months as we have talked about this issue from time to time, \nand I have had any number of amendments on this issue and have spoken \non the floor numerous times about it. It is important for the \nprotection and security of the American people to keep all these \nindividuals whom we capture on the battlefield, who are incarcerated at \nGuantanamo, outside America. We have the mechanics set up to try them. \nWe have a very safe place for them to be incarcerated. That is, \nfrankly, where they ought to stay until some method can be worked out \nto deal with them, to have them housed somewhere outside the United \nStates.\n  Unfortunately, the President has made a commitment to close \nGuantanamo by January 22, without ever having a plan in place as to how \nhe was going to deal with them. What we are talking about doing is \nmaking sure, because folks on the other side of the aisle have already \nsaid: We want to bring the prisoners from Guantanamo to American soil, \nwe try them there. Ultimately, I guess they are saying: We want to \nhouse them in American prisons. I think that is wrong.\n  This amendment, though, is even narrower than that. That is why it is \nso important. This amendment says: We are going to take the meanest of \nthese individuals, who get up every day thinking of ways to kill and \nharm Americans, and make sure they never come to American soil for \ntrial and are never subjected to the process that is developed in \narticle III courts for average, ordinary criminals who are tried every \nsingle day in America.\n  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed is the admitted mastermind of September 11. He \nis one of the individuals who today is housed at Guantanamo Bay. He is \none of the individuals who is going to be directly affected by this \namendment. Does Khalid Shaikh Mohammed want justice? No. Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed wants a platform. He wants a platform on which to exude his \narrogance and his hatred of America and his hatred of Americans, as \nexhibited by the plan he put in place to fly airplanes into the \nPentagon, the World Trade Center, and another entity that was probably \nthe U.S. Capitol. That airplane, ultimately, crashed in Pennsylvania.\n  There were over 3,000 victims on September 11. It is my understanding \nfamily members of those victims have written letters and made phone \ncalls urging the passage of this amendment. They are an indication of \nthe strong feeling that prevails all across America relative to how we \ndeal with these individuals who, particularly--particularly--intended \nand did, in fact, carry out an attack against America, an atrocious \nattack that took the lives of over 3,000 people.\n  I commend Senator Graham for even thinking of the idea of narrowing \nthis amendment to include just those individuals who participated in \nthe September 11 attack. I would rather broaden it to include all those \nwho are housed at Guantanamo. I defy anyone to stand and say that \ntrying any of those individuals who are housed at Guantanamo, who were \ncaptured on the battlefield, in an article III court in the United \nStates would be similar to some other terrorists we have tried in this \ncountry. That is wrong. We have never tried anybody who was arrested on \nthe battlefield in an article III court in the United States.\n  So Senator Graham's amendment is very appropriate. It ought to be \npassed. It ought to be passed with a large margin. A vote against this \namendment is simply a vote to give Khalid Shaikh Mohammed that platform \nhe wants to have to talk about why he hates America and about \neverything that is wrong with America. That is not what we ought to be \ndoing in this body today or at any other time.\n  I urge a positive and affirmative vote on the Graham amendment.\n  I yield back, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2631\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, what is the pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Coburn amendment No. 2631 is the pending \namendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I vigorously and unabashedly oppose the \nCoburn amendment. It eliminates not only the dollars from the science \nprogram at the National Science Foundation, it specifically targets the \n$9 million cut in the area of funding for research by political \nscientists.\n  The very first American woman to win the Nobel Prize for economics \never has received 28 awards from the National Science Foundation, the \nscience program offered to political science professors. It shows what \ngroundbreaking work can be done.\n  This amendment is an attack on science. It is an attack on academia. \nWe need full funding to keep America innovative, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote no on this amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of our time, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in favor of the amendment?\n  Is there objection to yielding back all time?\n  Without objection, all time is yielded back.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, people are anxious to finish tonight. If \neverybody will try to stay close and not wander around, we can wrap \nthese up.\n  I yield at this time to the Senator from Texas, Kay Bailey Hutchison.\n\n\n                           MOMENT of Silence\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this body \nhave a moment of silence in memory of 11 great soldiers at Fort Hood, \nTX, who have been shot down this afternoon at the base at a processing \ncenter where they were being prepared to be deployed to Iraq and \nAfghanistan. In addition, the person who was the main shooter has also \nbeen killed. Over 30 of our great personnel are also injured and being \ntreated as we speak.\n  When I spoke to the general a few minutes ago, the base, Fort Hood, \nwas still in lockdown to make sure they have checked every possibility \nthat there would be no more shootings. I know all of us love our \nmilitary and appreciate everything they do. For them to have to suffer \neven more tragedy like this, as they are on their way to protect our \nfreedom, is unthinkable.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all of us show how deeply we care about \nthem right now on the floor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, a moment of silence will \ncommence.\n  [Moment of Silence.]\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank Senators very much.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2667\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided in relation to the Coburn amendment No. 2667. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this is a straightforward amendment that \nactually increases the funding for the IG. One of our weaknesses is \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. According to GSA, this will not affect the \nrenovations whatsoever at the Hoover Building. We are simply \ntransferring funds.\n  I understand a point of order is going to be made against this \namendment. But if my colleagues want control and have accurate work \ndone by our IGs, we need to fund them appropriately, and this amendment \nis intended to do that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I share the concerns of the Senator from \nOklahoma about oversight at the Department of Commerce. That is why the \nbill already funds the inspector general at $25.8 million, the same as \nthe President's request. There is an additional $6 million furnished \nthrough the stimulus.\n  This amendment does cut the Hoover Building and it would only delay \nthe renovations to meet basic health and safety standards. I oppose the \namendment. The amendment would cause the CJS bill to exceed its \nallocation. Therefore, I make a point of order that the amendment \nviolates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable section of \nthe Budget Act with respect to my amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2669\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 4 minutes equally divided before \nthe vote on the Graham amendment, No. 2669.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Colleagues, we are about to take a vote. It is a tough \nvote, and I regret we are having to do this, but at the end of the day, \nI have a view that this country is at war. I think most of you share \nit. Our civilian court system serves us well, but we have had a long \nhistory of having military commission trials when the Nation is at war. \nThe military commission bill which this Congress wrote is reformed. It \nis new, it is transparent, and it is something I am proud of.\n  This amendment says that the six coconspirators who planned 9/11--\nKhalid Shaikh Mohammed at the top of the list--will not be tried in \nFederal court because the day you do that, you will criminalize this \nwar.\n  In the first attack on the World Trade Center, the Blind Sheik was \ntried in Federal court, and the unindicted coconspirators list wound up \nin the hands of al-Qaida.\n  Military commissions are designed to administer justice in a fair and \ntransparent way, but they know and understand we are at war. Our \ncivilian courts are not designed to deal with war criminals; the \nmilitary system is.\n  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of 9/11, didn't rob a liquor \nstore; he didn't commit a crime under domestic criminal law; he took \nthis Nation to war and he killed 3,000 of our citizens. He needs to \nhave justice rendered in the system that recognizes we are at war.\n  Please support this idea of not criminalizing the war the second time \naround.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we all recognize the severity of this issue \nand the passion the Senator from South Carolina brings to the issue. \nBut since 9/11, we have tried 195 terrorists in article III courts; we \nhave tried 3 in military commissions. I think we have recognized that \nour courts are durable enough to stand up to the issues of the \nculpability of these individuals and the magnitude of their actions. \nSecretary Gates and Attorney General Holder have asked for the option \nto use article\n\n[[Page S11171]]\n\nIII courts or military commissions. We are preserving that if we reject \nthe Graham amendment.\n  Let me say something else. Our enemies see themselves as jihadists--\nholy warriors. They don't object to being tried in military commissions \nbecause they see themselves as combatant warriors. They are criminals. \nThey committed murder. The sooner we can convince the world that these \naren't holy warriors, that they are criminals, the sooner we will take \nan advantage in this battle of ideas between those people and the \nsystem of laws and justice that we represent and try to protect and \ndefend.\n  So I recognize the sincerity and the passion of the Senator, but I \nwould urge a vote against this amendment, and I move to table the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. To my dear friend, this is the biggest issue of the day: \nAre they criminals? Are they warriors? Does it matter? These people are \nnot criminals, they are warriors, and they need to be dealt with in a \nlegal system that recognizes that.\n  And to the 214 9/11 families who support my amendment, I understand \nthat the people who killed your family members are at war with us. I \nhope the Senate will understand that so we don't have another.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, do I have time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five seconds.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, this present statute that is on the books \ngives the Secretary of Defense the opportunity to recommend and the \nAttorney General the opportunity to prosecute in either an article III \ncourt or a military tribunal. I think that choice should be maintained.\n  I would urge that we defeat this amendment.\n  I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. REID.

There is now 2 minutes equally divided with \nrespect to the Ensign amendment, No. 2648. The Senator from Nevada is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, my amendment is very simple. It would add \n$172 million to the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program. This \nprogram provides payment to States that incur correctional officer \nsalary costs for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens for at \nleast one felony or two misdemeanor convictions. This amendment is \noffset by simply an across-the-board decrease in spending, so it is \nbudget neutral.\n  I believe this is an important amendment. It is especially important \nif you are in one of the Southwestern States or border States. Local \nlaw enforcement in those states incur a lot of expenses; those \nassociated with illegal immigrants, especially those who are criminals. \nI urge my colleagues to support this amendment and match what the House \nof Representatives did when they passed this amendment by a vote of 405 \nto 1. Let's go along with the House of Representatives and make sure \nour local law enforcement has the resources they need to fight those \nwho are here illegally and committing serious crimes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Ensign \namendment. The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, a program that \nwas not requested by this nor the previous administration, is currently \noverfunded in this bill at $228 million. With the Ensign amendment, we \nare being asked to add $172 million to a program that barely touches \nmost of our States. Since 2004, five States have received 71 percent of \nthe $2.1 billion in funding for this program.\n  Let me say that again, 71 percent, or $1.5 billion of the amount for \nthis program since 2004, has gone to five States. This can hardly be \ncalled a national program.\n  In 2008, during the CJS Senate floor debate a year ago, this \namendment was tabled and rejected by a vote of 68 to 25. I strongly \noppose this amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against this \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I support every comment made by my \nranking member. I believe this amendment will cause the CJS bill to \nexceed its allocation, therefore I make a point of order the amendment \nviolates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. To clear up a couple of facts, first of all, not every \nState has the same problem with illegal immigrants that other States \ndo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I move to waive the applicable sections of the Budget Act \nwith respect to my amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Speaking through the Chair to the manager of the \nCommerce-Justice-Science bill, I would like to ask if she is aware that \nthe President's fiscal year 2010 budget for the Bureau of Economic \nAnalysis contained two important initiatives to measure the impact that \nresearch and development as well as energy has on the gross domestic \nproduct?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, I am aware of these two important initiatives I \nknow from the COMPETES Act, which I was integrally involved in with the \nSenator, that one of the more important policy questions is what effect \nresearch and development has on gross domestic product. There are many \nestimates that it is substantial and it is an important question for \nCongress to consider.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, I would also like to point out another initiative by the \nBureau in the fiscal year 2010 budget on the effect of energy \nconsumption on the gross domestic product. I believe that such \nmacroeconomic information will be critical as we develop a \ncomprehensive energy policy that is currently before the Congress.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Yes, I am aware of the initiative and it is important \nwe understand how the recent prices increases for the energy we use \naffects the overall gross domestic product.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I would like to ask the manager if during conference \nwith the House consideration can be given to help start these two \ninitiatives so that we in Congress can begin to understand how these \ntwo important parameters affect our gross domestic product.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank Senator Bingaman. I will work with the House \nand Senate conferees to give these two important initiatives the \nconsideration they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11172-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11172-S11186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COPS HIRING PROGRAM FUNDING\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I congratulate the senior Senators from \nMaryland and Alabama for their excellent work putting together a \nCommerce, Justice, Science--CJS--appropriations bill that invests in \ncritical national priorities. At this moment, I would like to invite \nChairwoman Mikulski to enter into a colloquy about how important that \nthe Community-Oriented Policing Services, COPS, Hiring Program is for \nour local law enforcement personnel. Given the budget shortfalls faced \nby states and local governments, federal resources through the COPS \nprogram are absolutely essential to ensure that work we are doing \nlocally to prevent domestic violence and drug trafficking, for example, \ndo not go neglected during this recession. I know Senator Mikulski has \nchampioned the COPS program, and. I would love to hear more of her \nthoughts.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Certainly, I thank the Senator for his kind words. As \nthe Senator noted, I am a strong supporter of the COPS Hiring Program. \nThis year in particular, we faced difficult funding decisions and had \nto juggle a number of priorities because we were trying to make up for \nyears of underinvestment in Justice Department programs. That is why \nour fiscal year 2010 CJS spending bill provides $100 million for the \nCOPS Hiring Program to put an additional 500 cops on the beat, \npatrolling our streets and protecting our families. As we move forward \nto conference with the House, I expect to hear from Democratic members \nabout the need to increase those funds. I intend to do my part in \nconference to see that this program remains a high priority in the \nconference report.\n  Mr. BENNET. I agree with the Senator that we need to ensure that our \nlaw enforcement ranks remain stable. In February, this body took \nsignificant steps to ensure that our law enforcement maintained its \nranks through investments made in the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act. The stimulus provided $1 billion for the COPS Hiring \nRecovery Program, CHRP, which was intended to help communities hire and \nrehire police officers during the recession. Nearly 7,300 CHRP \napplications requesting over 39,000 officers and $8.3 billion in funds \nwere submitted to the COPS Office. Because of limited funds available, \nCOPS was able to fund only 1,046--14 percent of the 7,272 CHRP requests \nreceived during the 2009 solicitation.\n  Some local law enforcement in my state are in need of assistance, \nthough, and have not been able to get it. In July, the Montrose Police \nDepartment tragically lost Sgt. David Kinterknecht in a shooting. His \nsacrifice in the line of fire is a testament to the commitment of law \nenforcement in Colorado. Unfortunately, Montrose and some other \ndepartments in my state were rejected when they applied for the COPS \nHiring Recovery Program. After the loss of Sergeant Kinterknecht, they \nwere not only unable to add to their force, but also could not refill \ntheir ranks after this tragic death. The Montrose Police Department \nremains an officer short.\n  The story of the Montrose Police Department is just one of the many \nchallenges faced by law enforcement as they try to protect our \ncommunities. Denver had to forego pay increases for 2010 and 2011 due \nto shortfalls in the city budget, for example. The city faced layoffs \nand our law enforcement made hard concessions in order to protect \ncrucial jobs. Now in addition to making sacrifices in the line of duty, \nlaw enforcement is making financial sacrifices as our communities \nstruggle to stay above water.\n  An increase in funding for the COPS Hiring Program would go a long \nway toward helping communities brace with the challenges of the current \neconomic crisis.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I agree that we need to do all we can to help our \npolice officers to ensure they are not walking a thin blue line. Our \ncops need a full team to combat violence, protect families, and fight \nthe crime that's destroying neighborhoods. The funding provided in the \nstimulus went a long way toward helping put cops back on the beat. It \nis clear that the demand and needs of local communities are high. The \nSenators tireless advocacy for his State's law enforcement is much \nappreciated. The Senator has made his point loud and clear, and I know \nwe will continue to hear from him on the importance of the COPS Hiring \nProgram as we move into conference.\n  Mr. BENNET. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 3288 and to thank my colleagues on the \nCommerce,\n\n[[Page S11173]]\n\nJustice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee for \ntheir fine work on this bill. I congratulate the senior Senator from \nMaryland, Ms. Mikulski, and the ranking member, Mr. Shelby, for \ncrafting legislation that positively impacts the course of technology-\nbased innovation, U.S. competitiveness, and scientific advances while \nprotecting Americans from terrorism and violent crime.\n  In my home State of Maryland, we are fortunate to have many Maryland \nfacilities that have crucial roles in the development and advancement \nof science and technology. The Senate amendment provides $878.8 million \nfor the National Institute of Standards and Technology, or NIST. NIST \noperates a 234-acre headquarter facility in Gaithersburg, MD, where \nmore than 2,500 scientists, engineers, technicians, and support \npersonnel are employed. NIST assists industry in developing technology \nto improve product quality, helps modernize manufacturing processes, \nensure product reliability, and facilitate rapid commercialization of \nproducts based on scientific discoveries.\n  Maryland is also fortunate to be home to several National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric, or NOAA, facilities. The Senate amendment provides $4.77 \nbillion for NOAA. NOAA provides scientific, technical, and management \nexpertise to promote safe and efficient marine and air navigation; \nassess the health of coastal and marine resources; monitor and predict \nthe coastal, ocean, and global environments--including weather \nforecasting--and protect and manage the Nation's coastal resources. \nNOAA's significance is strongly felt in Maryland which, with the \nChesapeake Bay, boasts 4,000 miles of coastal land. The bill funds \nseveral environmental projects important to Maryland including the \nChesapeake Bay Interpretive Buoy System and NOAA's Chesapeake Bay \nOyster Restoration, and the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Center to name \na few.\n  As we are all acutely aware, the decennial Census will soon be upon \nus. This legislation provides $7.32 billion for the Census Bureau. The \nchallenges of the 2010 Census will be unlike any previously \nexperienced. Hot button issues such as immigration and healthcare have \ncultivated mistrust of the government and will impede public \ncooperation on the Census. Responses to economic conditions such as \nfamilies whose home have been foreclosed living in recreational \nvehicles or multiple families ``doubling up'' into single family homes \npresent even more challenges. However, these challenges simply \nunderscore the importance of the Census and the necessity of making \nsure every person counts. The Census count will determine federal \nfinancial formula allocations. Not in the past seven decades has the \nCensus been so significant, economically speaking. And for those who \nquestion whether their voices are heard on Capitol Hill; the Census \nensures that they do through the process of reapportionment. It is \nimperative that the 2010 Census count be accurate. I thank the \nappropriators for their attention to this important matter on behalf of \nthe nearly 4,300 employees of the U.S. Census Bureau Headquarters in \nSuitland, MD.\n  The committee has provided $27.39 billion for the Department of \nJustice. This will fund important grant programs like the Byrne justice \nassistance grants for local law enforcement, and Community Oriented \nPolicing Service or COPS grants, and other crime abatement activities. \nThe bill combats crime in Maryland by providing funding for programs \nsuch as the Annapolis Capital City Safe Streets Program and the \nMaryland Department of Juvenile Services Violence Prevention \nInitiative. This bill supports our law enforcement officers who protect \nand serve Americans each day by giving them the resources needed to \ncombat and deter violent crimes. In Maryland, this includes the State \nPolice First Responder Radio Interoperability Project. The State of \nMaryland has committed to developing a Radio interoperability Project \nthat will link State and local law enforcement agencies for \ncoordinated, comprehensive protective services.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski for boosting funding for the Legal \nServices Corporation, LSC, in this bill, and for removing the \nrestrictions on the use of non-LSC funds by LSC grant recipients. \nLifting this restriction in the law is important, because it allows LSC \ngrantees to use their own funds to pursue class action lawsuits and \nattorneys fees. These are critical tools for lawyers to have in their \narsenal as they fight to protect their low-income clients against \negregious miscarriages of justice, and help the most vulnerable \nindividuals in our society secure equal justice under the law. I \nchaired a hearing in May 2008 in the Judiciary Committee on ``Closing \nthe Justice Gap.'' This bill is consistent with many of our witnesses' \nrecommendations at the hearing, and also with the underlying \nreauthorization legislation--the Civil Access to Justice Act--filed by \nSenators Kennedy, Harkin, and me in March 2009. I am also pleased that \nthe House has introduced legislation to reauthorize LSC, and look \nforward to working with the Obama administration and my colleagues in \nCongress to enact both the LSC appropriations and reauthorization \nlegislation in this Congress.\n  In closing, again let me say how much I appreciate the work of \nSenator Mikulski, Senator Shelby, and their staffs along with the rest \nof the subcommittee. In addition to providing for critical law \nenforcement needs, they have crafted a bill that spurs American \ninterests in science and technology forward; making way for American \ninnovation in the global economy. I find that quite impressive and I \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Commerce, Justice, Science, \nand Related Agencies appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010. This \nbill's priorities will protect America from terrorism and violent \ncrime; create jobs for Americans by investing in the Nation's \nscientific infrastructure and in new technologies; and ensure a timely \nand accurate 2010 decennial census.\n  In Hawaii, as in the rest of the Nation, sexual and domestic violence \nunfortunately persists, bringing with it the need for programs and \nservices that address such violence and meet the needs of victims. For \nnearly four decades, the Sexual Assault Response Services of the Hawaii \nCounty and Kauai County YWCAs, have offered a 24/7 sexual assault \nhotline, 24/7 on-call crisis intervention, and support for victims of \nsexual assault and violence through the medical examination and legal \nservices process, individual/group therapeutic counseling, and case \nmanagement. I am therefore thankful that this bill includes $400,000 to \nenable the Hawaii and Kauai County YWCAs to continue their critically \nneeded services.\n  Like other political jurisdictions across the Nation, Hawaii has \npursued collaborative, community based delinquency prevention programs \ntargeted to at-risk youth. To address this need the bill includes \n$300,000 for Ka Wili Pu (Native Hawaiian for ``the blend'') a project \nthat would provide 400 at-risk youth on Maui with adult guidance and \nadult role models and one-on-one instruction to bolster their self-\nesteem, self-confidence, school attendance, and academic performance \nand dissuade them from becoming truants and dropouts. By encouraging \nat-risk youth to remain in school, fulfill their promise, and avoid a \nproblematic future with few meaningful options, Ka Wili Pu promotes a \nhealthier and more stable society.\n  Recognizing that children and elderly adults can become lost and \ndisoriented in the urban and suburban areas of Hawaii, $500,000 is \nprovided for A Child Is Missing--ACIM--Hawaii. ACIM currently operates \nin 49 States but not in Hawaii, where its advanced telephone-based \ncomputer system only recently became available. That system can place \n1,000 phone calls every 60 seconds to residences and businesses in the \narea where a missing child or adult was last seen. This initiative will \nprovide that critical rapid response to assist law enforcement agencies \nin Hawaii to locate missing children and adults.\n  I am also pleased that $500,000 was included in this legislation for \nthe State Courts Improvement Initiative of the National Center or to \nCourts, NCSC. The NCSC was founded in 1971 by the Conference of Chief \nJustices, CCJ, the Conference of State Court Administrators, COSCA, and \nformer U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren E. Burger. Today, the \nNCSC serves as a think tank, forum, and voice for 30,000 judges, and \n20,000 courthouses, in the\n\n[[Page S11174]]\n\nState court system in the 50 States, DC, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, Guam, and American Samoa, where annually 98 percent of court \nfilings are submitted. This request funds the implementation of the \nNCSC's State Courts Improvement Initiative, which will increase support \nservices to judges, administrators and other personnel in the state \ncourt system. Improving the operations of the state courts will help \nshape Americans' understanding of and confidence in the Nation's \njudicial system.\n\n  Because there may be Hawaii prisoners with credible claims to actual \ninnocence who have exhausted their appellate rights and their rights to \ncounsel, the bill includes $300,000 for the Hawaii Innocence Project. \nFounded in 2005 by Hawaii attorneys in partnership with the William S. \nRichardson School of Law, this project, in which law students work \nalongside practicing criminal defense attorneys, provides pro bono \nassistance to Hawaii prisoners who no longer have access to legal \nresources but who may be innocent of the crimes for which they were \nconvicted, and whose innocence may now be proven through technology \nunavailable at the time of their trials. The possible exoneration of \nany wrongfully convicted individual will help to serve the cause of \njustice.\n  The Violence Against Women Act, VAWA, acknowledges that immigrant \nwomen, particularly indigent women, are a specific and often overlooked \nat-risk group. In Hawaii, the Hawaii Immigrant Justice Center, HIJC, is \nthe only agency providing pro bono civil legal services to indigent \nimmigrants, particularly immigrant women who are victims of sexual \nassault and domestic violence. For many years, the HIJC has coordinated \nand delivered comprehensive assistance to indigent immigrant women \nthrough a cost-effective delivery of legal, medical, psychological, and \nsocial services that would otherwise have required the intervention of \na range of other public agencies and at far greater cost. I am pleased \nthat this bill includes $200,000 for the HIJC to enable the agency to \ncontinue to perform its good work, which not only assists immigrant \nvictims of sexual violence but places them on a path to self-\nsufficiency that will, in time and over the long term, mitigate the \neffects of crime and promote family and social stability.\n  All in all, the fiscal year 2010 Department of Justice-related \nappropriations will help Hawaii to discourage delinquency and crime, \nbring criminals to justice, address and meet the needs of victims, and \npromote a fairer and more just society.\n  Funding included in this bill also bolsters advancements in science \nand technology, as well as enhances U.S. competitiveness. I am proud to \nhave worked with Senator Inouye to secure resources that support \necosystem based management, preserve the endangered Hawaiian Monk Seal, \nstrengthen our understanding of climate change, improve warning systems \nfor public safety, and further science education at the 'Imiloa \nAstronomy Center. These programs will inform our decisions on how we \nmanage our resources, as well as understand and interact with our \nnatural environment.\n  Maintaining healthy ecosystems that extend into our oceans is \nimportant. Coral reef ecosystems provide benefits by protecting coastal \ncommunities, sustaining fisheries, and preserving biodiversity. \nHawaii's coral reefs generate more than $360 million a year on reef \nrelated tourism and fisheries activities. To ensure this natural \nresource is preserved, $2.250  million is provided in this bill to \nconduct studies that will enable scientists to develop predictive \nmanagement tools for the conservation and management of healthy coral \nreef ecosystems in Hawaii and develop best practices to restore reefs \nwhere human related activities result in reef ecosystem decline. This \ninitiative will help ensure that these reefs are protected and managed \nwell, while also empowering coastal communities across the country to \nminimize human impact on our reefs.\n\n  The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration will receive $4 \nmillion in this bill to continue the implementation of the Hawaiian \nmonk seal recovery plan. The Hawaiian monk seal, endemic to Hawaii, is \nthe most endangered seal in the country and one of the most endangered \nmarine mammals in the world. In the last 50 years the Hawaiian monk \nseal population has fallen by 60 percent, with a current population of \nless than 1,200 individual seals. Funding will address female and \njuvenile monk seal survival and enhancement, as well as efforts to \nminimize monk seal mortality. Further, these funds will strengthen \ncoordinated regional office efforts for field response teams and \nenhance implementation of the 2007 recovery plan.\n  We know that there are significant effects of climate change, \nespecially in Hawaii and the Pacific region. As island communities, sea \nlevel rise, coral bleaching, and severe weather associated with climate \nchange have unique impacts on the public safety, economic development, \nand health of our ecosystems and wildlife. Fortunately, $1.5 million is \nprovided in the bill for the International Pacific Research Center at \nthe University of Hawaii to conduct systematic and reliable \nclimatographic research for the Pacific. Improving our understanding of \nclimate variability empowers us to use data and models to mitigate \nadverse impacts.\n  Given Hawaii's geographic isolation, having warning systems in place \nto address public safety needs is critical. In order to focus on \nresponse and preparedness needs, I worked to ensure that $2 million was \nprovided to foster the development of infrasound as a warning tool for \nnatural hazards. As a joint initiative by the University of Hawaii and \nUniversity of Mississippi, infrasound technology has the potential to \nminimize the catastrophic human and economic loss resulting from a \nnatural disaster. The objective is to develop technologies for \ninfrasound warning systems for emergency organizations and traffic \ncontrol agencies. Potential applications of infrasound monitoring may \ninclude volcanic eruptions, gulf coast hurricane tracking, tsunami \ninfrasound warning, acoustic monitoring of ocean swells, infrasonic \ntornado detection, and other natural disasters such as avalanches and \nwild fires. Development of this technology and lessons learned can help \nenhance existing warning systems nationwide.\n  Developing interest in science by our Nation's youth at an early age \nensures that they are better prepared to pursue and excel in the fields \nof science, technology, engineering, and math. In an effort to \ncultivate a life-long interest in science and learning, $2.5 million is \nprovided to expand astronomy and culture exhibits, as well as to \ndevelop community and educational programming at the Imiloa Astronomy \nCenter. This endeavor is a joint initiative supported by partners \nincluding the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and \nHawaii Volcanoes National Park. This program will serve as a model that \nintegrates university/research institution resources with community \nlearning needs using the center as a catalyst to engage and educate \nstudents and the general community. Further, this initiative increases \npublic understanding and enjoyment of science research, while \nsupporting the national priority of attracting more students into \nscience and technology related fields.\n  In conclusion, I would like to thank the senior Senator from Hawaii \nand the senior Senator from Mississippi, the chairman and ranking \nmember, respectively, of the Appropriations Committee, as well as the \nsenior Senator from Maryland and the senior Senator from Alabama, the \nChairwoman and ranking member, respectively, for the Appropriations \nSubcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies, for \ntheir support in funding these important priorities for Hawaii and for \ntheir efforts in developing and managing this bill through the \nlegislative process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Law enforcement agencies \n     may request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons \n     are not necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not \n     all firearms used in crime are traced and not all firearms \n     traced are used in crime.\n       (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for \n     purposes of determining which types, makes, or models of \n     firearms are used for illicit purposes. The firearms selected \n     do not constitute a random sample and should not be \n     considered representative of the larger universe of all \n     firearms used by criminals, or any subset of that universe. \n     Firearms are normally traced to the first retail seller, and \n     sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily \n     represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general \n     are acquired for use in crime.\n       Sec. 517.

The results shall \n     be made available in redacted form to exclude--\n       (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, \n     United States Code; and\n       (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the \n     public access to which could be used to commit identity theft \n     or for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.\n       (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by \n     this Act may not be used for the purpose of defraying the \n     costs of a banquet or conference that is not directly and \n     programmatically related to the purpose for which the grant \n     or contract was awarded, such as a banquet or conference held \n     in connection with planning, training, assessment, review, or \n     other routine purposes related to a project funded by the \n     grant or contract.\n       (d) Any person awarded a grant or contract funded by \n     amounts appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to \n     the Secretary of Commerce, the Attorney General, the \n     Administrator, Director, or President, as appropriate, \n     certifying that no funds derived from the grant or contract \n     will be made available through a subcontract or in any other \n     manner to another person who has a financial interest in the \n     person awarded the grant or contract.\n       (e) The provisions of the preceding subsections of this \n     section shall take effect 30 days after the date on which the \n     Director of the Office of Management and Budget, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Government \n     Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules and \n     requirements, substantially similar to the requirements in \n     such subsections, consistently apply under the executive \n     branch ethics program to all Federal departments, agencies, \n     and entities.\n       Sec. 518.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available under this Act may be used to issue patents on \n     claims directed to or encompassing a human organism.\n       Sec. 519.  None of the funds made available in this Act \n     shall be used in any way whatsoever to support or justify the \n     use of torture by any official or contract employee of the \n     United States Government.\n       Sec. 520.

The \n     President shall terminate the requirements of a license when \n     reasons for the temporary requirements have ceased.\n       Sec. 521.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no \n     department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States \n     receiving appropriated funds under this Act or any other Act \n     shall obligate or expend in any way such funds to pay \n     administrative expenses or the compensation of any officer or \n     employee of the United States to deny any application \n     submitted pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B) and qualified \n     pursuant to 27 CFR section 478.112 or .113, for a permit to \n     import United States origin ``curios or relics'' firearms, \n     parts, or ammunition.\n       Sec. 522.

Mr. President, we have one more vote tonight. In the last \n24 hours we have had a lot of accomplishments that we are going to be \nable to point to. I appreciate the cooperation of the Republicans. We \nhave a number of nominations we are going to be able to complete.\n  We are going to move, as soon as this next vote is over, to military \nconstruction. I have spoken to the Republican leader. We are going to \ndo our best to finish that on Monday or Tuesday. We are going to have \nthat one vote, the one vote I indicated. On Monday, at 5:30, we will \nhave a judge vote. We will see if there is anything else we can have to \nvote on on Monday, but at least we will have that one at--5:30 will be \nfine.\n  Mr. President, we are going to be in Monday and Tuesday. I told \neveryone I thought this was going to be the day that Reid finally \ncalled ``wolf'' and the wolf showed up, but it is not going to be the \ncase. The reason it is not is because we have been able to get a lot of \nstuff done. I indicated to the Republican leader there were things we \nneeded to get done. We did not get everything I wanted done, but we got \nthings I had not put on the list done that amounts to the same.\n  So I am grateful for the cooperation we have gotten recently, and I \nlook forward to a good week next week. Remember, it is only 2 days \nlong.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11186-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11186-S11187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATION OF IGNACIA S. MORENO TO BE AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider a nomination, which the clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Ignacia S. \nMoreno, of New York, to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will confirm yet another \noutstanding nominee to fill a high-level vacancy at the Department of \nJustice. The confirmation of Ignacia Moreno to head the Environment and \nNatural Resources Division is long overdue. Ms. Moreno's nomination has \nbeen stalled on the Senate Executive Calendar without explanation for \nalmost 6 weeks. Nominations for four other Assistant Attorneys General \nto run divisions at the Department remain stalled by Republican \nobjections to their consideration.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the Judiciary Committee \nhearing on this nomination on September 9. When we reported this \nnomination by unanimous consent--without a single dissenting vote--on \nSeptember 24, I did not imagine it would not be considered by the full \nSenate until November.\n\n[[Page S11187]]\n\n  Senate Republicans have irresponsibly held up nominations to critical \nposts in the Department of Justice, depriving the President, the \nAttorney General, and the country of the leaders needed to head key law \nenforcement divisions at the Justice Department. These are leaders in \nour Federal law enforcement efforts. Presidents of both parties, \nespecially newly elected ones, are normally accorded significant \ndeference to put in place appointees for their administrations.\n  Yet, 10 months into President Obama's first term, even after we \nconfirm Ms. Moreno, four nominations to be Assistant Attorneys General \nwill remain stalled on the Senate's Executive Calendar due to \nRepublican opposition and obstruction. These are the President's \nnominees to run 4 of the 11 divisions at the Justice Department--nearly \nhalf. By comparison, at this point in the Bush administration the \nSenate had confirmed nine Assistant Attorneys General and only one \nnomination was pending on the Senate Executive Calendar. The difference \nis that the Republican minority is refusing to consider these \nnominations.\n  The nomination we consider today, President Obama's nomination of \nIgnacia Moreno to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources Division, has been on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar for almost 6 weeks, even though it was reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee without a single Republican Senator dissenting. \nBy comparison, a Democratic majority in the Senate confirmed President \nBush's nomination of Thomas Sansonetti to the position only 1 day after \nit was reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The President nominated Dawn Johnsen to be the Assistant Attorney \nGeneral in charge of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice \nDepartment on February 11. Her nomination has been pending on the \nSenate Executive Calendar since March 19. That is the longest pending \nnomination on the calendar by over 2 months. We did not treat President \nBush's first nominee to head the Office of Legal Counsel the same way. \nWe confirmed Jay Bybee to that post only 49 days after he was nominated \nby President Bush and only 5 days after his nomination was reported by \nthe committee. Of course, his work in the Office of Legal Counsel is \nnow the subject of an ongoing review by the Office of Professional \nResponsibility.\n  Mary Smith's nomination to be the Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the Tax Division has been pending on the Senate's Executive \nCalendar since June 11--nearly 5 months. We confirmed President Bush's \nfirst nomination to that position, Eileen O'Connor, only 57 days after \nher nomination was made and 1 day after her nomination was reported by \nthe Committee. Her replacement, Nathan Hochman, was confirmed without \ndelay, just 34 days after his nomination.\n  Chris Schroeder's nomination to be the Assistant Attorney General in \ncharge of the Office of Legal Policy has been pending on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar since July 28. It was reported by voice vote without \na single dissenting voice. President Bush's first nominee to head that \ndivision, Viet Dinh, was confirmed 96 to 1 only 1 month after he was \nnominated and only a week after his nomination was reported by the \ncommittee. The three nominees to that office that succeeded Mr. Dinh--\nDaniel Bryant, Rachel Brand, and Elisabeth Cook--were each confirmed by \nvoice vote in a shorter time than Professor Schroeder's nomination has \nbeen pending. Ms. Cook was confirmed 13 days after her nomination was \nreported by the committee, even though it was the final year of the \nBush Presidency. By contrast, the majority leader may have to file \nanother cloture position in order to overcome Republican obstruction \nand obtain Senate consideration of Professor Schroeder's nomination.\n  Instead of withholding consents and filibustering President Obama's \nnominees, the other side of the aisle should join us in treating them \nfairly. We should not have to fight for months to schedule \nconsideration of the President's judicial nominations and nomination \nfor critical posts in the executive branch.\n  Upon the announcement of her nomination, President Obama described \nIgnacia Moreno as a ``talented individual'' whose leadership will help \nus ``preserve our environment.'' I agree. Ignacia Moreno is a well-\nqualified nominee who has chosen to leave a lucrative private practice \nto return to government service.\n  Ms. Moreno currently works for General Electric, where she oversees \nthat corporation's compliance with State and Federal laws. Prior to \nthat, she spent 7 years in the Energy and Natural Resources Division, \nwhere she served as a Special Assistant and later Principal Counsel to \nthe Assistant Attorney General. I am confident that Ms. Moreno's \nsignificant experience will be put to good use when she is confirmed to \nreturn to the Justice Department.\n  I congratulate Ms. Moreno and her family on her confirmation today. I \nthank her many supporters for helping to free this nomination for \nSenate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Ignacia S. Moreno, of New York, to be an \nAssistant Attorney General?\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Delaware (Mr. Carper), and the Senator from \nLouisiana (Ms. Landrieu) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Chambliss), the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint), the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson), and the Senator from \nOhio (Mr. Voinovich).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from South Carolina (Mr. \nDeMint) would have voted ``yea.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senate will now proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3082, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3082) making appropriations for military \n     construction, the Department Of Veterans Affairs, and related \n     agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and \n     for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n[[Page S11188]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2730.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for himself \n     and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 2730.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I am pleased to present the fiscal year \n2010 Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill. The bill was unanimously reported out of committee \non July 7. It is a well balanced and bipartisan measure, and I hope all \nSenators will support it.\n  I thank my ranking member, Senator Hutchison, for her help and \ncooperation in crafting the bill. Senator Hutchison's dedication to \nAmerica's veterans and to our military forces has been a tremendous \nasset in developing this bill. I also thank Chairman Inouye and Vice \nChairman Cochran for their support and assistance in moving this bill \nforward.\n  The Military Construction and Veterans Affairs bill provides critical \ninvestments in capital infrastructure for our military, including \nbarracks and family housing; training and operational facilities; and \nchildcare and family support centers. In addition, it fulfills the \nNation's promise to our veterans by providing the resources needed for \nthe medical care and benefits that our veterans have earned through \ntheir service.\n  The bill before the Senate today provides a total of $134 billion in \nfunding for fiscal year 2010. This includes $76.7 billion in \ndiscretionary funding--$439 million over the budget request; $1.4 \nbillion for overseas contingency operations to support our troops in \nAfghanistan, and $56 billion in mandatory funding for veterans \nprograms.\n  In addition, I am pleased to report that, for the first time, the \nbill before us contains $48.2 billion in advance appropriations for \nveterans medical care for fiscal year 2011. This funding will ensure \nthat the VA has a predictable stream of funding and that medical \nservices will not be adversely affected should another stopgap funding \nmeasure be needed in the future. As an original cosponsor of the \nlegislation authorizing advance appropriations for veterans health \ncare, I am particularly pleased that Senator Hutchison and I were able \nto provide the funding in this bill to implement this important \nlegislation.\n  Other funding priorities in the bill include $53 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for veterans programs, $150 million over the \nbudget request and $3.9 billion more than last year; $45 billion for \nveterans' medical care, $4.2 billion over last year; $23 billion for \nmilitary construction, $286 million over the President's budget \nrequest; $1.3 billion for Guard and reserve construction projects, $264 \nmillion above the budget request, and $279 million for related \nagencies, including the American Battle Monuments Commission and \nArlington National Cemetery.\n  For fiscal year 2010, the bill provides $53.2 billion in \ndiscretionary funding for veterans programs, an increase of $150 \nmillion over the budget request and $3.9 billion over last year. This \nincludes $44.7 billion for veterans medical care, an increase of $4.2 \nbillion over last year.\n  The veterans funding also includes $250 million requested by the \nPresident for rural health care, continuing an initiative the committee \nbegan last year. To further improve outreach to veterans in rural \nareas, including Native Americans, the bill provides $50 million above \nthe budget request for a new rural clinic initiative to serve veterans \nin rural areas currently underserved by VA facilities.\n  For military construction, the bill provides $23.2 billion, $286 \nmillion over the President's budget request. This includes nearly $1.3 \nbillion for Guard and Reserve projects, $264 million above the budget \nrequest. As so many of us know, our Reserve components have provided \nunparalleled support to their active component counterparts in \noperations around the globe. Providing quality infrastructure for the \nGuard and Reserve is only a small token of our appreciation.\n  In all, the military construction projects included within this bill \nare as diverse as the individuals serving our Nation--from building a \nfield training facility in North Carolina, to constructing a military \nschool in Europe; from developing a military health clinic in \nWashington State to providing dining halls in forward operating \nlocations in Afghanistan.\n  For the first time since the war in Afghanistan began; the President \nhas requested war-related funding as part of the regular budget \nprocess. This year, we have incorporated projects for Afghanistan into \nthe normal budget order by providing an overseas contingency operations \naccount to support war fighting operations. Within this account, we \nsupported the President's budget request of $1.4 billion for military \nconstruction projects at 22 forward operating locations in Afghanistan.\n  For military family housing, the bill provides $2 billion as \nrequested. The budget request for family housing is $1.5 billion below \nthe fiscal year 2009 enacted level, due primarily to the nearing \ncompletion of the military's housing privatization initiative and \nsubsequent reductions in operating expenses. The privatization of \nmilitary family housing has been a good news story for our military \nfamilies and the American taxpayers. Our military families will get \nfirst rate housing while at the same time reducing construction and \nmaintenance costs to the military.\n  Our committee mark also includes funding to complete previous and \nongoing base closure actions. This bill contains $7.5 billion for BRAC \n2005 as requested and $421.8 million for BRAC 1990, a $25 million \nincrease above the request. The BRAC 2005 request is $1.3 billion below \nthe fiscal year 2009 enacted level, reflecting reduced construction \nrequirements.\n  The bill also includes $276.3 million as requested to fund the NATO \nSecurity Investment Program, NSIP. This program provides the U.S. \nfunding share of joint U.S.-NATO military facilities.\n  Two military construction programs of particular importance to me are \nthe Homeowners Assistance Program, HAP, which provides mortgage relief \nto military families required to relocate, and the Energy Conservation \nInvestment Program. Building on an expansion of the HAP program that \nwas funded in the stimulus bill, this bill adds $350 million to \ncomplete the funding requirement to temporarily extend HAP benefits to \nall eligible military families who have suffered losses on home sales \ndue to the mortgage crisis. The additional funding also supports the \npermanent extension of HAP benefits to wounded warriors who must \nrelocate for medical reasons and to surviving spouses of fallen \nwarriors. As everyone knows, the mortgage crisis has had a devastating \nimpact on many Americans, and our military families are not immune from \nthe collapse in the housing market. In particular, military families \nhave been adversely impacted when forced to sell their homes at a loss \nwhen required by the military to relocate either within the United \nStated or overseas. In such circumstances, our military men and women \ndo not have the luxury of waiting for the housing market to recover.\n  The Energy Conservation Investment Program--ECIP--is designed to \npromote energy conservation and efficiency, including investments in \nrenewable and alternative energy resources, on our military \ninstallations. The subcommittee has added $135 million in funding to \nthe President's budget request to provide for such innovations. Our \nbill also includes language urging the Department of Defense to develop \na more comprehensive strategy to address energy conservation, energy \nefficiency and energy security. While I am encouraged by the efforts of \nthe services at finding ways to reduce energy use on military \ninstallations, I worry that the Department as a whole does not have a \nsingle point of coordination that will ensure that innovative ideas and \nprojects are shared across all of the services and within the \nDepartment.\n  This bill includes $26.9 million for projects at active duty \ninstallations and Guard facilities in my home State of South Dakota. \nThis includes $14.5\n\n[[Page S11189]]\n\nmillion to expand the Deployment Center at Ellsworth Air Force Base; \n$7.89 million for the Army and Air Guard Joint Force Headquarters \nReadiness Center at Camp Rapid; $1.95 million for a National Guard \ntroop medical clinic addition at Camp Rapid; $1.3 million to construct \nan above-ground magazine storage facility for the Air Guard at Joe Foss \nField; and $1.3 million for a munitions maintenance complex addition, \nalso for the Air Guard at Joe Foss Field.\n  Once again we have made veterans a top priority this year by \nincluding $53.2 billion in discretionary funding for the VA, an \nincrease of $150 million over the budget request and $3.9 billion over \nlast year. The Department is expecting to treat almost 6.1 million \npatients in fiscal year 2010; therefore we have targeted the bulk of \nthe discretionary funding for the three medical care accounts, which \ntotal $44.7 billion this year. This includes a $3.7 billion increase \nover fiscal year 2009 for the medical services account.\n  The challenges that face the VA in the 21st century are daunting but \nnot insurmountable. These include modernizing and transforming \nantiquated systems; treating combat injuries, many of which leave no \nphysical scars; and adjusting services to meet changing demographics. \nThe VA will have to balance the services required by aging veterans, \nsuch as long term care, with the needs required by a surge of new \nveterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Moreover, as more and \nmore women are choosing the Armed Forces as a career, the VA will need \nto transform from a culture dominated by services designed for men to \none that includes services specific to the health care needs of women \nveterans. To that end, this bill includes $183 million to specifically \naddress the unique health care needs of women veterans.\n  Veterans Affairs Secretary Shinseki has laid out an ambitious plan to \ntransform the Department of Veterans Affairs into a 21st century \norganization. The bill before the Senate is a step in that direction by \nproviding the VA with the resources needed to address these and other \nissues. For example, the bill provides $6 billion for long-term care, a \n$663 million increase from last year. The funding includes both \ninstitutional and home based care programs. In addition, the bill \nprovides $115 million for grants for the construction of State extended \ncare facilities, $30 million over the budget request. This program \nprovides grants to State veterans homes to construct new facilities or \nto correct life threatening code violations.\n  The bill also includes $2.1 billion, $460 million above fiscal year \n2009, for medical care for veterans of the wars in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. The VA has seen a surge of these veterans and expects to \nsee over 419,000 this year alone, a 61 percent increase in patient load \nsince 2008. Many of these veterans suffer combat specific injuries such \nas polytrauma, post traumatic stress disorder, and traumatic brain \ninjury. The resources provided in the bill are essential to the VA's \nability to treat these veterans.\n  As a Senator from a large, highly rural state, I have been emphatic \nthat the VA must change its way of doing business when it comes to \nproviding services to veterans who live well outside urban areas. Last \nyear, as chairman of the subcommittee, I established a new rural health \ninitiative at the VA, and provided $250 million specifically for the \nDepartment to address the gap in services that exists in rural areas. \nThis year's bill includes an additional $250 million, as requested by \nthe President, to continue this program. To further bolster the rural \nhealth effort, I added $50 million to the bill for a new Rural Clinic \nInitiative. This will provide the VA with additional funding to \nestablish Community Based Outpatient Clinics--CBOCs--in rural areas \nthat are currently underserved by VA health care facilities.\n  According to the VA, roughly 131,000 veterans are homeless on any \ngiven night. This is 131,000 too many veterans. Secretary Shinseki has \nmade combating homelessness a top priority at the VA. To assist, the \nbill includes $3.2 billion for health care and support services for \nhomeless veterans. This includes $500 million in direct programs to \nassist homeless veterans.\n  The bill also puts a priority on reducing the time it takes for \nveterans to receive the benefits they have earned. Funding is included \nwhich will provide the Veterans Benefits Administration with the \nresources to hire 1,200 new claims processors in fiscal year 2010. This \nwill bring the compensation and pensions workforce level to 14,549 in \n2010 as compared to 7,550 in 2005. This increased workforce will be \nnecessary as claims for benefits are estimated to reach almost one \nmillion in fiscal year 2010.\n  The last two issues I will highlight deal with infrastructure, both \ncapital and electronic. The VA operates the Nation's largest integrated \nhealth care system in the United Sates. It does so through a system of \n153 hospitals and 1,002 outpatient clinics. These buildings must be \nmaintained at the highest level to ensure patient safety and high \nquality medical care. Once again this year, the bill contains \nadditional funding above the budget request to ensure that VA \nfacilities do not become dilapidated and that the backlog of code \nviolations identified in facility condition assessment reports is \naddressed. In total, this bill provides $1.3 billion, $300 million \nabove the President's request, to address critical non-recurring \nmaintenance at existing VA hospitals and clinics. Additionally, $1.9 \nbillion is provided for the construction of new VA hospitals and \nclinics. The bill also includes $685 million for minor construction \nprojects, $85 million above the President's request.\n  Funding for bricks and mortar and recapitalization is not the only \ninfrastructure investment made in the bill. In the 21st century, health \ncare delivery is dependent on modern technology and robust information \ntechnology. Therefore, we have included $3.3 billion for the Department \nto modernize its information technology programs, including its \nelectronic medical records, a new paperless claims system, and systems \ndesigned for seamless integration of medical and service records with \nthe Department of Defense.\n  Finally, the bill provides $279 million for a handful of small but \nimportant related agencies, including the American Battle Monuments \nCommission and Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Next Wednesday is Veterans Day, a day on which the Nation honors all \nthose who have served in the armed forces of the United States. I can \nthink of no better way to express the Senate's gratitude for the \nservice of our veterans and the sacrifices they have made for our \ncountry than to pass this bill without delay. Again, I thank my ranking \nmember for her support in crafting the bill. I also thank the staff of \nthe subcommittee--Christina Evans, Chad Schulken and Andy Vanlandingham \nof my staff, and Dennis Balkham and Ben Hammond of the minority staff--\nfor their hard work and cooperative effort to produce this bill.\n  Mr. President, I want to express my sorrow at the tragic events that \nunfolded at Fort Hood, TX, this afternoon. I extend my condolences to \nthe troops and families at Fort Hood, and to my ranking member Senator \nHutchison. Our thoughts and prayers are with her and with the Fort Hood \ncommunity in this difficult time.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, suddenly I find myself a member of the \npowerful Appropriations Committee, but it comes under a dark cloud \nindeed. The distinguished chairman, who does such a great job in behalf \nof our veterans and military construction, has pointed out the terrible \ntragedy that has happened at Fort Hood. So I am here standing in, if \nyou will, for Senator Hutchison, who does such a good job, in \npartnership with my colleague and my friend and my neighbor, whom I \nrespect a great deal. So I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the \nbill before us.\n  As Senator Hutchison departs as early as she possibly can to get to \nTexas to assist in the challenge of this great tragedy, we wish her \nwell, and our prayers are with her and all the people at Fort Hood and \nall the people in Texas.\n  As the distinguished chairman has stated, a lot of time and energy \nhave gone into putting this legislation together. Senator Hutchison \nwanted to thank Chairman Johnson and his staff for working hard to \naddress the needs of our servicemembers and veterans. I am going to \nrepeat just a couple of things that are in the full statement of the \ndistinguished Senator from Texas.\n\n[[Page S11190]]\n\n  As Chairman Johnson has pointed out, the Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and Related Agencies appropriations bill includes for \nfiscal year 2010 $76.7 billion in discretionary spending, $23.2 billion \nfor military construction, $53.2 billion for our veterans, $55.8 \nbillion in mandatory spending for veterans' benefits, and $1.4 billion \nfor military construction projects to assist our troops in Afghanistan \nin their fight against terrorism.\n  A lot of the figures Senator Hutchison has here have been mentioned \nby the distinguished chairman, so I won't go into those, but Senator \nHutchison wanted to indicate and wanted to highlight that she was very \npleased that the bill provides full funding for the base realignment \nand closure actions. The funds are essential to bringing our troops \nhome, predominantly from Europe and Korea, and basing them in the \nUnited States. By fully funding BRAC, we can help the Department of \nDefense to stay on schedule to achieve this goal by September of 2011.\n  Senator Hutchison would also like to highlight that the legislation \ncontains the necessary funds for the Defense Department program \nespecially designed to help our servicemembers who were forced to \nrelocate in this harsh economic housing environment--I might add that \nwe see this at Fort Leavenworth and Fort Riley as well in Kansas--the \nHomeowners Assistance Fund. Chairman Johnson has been absolutely \ninstrumental in making this program a success.\n  The legislation contains about $1.4 billion in emergency funding for \nthe war in Afghanistan. Senator Hutchison, myself--almost every Senator \nknows that the policies of this conflict have been passionately debated \non the Senate floor in recent days, but I am sure we can all agree that \nindependent of our views on the war or the strategy of that national \nsecurity threat, we must provide the infrastructure needs of our \nsailors, soldiers, airmen, and marines, who, by the way, celebrated \ntheir birthday today. This bill does just that.\n  In addition, I would point out that the distinguished ranking member \nwanted to express her strong commitment to making sure that our NATO \nallies--our NATO allies--fund their fair share of these joint projects.\n  The chairman has already gone over the figures for the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, although Senator Hutchison did want to point out that \nit includes funding to enhance outreach and services for mental health \ncare, combat homelessness, further meet the needs of women veterans, \nand expand our health care to rural areas--something the chairman knows \nall about, something which I like to think I know something about, and \nsomething that I know Senator Hutchison knows about a great deal.\n  Finally, we have included $48.2 billion in advanced appropriations \nfor veterans' medical care for fiscal year 2011. This funding will \nallow the VA to better plan the budget for our veterans' health care.\n  Congress has shown its resolve time and again to care for our \nNation's veterans and provide the infrastructure for our men and women \nin uniform. We all owe them a debt of gratitude and will do our part to \ntake care of them.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support this bill. We have no objection on \nthis side.\n  Again, I wish to thank the distinguished chairman for all of his work \nand leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Roberts, the following statement was ordered \nto be printed in the Record.)\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, as the ranking member of the \nMilitary Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies \nSubcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the bill before \nus. A lot of time and energy has gone into putting this legislation \ntogether, and I would like to thank Chairman Johnson and his staff for \nworking hard to address the needs of our service members and veterans.\n  This is a bipartisan bill, and I can say with great confidence that \nthis subcommittee makes sure that the priorities of all Senators, on \nboth sides of the aisle, are evaluated and taken care of to the best of \nour ability.\n  As Chairman Johnson has pointed out, this Military Construction, \nVeterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations bill includes, \nfor fiscal year 2010: $76.7 billion in discretionary spending, \nincluding $23.2 billion for military construction and $53.2 billion for \nour veterans; $55.8 billion in mandatory spending for veterans' \nbenefits, and $1.4 billion for military construction projects to assist \nour troops in Afghanistan in their fight against terrorists and \ninsurgents.\n  This legislation provides $23.2 billion for the Defense Department's \nmilitary construction program. I am concerned that the DOD requested \nover $7 billion less for 2010, a 25 percent decrease from the previous \nyear, and I hope this trend does not continue. Of all the funds we \nprovide for our government, supporting the infrastructure needs of our \nsoldiers is one of the most important I can think of.\n  I am pleased that our bill provides full funding for the Base \nRealignment and Closure actions at almost $7.5 billion. These funds are \nessential to bring our troops home, predominantly from Europe and \nKorea, and basing them in the United States. By fully funding BRAC we \ncan help the DOD stay on schedule to achieve this goal by September \n2011.\n  I wish to point out as well that our legislation contains the \nnecessary funds for the Defense Department program specially designed \nto help our service members who are forced to relocate in this harsh \neconomic housing environment, the Homeowners Assistance Fund. Chairman \nJohnson has been instrumental in making this program a success.\n  This bill funds the Guard and Reserve at $264 million above the \nPresident's request. A significant number of the troops fighting the \nwar on terror consist of Guard and Reserve members, so I am very glad \nwe were able to provide additional resources for them.\n  This summer, as our Nation was preparing for its Fourth of July \ncelebrations, I had the honor of visiting our troops in Iraq and \nKuwait. I listened to their concerns and saw first hand how the \nfacilities we provide in this bill are instrumental in their ability to \ncarry out their mission.\n  This legislation contains almost $1.4 billion in emergency funding \nfor the war in Afghanistan. The policies of this conflict have been \npassionately debated on the Senate floor in recent days. But I am sure \nwe can all agree that--independent of our views of the war--we must \nprovide the infrastructure needs of our sailors, soldiers, airmen and \nmarines. This bill does that.\n  In addition, I would like to point out that this subcommittee is \ncommitted to making sure that our NATO allies fund their fair share of \nall joint projects. I can assure my colleagues, and the American \npeople, that every MILCON facility shared by allied forces is evaluated \nfor NATO reimbursement and that we push hard for cost sharing at every \npossible opportunity.\n  Our bill provides $109 billion for the Department of Veterans \nAffairs, a 14 percent increase above fiscal year 2009. Veterans' \nhealthcare is funded at $45 billion, and medical research is funded at \n$580 million. This bill also makes a significant investment in VA \ninfrastructure needs, with nearly $5 billion for the maintenance and \nrepair of VA medical facilities and $2 billion in new construction \nprojects.\n  The Veterans Benefits Administration is funded at $56 billion to \nadminister compensation, pension, and readjustment benefits earned by \nour veterans. We have fully funded the new education benefits provided \nby the post-9/11 educational assistance program, and included funding \nfor 1,200 new claims processors to reduce the claims backlog.\n  This legislation addresses the many demands facing the Department of \nVeterans Affairs. It includes funding over 2009 levels to enhance \noutreach and services for mental health care, combat homelessness, \nfurther meet the needs of women veterans, and expand access to \nhealthcare in rural areas. Finally, we included $48.2 billion in \nadvance appropriations for veterans' medical care for fiscal year 2011. \nThis funding will allow the Veterans Health Administration to better \nplan and budget for veterans' health care.\n  Congress has shown its resolve time and again to care for our \nnation's veterans and provide the infrastructure for our men and women \nin uniform. We\n\n[[Page S11191]]\n\nowe all of them our gratitude, and we will do our part to take care of \nthem. I ask my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Again, I would like to thank Senators Inouye and Cochran for their \nsupport putting this bill together, and I would especially like to \nthank Chairman Johnson for his leadership and the hard work of his \nstaff: Christina Evans, Chad Schulken, and Andy Vanlandingham.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2732 to Amendment No. 2730\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk on behalf \nof myself and Senator Hutchison and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Johnson], for himself \n     and Mrs. Hutchison, proposes an amendment numbered 2732 to \n     amendment No. 2730.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To make a technical amendment regarding the designation of \n                                 funds)\n\n       On page 56, between lines 9 and 10, insert the following:\n       Sec. 401.  Amounts appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this title are designated as being for overseas \n     deployments and other activities pursuant to sections \n     401(c)(4) and 423(a)(1) of S. Con. Res. 13 (111th Congress), \n     the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2010.\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, this amendment is a technical amendment \nwhich provides for the proper designation for title IV of the bill, \nOverseas Contingency Operations. This information was inadvertently \nleft out of the bill. An amendment would correct this error.\n  I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I believe it has been cleared by both \nsides. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be agreed to.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Will the chairman yield?\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Yes.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. The chairman has accurately described the contents of \nthe amendment. We have no objection and ask that it be agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 2732) was agreed to.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, with respect to amendment No. 2732, I move \nto reconsider and table the vote on adoption of the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal years 2009 and 2010 for overseas deployments and other \nactivities by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \npurposes and so designated pursuant to section 401(c)(4). The \nadjustment is limited to the total amount of budget authority specified \nin section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. 13. For 2009, that limitation is \n$90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is $130 billion.\n  On July 7, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. \n1407, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Act, 2010. The reported bill contains $1.399 \nbillion in funding that the Senate Appropriations Committee intends to \ndesignate for overseas deployments and other activities pursuant to \nsection 401(c)(4). An amendment has been offered that provides a \ndesignation consistent with section 401(c)(4). The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that the $1.399 billion in budget authority will \nresult in $145 million in new outlays in 2010. As a result, I am \nrevising both the discretionary spending limits and the allocation to \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations for discretionary budget \nauthority and outlays by those amounts in 2010. When combined with \nprevious adjustments made pursuant to section 401(c)(4), $129.999 \nbillion has been designated so far for overseas deployments and other \nactivities for 2010.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n13 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n CONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S.

Mr. President, I rise again this evening, as I have many \ndays in the last couple of months, to share with my colleagues letters \nfrom people in Ohio--from Bucyrus, Lima, Springfield, and Zanesville--\npeople who are sharing their stories with us.\n  As I have been in the Senate now for 3 years, it occurs to me that \nperhaps more often than not, we talk about policy up here, but we \nsimply do not pay enough attention to individual problems and \nindividual people. That is why a lot of people think their elected \nofficials are out of touch with them. These letters really do share \nwith us where we are, what we ought to do, and how we should respond as \nwe move forward on the health issue.\n  This letter comes from Ann from Montgomery County. She writes:\n\n       Our insurance premiums have nearly tripled in the last 6 \n     years, going from $500 per month to $1,500 per month. At the \n     same time, none of our benefits have increased. Since we \n     bought our policy, we have paid the insurance company $68,000 \n     for the insurance. Anthem's total spending for my family's \n     claims since we bought the insurance: $4,064.24. Anthem's \n     profit from my family: $64,000. Anthem's CEO's total \n     compensation last year alone: $10 million.\n\n  Ann from Montgomery County, Dayton, Huber Heights, Centerville, \nOakwood--that area of the State, southwest Ohio. Obviously, Ann is \nangry and frustrated with what she has seen. She has paid so much for \ninsurance, gotten so few benefits, and she sees Anthem's CEO taking \ndown $10 million a year.\n  What we see repeatedly in the insurance industry, the average CEO \nsalary for the biggest 11 insurance companies is $11 million a year. \nInsurance company profits have gone up more than 400 percent in the \nlast 7 years.\n  The way they make this money is this kind of business model where \nthey hire a huge bureaucracy, a bunch of bureaucrats to keep people \nfrom buying insurance if they are sick. They discriminate based on \ngender. They discriminate based on age. They discriminate based on \ndisability. In some cases,\n\n[[Page S11192]]\n\nthey use the excuse of preexisting condition to keep people from buying \npolicies, including, believe it or not, women who have been victims of \ndomestic violence. Some insurance companies consider that a preexisting \ncondition. If their husband hit them once, they might hit them again, \nand that would be a cost to the insurance company. They cannot get \ninsurance. Sometimes a woman who has had a C-section is a preexisting \ncondition. She cannot get insurance because if a woman has had a C-\nsection, she might get pregnant again and need another one. That is too \nexpensive. They don't give her insurance. That is how Anthem and these \nother companies make these kinds of profits, because they hire \nbureaucrats to keep you from buying insurance if you have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  On the other end, they hire more bureaucrats to reject your claims \nwhen you have been sick. Oftentimes the insurance company records show \nthat about 30 percent of all claims are rejected initially. Sometimes \nthey are appealed and then they pay these claims. But then you as the \npatient or you the family of a sick husband, wife, child have to spend \nyour time on the phone fighting with the insurance company while at the \nsame time you are trying to nurse your husband, wife, child, or mother. \nWhat kind of system is that, that we allow these insurance companies to \ndo that.\n  What I found in these letters, in the last 3 months I have been doing \nthis on the Senate floor, is a couple of things. One is, consistently \npeople were pretty happy with their insurance, if you asked them a year \nor two earlier, but then they got sick and they found out their \ninsurance wasn't what they thought it was. That frustration and anger \nbuilds from that.\n  Another thing I found is that people in their late fifties and \nsixties have lost their insurance, they have lost their jobs, their \ninsurance is canceled or their employers cannot afford it because they \nare a small business, they don't have insurance, they are 58, 62 years \nold, and they just hope they can hang on until they are Medicare \neligible or until they can get a stable public plan, such as a public \noption, such as Medicare.\n  I will share two more letters.\n  John from Richland County--that is my home county. I grew up in \nMansfield. There is Shelby, Lexington, Butler--north central Ohio.\n\n       Health care reform will not be achieved unless a public \n     option is in place to compete with insurance carriers. I \n     recently retired after 45 years as a family physician. If \n     government-run medicine is so bad, why should insurance \n     companies object to the competition? Cost and treatment is \n     already controlled by the insurance providers whose only \n     motive is profit.\n       Allowing the insurance industry to dictate terms of cost \n     and treatment has not worked and will not work. Please fight \n     for a public option.\n\n  John, a physician of 45 years, absolutely gets it. He says something \ninteresting. I hear opponents of the public option, a lot of \nconservatives say government cannot do anything right, they mess \neverything up, and then they say that if we have a public option, they \nwill be so efficient that they will run private insurance out of \nbusiness. So which is it--the government cannot do anything right or \nthe government is so efficient, it is going to run private insurance \nout of business?\n  The point is, insurance executives' average salary is $11 million. \nInsurance companies' profits are up 400 percent in the last 7 or 8 \nyears. Insurance companies don't want the public option because you \nknow what will happen--their profits won't be quite as high. They won't \ngo up 400 percent. Salaries won't be as high because they have \ncompetition from the public option. They know they will be in a \nsituation where life is not going to be quite as good for insurance \ncompanies and insurance executives. That is why they don't like the \npublic option. That is why they fight the public option. And we know \nthat is why the public option will work. It will mean more choice for \nconsumers.\n  In southwest Ohio, two companies have 85 percent of the insurance \npolicies. A public option will provide competition, will stabilize \nprices, which means prices will come down and quality will be better. \nIf you have two companies controlling 85 percent of the business in \nCincinnati, Batavia, Lebanon, Hamilton, Littleton, Fairfield, or any of \nthose counties, you have two companies controlling 85 percent of the \nbusiness, you know the quality is lower and prices are too high.\n  Let me conclude--Senator Casey is here. He more than any single \nSenator has spoken out strongly and fought successfully to make sure \nthis health care bill works for our Nation's children, from when we \npassed the SCHIP back months ago to the health care bill on which my \ncolleague from Pennsylvania has done remarkable work. Let me read one \nmore letter and turn to him.\n  Cheryl from Cuyahoga County in northern Ohio, the Cleveland area, \nwrites:\n\n       My daughter is paying costly health care out of her own \n     pocket to treat her depression. Despite getting a new job, \n     she was told her condition is preexisting and would not be \n     covered.\n       After struggling for a year to find a good job, she doesn't \n     need this preexisting condition to shadow her.\n       I, too, have a preexisting condition of breast cancer. \n     Please stop insurance companies from denying insurance due to \n     preexisting conditions.\n\n  This letter again shows this insurance reform--our health care bill \nmakes so much sense. I am hearing from hundreds and hundreds of them \nfrom Gallipolis, Pomeroy, along the Ohio River to Lake Erie, Lake \nCounty, to the Indiana border, Troy, Preble County--all over--that too \nmany people are denied coverage because of a preexisting condition.\n  Why does it make sense that people who are sick or maybe are going to \nget sick cannot get insurance? Why does it make sense that they would \nhave to pay so much, they simply cannot qualify or literally cannot get \nit no matter how much they pay?\n  One of the important things about our bill is that it will outlaw--\nthere will be no more exclusions for preexisting conditions. Nobody \nwill be prohibited from getting insurance because of a preexisting \ncondition, including women who have been victims of domestic violence, \nwomen who have had C-sections, men who have had colon cancer, whatever, \nNo. 1.\n\n  No. 2, nobody will be denied care because of discrimination, because \nof their disability, because of their age or their gender or their \ngeography.\n  No. 3, nobody will have their insurance policy rescinded. That is \nwhat the insurance companies say when they take away your insurance. \nNobody will have their policy rescinded because they got sick and it \nwas a very expensive illness they had and the insurance companies want \nto cut them off.\n  In addition to these changes in the law that we are going to do with \ninsurance reform, the public option will make sure these rules are \nenforced, that people simply can't game the system. The insurance \ncompanies will not be able to game the system the way they have.\n  It makes so much sense to pass this bill. It is going to mean people \nwho have insurance and are happy with it will be able to keep their \ninsurance and have consumer protections. Small businesses will get help \nwith tax incentives and other things to insure their employees. And it \nwill mean those without insurance can get insurance and have the option \nof going to Medical Mutual, CIGNA, BlueCross, Aetna, WellPoint, or the \npublic option and have that choice.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about the health \ninsurance reform bill that will eventually come before the Congress. We \nhave a process underway in the Senate that is still playing out. We \ndon't have a bill, but I think we are cognizant of the fact that we \nneed to talk about the challenge we face with regard to health care, as \nwell as talk about some good ideas to confront this challenge.\n  I commend my colleague from Ohio, Senator Brown, who has led the \nfight on making sure the public option is a priority. From day one, he \nnot only has led this fight, but also from day one, way back in the \nsummer when we were actually working on language in the Health, \nEducation, Labor,and Pensions Committee, he and others sat down to \nactually rewrite that section. We are grateful for his leadership and \nfor his ability to relate to us what a public option means to real \npeople--not the concept, not only the policy of it, but what\n\n[[Page S11193]]\n\nit means to real people and real families. I commend him for that great \nwork.\n  One of the areas I have tried to spend as much time as possible on is \nthe question of what happens with regard to our children. Will children \nat the end of this process be better off or worse off, especially in \nthe context of children who happen to be vulnerable because of income? \nWe are concerned about poor children and children with special needs in \nparticular.\n  I believe one of the principles--or maybe the better word is a goal--\nthat we must meet at the end of the road, when we have a bill that gets \nthrough both Houses of Congress and goes to the President, when a bill \ngets to the President of the United States, President Obama, for his \nsignature--and I believe we will get there; it is going to take some \ntime and we are going to be continuing to work very hard in the next \ncouple of weeks to get that done. But when that bill gets to President \nObama, I believe we have to make sure in this process over these many \nmonths of work--and for some people, many years--we have to make sure \nthat bill ensures that no child, especially those who are vulnerable, \nis worse off. I believe we can get there. I believe we must get there. \nI believe we have an obligation, especially when it comes to vulnerable \nchildren, poor children, and those with special needs.\n  To set forth a foundation for that, I submitted a resolution several \nmonths ago, resolution 170. I won't read it or review it tonight, but \nit was a resolution that focused on that basic goal of making sure no \nchild was worse off. I was joined in that resolution by Senator Dodd, \nthen-chairman of our health care reform hearings, this summer. Senator \nRockefeller also was a cosponsor of this resolution, someone who has \nled on not just health care issues in the Finance Committee but also in \na very particular way he stood up for children, as has Senator Dodd--\nboth Senators in their many years in the Senate.\n  We just heard from Senator Brown. He was a cosponsor of this joint \nresolution for children, as well as Senator Sanders from the State of \nVermont and Senator Whitehouse from Rhode Island. Those five Senators \njoined with me in this resolution which I believe is the foundation for \nwhat we have to do with regard to children.\n\n  The chart on my left is a summation of some of the things we just \ntalked about. First of all, this first point with regard to our \nchildren, children are not small adults. It seems like a simple \nstatement. It seems very much self-evident, but, unfortunately, we \nforget that. I think we forget it once we become adults. But even in \nthe context of health care reform, we cannot just say this is a health \ncare strategy or program or manner of delivering care or a treatment \noption or a way to cover more Americans with regard to health care, so \nif it applies to an adult it will work for children. Unfortunately, \nbecause they are not simply small adults, we have to have different \nstrategies for children that differ from the way we approach the \nchallenge in providing health care for adults.\n  The second bullet: Children have different health care needs than do \nadults. I think that is a basic fundamental principle; that children \nhave to be approached in a different way. The treatment is different, \nthe prevention strategies are different, and sometimes the outcome of a \nhealth care treatment or strategy is different.\n  It is also critical that all children, particularly those who are \nmost disadvantaged, get the highest quality care throughout childhood. \nAnd that is the foundation of that resolution.\n  When it comes to health care reform generally, but in particular with \nregard to our children, we have to get this right. We can't just say: \nWell, we tried, and we tinkered with some details or some programs, and \nwe did our best. When it comes to health care for children, not only \nfor that child or his or her family or the community they live in--and \nwe tend to forget this--but also our long-term economic strength is \npredicated in large measure, in my judgment, on how we care for our \nchildren, and especially the kind of health care our children will \nreceive. So we have to get this right for our kids, for their families, \nand for our economy long term.\n  Fortunately, we have made great strides over the last 15 years. \nReally even less, maybe the last 12 years we have made great strides on \nchildren's health insurance. President Clinton signed a law passed by \nCongress in 1997 creating a nationwide Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--the so-called CHIP program. In that case, we had something \nthat had its origin in the States.\n  My home State of Pennsylvania started one of the largest, if not the \nlargest, children's health insurance efforts in the Nation, and that \nwas built upon by way of Federal legislation so that we now have had a \nprogram in existence since about 1997 nationally where millions of \nchildren have health care because we made them a priority.\n  In Pennsylvania, for example, we have had, fortunately, a diminution, \na decreasing number of children who are uninsured, to the point where \nlast year, when there was a survey done for the State of Pennsylvania, \nthe uninsured rate for children was 5 percent. That is still too high, \nbut it is lower than it used to be. We want to bring that, obviously, \nto zero, but we have a 5-percent rate of uninsured children in \nPennsylvania and 12 percent uninsured for people between the ages of 19 \nand 64.\n  For children and for citizens over the age of 64--65 and up--we have \nhad strategies for both those age groups; children more recently, with \nregard to children's health insurance, as well as Medicaid for low-\nincome children, and also, we have had Medicare for our older citizens. \nBut the problem is that age category in the middle, that vast middle \nage group of 19 to 64. We haven't had a strategy recently, or over many \ndecades, and that is one of the many reasons we are talking about \nhealth insurance reform for everyone but especially for those who are \nin that age category.\n  With regard to children, we have to make sure what we know works \nstays in place. We have plenty of data to show that children with \nhealth care coverage do better than children without health care \ncoverage. That is irrefutable. It is absolutely indisputable now. I \ndon't think anyone would dispute that as a matter of public policy. \nChildren with insurance are more likely to have access to preventive \ncare.\n  A major part of our reform effort--and the major part of the HELP \nbill we passed this summer--is all about prevention. Children in public \nprograms are 1\\1/2\\ times more likely to obtain well-child care than \nuninsured children. What does that mean? Well, it is simple. The \nexperts tell us children enrolled in the CHIP program--or SCHIP, as we \nsometimes call it--in their first year of life have six well-child \nvisits to the doctor. That is fundamentally important. It can alter in \na positive sense that child's destiny. Their future can be determined \nin the first couple of weeks and months, and certainly the first year \nof life. It is good for that child in the first year of life to go to \nthe doctor at least six times for a well-child visit, as they do in the \nCHIP program. It is important that we have prevention strategies in \nplace for that child in the very early months of that child's life, but \ncertainly in the first year.\n  Here is another chilling statistic. Uninsured children are 10 times \nmore likely to have an unmet health care need than insured children--\nnot double or triple but 10 times more likely to have an unmet health \ncare need.\n  We hear some people in this debate say: Well, that is about someone \nelse. That is about some other family, someone else's child. That is \nnot our problem.\n  Well, it actually is your problem. Even if you have no compassion, \neven if someone out there says: Well, that is not my problem; that is \nsomeone else's problem.\n  It is your problem because for every child who has no insurance, and \nas a result has no well-child visits to the doctor or does not get to \nthe dentist or does not get preventive care, there is, in some way, an \nadverse impact on our economy. Think about it long term. If you are \nrunning a company, who do you think will be a stronger employee for you \nor a more productive employee, someone who got good health care in the \ndawn of their life--as Hubert Humphrey used to say--or someone who \ndidn't get that kind of health care or nutrition or early learning?\n\n[[Page S11194]]\n\n  All these things we talk about have ramifications for our long-term \neconomy because of our workforce. To have a high-skilled workforce, you \nhave to have access to health care. So that number of 10 times more \nlikely to have an unmet health care need for the uninsured child versus \nthe child with insurance is chilling. It is one of those numbers that \nalone should compel us, should motivate us to pass this bill.\n  Insured children are better equipped to do well in school. Uninsured \nchildren, with poorly controlled chronic diseases, such as asthma, can \nsuffer poor academic performance if their health care condition causes \nthem to miss many days of school. We know that. This is not news, but, \nunfortunately, we have allowed conditions to persist in our system \nwhere a child doesn't get the kind of care they need, and that allows \ntheir asthma or other condition to be made worse. Insurance improves \nchildren's access to the medications and treatments they need to \ncontrol chronic diseases, allowing them to miss fewer days of school. \nWe know that is the case.\n  The chart on my left gives a brief overview of a Johns Hopkins \nUniversity study published in the New York Times on October 30, just a \nfew days ago, which states that hospitalized children without insurance \nare more likely to die. So this isn't just about a child getting a \nslower start in life because they didn't have health care or a child \nnot having a B average in school because they didn't get health care or \nmissing days from school. All of that is terrible for that child and \nfor that family, but this is a lot worse than that. This is literally \nabout the life and death of a child, according to this study and others \nas well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article dated October 30, 2009, in the New York Times with the \nheadline: ``Hospitalized Children Without Insurance Are More Likely to \nDie, a Study Finds.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CASEY. This is what the article says:\n\n       Researchers at Johns Hopkins Children's Center analyzed \n     data from more than 23 million children's hospitalizations in \n     37 states from 1988 to 2005.\n\n  This wasn't a quick survey, Mr. President. This was a detailed study \nof millions of records over that long a time period. Continuing the \nquote:\n\n       Compared with insured children, uninsured children faced a \n     60 percent increased risk of dying, the researchers found.\n\n  So this research showed a 60-percent increased risk of dying. That is \nwhat we are talking about. This isn't theoretical. This isn't some \npublic policy argument we have pulled down from a public policy report. \nThis is about life and death for children. We are either going to stay \non the course we have been on with regard to children, making \nimprovements, strengthening a program like CHIP, or we are not. I think \nit is vitally important that we continue to make progress as it relates \nto children's health insurance.\n  So this is fundamental to this discussion about health care reform, \nand sometimes a study or a chart or a public policy report doesn't tell \nus nearly enough. Sometimes the life of a person says it best.\n  Senator Brown has been highlighting letters that he has received from \npeople in the State of Ohio, and people in Pennsylvania have written to \nme or sent an e-mail or appeared in my office and relayed their own \nstories. In this case, when it comes to real families and real \nchildren, it is especially important to highlight them.\n  I just have one example to share tonight. I received a letter from a \nPennsylvania resident named Denise Lewis. Denise has four children who \nare now older, but when she contacted us, she was recalling what she \nwent through with her four children in terms of health care. All \nthrough their childhood, Denise and her husband struggled with being \neither uninsured or underinsured. What health insurance they have had \nhas always been employer-based but often was limited and only covered \nhospitalizations. Her family couldn't afford the premiums on more \nexpensive coverage, and much of this, unfortunately, was before the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program was in effect. Her family never \nqualified for any other kind of assistance.\n  She said she would work a second job part time as a waitress so they \ncould afford food and to pay off medical bills. Today, even though her \nyoungest is 19 years old--her youngest child of the four is 19 years \nold today--she is still sending monthly checks to her pediatrician to \npay for all the care her children received.\n  Imagine that, all these years later, because of the system we have. \nGoodness knows there are great parts to our system that we should \ncelebrate and be proud of, but there are a lot of parts of our health \ncare system which simply don't work for too many Americans and is \nhurting families, hurting businesses, and killing our ability to grow \nour economy long term, and this is one example.\n  Why should Denise Lewis or anyone have to worry like this, have to \nchoose between food and getting medical care or paying for a hospital \nvisit? Why should anyone have to pay off medical bills years and years \nlater for children who are already grown?\n  At times, Denise said the medical care her children needed would \nactually determine what food the family ate that week. They managed to \nmake ends meet but never had any money for extras of any kind.\n  Listen to this in terms of what Denise said, and these are her words:\n\n       Wondering whether you should go to the doctor is completely \n     different from wondering whether your kids should go to the \n     doctor.\n\n  That is the nightmare that too many families are living through. \nThere are those who say: Well, let's just think about it for another 6 \nmonths. Some are saying: Let's not pass a bill. Let's slow it down. \nIt's too complicated. We can't do this.\n  For those who are saying that, I would ask them if they have ever had \nto face that decision--the question of what kind of care their child \nwould get. Had they ever faced the dilemma of how much your family can \neat in a particular week or can you pay for a doctor's visit?\n\n  Denise Lewis, one of her children had frequent ear infections as a \nbaby, and more than once she would call the pediatrician and ask if she \ncould get a prescription without coming to the office so she wouldn't \nhave to pay for the office visit.\n  Why have we tolerated this, year after year and decade after decade, \nof people telling stories such as this? The Congress of the United \nStates, year after year, has said we will get to that later; it is too \ncomplicated. Why should any parent, mother or father, single parent--\nwhy should any parent have to make those choices or say to a \npediatrician can I get a prescription without coming to the office \nbecause I can't afford the office visit?\n  We are the greatest country in the world. We have all the benefits of \nthe wonders of technology and great doctors and dedicated and skilled \nnurses, great hospitals and hospital systems, all this brainpower and \ntalent and ability--ability to cure disease. Yet on the other side of \nour system we tell people you have to pay more for a doctor visit for \nyour child. Why did we allow this to happen? Year after year, we have \njust allowed the problem to persist.\n  Our system has said to women, you should engage in some preventive \nstrategy. With regard to breast cancer, you should get a mammogram. \nThen we say you have to pay for all or most of it. Why do we do that? \nWhy should we allow that to continue?\n  I want to move to two more charts. I know I am over my time a little \nbit. Let me go to the next chart. I really believe, when we describe \nsome of these challenges, we are talking about, really, a national \ntragedy, that the children in our country should be reduced to having \nthe emergency room as their primary care physician or their doctor's \noffice.\n  When we were growing up, we knew what it was like to go to the \ndoctor, but for too many children the emergency room is the doctor's \noffice. That is not good for the child because that usually means they \nare further down the road for a condition or problem; they are sicker \nand have more complications. It is also bad for how we pay for health \ncare.\n  We also know the emergency room care by uninsured Americans with no \nplace to go but an emergency room is one of the biggest drivers of the \nout-of-\n\n[[Page S11195]]\n\ncontrol costs we often see in our system. That is why we need health \ncare reform now.\n  We now cover about 7 million children in CHIP. Thankfully, \nfortunately, we reauthorized it in 2009. It kind of went by people \npretty quickly, but that was a major achievement. That bill went \nthrough and the President, President Obama, signed it into law. By \nvirtue of that one signature and the work that led up to that, those 7 \nmillion who are covered now by CHIP will double by 2013 to 14 million \nchildren who will be covered by that program.\n  But even with that reauthorization, there are still things that will \nchallenge us with regard to the Children's Health Insurance Program. \nOne of them is a failure that could take place over time where we do \nnot strengthen the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I meant to highlight this chart as well: ``Uninsured low-income \nchildren are four times as likely to rely on an emergency department or \nhave no regular source of care.'' That is the point I wanted to make \nabout emergency room visits.\n  Finally, let me move to the fourth chart. Not only is this program, \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program, a major success across the \ncountry, but it has reduced the rate of uninsured children by more than \none-third. As we can see by this chart on my left, insuring children is \nsomething people across America strongly support. Prior to the \namendments and the markup process in the Finance Committee this fall, \nthere was a proposal to move the Children's Health Insurance Program \ninto the health insurance exchange as part of the Finance Committee \nbill. Many members of that committee, and others like me and others, \ndidn't think that was a good idea. Senator Jay Rockefeller was another \nand, fortunately, he was on the Finance Committee. His amendment in \nthat committee fortunately removed the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram from the exchange.\n  Why was that important? The data is overwhelming that placing \nfamilies that are covered by the Children's Health Insurance Program \ninto that newly created insurance exchange would, in fact, increase \ntheir costs and decrease their benefits. There was a debate about it, \nbut I think the Finance Committee did the right thing. By keeping the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program as a stand-alone program that we \nknow works--all the data shows it. It is not an experiment. It is not a \nnew program. We have had more than a decade of evidence that shows that \nit works. We have to keep that in the final bill. We have to keep that \nas a stand-alone program, and we have some work to do to make sure that \nhappens.\n  When you see the numbers here, an overwhelming three to one majority, \n62 percent to 21 percent of Americans, would oppose the elimination of \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program if they learned that a new \nhealth insurance exchange ``may be more costly for families and provide \nfewer benefits for children.'' We have to make sure when we get to the \npoint of having a final bill worked out that we keep that in mind.\n  We know for now that we have a stand-alone program. Thank goodness \nthat change was made. We know it works. But we have to do everything we \ncan to strengthen the Children's Health Insurance Program, because in \nthe coming years there will be recommendations to change it. There will \nbe others who will make suggestions about how the Children's Health \nInsurance Program fits into our health care system, and we have to be \nvery careful about how we do that.\n  But for now I want to emphasize two points and I will conclude. A \ncommitment to that basic goal that no child at the end of this is worse \noff, especially vulnerable children who happen to be poor or have one \nor more special needs--we have to make sure that happens. We also have \nto reaffirm what I think is self-evident and irrefutable. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program works. We have to keep it as a \nstand-alone program, and we have to continue to strengthen it because \nthere are some changes we can make to strengthen it.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate to meet \nthose goals. I know the Presiding Officer has a concern about this as \nwell. He has been a great leader on health care in his first year in \nthe Senate. I thank him for his work.\n  I will conclude with this. In the Scriptures it tells us ``A faithful \nfriend is a sturdy shelter.'' We have heard that line from Scripture. \nWe have heard it other places as well. We think of a friendship as a \nkind of shelter when things get difficult, when life gets difficult. \nOne of the questions we have to ask ourselves in this debate is, Will \nthe Congress of the United States really be a friend to children? Will \nwe be that faithful friend who acts as a sturdy shelter? Because \nchildren can't do it on their own; we have to help them. I believe by \ngetting this right we can be that faithful friend and we can be that \nsturdy shelter for our children.\n  Let it be said of us many years from now, when people reflect upon \nhow this debate took place and what we passed, in terms of health care \nreform--let it be said of us, when our work is done, that we, all of us \nas Members of the Senate and Members of the Congress overall, that we \ncreated at this time, at this place, a sturdy shelter for our children \nand that we can say that with confidence and with integrity.\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 30, 2009]\n\n                               Exhibit 1.\n\nHospitalized Children Without Insurance Are More Likely To Die, a Study \n                                 Finds\n\n                         (By Roni Caryn Rabin)\n\n       Nicole Bengiveno/The New York Times Researchers analyzed \n     data from more than 23 million children's hospitalizations \n     from 1988 to 2005.\n       Uninsured children who wind up in the hospital are much \n     more likely to die than children covered by either private or \n     government insurance plans, according to one of the first \n     studies to assess the impact of insurance coverage on \n     hospitalized children.\n       Researchers at Johns Hopkins Children's Center analyzed \n     data from more than 23 million children's hospitalizations in \n     37 states from 1988 to 2005. Compared with insured children, \n     uninsured children faced a 60 percent increased risk of \n     dying, the researchers found.\n       The authors estimated that at least 1,000 hospitalized \n     children died each year simply because they lacked insurance, \n     accounting for 16,787 of some 38,649 children's deaths \n     nationwide during the period analyzed.\n       ``If you take two kids from the same demographic \n     background--the same race, same gender, same neighborhood \n     income level and same number of co-morbidities or other \n     illnesses--the kid without insurance is 60 percent more \n     likely to die in the hospital than the kid in the bed right \n     next to him or her who is insured,'' said David C. Chang, co-\n     director of the pediatric surgery outcomes group at the \n     children's center and an author of the study, which appeared \n     today in The Journal of Public Health.\n       Although the research was not set up to identify why \n     uninsured children were more likely to die, it found that \n     they were more likely to gain access to care through the \n     emergency room, suggesting they might have more advanced \n     disease by the time they were hospitalized.\n       In addition, uninsured children were in the hospital, on \n     average, for less than a day when they died, compared with a \n     full day for insured children. Children without insurance \n     incurred lower hospital charges--$8,058 on average, compared \n     with $20,951 for insured children.\n       In children who survived hospitalization, the length of \n     stay and charges did not vary with insurance status.\n       The paper's lead author, Dr. Fizan Abdullah, assistant \n     professor of surgery at Johns Hopkins, dismissed the \n     possibility that providers gave less care or denied \n     procedures to the uninsured. ``The children who were \n     uninsured literally died before the hospital could provide \n     them more care,'' Dr. Abdullah said.\n       Furthermore, Dr. Abdullah said, indications are that the \n     uninsured children ``are further along in their course of \n     illness.''\n       The results are all the more striking because children's \n     deaths are so rare that they could be examined only by a very \n     large study, said Dr. Peter J. Pronovost, a professor of \n     surgery at Johns Hopkins and an author of the new study.\n       ``The striking thing is that children don't often die,'' \n     Dr. Pronovost said. ``This study provides further evidence \n     that the need to insure everyone is a moral issue, not just \n     an economic one.''\n       An estimated seven million children are uninsured in the \n     United States, despite recent efforts to extend coverage \n     under the federal Children's Health Insurance Program.\n       Advocates for children said they were saddened by the \n     findings but not surprised.\n       ``We know from studies of adults that lack of insurance \n     contributes to worse outcomes, and this study provides \n     evidence that there are similar consequences for children,'' \n     said Alison Buist, director of child health at the Children's \n     Defense Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization. ``If you \n     wait until a child gets care at a hospital, you have missed \n     an opportunity to get them the types of screening and \n     preventive services that prevent them from getting to that \n     level of severity to begin with.''\n\n[[Page S11196]]\n\n       The most common reasons for children being hospitalized \n     were complications from birth, pneumonia and asthma. The \n     study found that the reasons did not differ depending on \n     insurance status.\n       Earlier studies have found that uninsured children are more \n     likely than insured children to have unmet medical needs, \n     like untreated asthma or diabetes, and are more likely to go \n     for two years without seeing a doctor.\n       Following a recent expansion, 14 million children will be \n     covered by the CHIP program by 2013, according to the \n     Congressional Budget Office. Advocates for children are \n     concerned that efforts to overhaul the health care system may \n     actually reverse the progress made toward covering more \n     children if CHIP is phased out and many families remain \n     unable to afford health insurance.\n       ``You can't just dump 14 million vulnerable children into a \n     new system without evidence that the benefits and the \n     affordability provisions are better than they are now,'' Dr. \n     Buist said. ``That's not health reform.''\n\n   Mr. CASEY.

Mr. President, I rise before you today to speak about a \npopulation that is all too often forgotten in the poorest corners of \nour world; women and children. A woman's pregnancy should be a joyous \ntime in her life. Sadly, in many developing countries countless women \nsuffer from pregnancy-related injuries, infections, diseases, and \ndisabilities often with lifelong consequences. Too often their children \ndie or struggle from a lack of basic childhood medical care.\n  Over the years I have traveled to some of the poorest corners of the \nworld, from Congo to Haiti. I have seen those who struggle to find food \nand water, battle AIDS, TB and malaria, and fight every day to eke out \na living against great odds.\n  Yet one of the most fundamental struggles I have witnessed is that of \na mother and child surviving pregnancy and childbirth. It is \nheartbreaking to hear stories of women who have been in labor for days \nbefore being able to reach a hospital, of those who die giving birth \nbecause of a lack of basic medical facilities, of the thousands of \nchildren who could be saved with low cost vitamin A supplements, or of \nthe thousands of children left as orphans.\n  What could be a more fundamental need in our world than making sure \nwomen and children survive childbirth?\n  Reducing child mortality and improving maternal health make up two of \nthe eight United Nations Millennium Development Goals. While progress \nhas been made in many countries, an effort to reduce under-five \nmortality by two-thirds and improve maternal mortality to achieve MDG \ntargets has made the least progress than any of the other MDG's.\n  That is why Senators Dodd, Corker and I introduced the Global Child \nSurvival Act of 2009.\n  This legislation is about strengthening the U.S. Government's role in \nsaving the lives of children and mothers in poor countries. The act \nwould require the U.S. Government to develop a strategy for supporting \nthe improvement of newborns, children, and mothers.\n  Across the developing world, mothers are dying giving birth from \ncomplications such as hemorrhaging, sepsis, hypertensive disorders, and \nobstructed labor. Each year, more than half a million women die from \ncauses related to pregnancy and childbirth.\n  The sad reality is that most of these complications have easy and \npreventable solutions. In fact, if women had access to basic maternal \nhealth services, an estimated 80 percent of maternal deaths could be \nprevented.\n  Key interventions, such as adequate nutrition, antenatal care, \nskilled attendance at birth and access to emergency obstetric care when \nnecessary,\n\n[[Page S11197]]\n\nare already improving the health outcomes for mothers and infants \naround the world.\n  But we can do more. We must do more.\n  Accordingly, the Global Child Survival Act would create an \ninteragency task force on child and maternal health. Through building \nlocal capacity and self-sufficiency, partnering with nongovernmental \norganizations and participation by local communities we can better \ncoordinate activities directed at achieving maternal and child health \ngoals.\n  The act builds on existing interventions that support counseling for \nnew mothers. Research has shown that most of the 4 million newborn \nbabies that die every year could be saved by training parents in simple \ncare practices and by training health workers to help newborns with \ncomplications.\n  Factors such as malnutrition, unsafe drinking water, and inadequate \naccess to vaccines contribute greatly to global child mortality. Three \nquarters of newborn deaths take place in the first 7 days of life; most \nof these deaths are also preventable. Effective low-cost tools--such as \nvaccines and antibiotics--could save the lives of 6 million of these \nchildren.\n  The reproductive risks young girls in developing countries face are \nlinked to lower levels of schooling and to underlying factors of \npoverty, poor nutrition, and reduced access to health care. That is why \nthe Global Child Survival Act also supports activities to promote \nscholarships for secondary education. Educating girls and young women \nis one of the most powerful ways of breaking the poverty trap and \ncreating a supportive environment for maternal and newborn health.\n  I am pleased that many partners in this fight are showing an interest \nin moving forward in this fight. In May, President Obama announced a \nGlobal Health Initiative proposing $63 billion over 6 years, \nspecifically emphasizing maternal and child health as a piece of the \ninitiative.\n  President Obama also called attention to maternal and child mortality \nduring his recent travel to Africa. After visiting a USAID funded \nhospital in Accra, Ghana the President stated, ``Part of the reason \nthis is so important is that throughout Africa, the rate of both infant \nmortality but also maternal mortality is still far too high.''\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Global Child \nSurvival Act to help show our commitment to improving the lives of \nwomen and children around the world. It is an important step, along \nwith such basics as clean water and sanitation, food security, and \neducation, in improving the lives of the world's poor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11197-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11197-S11201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION EXTENSION ACT\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Extension and Modification of First-Time Homebuyer Credit (secs. 11 \n              and 12 of the bill and sec. 36 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       An individual who is a first-time homebuyer is allowed a \n     refundable tax credit equal to the lesser of $8,000 ($4,000 \n     for a married individual filing separately) or 10 percent of \n     the purchase price of a principal residence. The credit is \n     allowed for qualifying home purchases on or after April 9, \n     2008, and before December 1, 2009.\n       The credit phases out for individual taxpayers with \n     modified adjusted gross income between $75,000 and $95,000 \n     ($150,000 and $170,000 for joint filers) for the year of \n     purchase.\n       An individual is considered a first-time homebuyer if the \n     individual had no ownership interest in a principal residence \n     in the United States during the 3-year period prior to the \n     purchase of the home.\n       An election is provided to treat a residence purchased \n     after December 31, 2008, and before December 1, 2009, as \n     purchased on December 31, 2008, so that the credit may be \n     claimed on the 2008 income tax return.\n       No District of Columbia first-time homebuyer credit is \n     allowed to any taxpayer with respect to the purchase of a \n     residence after December 31, 2008, and before December 1, \n     2009, if the national first-time homebuyer credit is \n     allowable to such taxpayer (or the taxpayer's spouse) with \n     respect to such purchase.\n     Recapture\n       For homes purchased on or before December 31, 2008, the \n     credit is recaptured ratably over fifteen years with no \n     interest charge beginning in the second taxable year after \n     the taxable year in which the home is purchased. For example, \n     if an individual purchases a home in 2008, recapture \n     commences with the 2010 tax return. If the individual sells \n     the home (or the home ceases to be used as the principal \n     residence of the individual or the individual's spouse) prior \n     to complete recapture of the credit, the amount of any credit \n     not previously recaptured is due on the tax return for the \n     year in which the home is sold (or ceases to be used as the \n     principal residence). However, in the case of a sale to an \n     unrelated person, the amount recaptured may not exceed the \n     amount of gain from the sale of the residence. For this \n     purpose, gain is determined by reducing the basis of the \n     residence by the amount of the credit to the extent not \n     previously recaptured. No amount is recaptured after the \n     death of an individual. In the case of an involuntary \n     conversion of the home, recapture is not accelerated if a new \n     principal residence is acquired within a two-year period. In \n     the case of a transfer of the residence to a spouse or to a \n     former spouse incident to divorce, the transferee spouse (and \n     not the transferor spouse) will be responsible for any future \n     recapture. Recapture does not apply to a home purchased after \n     December 31, 2008 that is treated (at the election of the \n     taxpayer) as purchased on December 31, 2008.\n       For homes purchased after December 31, 2008, and before \n     December 1, 2009, the credit is recaptured only if the \n     taxpayer disposes of the home (or the home otherwise ceases \n     to be the principal residence of the taxpayer) within 36 \n     months from the date of purchase.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n     Extension of application period\n       In general, the credit is extended to apply to a principal \n     residence purchased by the taxpayer before May 1, 2010. The \n     credit applies to the purchase of a principal residence \n     before July 1, 2010 by any taxpayer who enters into a written \n     binding contract before May 1, 2010, to close on the purchase \n     of a principal residence before July 1, 2010.\n       The waiver of recapture, except in the case of disposition \n     of the home (or the home otherwise ceases to be the principal \n     residence of the taxpayer) within 36 months from the date of \n     purchase, is extended to any purchase of a principal \n     residence after December 31, 2008.\n       The election to treat a purchase as occurring in a prior \n     year is modified. In the case of a purchase of a principal \n     residence after December 31, 2008, a taxpayer may elect to \n     treat the purchase as made on December 31 of the calendar \n     year preceding the purchase for purposes of claiming the \n     credit on the prior year's tax return.\n       No District of Columbia first-time homebuyer credit is \n     allowed to any taxpayer with respect to the purchase of a \n     residence after December 31, 2008, if the national first-time \n     homebuyer credit is allowable to such taxpayer (or the \n     taxpayer's spouse) with respect to such purchase.\n     Long-time residents of the same principal residence\n       An individual (and, if married, the individual's spouse) \n     who has maintained the same principal residence for any five-\n     consecutive year period during the eight-year period ending \n     on the date of the purchase of a subsequent principal \n     residence is treated as a first-time homebuyer. The maximum \n     allowable credit for such taxpayers is $6,500 ($3,250 for a \n     married individual filing separately).\n     Limitations\n       The bill raises the income limitations to qualify for the \n     credit. The credit phases out for individual taxpayers with \n     modified adjusted gross income between $125,000 and $145,000 \n     ($225,000 and $245,000 for joint filers) for the year of \n     purchase.\n       No credit is allowed for the purchase of any residence if \n     the purchase price exceeds $800,000.\n       No credit is allowed unless the taxpayer is 18 years of age \n     as of the date of purchase. A taxpayer who is married is \n     treated as meeting the age requirement if the taxpayer or the \n     taxpayer's spouse meets the age requirement.\n       The definition of purchase excludes property acquired from \n     a person related to the\n\n[[Page S11198]]\n\n     person acquiring such property or the spouse of the person \n     acquiring the property, if married.\n       No credit is allowed to any taxpayer if the taxpayer is a \n     dependent of another taxpayer.\n       No credit is allowed unless the taxpayer attaches to the \n     relevant tax return a properly executed copy of the \n     settlement statement used to complete the purchase.\n     Waiver of recapture for individuals on qualified official \n         extended duty\n       In the case of a disposition of principal residence by an \n     individual (or a cessation of use of the residence that \n     otherwise would cause recapture) after December 31, 2008, in \n     connection with government orders received by the individual \n     (or the individual's spouse) for qualified official extended \n     duty service, no recapture applies by reason of the \n     disposition of the residence, and any 15-year recapture with \n     respect to a home acquired before January 1, 2009, ceases to \n     apply in the taxable year the disposition occurs.\n       Qualified official extended duty service means service on \n     official extended duty as a member of the uniformed services, \n     a member of the Foreign Service of the United States, or an \n     employee of the intelligence community.\n       Qualified official extended duty is any period of extended \n     duty while serving at a place of duty at least 50 miles away \n     from the taxpayer's principal residence or under orders \n     compelling residence in government furnished quarters. \n     Extended duty is defined as any period of duty pursuant to a \n     call or order to such duty for a period in excess of 90 days \n     or for an indefinite period.\n       The uniformed services include: (1) the Armed Forces (the \n     Army, Navy, Air Force, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard); (2) \n     the commissioned corps of the National Oceanic and \n     Atmospheric Administration; and (3) the commissioned corps of \n     the Public Health Service.\n       The term ``member of the Foreign Service of the United \n     States'' includes: (1) chiefs of mission; (2) ambassadors at \n     large; (3) members of the Senior Foreign Service; (4) Foreign \n     Service officers; and (5) Foreign Service personnel.\n       The term ``employee of the intelligence community'' means \n     an employee of the Office of the Director of National \n     Intelligence, the Central Intelligence Agency, the National \n     Security Agency, the Defense Intelligence Agency, the \n     National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, or the National \n     Reconnaissance Office. The term also includes employment \n     with: (1) any other office within the Department of Defense \n     for the collection of specialized national intelligence \n     through reconnaissance programs; (2) any of the intelligence \n     elements of the Army, the Navy, the Air Force, the Marine \n     Corps, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of \n     the Treasury, the Department of Energy, and the Coast Guard; \n     (3) the Bureau of Intelligence and Research of the Department \n     of State; and (4) the elements of the Department of Homeland \n     Security concerned with the analyses of foreign intelligence \n     information.\n     Extension of the first-time homebuyer credit for individuals \n         on qualified official extended duty outside of the United \n         States\n       In the case of any individual (and, if married, the \n     individual's spouse) who serves on qualified official \n     extended duty service outside of the United States for at \n     least 90 days during the period beginning after December 31, \n     2008, and ending before May 1, 2010, the expiration date of \n     the first-time homebuyer credit is extended for one year, \n     through May 1, 2011 (July 1, 2011, in the case of an \n     individual who enters into a written binding contract before \n     May 1, 2011, to close on the purchase of a principal \n     residence before July 1, 2011).\n     Mathematical error authority\n       The bill makes a number of changes to expand the definition \n     of mathematical or clerical error for purposes of \n     administration of the credit by the Internal Revenue Service \n     (``IRS''). The IRS may assess additional tax without issuance \n     of a notice of deficiency as otherwise required in the case \n     of: an omission of any increase in tax required by the \n     recapture provisions of the credit; information from the \n     person issuing the taxpayer identification number of the \n     taxpayer that indicates that the taxpayer does not meet the \n     age requirement of the credit; information provided to the \n     Secretary by the taxpayer on an income tax return for at \n     least one of the two preceding taxable years that is \n     inconsistent with eligibility for such credit; or, failure to \n     attach to the return a properly executed copy of the \n     settlement statement used to complete the purchase.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The extension of the first-time homebuyer credit and \n     coordination with the first-time homebuyer credit for the \n     District of Columbia apply to residences purchased after \n     November 30, 2009.\n       Provisions relating to long-time residents of the same \n     principal residence, and income, purchase price, age, related \n     party, dependent, and documentation limitations apply for \n     purchases after the date of enactment.\n       The waiver of recapture provision applies to dispositions \n     and cessations after December 31, 2008.\n       The expansion of mathematical and clerical error authority \n     applies to returns for taxable years ending on or after April \n     9, 2008.\n\n  B. Five-Year Carryback of Operating Losses (sec. 13 of the bill and \n                         sec. 172 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       Under present law, a net operating loss (``NOL'') generally \n     means the amount by which a taxpayer's business deductions \n     exceed its gross income. In general, an NOL may be carried \n     back two years and carried over 20 years to offset taxable \n     income in such years. NOLs offset taxable income in the order \n     of the taxable years to which the NOL may be carried.\n       For purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax \n     (``AMT''), a taxpayer's NOL deduction cannot reduce the \n     taxpayer's alternative minimum taxable income (``AMTI'') by \n     more than 90 percent of the AMTI.\n       In the case of a life insurance company, present law allows \n     a deduction for the operations loss carryovers and carrybacks \n     to the taxable year, in lieu of the deduction for net \n     operation losses allowed to other corporations. A life \n     insurance company is permitted to treat a loss from \n     operations (as defined under section 810(c)) for any taxable \n     year as an operations loss carryback to each of the three \n     taxable years preceding the loss year and an operations loss \n     carryover to each of the 15 taxable years following the loss \n     year.\n     Temporary rule for small business\n       Present law provides an eligible small business with an \n     election to increase the present-law carryback period for an \n     ``applicable 2008 NOL'' from two years to any whole number of \n     years elected by the taxpayer that is more than two and less \n     than six. An eligible small business is a taxpayer meeting a \n     $15,000,000 gross receipts test. An applicable 2008 NOL is \n     the taxpayer's NOL for any taxable year ending in 2008, or if \n     elected by the taxpayer, the NOL for any taxable year \n     beginning in 2008. However, any election under this provision \n     may be made only with respect to one taxable year.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision provides an election to increase the present-\n     law carryback period for an applicable NOL from two years to \n     any whole number of years elected by the taxpayer which is \n     more than two and less than six. An applicable NOL is the \n     taxpayer's NOL for a taxable year beginning or ending in \n     either 2008 or 2009. Generally, a taxpayer may elect an \n     extended carryback period for only one taxable year.\n       The amount of an NOL that may be carried back to the fifth \n     taxable year preceding the loss year is limited to 50 percent \n     of taxable income for such taxable year (computed without \n     regard to the NOL for the loss year or any taxable year \n     thereafter). The limitation does not apply to the applicable \n     2008 NOL of an eligible small business with respect to which \n     an election is made (either before or after the date of \n     enactment of the bill) under the provision as presently in \n     effect. The amount of the NOL otherwise carried to taxable \n     years subsequent to such fifth taxable year is to be adjusted \n     to take into account that the NOL could offset only 50 \n     percent of the taxable income in such year. Thus, in \n     determining the excess of the applicable NOL over the sum of \n     the taxpayer's taxable income for each of the prior taxable \n     years to which the loss may be carried, only 50 percent of \n     the taxable income for the taxable year for which the \n     limitation applies is to be taken into account.\n       The provision also suspends the 90-percent limitation on \n     the use of any alternative tax NOL deduction attributable to \n     carrybacks of the applicable NOL for which an extended \n     carryback period is elected.\n       For life insurance companies, the provision provides an \n     election to increase the present-law carryback period for an \n     applicable loss from operations from three years to four or \n     five years. An applicable loss from operations is the \n     taxpayer's loss from operations for any taxable year \n     beginning or ending in either 2008 or 2009. A 50-percent of \n     taxable income limitation applies to the fifth taxable year \n     preceding the loss year.\n       A taxpayer must make the election by the extended due date \n     for filing the return for the taxpayer's last taxable year \n     beginning in 2009, and in such manner as may be prescribed by \n     the Secretary. An election, once made, is irrevocable.\n       An eligible small business that timely made (or timely \n     makes) an election under the provision as in effect on the \n     day before the enactment of the bill to carryback its \n     applicable 2008 NOL may also elect to carryback a 2009 NOL \n     under the amended provision. It is intended that an eligible \n     small business may continue to make the present-law election \n     under procedures prescribed in Rev. Proc. 2009-26 following \n     the enactment of the bill.\n       The provision generally does not apply to: (1) any taxpayer \n     if (a) the Federal government acquired or acquires at any \n     time, an equity interest in the taxpayer pursuant to the \n     Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, or (b) the \n     Federal government acquired or acquires, at any time, any \n     warrant (or other right) to acquire any equity interest with \n     respect to the taxpayer pursuant to such Act; (2) the Federal \n     National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan \n     Mortgage Corporation; and (3) any taxpayer that in 2008 or \n     2009 is a member of the same affiliated group (as defined in \n     section 1504 without regard to subsection (b) thereof) as a \n     taxpayer to which the provision does not otherwise apply. An \n     equity interest (or right to acquire an equity interest) is \n     disregarded for this purpose if acquired by the Federal\n\n[[Page S11199]]\n\n     government after the date of enactment from a financial \n     institution pursuant to a program established by the \n     Secretary for the stated purpose of increasing the \n     availability of credit to small businesses using funding made \n     available under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n     2008.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is generally effective for net operating \n     losses arising in taxable years ending after December 31, \n     2007. The modification to the alternative tax NOL deduction \n     applies to taxable years ending after December 31, 2002. The \n     modification with respect to operating loss deductions of \n     life insurance companies applies to losses from operations \n     arising in taxable years ending after December 31, 2007.\n       Under transition rules, a taxpayer may revoke any election \n     to waive the carryback period under either section 172(b)(3) \n     or section 810(b)(3) with respect to an applicable NOL or an \n     applicable loss from operations for a taxable year ending \n     before the date of enactment by the extended due date for \n     filing the tax return for the taxpayer's last taxable year \n     beginning in 2009. Similarly, any application for a tentative \n     carryback adjustment under section 6411(a) with respect to \n     such loss is treated as timely filed if filed by the extended \n     due date for filing the tax return for the taxpayer's last \n     taxable year beginning in 2009.\n\n C. Exclusion from Gross Income of Qualified Military Base Realignment \n   and Closure Fringe (sec. 14 of the bill and sec. 132 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     Homeowners Assistance Program payment\n       The Department of Defense Homeowners Assistance Program \n     (``HAP'') provides payments to certain employees and members \n     of the Armed Forces to offset the adverse effects on housing \n     values that result from a military base realignment or \n     closure.\n       In general, under the HAP, eligible individuals receive \n     either: (1) a cash payment as compensation for losses that \n     may be or have been sustained in a private sale, in an amount \n     not to exceed the difference between (a) 95 percent of the \n     fair market value of their property prior to public \n     announcement of intention to close all or part of the \n     military base or installation and (b) the fair market value \n     of such property at the time of the sale; or (2) as the \n     purchase price for their property, an amount not to exceed 90 \n     percent of the prior fair market value as determined by the \n     Secretary of Defense, or the amount of the outstanding \n     mortgages.\n       The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expands \n     the HAP in various ways. It amends the Demonstration Cities \n     and Metropolitan Development Act of 1966 to allow, under the \n     HAP under such Act, the Secretary of Defense to provide \n     assistance or reimbursement for certain losses in the sale of \n     family dwellings by members of the Armed Forces living on or \n     near a military installation in situations where: (1) there \n     was a base closure or realignment; (2) the property was \n     purchased before July 1, 2006, and sold between that date and \n     September 30, 2012; (3) the property is the owner's primary \n     residence; and (4) the owner has not previously received \n     benefits under the HAP. Further, it authorizes similar HAP \n     assistance or reimbursement with respect to: (1) wounded \n     members and wounded civilian Department of Defense and Coast \n     Guard employees (and their spouses); and (2) members \n     permanently reassigned from an area at or near a military \n     installation to a new duty station more than 50 miles away \n     (with similar purchase and sale date, residence, and no-\n     previous-benefit requirements as above). It allows the \n     Secretary to provide compensation for losses from home sales \n     by such individuals to ensure the realization of at least 90 \n     percent (in some cases, 95 percent) of the pre-mortgage-\n     crisis assessed value of such property.\n     Tax treatment\n       Present law generally excludes from gross income amounts \n     received under the HAP (as in effect on November 11, 2003). \n     Amounts received under the program also are not considered \n     wages for FICA tax purposes (including Medicare). The \n     excludable amount is limited to the reduction in the fair \n     market value of property.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The bill expands the exclusion to HAP payments authorized \n     under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for payments made after February \n     17, 2009 (the date of enactment of the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Tax Act of 2009).\n\nD. Delay in Application of Worldwide Allocation of Interest (sec. 15 of \n                   the bill and sec. 864 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n     In general\n       To compute the foreign tax credit limitation, a taxpayer \n     must determine the amount of its taxable income from foreign \n     sources. Thus, the taxpayer must allocate and apportion \n     deductions between items of U.S.-source gross income, on the \n     one hand, and items of foreign-source gross income, on the \n     other.\n       In the case of interest expense, the rules generally are \n     based on the approach that money is fungible and that \n     interest expense is properly attributable to all business \n     activities and property of a taxpayer, regardless of any \n     specific purpose for incurring an obligation on which \n     interest is paid. For interest allocation purposes, all \n     members of an affiliated group of corporations generally are \n     treated as a single corporation (the so-called ``one-taxpayer \n     rule'') and allocation must be made on the basis of assets \n     rather than gross income. The term ``affiliated group'' in \n     this context generally is defined by reference to the rules \n     for determining whether corporations are eligible to file \n     consolidated returns.\n       For consolidation purposes, the term ``affiliated group'' \n     means one or more chains of includible corporations connected \n     through stock ownership with a common parent corporation that \n     is an includible corporation, but only if: (1) the common \n     parent owns directly stock possessing at least 80 percent of \n     the total voting power and at least 80 percent of the total \n     value of at least one other includible corporation; and (2) \n     stock meeting the same voting power and value standards with \n     respect to each includible corporation (excluding the common \n     parent) is directly owned by one or more other includible \n     corporations.\n       Generally, the term ``includible corporation'' means any \n     domestic corporation except certain corporations exempt from \n     tax under section 501 (for example, corporations organized \n     and operated exclusively for charitable or educational \n     purposes), certain life insurance companies, corporations \n     electing application of the possession tax credit, regulated \n     investment companies, real estate investment trusts, and \n     domestic international sales corporations. A foreign \n     corporation generally is not an includible corporation.\n       Subject to exceptions, the consolidated return and interest \n     allocation definitions of affiliation generally are \n     consistent with each other. For example, both definitions \n     generally exclude all foreign corporations from the \n     affiliated group. Thus, while debt generally is considered \n     fungible among the assets of a group of domestic affiliated \n     corporations, the same rules do not apply as between the \n     domestic and foreign members of a group with the same degree \n     of common control as the domestic affiliated group.\n       Banks, savings institutions, and other financial affiliates\n       The affiliated group for interest allocation purposes \n     generally excludes what are referred to in the Treasury \n     regulations as ``financial corporations.'' A financial \n     corporation includes any corporation, otherwise a member of \n     the affiliated group for consolidation purposes, that is a \n     financial institution (described in section 581 or section \n     591), the business of which is predominantly with persons \n     other than related persons or their customers, and which is \n     required by State or Federal law to be operated separately \n     from any other entity that is not a financial institution. \n     The category of financial corporations also includes, to the \n     extent provided in regulations, bank holding companies \n     (including financial holding companies), subsidiaries of \n     banks and bank holding companies (including financial holding \n     companies), and savings institutions predominantly engaged in \n     the active conduct of a banking, financing, or similar \n     business.\n       A financial corporation is not treated as a member of the \n     regular affiliated group for purposes of applying the one-\n     taxpayer rule to other non-financial members of that group. \n     Instead, all such financial corporations that would be so \n     affiliated are treated as a separate single corporation for \n     interest allocation purposes.\n     Worldwide interest allocation\n       In general\n       The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (``AJCA'') modified \n     the interest expense allocation rules described above (which \n     generally apply for purposes of computing the foreign tax \n     credit limitation) by providing a one-time election (the \n     ``worldwide affiliated group election'') under which the \n     taxable income of the domestic members of an affiliated group \n     from sources outside the United States generally is \n     determined by allocating and apportioning interest expense of \n     the domestic members of a worldwide affiliated group on a \n     worldwide-group basis (i.e., as if all members of the \n     worldwide group were a single corporation). If a group makes \n     this election, the taxable income of the domestic members of \n     a worldwide affiliated group from sources outside the United \n     States is determined by allocating and apportioning the \n     third-party interest expense of those domestic members to \n     foreign-source income in an amount equal to the excess (if \n     any) of (1) the worldwide affiliated group's worldwide third-\n     party interest expense multiplied by the ratio that the \n     foreign assets of the worldwide affiliated group bears to the \n     total assets of the worldwide affiliated group, over (2) the \n     third-party interest expense incurred by foreign members of \n     the group to the extent such interest would be allocated to \n     foreign sources if the principles of worldwide interest \n     allocation were applied separately to the foreign members of \n     the group.\n       For purposes of the new elective rules based on worldwide \n     fungibility, the worldwide affiliated group means all \n     corporations in an affiliated group as well as all controlled \n     foreign corporations that, in the aggregate, either directly \n     or indirectly, would be members of such an affiliated group \n     if section 1504(b)(3) did not apply (i.e., in which at least \n     80 percent of the vote and value of the stock of such \n     corporations is owned by one or more other corporations \n     included in the affiliated group). Thus, if an affiliated \n     group\n\n[[Page S11200]]\n\n     makes this election, the taxable income from sources outside \n     the United States of domestic group members generally is \n     determined by allocating and apportioning interest expense of \n     the domestic members of the worldwide affiliated group as if \n     all of the interest expense and assets of 80-percent or \n     greater owned domestic corporations (i.e., corporations that \n     are part of the affiliated group, as modified to include \n     insurance companies) and certain controlled foreign \n     corporations were attributable to a single corporation.\n       Financial institution group election\n       Taxpayers are allowed to apply the bank group rules to \n     exclude certain financial institutions from the affiliated \n     group for interest allocation purposes under the worldwide \n     fungibility approach. The rules also provide a one-time \n     ``financial institution group'' election that expands the \n     bank group. At the election of the common parent of the pre-\n     election worldwide affiliated group, the interest expense \n     allocation rules are applied separately to a subgroup of the \n     worldwide affiliated group that consists of (1) all \n     corporations that are part of the bank group, and (2) all \n     ``financial corporations.'' For this purpose, a corporation \n     is a financial corporation if at least 80 percent of its \n     gross income is financial services income (as described in \n     section 904(d)(2)(C)(i) and the regulations thereunder) that \n     is derived from transactions with unrelated persons. For \n     these purposes, items of income or gain from a transaction or \n     series of transactions are disregarded if a principal purpose \n     for the transaction or transactions is to qualify any \n     corporation as a financial corporation.\n       In addition, anti-abuse rules are provided under which \n     certain transfers from one member of a financial institution \n     group to a member of the worldwide affiliated group outside \n     of the financial institution group are treated as reducing \n     the amount of indebtedness of the separate financial \n     institution group. Regulatory authority is provided with \n     respect to the election to provide for the direct allocation \n     of interest expense in circumstances in which such allocation \n     is appropriate to carry out the purposes of these rules, to \n     prevent assets or interest expense from being taken into \n     account more than once, or to address changes in members of \n     any group (through acquisitions or otherwise) treated as \n     affiliated under these rules.\n       Effective date of worldwide interest allocation\n       The common parent of the domestic affiliated group must \n     make the worldwide affiliated group election. It must be made \n     for the first taxable year beginning after December 31, 2010, \n     in which a worldwide affiliated group exists that includes at \n     least one foreign corporation that meets the requirements for \n     inclusion in a worldwide affiliated group. The common parent \n     of the pre-election worldwide affiliated group must make the \n     election for the first taxable year beginning after December \n     31, 2010, in which a worldwide affiliated group includes a \n     financial corporation. Once either election is made, it \n     applies to the common parent and all other members of the \n     worldwide affiliated group or to all members of the financial \n     institution group, as applicable, for the taxable year for \n     which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years, \n     unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary of the \n     Treasury.\n       Phase-in rule\n       HERA also provided a special phase-in rule in the case of \n     the first taxable year to which the worldwide interest \n     allocation rules apply. For that year, the amount of the \n     taxpayer's taxable income from foreign sources is reduced by \n     70 percent of the excess of (i) the amount of its taxable \n     income from foreign sources as calculated using the worldwide \n     interest allocation rules over (ii) the amount of its taxable \n     income from foreign sources as calculated using the present-\n     law interest allocation rules. For that year, the amount of \n     the taxpayer's taxable income from domestic sources is \n     increased by a corresponding amount. Any foreign tax credits \n     disallowed by virtue of this reduction in foreign-source \n     taxable income may be carried back or forward under the \n     normal rules for carrybacks and carryforwards of excess \n     foreign tax credits.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision delays the effective date of worldwide \n     interest allocation rules for seven years, until taxable \n     years beginning after December 31, 2017. The required dates \n     for making the worldwide affiliated group election and the \n     financial institution group election are changed accordingly.\n       The provision also eliminates the special phase-in rule \n     that applies in the case of the first taxable year to which \n     the worldwide interest allocation rules apply.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for taxable years beginning \n     after December 31, 2010.\n\n    E. Modification of Penalty for Failure To File Partnership or S \nCorporation Returns (sec. 16 of the bill and secs. 6698 and 6699 of the \n                                 Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       Both partnerships and S corporations are generally treated \n     as pass-through entities that do not incur an income tax at \n     the entity level. Income earned by a partnership, whether \n     distributed or not, is taxed to the partners. Distributions \n     from the partnership generally are tax-free. The items of \n     income, gain, loss, deduction or credit of a partnership \n     generally are taken into account by a partner as allocated \n     under the terms of the partnership agreement. If the \n     agreement does not provide for an allocation, or the agreed \n     allocation does not have substantial economic effect, then \n     the items are to be allocated in accordance with the \n     partners' interests in the partnership. To prevent double \n     taxation of these items, a partner's basis in its interest is \n     increased by its share of partnership income (including tax-\n     exempt income), and is decreased by its share of any losses \n     (including nondeductible losses). An S corporation generally \n     is not subject to corporate-level income tax on its items of \n     income and loss. Instead, the S corporation passes through \n     its items of income and loss to its shareholders. The \n     shareholders take into account separately their shares of \n     these items on their individual income tax returns.\n       Under present law, both partnerships and S corporations are \n     required to file tax returns for each taxable year. The \n     partnership's tax return is required to include the names and \n     addresses of the individuals who would be entitled to share \n     in the taxable income if distributed and the amount of the \n     distributive share of each individual. The S corporation's \n     tax return is required to include the following: the names \n     and addresses of all persons owning stock in the corporation \n     at any time during the taxable year; the number of shares of \n     stock owned by each shareholder at all times during the \n     taxable year; the amount of money and other property \n     distributed by the corporation during the taxable year to \n     each shareholder and the date of such distribution; each \n     shareholder's pro rata share of each item of the corporation \n     for the taxable year; and such other information as the \n     Secretary may require.\n       In addition to applicable criminal penalties, present law \n     imposes assessable civil penalties for both the failure to \n     file a partnership return and the failure to file an S \n     corporation return. Each of these penalties is currently $89 \n     times the number of shareholders or partners for each month \n     (or fraction of a month) that the failure continues, up to a \n     maximum of 12 months for returns required to be filed after \n     December 31, 2008.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       Under the provision, the base amount on which a penalty is \n     computed for a failure with respect to filing either a \n     partnership or S corporation return is increased to $195 per \n     partner or shareholder.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision applies to returns for taxable years \n     beginning after December 31, 2009.\n\n F. Expansion of Electronic Filing by Return Preparers (sec. 17 of the \n                   bill and sec. 6011(e) of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       The IRS Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998 (``RRA 1998'') \n     states a Congressional policy to promote the paperless filing \n     of Federal tax returns. Section 2001(a) of RRA 1998 sets a \n     goal for the IRS to have at least 80 percent of all Federal \n     tax and information returns filed electronically by 2007. \n     Section 2001(b) of RRA 1998 requires the IRS to establish a \n     10-year strategic plan to eliminate barriers to electronic \n     filing.\n       Present law authorizes the IRS to issue regulations \n     specifying which returns must be filed electronically. There \n     are several limitations on this authority. First, it can only \n     apply to persons required to file at least 250 returns during \n     the calendar year. Second, the Secretary is prohibited from \n     requiring that income tax returns of individuals, estates, \n     and trusts be submitted in any format other than paper, \n     although these returns may be filed electronically by choice.\n       Regulations require corporations and tax-exempt \n     organizations that have assets of $10 million or more and \n     file at least 250 returns during a calendar year, including \n     income tax, information, excise tax, and employment tax \n     returns, to file electronically their Form 1120/1120S income \n     tax returns and Form 990 information returns for tax years \n     ending on or after December 31, 2006. Private foundations and \n     charitable trusts that file at least 250 returns during a \n     calendar year are required to file electronically their Form \n     990-PF information returns for tax years ending on or after \n     December 31, 2006, regardless of their asset size. Taxpayers \n     can request waivers of the electronic filing requirement if \n     they cannot meet that requirement due to technological \n     constraints, or if compliance with the requirement would \n     result in undue financial burden on the taxpayer.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision generally maintains the current rule that \n     regulations may not require any person to file electronically \n     unless the person files at least 250 tax returns during the \n     calendar year. However, the proposal provides an exception to \n     this rule and mandates that the Secretary require electronic \n     filing by specified tax return preparers. ``Specified tax \n     return preparers'' are all return preparers except those who \n     neither prepare nor reasonably expect to prepare ten or more \n     individual income tax returns in a calendar year. The term \n     ``individual income tax return'' is defined to include \n     returns for estates and trusts as well as individuals.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective for tax returns filed after \n     December 31, 2010.\n\n G. Time for Payment of Corporate Estimated Taxes (sec. 18 of the bill \n                       and sec. 6655 of the Code)\n\n\n                              Present Law\n\n       In general, corporations are required to make quarterly \n     estimated tax payments of\n\n[[Page S11201]]\n\n     their income tax liability. For a corporation whose taxable \n     year is a calendar year, these estimated tax payments must be \n     made by April 15, June 15, September 15, and December 15. In \n     the case of a corporation with assets of at least $1 billion \n     (determined as of the end of the preceding tax year), \n     payments due in July, August, or September, 2014, are \n     increased to 100.25 percent of the payment otherwise due and \n     the next required payment is reduced accordingly.\n\n\n                        Explanation of Provision\n\n       The provision increases the required payment of estimated \n     tax otherwise due in July, August, or September, 2014, by 33 \n     percentage points.\n\n\n                             Effective Date\n\n       The provision is effective on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11201-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11201]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SETTLEMENT STATEMENTS AND MANUFACTURED HOUSING\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, the amendment requires the \ntaxpayer to provide a settlement statement to the IRS as proof that a \nhome was purchased. While I support that requirement, the fact is that \nthere is no settlement statement in the case of a manufactured home \nthat is purchased and will be either sited on land already owned by the \nhome buyer or sited on land to be leased by the home buyer. In those \ninstances, a retail sales contract is used to purchase the home. This \ncontract contains all of the truth in lending disclosures, as well as \nall the itemized disbursements relating to the transaction. Mr. \nChairman, is it the view of the Senate that the IRS should accept \nretail sales contracts as proof of purchase in the event that a \nsettlement statement is not available to the taxpayer?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator from Florida is correct. The purpose of the \nlegislation is to eliminate fraud by requiring documentation of the \nproof of purchase. It is the Senate's intent that the IRS should accept \nretail sales contracts from taxpayers as proof of purchase of a \nmanufactured home in the event that a settlement statement is not \navailable.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the chairman very much for that important \nclarification which will provide more certainty for our constituents \nwho wish to purchase a manufactured home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11201-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11201-S11202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    A NEPHEW'S MEMORIES OF ``TEDDY''\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, during his long illness, the Senate missed \nTed Kennedy and Ted Kennedy missed the Senate. But Ted was especially \nmissed by a young Senate page with whom he had a special connection--\nhis nephew, Jack Schlossberg, Caroline Kennedy's son.\n  Jack worked as a page over the summer months, and I got to know him. \nWhen he wasn't busy with his page duties in the cloakroom and on the \nSenate floor, we talked about the lessons he had learned from his \nuncle.\n  Ted was thrilled that Jack was walking the same corridors where his \nUncle Bobby and his grandfather, John F. Kennedy, had once served. When \nyoung Jack returned to school this fall, he had a chance to reflect on \nall that had happened during his summer in Washington, but mostly he \nthought about his Uncle Teddy. He wrote about it in an essay he titled \n``EMK.''\n  Jack shared his essay with me, and I would like to share it with the \nCongress, because it reflects not only what a tower of strength Teddy \nwas to his family, but also the extraordinary qualities of Ted's loving \nnephew, Jack Schlossberg.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Jack's essay be printed \nin the Record, and I recommend that it be read by all who knew Ted, all \nwho called him their friend, all who benefited from his extraordinary \ncareer in the U.S. Senate:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                  EMK\n\n                         (By Jack Schlossberg)\n\n       When I was little, I could only remember general things \n     about him, like the way his voice sounded, or the feeling I \n     got when we went sailing on his boat. As I grew up I started \n     to understand what Uncle Teddy was saying to me and what he \n     meant. As Teddy became sick, I understood him differently. He \n     was still at times the same person I knew and loved, but his \n     imperfections startled me. During his last few months I began \n     to study every word he said. I idolized him in a way I never \n     had before. No longer was my Uncle Teddy a summer memory or \n     someone I heard about from my mother; he meant something to \n     me. As I watched him go through Boston for the last time in \n     August, I realized that I was not the only person who grew up \n     with him this way, and that multiple generations had. \n     Hundreds of thousands of people knew Teddy as the loving man \n     who had always been there, and who never disappointed them.\n       It was my first year playing basketball and my team had \n     made it to the championships. I was ten years old and I had \n     never been more excited in my life. It was a tie game well \n     into the fourth quarter when Teddy showed up. He came \n     barreling into the gloomy PS 188 gym and sat down with my \n     mother and father on the sidelines. He did not cheer too loud \n     or even make himself heard, he just sat there and watched me. \n     After my team's victory, he got up and gave me a great big \n     hug. Soon after, he left and went home, as did I. I did not \n     think twice about him coming to my game. I had not told him \n     about it--he probably asked my mother what time and where it \n     was, and moved everything that he was doing that day around \n     my 11:00 am basketball game. That night I got a call from \n     him: ``The game of all games,'' he shouted into the phone. \n     ``And you scored the winning shot. I can't believe it. I just \n     can't believe it,'' he said. Of course, I had not actually \n     scored the winning shot, but all of sudden I believed I had. \n     Teddy was always there to make your story a little more \n     dramatic and entirely more fun. After he told a story about \n     something you both had done, you started telling the story \n     exactly as he had. At the time, I never understood how much \n     effort he put into our relationship. Not only was he the \n     senior Senator from Massachusetts, but also he was also quite \n     busy, unlike many Senators. It was not as if he called me \n     every day, every week, or even every month, but without fail, \n     when you needed Teddy, he was there.\n       A year ago Teddy was diagnosed with brain cancer. A person \n     who never made me sad, and never seemed weak, was said to \n     have months to live. At first I was more baffled than I was \n     upset. We were not talking about your average person, this \n     was Teddy. He was not someone who came and went, he simply \n     was always there. This was the first time I saw him affected \n     by anything, and I was so confused by his vulnerability. My \n     view of Teddy changed completely without any interaction with \n     him. I suddenly became endlessly interested in his life. I \n     read about him, I followed his policy and studied his \n     speeches. Soon after his diagnosis my family and I went to \n     visit Teddy in Florida. For the first time, I was aware of \n     who Teddy was when he was not with me. In Florida, I asked \n     him about his life and his politics, something I had never \n     done before. He explained how he was seven years old (in the \n     eighth grade because he was sent to school with his older \n     brother) and his classmates stole his turtle and buried it: \n     ``I cried for hours and ran outside to dig him up,'' he said \n     with a grin. ``They were so mean over there at Riverdale.'' \n     Although he could not express himself the way he wanted to at \n     all times, he still stunned me with stories about civil \n     rights and Lyndon Johnson. He also triggered the same \n     emotions he always had. As he and his wife, Vicki, sat down \n     to watch ``24'' one night, I saw Teddy as himself. I sat next \n     to him as he commented on the show: ``She's always cross,'' \n     he said about one character. He made joke after joke about \n     every possible thing he could and had everyone in the room \n     laughing. This was Teddy's way. It was not as if every word \n     he said was brilliant, but his way as a person was truly \n     unique. He could make a very depressing evening hilarious \n     just by cracking a few jokes.\n       My final memories of Teddy are not really of him, but of \n     what I learned about him. His death was both upsetting and \n     uplifting. At first I only thought of how I would miss him \n     and how unfair it was that he was gone. But, as I went \n     through Boston with him for the last time, I realized that \n     many others loved him too. The drive started slowly as we \n     went through Hyannis and waved to the people we passed on the \n     street. The crowds got bigger as we approached Boston, and as \n     we passed Teddy's famed ``Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy Greenway'' \n     the crowd was enormous. The signs people held that said ``We \n     love you Teddy'' struck deep in my heart. We drove through \n     all of Boston as people lined the streets everywhere. There \n     was no animosity, no hatred, just appreciation and love for \n     Teddy. This made me realize that I was not the only person \n     who loved him, and that the same effort he had made for me, \n     he had made for everyone. He is the only person I know who \n     was capable of making the type of effort he made. Whether it \n     was my basketball game or grandparents day, Teddy showed up \n     and made you laugh.\n       The drive continued as we pulled into the JFK Library and \n     saw news cameras, photographers, and another gigantic crowd. \n     It became clear to me then that in both political and \n     personal life, he had something only few have: people trusted \n     him. Everyone who came out to see Teddy trusted that he was \n     going to take care of them, because he always had. I never \n     knew any of this to be true until that day. Teddy was my \n     uncle, so naturally I figured only those who really knew him \n     would feel like I did. But Teddy's charm was universal, \n     although he brought it up a notch in Massachusetts. The final \n     way in which I remember Teddy, is as someone who always was \n     truly who they appear to be. It would have been possible for \n     his trust to apply only to his family and friends, and for it \n     to have been somewhat artificial, the way most people behave. \n     However, Teddy acted\n\n[[Page S11202]]\n\n     toward everyone the way he did with me, and this is the \n     highest praise any public figure can attain.\n       Teddy's relationship with me during his life was \n     spectacular. Not once did he disappoint me, and he provided \n     continuous support and much-needed laughs. Teddy's legacy \n     lies in many places. It lies in his legislative and political \n     accomplishments. It lies in changes in the lives of his \n     friends and constituents. It lies in his family bonds, and \n     his love for the sea. However, it also lies in the way he \n     left us. Teddy's illness at first seemed unfair and \n     depressing. This is not the case at all. Teddy was able to \n     teach everyone who watched him how to fight and how to \n     succeed. Many people do not realize that he outlived \n     everyone's initial predictions, and lived seven times as long \n     as anyone thought possible. This was not because his doctors \n     were wrong about the severity of his cancer, but because this \n     prediction did not consider that they were dealing with \n     Teddy. Not once did he stop fighting. In fact, he took the \n     most aggressive and strenuous approach to fighting his \n     cancer, and always remained hopeful. Teddy's death taught me \n     that no cause is lost, and that every day is worth living.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11202-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CLEAN ENERGY JOBS AND AMERICAN POWER ACT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I was proud to cast my vote today in the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee for S. 1733, the Clean Energy \nJobs and American Power Act. At this critical juncture in our Nation's \nhistory, we face an economic crisis, an energy security crisis, and a \nglobal climate crisis. The good news is that the solutions to these \nproblems are intertwined with one another. This bill will help us meet \nthese challenges and emerge stronger than we are today. We have an \nurgent responsibility to move forward and I want to thank the chairman \nof our committee, Senator Barbara Boxer, for her leadership and courage \nin taking action on this bill today.\n  If we do not act on this bill which invests in clean, domestic \nenergy, we will be stuck with an energy policy that is undermining our \nnational security and our economy.\n  If we do not act on this bill which invests in the industries of \ntomorrow, we will continue to lose clean energy jobs, jobs that stem \nfrom American inventions and ideas, to countries overseas.\n  If we do not act on this bill which provides significant investment \nin clean fuels and public transit, we will lose an opportunity to \nchange the way we move people and goods around this country. Right now, \nthe transportation sector represents 30 percent of our greenhouse gas \nemissions and 70 percent of our oil use. If we could double the number \nof transit riders in the United States, we would reduce our dependence \non foreign oil by more than 40 percent, nearly the amount of we import \nfrom Saudi Arabia each year.\n  If we do not act on this bill, we face irreversible, catastrophic \nclimate change. Our children and grandchildren--my two grandchildren--\nface a world where there is not enough clean water, food, or fuel, a \nworld that is less diverse, less beautiful, less secure.\n  I am glad that the majority members of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee convened today in order to act. And we needed to act on \nthis bill today because this is a global problem and we want all \ncountries to act. In just a few weeks, the international community will \nmeet in Copenhagen to work on an international agreement to do just \nthat.\n  I am hopeful that Copenhagen will produce an agreement on the \narchitecture of a final climate regime in which countries make a \ncommitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I hope we have an \nagreement that spells out the mechanism for reaching and enforcing \nthose targets as well as outlining the financing for the developing \nworld.\n  In my role as chairman of the Commission for Security and Cooperation \nin Europe and as a member of the Foreign Relations Committee, I speak \noften to our colleagues in Europe and around the world. And what other \ncountries want to know before they take additional steps--or take first \nsteps--on climate change is: Where is the United States? They are \nimpressed with the action the Obama administration has taken. They are \nhappy to see that the House has acted.\n  But for the countries of the world to commit to reduce greenhouse \ngasses in Copenhagen in just a few weeks, they want to see that both \nHouses of Congress are serious. They want to know that the Senate is \nmaking progress toward producing comprehensive climate legislation. The \nvote today in the Environment and Public Works Committee demonstrates \nthat progress.\n  But this bill is good for this country and good for Maryland even if \nwe don't get an international agreement. Marylanders understand the \nopportunities this bill promises. With this bill, we can invest in \nclean energy jobs: like those at Algenol in Baltimore where they are \nnational leaders in making fuel from algae; like those at Volvo-Mack \nTruck in Hagerstown where they are making hybrid trucks; like those at \nChesapeake Geosystems, a Maryland company that is an east coast leader \nin geothermal heating; and like those at DAP that makes spackling that \nis used in weatherizing homes and businesses.\n  With this bill, we can invest in the transportation improvements \nMarylanders so desperately need. Transit ridership in Maryland \nincreased by 15 percent in 2008. But recent train and bus accidents in \nthe DC Metro area demonstrate that we need new investment in transit. \nOur transit systems will not be a safe and reliable solution to our \npollution and energy security problems without it.\n  Marylanders also know the costs of inaction. The people of Smith \nIsland are watching their island disappear under rising sea levels. The \ncrabs, fish, and other aquatic life Maryland's watermen rely on are \ndisappearing along with their way of life. And it is only going to get \nworse. Maryland's sea levels are projected to rise 3.5 feet. That means \nthousands of Marylanders are going to lose their homes and farms. This \nbill provides critical assistance to States, especially coastal States \nsuch as Maryland, to help address these challenges and protect our \ntreasured resources such as the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The vote that we took today in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee is just the beginning of putting America back in control of \nits energy future. And we must remember that even after Copenhagen, any \ndeals we reach, any papers we sign, are still but the foundation. The \nwork must continue with earnest followthrough, dedication to truly \nchanging the way we work and live and move around this Earth. That is \nwork for each of us, and we took one important step forward today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11202-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11202-S11203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLEAN ENERGY PARTNERSHIPS ACT\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, yesterday I introduced S. 2729, the \nClean Energy Partnerships Act. I am proud to have as cosponsors for \nthis bill Senator Max Baucus, Senator Amy Klobuchar, Senator Sherrod \nBrown, Senator Tom Harkin, Senator Mark Begich, and Senator Jeanne \nShaheen, who has been working with me on the carbon conservation \nprogram after she introduced S. 1576, the Forest Carbon Incentives \nProgram Act.\n  As we work toward creating a clean energy economy in America, we need \na strategy that protects our environment while protecting and creating \njobs and revitalizing our economy.\n  The bill I introduced yesterday is an important part of that \nstrategy. By creating partnerships among manufacturing, utilities, \nagriculture, and forestry, we can reduce costs now to help transition \nto a clean energy economy tomorrow.\n  As we work to develop new technologies to reduce emissions in the \nfuture, we also need to find cost-effective ways to limit emissions in \nthe short-term that do not cost us jobs. This bill is about creating a \nlower cost strategy to help us reach our emission reduction goals while \nprotecting and strengthening our economy.\n  We can counteract, or offset, our current carbon emissions by \ninvesting in practices like sustainable agriculture and forestry \nprojects that capture and store carbon. A ton of carbon is a ton of \ncarbon. That is what this offset bill is all about.\n  For example, we can change farming practices through more efficient \napplication of fertilizer, the use of cover crops, or by utilizing \ntillage practices, called ``no till farming.'' No-till farming reduces \ncarbon emissions by leaving old plant matter buried underground. In \ncontrast, conventional tilling moves old plant matter from last\n\n[[Page S11203]]\n\nyear's crop from under the soil to the top of the soil, where it \ndecomposes and releases carbon into the atmosphere.\n  Improved forestry practices are another example of effective and \nscientifically-proven methods to help reduce carbon emissions. These \npractices must be a central component of any clean energy legislation. \nIt is estimated that forests store up to 80 percent of above-ground \ncarbon and nearly 70 percent of the carbon stored in the soil. Reducing \ndeforestation, restoring forests, and better land management can all \nhelp reduce atmospheric carbon levels, not just in our country but \naround the world.\n  This bill also creates incentives to develop new technologies for \nreducing other greenhouse gas emissions. For example, methane is more \nthan 20 times more potent than carbon dioxide and can be produced from \nlandfills, coal mines, farms, natural gas systems and oil pipelines.\n  Equipment that can reduce or eliminate methane emissions can have a \ndrastic impact on our environment. We can even use technologies that \nnot only capture the methane but use it to generate cleaner \nelectricity. That equipment can be designed and built right here in \nAmerica, building on our innovative and manufacturing expertise to \ncreate good-paying jobs.\n  Not only will an offsets program help store carbon, it will also \nresult in cleaner water, more wildlife habitat, and reduced costs for \nbusiness and agriculture. That is why this legislation has the broad \nsupport of organizations and leaders in agriculture, forestry, \nconservation, utilities and manufacturing, including National Milk \nProducers Federation; National Farmers Union; National Corn Growers \nAssociation; National Cattlemen's Beef Association; American Farmland \nTrust; National Alfalfa & Forage Association; Dow Chemical Company; \nDuke Energy; American Electric Power; PG Corporation; Dominion; John \nDeere; Business Council for Sustainable Development; Coalition for \nEmission Reduction Projects; Generators for Clean Air; National \nAssociation of Forest Owners; American Forest Foundation; Binational \nSoftwood Lumber Council; Conservation Forestry; First Environment, \nInc.; Forest Guild; Hardwood Federation; Lyme Timber Company; Maine \nForest Service; National Alliance of Forest Owners; National \nAssociation of State Foresters; National Association of University \nForest Resource Programs; National Hardwood Lumber Association; Society \nof American Foresters; Weyerhaeuser; The Nature Conservancy; \nAssociation of Fish and Wildlife Agencies; and Trust for Public Land.\n  The legislation I introduced yesterday creates partnerships between \nour agricultural and manufacturing industries, protecting jobs and \nrevitalizing our economy. It is estimated that strong agriculture and \nforestry offsets could be worth up to $24 billion annually to our \neconomy. If the right clean energy policies are put in place, we have \nthe opportunity to make this work for manufacturing and agriculture and \ncreate jobs.\n  Manufacturing in America created the middle class and is the backbone \nof our economy. We cannot have an economy if we aren't making things in \nthis country--so any energy bill we pass must protect our industries, \nprotect jobs, and protect our American middle class.\n  By creating partnerships between manufacturers and agriculture, we \ncan link up the people who ``bring home the bacon'' with the people who \nactually make the bacon.\n  By allowing our manufacturing industries to offset their carbon \nemissions with savings made by sustainable agriculture and forestry \npractices, we can create a real win-win situation for America's \neconomy.\n  In my home State of Michigan, we know how to make things and grow \nthings. We know that to reach the clean energy future, we must link our \nmanufacturing expertise with our agricultural expertise. Supported by \nsome of the finest research universities in the world, we are already \nmaking key investments in clean energy technology that will \nreinvigorate our economy, create jobs, and protect our environment for \nthe next generation.\n  That is what this bill is all about. We still have a long way to go \nin creating a clean energy bill that makes sense for our manufacturing \nand agricultural industries. But this bill is an important step toward \nreaching a balanced approach to energy legislation that respects our \nenvironment while also respecting the men and women who build things \nand grow things in this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11203-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n               TRIBUTE TO THE REVEREND JOHN (JACK) SHARP\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to pay special tribute \nto an outstanding community leader, the Reverend John (Jack) Sharp of \nBaltimore, MD. Reverend Sharp served as pastor of the Govans \nPresbyterian Church for 27 years. He has distinguished himself by \nreaching far beyond his parish to the entire Baltimore community as a \nvisionary and activist determined to move people and social programs \nfrom inaction to accomplishment.\n  Reverend Sharp's mission had always been to aid the poor and the most \nvulnerable citizens. His boldness of purpose and tenacity, coupled with \na winning and commanding personality, enabled him to unite diverse \npeople to work for a common good. Few community activists can match his \naccomplishments. During his career, he encouraged neighborhoods to \naccept and embrace housing for the mentally ill and the homeless. In \n1991, he founded the Govans Ecumenical Development Corporation, GEDCO, \nand he has become one of Baltimore's most dynamic and expansive \nnonprofit developers of senior housing and supportive services for \nthose with special needs.\n  GEDCO projects and facilities are numerous, providing housing and \nservices for the mentally ill and the homeless--including men and women \nwith HIV/AIDS--a large community pantry, financial assistance, and job \ndevelopment and mentoring. Jack Sharp is most proud of the development \nof his grand vision, Stadium Place, a state-of-the-art senior \nresidential campus on the grounds of the old Memorial Stadium. The \ncampus is home to four independent living buildings for retirees, an \nintergenerational and interfaith community ``Y'' and playground, and \nshovel-ready plans for an innovative Green House long-term care \nresidential facility.\n  Reverend Sharp accomplished all of this while serving as a pastor; \npresident of the Board of Community Housing Associates of the Baltimore \nMental Health Systems, Inc; president of the Glen Meadows Retirement \ncommunity; and treasurer of the Baltimore Interfaith Hospitality \nNetwork. In 2008, he was honored with the Governor's Leadership in \nAging Award and the National Football League--Ravens--Community \nQuarterback Award for Community Service.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing and applauding Jack \nSharp for all that he has accomplished to improve the lives of citizens \nin Baltimore. He made their challenges his challenge and he has made \nBaltimore City a better place in which to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11203-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11203-S11204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:21 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3639.

A bill to improve disaster assistance provided by the Small \nBusiness Administration, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to my home State of Louisiana--\nFederal disaster preparedness. As you know, along the Gulf Coast, we \nkeep an eye trained on the Gulf of Mexico during hurricane season. This \nis following the devastating one-two punch of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita of 2005 as well as Hurricanes Gustav and Ike last year. Our \ncommunities and businesses are still recovering from these disasters--\nsome from a disaster that devastated the Gulf Coast almost 5 years ago. \nFor this reason, as Chair of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship disaster preparedness is one of my top priorities. \nWhile the Gulf Coast is prone to hurricanes, other parts of the country \nare no strangers to disaster. For example, the Midwest has tornadoes, \nCalifornia experiences earthquakes and wildfires, and the Northeast \nsees crippling snowstorms. So no part of our country is spared from \ndisasters--disasters which can and will strike at any moment. With this \nin mind, we must ensure that the Federal Government is better prepared \nand has the tools necessary to respond quickly, effectively following a \ndisaster.\n  As I mentioned, everyone around the country is familiar with the \nimpact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the New Orleans area and the \nsoutheast part of our state. Images from the devastation following \nthese storms, and the subsequent Federal levee breaks, were transmitted \naround the country and around the world. This is because Katrina was \nthe deadliest natural disaster in United States history, with 1,800 \npeople killed--1,500 alone in Louisiana. Katrina was also the costliest \nnatural disaster in United States history with over $81.2 billion in \ndamage. In Louisiana, we had 18,000 businesses catastrophically \ndestroyed and 81,000 businesses economically impacted. I believe that, \nacross the entire Gulf Coast, some estimates ran as high as 125,000 \nbusinesses impacted by Katrina and Rita. While we have made significant \nprogress in rebuilding infrastructure, housing, and our economy, I \ncontinue to hear from individual business owners who are struggling to \nfully recover. These business owners tell me that they have not been \nhit by one disaster but three: Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Hurricane \nGustav in 2008, and the economic downturn. Louisiana was slow to feel \nthe brunt of the credit crunch and economic meltdown but last year we \nbegan to see the drying up of investments and the shrinking of \nconsumers' pocketbooks.\n  One business owner that I have met with is Charles R. ``Ray'' \nBergeron. He and his wife own Fleur de Lis Car Care Center in New \nOrleans, Louisiana. Small Business Administration, SBA, Administrator \nKaren Mills and I toured Mr. Bergeron's business during a visit to New \nOrleans on June 30, 2009. As a result of Hurricane Katrina, Mr. and \nMrs. Bergeron found themselves having to take out two loans, one for \ntheir house and another for their small business. Pre-Katrina, Fleur de \nLis Car Care Center had 8 employees. As of our visit in June, they were \ndown to 2 employees not including Mr. Bergeron. They have a $225,000 \nSBA disaster loan with a standard 30-year term. According to Mr. \nBergeron, he will not pay it off until he is 101 years old. The \nbusiness was back at about 40 percent of pre-Katrina sales, due in \nlarge measure to the population not being back. Their neighborhood is \nmostly empty homes. He attributes part of slow population recovery to \nhigh flood insurance premiums, high property taxes and high homeowner's \ninsurance. These are the type of businesses that we must ensure keep \ntheir doors open: businesses that took the initiative to re-open right \nafter the disaster. These ``pioneer'' businesses serve as anchors to \nthe community in the early days of recovery. If residents see their \nfavorite restaurant open or the local gas station, they are more likely \nto come back to rebuild their homes.\n  In order to help ongoing recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast, and to \ngive the SBA more tools to respond after a future disaster, I am \nintroducing the Small Business Administration Disaster Recovery and \nReform Act of 2009. This legislation builds off of SBA disaster reforms \nenacted last year and also provides targeted assistance for Gulf Coast \nrecovery. My bill also includes an important provision authorizing SBA \nto help families impacted by defective drywall manufactured in the \nPeople's Republic of China.\n  In terms of immediate recovery assistance, Title I of the bill \nincludes three provisions which I believe will help both Gulf Coast \nbusinesses as well as families nationwide dealing with toxic drywall in \ntheir homes. First, this bill amends Section 12086 added by SBA \ndisaster reforms in the 2008 Farm Bill. This provision created a Gulf \nCoast Disaster Loan Refinancing Program. The intent of the program, as \nI understand it from my colleagues in the House of Representatives, was \nto allow Gulf Coast businesses and homeowners to defer for up to 4 \nyears, payments on SBA disaster loans. This provision certainly had \ngood intentions, however, we are a year on and the program has yet to \nbe implemented. That is because in practice the program would likely be \nre-amortizing the same debt and, under the Credit Reform Act, to \nrefinance a $1,000,000 disaster loan would require $1,000,000 in \nadditional funding. To try to salvage this program, my bill would \nrequire SBA to report back to Congress in 30 days with recommendations \non improving this program. These recommendations could include such \nadditional options as modifying the end of the deferment date of loans, \nreducing interest payments on loans, extending out the term of loans to \n35 years or other changes to the program that might make it more \nworkable. I believe this program is on the right track, Congress just \nneeds advice from the SBA on how we can make it work better to actually \nhelp people in the Gulf Coast.\n  The next provision in Title I relates to minority businesses in the \nGulf Coast that were impacted by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Everyone \nis familiar with the images and the cost of these storms, but they may \nnot be too familiar with the impact on individual businesses. In \nparticular, I am speaking about the affects of Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita on minority firms in the Gulf Coast. As a result of these storms, \nmany minority firms in the Gulf Coast were disrupted and thus lost \nvaluable time for participating in the 8(a) program. The 8(a) business \ndevelopment initiative, created under the Small Business \nAdministration, helps minority entrepreneurs access Federal contracts \nand allows companies to be certified for increments of three years. \nThese contracts are vital to the revival of these impacted areas. \nHowever, as currently structured the program allows businesses to \nparticipate for a limited length of time, 9 years, after which they can \nnever re-apply nor get back into the program. It is imperative that we \nprovide contracting assistance to our local minority businesses.\n  My bill includes a provision which would tackle this problem in three \nimportant ways. First, the bill extends 8(a) eligibility for program \nparticipants in Katrina/Rita-impacted areas in Louisiana, Mississippi, \nand Alabama by 24 months. The bill would also apply to any areas in the \nstate of Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama that have been designated \nby the Administrator of the Small Business Administration as a disaster \narea as a result of Hurricanes Katrina or Rita. Lastly, the bill would \nrequire the administrator of the Small Business Administration to \nensure that every small business participating in the 8(a) program \nbefore the date of enactment of the Act is reviewed and brought into \ncompliance with this act. This requirement would ensure that any \neligible previous 8(a) participants will be allowed back into\n\n[[Page S11208]]\n\nthe program. As such, these key provisions would ensure that these \nbusinesses continue to play a vital role in rebuilding their \ncommunities. I note that I introduced a similar provision as part of S. \n3285, the Disadvantaged Business Disaster Eligibility Act during the \n110th Congress. Last Congress, the proposal passed the House of \nRepresentatives but we were unable to pass the legislation here in the \nSenate before we adjourned for the year. I look forward to renewing my \nfight this Congress as I believe that this is a commonsense proposal \nwhich would not cost a great deal. It would, however, make a huge \ndifference for these businesses impacted by Katrina and Rita.\n\n  The last recovery-related provision in Title I of the bill is focused \non families impacted by defective drywall manufactured in the People's \nRepublic of China. Since 2006, more than 550 million pounds of drywall \nhave been imported to the United States from China. This drywall was \nused because at the time there was a shortage of product by domestic \ndrywall producers and there was increased demand due to recovery from \nthe 2004/2005 hurricanes and the housing boom. In the last 20 months, \nhowever, countless homeowners across the country have reported serious \nmetal corrosion, noxious fumes, and health concerns. Reported symptoms \nhave included bloody noses, headaches, insomnia, and skin irritation. \nPreliminary testing has confirmed that imported defective drywall is \nthe problem, but these tests have not been able to pinpoint the problem \nsubstance in the drywall.\n  Just last week, the Consumer Product Safety Commission, CPSC, \nreleased additional preliminary results of this drywall which did not \nidentify the exact cause but did outline areas for concern. First, CPSC \ntested Chinese drywall and compared it with U.S.-made drywall. Chinese \ndrywall contained elemental sulfur and higher levels of strontium--both \nnot in domestic drywall. These findings are similar to May 2009 test \nresults from the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA. Strontium and \nsulfur, in increased levels, have been linked to possible health \nproblems. CPSC also carried out chamber testing on emissions from \nsamples of Chinese-made and domestic drywall. Early results show that \nChinese drywall emits volatile sulfur compounds at a higher rate than \nU.S. drywall. Further testing is underway to determine the specific \ncompounds being emitted. Lastly, Federal officials analyzed indoor air \nresults from 10 homes in Florida and Louisiana. This study led to a \npreliminary finding of detectable concentrations of two known \nirritants: acetaldehyde and formaldehyde. The concentrations were at \nlevels that could worsen asthma or other conditions, especially when \nair conditioners were off/not working. Later this month, the CPSC is \nexpected to release more comprehensive information on Chinese drywall. \nThis includes results of a 50-home air sampling project and a \npreliminary engineering analysis of potential electrical/fire safety \nissues related to metal corrosion. Key to any results would be Federal \nrecommendations on testing and remediation protocols for Chinese \ndrywall. This would be crucial for homeowners who currently have no \ndefinitive way to prove they have Chinese drywall in their homes or \nprocedures to remove the product for good.\n  In total, as of last week the CPSC had received 1,900 incident \nreports from 30 States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. The \nmajority of these reports, 1,317, came from Florida, with Louisiana \nnext, 339, followed by Virginia, 69, Mississippi, 63, and Alabama, 32. \nThese figures demonstrate that this problem is not just an obstacle to \nGulf Coast recovery efforts but may also pose a threat to homeowners \nacross the country.\n  To help homeowners struggling with this defective product, I have \nworked closely over the past few months with my Senate colleagues from \nFlorida and Virginia. This summer, Senator Bill Nelson and I were \nsuccessful, along with the leadership of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, in pushing the CPSC to allocate $2,000,000 in unobligated \nfunds to help the Chinese drywall investigation. Senator Nelson and \nSenators Mark Warner and Jim Webb from Virginia also wrote to the \nInternal Revenue Service inquiring if they could assist homeowners. The \nIRS indicated in July that homeowners may be able to claim a casualty \nloss on their tax returns if they have Chinese drywall that emits an \nunusual or severe concentration of chemical fumes that causes extreme \nand unusual damage. We have also written to the Federal Emergency \nManagement Agency, FEMA, inquiring if the agency could provide \nemergency rental assistance as it has done in the past.\n  In July, my Senate colleagues and I wrote to the SBA asking what they \ncould do under existing authority to help these families. In its \nOctober 29, 2009, response to this letter, SBA indicated that it did \nnot currently have the authority to assist homeowners impacted by \ndrywall. This is because, under the current law, SBA's definition of a \ndisaster only includes typical natural disasters such as tornadoes, \nhurricanes, wildfires, or snowstorms. However, it is my understanding \nthat for previous disasters, there is a precedent in Congress \nauthorizing SBA to respond to a specific disaster and one instance \nwhere Congress tasked $25,000,000 in existing funds to help ongoing \nrecovery efforts. Manufacturers of this product should bear the \nmajority of the financial burden for remediation but I believe there is \na limited role for SBA to play in assisting homeowners with toxic \ndrywall.\n  For this reason, the legislation I am introducing today includes an \nauthorization for the SBA Administrator to provide disaster home loans \nin States in which a Governor declares a disaster because of defective \ndrywall. The provision would cover drywall which entered the United \nStates from China from 2004 to 2008 and is demonstrated to cause \ncorrosion or property damage. I note that this provision would not \nprovide SBA funds for losses or damage covered by insurance or other \nsources. This authorization also caps the funding at this program at no \nmore than 25 percent of the funds appropriated for SBA disaster \nassistance. In a normal Appropriations cycle, this would equate to \nabout $25,000,000 in funds or $250,000,000 in actual disaster loans. If \nenacted, this provision would go a long way towards helping these \nstruggling families.\n  While it is important to respond to ongoing recovery-related needs \nacross the country, we must also ensure that the SBA is better prepared \nfor future disasters. To these ends, my committee held a field hearing \nin Galveston, Texas on September 25, 2009. This hearing focused on the \ninitial Federal response and ongoing recovery efforts from Hurricane \nIke in 2008. The hearing was the first Congressional hearing held in \nGalveston since Hurricane Ike struck the Texas Gulf Coast last year. \nWith this in mind, we were able to hear firsthand Federal, State, and \nlocal officials on the progress of rebuilding Galveston Island. My \ncommittee also heard from business owners on the challenges that \nemerged in the year that passed since Ike made landfall.\n  This hearing highlighted improvements in SBA's disaster programs \nsince the 2005 storms. For example, after Katrina and Rita, the Federal \nresponse was slow; planning was insufficient, and staff and funding \ncame up short. Following the 2005 storms, it took SBA 90 days to \nprocess a home loan and 70 days to process a business loan. After this \nwoeful performance, I pushed for a change in SBA leadership and changes \nin the way they respond to disasters. In 2006, a new SBA Administrator, \nSteve Preston, took over and, at my request, he implemented a new SBA \nDisaster Response Plan in time for the 2007 hurricane season. This plan \nwas a major improvement over the unwieldy, bureaucratic procedures that \nguided SBA post-Katrina/Rita. SBA will also be submitting to Congress \nin the next few weeks 2009 revisions to the Disaster Response Plan. I \nlook forward to reviewing these changes in the event that additional \nimprovements are needed.\n  Last year, as part of the 2008 Farm Bill, Congress also passed \nlegislative reforms to SBA's disaster programs. These reforms, along \nwith other key improvements: Increased SBA loan limits from $1.5 \nmillion to $2 million; created new tools such as bridge loans or \nprivate disaster loans following catastrophic disasters; required \ncoordination between FEMA, SBA, and the IRS; and allowed nonprofits, \nfor the first time, to be eligible for SBA economic injury disaster \nloans. Earlier this year, our committee heard testimony from\n\n[[Page S11209]]\n\nlocal officials in southwest Louisiana that SBA was better prepared and \nmore responsive following Gustav and Ike. As evidence of this, I note \nthat it took 5 days to process a home loan following Ike, compared to \nthe 90 days after Katrina and Rita. Business loans averaged a little \nover a week to process, compared to the 70 days in 2005.\n  However, although we heard about improvements to SBA's disaster \nresponse at the Galveston hearing, we also learned of additional areas \nthat SBA could further improve its operations. While SBA is processing \nloans faster, there are still complaints from disaster victims on \npaperwork and bureaucracy. For example, as of August 31, SBA had \nreceived about 2,400 business applications for disaster assistance in \nGalveston County. 536 of those applications were approved for $84 \nmillion but, to date, only $24 million has been disbursed for 280 of \nthese loans. In light of these facts, I am concerned that 2008 disaster \nreforms might not have gone far enough in giving SBA the tools it needs \nto help businesses and homeowners after a future disaster. Title II of \nmy legislation dovetails upon the reforms from last year to improve SBA \ncoordination with other disaster response agencies. This section also \nmakes SBA disaster loans more effective in reaching disaster victims \nmost in need of assistance.\n  As indicated above, when Katrina hit, our businesses and homeowners \nhad to wait months for loan approvals. I do not know how many \nbusinesses we lost because help did not come in time. Because of the \nscale of this disaster, what these businesses needed was immediate, \nshort-term assistance to hold them over until SBA was ready to process \nthe tens of thousands of loan applications it received. That is why in \nlast year's SBA disaster reforms, I included a provision--the Expedited \nDisaster Assistance Loan Program--to allow the SBA Administrator with \nthe ability to set up a program to make short-term, low-interest loans \nto keep them afloat. These loans will allow businesses to make payroll, \nbegin making repairs, and address other immediate needs while they are \nawaiting insurance payouts or regular SBA Disaster Loans.\n  This provision also directed SBA to study ways to expedite disaster \nloans for those businesses in a disaster area that have a good, solid \ntrack record with the SBA or can provide vital recovery efforts. We had \nmany businesses in the Gulf Coast that had paid off previous SBA loans, \nwere major sources of employment in their communities, but had to wait \nmonths for decisions on their SBA Disaster Loan applications. I do not \nwant to get rid of the SBA's current practice of reviewing applications \non a first-come-first-served basis, but there should be some mechanism \nin place for major disasters to get expedited loans out the door to \nspecific businesses that have a positive record with SBA or those that \ncould serve a vital role in the recovery efforts. Expedited loans would \njump-start impacted economies, get vital capital out to businesses, and \nretain essential jobs following future disasters.\n  While I am proud of this provision, I believe that with a few \nadditional revisions, this program could be more successful. For this \nreason, Section 201 of this bill increases the loan limit from $150,000 \nto $250,000 and allows the SBA Administrator to utilize this program, \nas needed, in either a catastrophic or a major disaster. Currently, the \nprogram is limited only to a catastrophic disaster, despite the fact \nthat another bridge loan program from the 2008 Farm Bill--the Immediate \nDisaster Assistance Loan Program--is available for both catastrophic \nand major disasters. I realize that every disaster is different and \ncould range from a disaster on the scale of Hurricane Katrina or \n9/11, to an ice storm or drought. The modification in my bill would \nallow SBA additional options and flexibility in the kinds of relief \nthey can offer a community. When a tornado destroys 20 businesses in a \nsmall town in the Midwest, SBA can get the regular disaster program up \nand running fairly quickly. You may not need short-term loans in this \ninstance. But if you know that SBA's resources would be overwhelmed by \na storm--just as they were initially with Katrina--these expedited \nbusiness loans would be very helpful. This section also changes the \nname of the program to the ``Pioneer Business Recovery Program'' as the \nintent of the program is to help ``second responder'' or ``pioneer'' \nbusinesses that want to reopen immediately following a storm.\n  The next provision of my bill, Section 202, increases SBA disaster \nloan limits. In particular, it is my understanding that SBA's disaster \nhome loan limits have not been adjusted since the 1990s. The current \nlimit for SBA disaster loans to replace personal property is $40,000, \nand the limit for SBA disaster loans to repair damaged homes is \n$200,000. My legislation would increase the limits to $80,000 and \n$400,000, respectively. The bill also increases the SBA disaster \nbusiness loan limit from $2,000,000 to $4,000,000. I believe that these \nincreases would allow SBA to better address the needs of disaster \nvictims in the future.\n  Section 203 of the bill authorizes SBA to create a State Bridge Loan \nGuarantee Program. This program would enhance existing partnerships \nbetween SBA and States which administer bridge loan programs following \ndisasters. Currently, SBA consults with States pre-disaster on the \nstructure of their program. This is to ensure that these programs run \neffectively and do not duplicate assistance provided by the SBA \ndisaster assistance program. There are various States, including \nLouisiana and Florida, which have successful bridge loan programs, and \nother States which would consider this type of program if there was \nbetter Federal-State coordination. Section 203 would allow the SBA \nAdministrator to issue guidelines on an SBA-approved bridge loan \nprogram. After issuing these guidelines, SBA could then review State \napplications and, if necessary, guarantee bridge loans from approved \nStates following a disaster. I would note that this provision was part \nof S. 3664, the Small Business Disaster Recovery Assistance \nImprovements Act of 2006 which I introduced in the 109th Congress.\n\n  Another provision which I would like to highlight in this bill is \nSection 205. This section amends the Small Business Act to make \naquaculture businesses eligible for SBA Economic Injury Disaster Loans. \nCurrently, such businesses, including crawfish farmers, oyster farmers, \nshellfish farmers, are excluded from eligibility for these loans. In \nLouisiana, our aquaculture businesses in the southern part of the State \nwere hit hard by both Hurricane Katrina and Rita. These businesses, \nmany crawfish far ers or those with fish farms, were ineligible for \nU.S. Department of Agriculture, USDA, disaster assistance, but were \nalso ineligible for SBA disaster loans. We also learned that similar \nproblems followed Hurricanes Gustav and Ike in 2008. I believe that the \ncommonsense fix in my bill will give these businesses the help they \nneed to recover from future disasters.\n  I am concerned about the larger problem which was raised by \naquaculture businesses in my State being caught in limbo between USDA \nand SBA disaster programs. SBA for example provides physical and \neconomic injury disaster loan assistance to businesses that are victims \nof a declared disaster. However, the Small Business Act excludes \nagricultural enterprises from eligibility. The act defines \n``agricultural enterprises'' as ``those businesses engaged in the \nproduction of food and fiber, ranching, and raising livestock, \naquaculture, and all other farming and agricultural related \nindustries.'' Thus, if a business is an agricultural enterprise, SBA is \nprohibited from providing disaster loan assistance. Prior to 1976, \nagricultural enterprises were covered by USDA only, and between 1976 \nand 1986, several statutes allowed agricultural enterprises to be \neligible for SBA assistance under certain conditions. As a result of a \ncouple of factors though including duplication of benefits, disparity \nof service between SBA and USDA and loan shopping, Public Law. 99-272 \nrepealed agricultural eligibility for SBA disaster loans. Since then, \nall agricultural enterprises have been referred to USDA for disaster \nloans.\n  Though USDA has several disaster programs, most are related to \nproduction loss of crops. The Farm Service Agency's Emergency Loan \nProgram covers some agriculture related disaster losses, but operates \nunder different eligibility rules from SBA. They\n\n[[Page S11210]]\n\nare limited to production on agriculture operations and restrict \neligibility to ``family farm'' operations. The disparity between \neligibility requirements for the SBA and USDA has resulted in many \nagricultural businesses being ineligible for disaster assistance at \nall. Included in that category are horse-related businesses, feedlots, \nanimal breeders and sellers, nurseries, floriculture, tree farms, fish \nor shellfish business, seed producers, along with others. That is \nbecause, to currently be eligible for an SBA disaster loan, a primarily \nagricultural enterprise must have a separable non-agricultural \ncomponent, which may be eligible for physical disaster loan assistance \nprovided that it is a separate part of the agricultural enterprise, \nwith separate income, operations, expenses, assets, etc. For economic \ninjury disaster loan assistance, the Small Business Act limits \neligibility to small businesses, small agricultural cooperatives, \nproducer cooperatives, and private non-profit organizations. Therefore, \nthe business must meet the eligibility requirements for a small \nbusiness, and for purposes of EIDL eligibility, the activity of a \nbusiness must be nonagricultural.\n  To try to identify some of these gaps between USDA and SBA disaster \nassistance, Section 209 would require SBA, in consultation with USDA, \nto report to Congress within 120 days. This report would identify gaps \nin assistance and provide recommended legislative/administrative \nchanges to fix these problems. For my part, I would like to get these \nagencies on the same page to ensure that businesses in need--whether \nthey be small businesses or agricultural businesses--are not deprived \nof assistance if a disaster happens in their area.\n  In closing, the legislation I am introducing today is an important \nfirst step for the Small Business Administration. That is because I am \nhopeful that, at the appropriate time, my committee can send to the \nfull Senate legislation which will both reform SBA's disaster programs \nand address ongoing recovery needs across the country. With that goal \nin mind, I plan to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nin the coming months to identify their priorities on these issues.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2731\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mary Landrieu,\n     Chairwoman, Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, \n         U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: Thank you for your letter requesting \n     that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) review its \n     existing authority under the Stafford Act to provide disaster \n     assistance to affected businesses and homeowners impacted by \n     the use of allegedly defective drywall. Having toured New \n     Orleans earlier this year, I share your concern for the \n     victims of Hurricane Katrina.\n       The Stafford Act is the general statutory authority for \n     most Federal disaster response activities as they pertain to \n     Federal Emergency Management Authority (FEMA) programs. When, \n     pursuant to the Stafford Act, the President declares a Major \n     Disaster or emergency and authorizes Federal assistance, \n     including individual assistance, SBA is authorized to make \n     physical disaster loans and economic injury disaster loans to \n     disaster victims. In addition, SBA has the authority under \n     the Small Business Act (Act) to issue disaster declarations \n     and to make physical and economic injury disaster loans to \n     disaster victims in SBA-declared disasters. Under the Act, a \n     ``disaster'' is generally defined as a sudden event which \n     causes severe damage. Product defects do not fall within the \n     statutory definition for a ``disaster.'' Thus, SBA has never \n     based a disaster declaration on defective products. While we \n     are sympathetic to these victims, the installation of \n     defective drywall likewise would not fall within this \n     statutory definition and could not serve as the basis for an \n     SBA disaster declaration.\n       In response to the specific issues raised in your letter, \n     SBA does have the authority to disburse additional funds to \n     existing disaster borrowers for disaster-related damage that \n     is discovered within a reasonable time after original loan \n     approval and before repairs are complete. However, if the \n     repair, replacement or rehabilitation of the disaster-damaged \n     property has been completed, SBA does not increase an \n     existing loan.\n       You also asked whether SBA may issue a disaster declaration \n     based on a request from a Governor. After SBA receives a \n     request from a Governor that satisfies the statutory and \n     regulatory requirements, SBA can issue a physical or economic \n     injury disaster declaration and make low interest loans to \n     cover uninsured losses. As noted above, however, the \n     installation of defective drywall would not qualify as a \n     disaster under the SBA's statutory definition.\n       Thank you again for your continued support of the SBA \n     disaster loan program and the small business community. A \n     similar response is being sent to your colleagues, Senators \n     Nelson, Warner, and Webb.\n           With warmest regards,\n     Karen G. Mills.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 28, 2009.\n     Hon. Karen G. Mills,\n     Administrator, U.S. Small Business Administration, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Administrator Mills: As we write to you, the Consumer \n     Product Safety Commission (CPSC) and the Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA), in coordination with other Federal \n     and State agencies, are conducting a comprehensive \n     investigation into the health and safety impacts of Chinese-\n     made drywall on American consumers. The U.S. Small Business \n     Administration (SBA) has an important role in disaster \n     response and recovery efforts--helping both homeowners and \n     businesses impacted by manmade and natural disasters. We \n     believe that, at the appropriate time, your agency may be of \n     assistance to homeowners impacted by this toxic product.\n       Since 2006, more than 550 million pounds of drywall have \n     been imported to the United States from China. In the last 18 \n     months, countless homeowners across the country have reported \n     serious metal corrosion, noxious fumes and health concerns. \n     Reported symptoms have included bloody noses, headaches, \n     insomnia and skin irritation. Preliminary testing has \n     confirmed that imported defective drywall is the problem, but \n     these tests have not been able to pinpoint the specific \n     problem substance within the drywall. More comprehensive \n     results are expected from CPSC and EPA in August/September. \n     In total, the CPSC has received 608 incident reports from 21 \n     states and the District of Columbia, demonstrating that this \n     poses a threat to homeowners across the country.\n       With this in mind, we respectfully request that the SBA \n     review its existing authority under the Stafford Act and \n     respond no later than August 28, 2009 on the following:\n       Whether SBA may disburse additional funds on SBA Real \n     Property Disaster Loans from previous disaster or emergency \n     declarations (such as Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, \n     the 2004 Florida Hurricanes, the 2008 Midwest floods, or \n     other emergency/disaster declarations).\n       Also outline if the SBA can waive the two year time limit \n     for requesting an increase in loan limits since extraordinary \n     and unforeseeable circumstances may apply in this situation;\n       Whether SBA--following a written request from a Governor \n     that has declared a disaster or emergency--may make a \n     physical disaster declaration if homes, businesses or a \n     combination of the two, have sustained uninsured losses; and\n       Whether SBA may make an economic injury declaration if it \n     is demonstrated that at least five small businesses in a \n     disaster area have suffered economic injury as a result of \n     the disaster or emergency and are in need of financial help \n     not otherwise available.\n       In closing, families in our states are, in many cases, \n     watching their dream homes turn into nightmares. As the \n     Federal government determines the full size and scope of this \n     disaster, we believe it is important to marshal all \n     appropriate Federal resources that may assist these families. \n     We therefore thank you for your consideration of this \n     important request.\n           Sincerely,\n     Mary L. Landrieu,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Bill Nelson,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Mark R. Warner,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Jim Webb,\n       U.S. Senator.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself and Mr. Lugar):\n  S. 2734. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect \nto the prevention of diabetes, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, right now many of us are engaged in a \nworthwhile discussion about health care and health insurance. These are \nimmensely important topics, and I look forward to working with all \ncolleagues to pass health reform this year. In these broader \ndiscussions, it is easy to forget that the best way to become a \nhealthier country with lower health care costs is to prevent Americans \nfrom becoming sick in the first place. A great place to prioritize \nwellness over sickness comes in our prevention of diabetes.\n  Today 24 million Americans suffer from diabetes, and the epidemic is \ngetting worse. If we do not make some changes soon, the prevalence of \nthe disease will double over the next 30 years. The annual cost of \ndiabetes in the country is expected to reach $338 billion by 2020. \nRight now 57 million Americans are what is considered prediabetic.\n  That means they are at risk of developing the full-blown disease \nbecause they have high blood pressure or high glucose levels. These \nstatistics include over a million adults and 92,000 youth in my State \nalone. These are Minnesotans who may find out tomorrow they have become \ndiabetic.\n  We know that diabetes may become debilitating and require costly \nmedical interventions, from daily injections of insulin all the way to \namputations. We know how devastating this disease is from the stories \nwe hear when we are back home.\n  This week I was on the floor and shared the story of Liz MacCaskie \nfrom Minneapolis. She lost her job in September and is 58 years old, my \nexact age. She lives with diabetes and was just diagnosed with kidney \nfailure. She is paying close to $20,000 a year for her insurance and \ntrying to live on $1,000 a month.\n  If we could help people such as Liz avoid the pain and suffering that \ncomes from diabetes, it would be a healthier, more prosperous country. \nThe good news is that we can help Americans avoid this costly and \ndebilitating disease. Research has shown that prediabetics can avoid \nfull-blown diabetes if they receive access to community services such \nas nutrition counseling and gym memberships. These are proven to cut \nthe risk of developing diabetes in half.\n  I am pleased to be offering legislation with Senator Lugar to ensure \nthat prediabetics have access to services that will stop this disease \nin its tracks. The Diabetes Prevention Act is based on an NIH research \nstudy done in partnership with the YMCA in Indiana. The study showed \nthat a 16-week intensive lifestyle program can prevent diabetes and \ncost less than $300 per person--less than $300 per person--per\n\n[[Page S11213]]\n\nyear. Studies have shown us that this investment can save us money \nwithin 2 to 3 years.\n  The Minnesota Department of Health has been working with our local \nYMCAs in Willmar, Rochester, and Minneapolis to implement this program. \nWe have a diverse group of instructors who speak Spanish, Hmong, \nSomali, and American Sign Language. They include parish nurses, \ndietitians, and community health educators. All these folks are helping \ncommunity members to eat healthier and become more physically active. \nFor the lucky people who get to participate in these programs, it is \nworking. They are losing weight, getting healthier, and avoiding \ndiabetes.\n  But right now, these efforts are a drop in the bucket because the \nepidemic is so great. With this bill, we will replicate this cost-\neffective program and improve the lives of millions of Americans. This \nbill will help communities across the country to set up diabetes \nprevention programs--on Indian reservations, in rural areas, and urban \ncenters. Ultimately, health insurance companies will be reimbursing for \nthese services because prevention saves money and it saves lives.\n  This is an investment in our Nation's future. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to enact this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Grassley, Mrs. Feinstein, and \n        Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 2736. A bill to reduce the rape kit backlog and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, sexual assault is a heinous crime. It is \nalso a startlingly common one. Last year, 90,000 people were raped. We \nas a Nation have an obligation to help the survivors of sexual \nassault--by providing them prompt medical attention, and by bringing \ntheir assailants to justice.\n  Thanks to modern technology, we have an unparalleled tool to bring \nsexual predators to justice: forensic DNA analysis. Using the DNA \nevidence collected in a rape kit, a police department can conclusively \nidentify an assailant--even when the survivor cannot visually identify \nher attacker. When DNA collected in rape kits matches existing DNA \nrecords, police can quickly capture habitual rapists before they strike \nagain. Rape kit DNA evidence is survivors' best bet for justice. It is \nalso communities' best bet for public safety.\n  Unfortunately, we have failed to make adequate use of DNA analysis. \nIn 1999, a study commissioned by the National Institute of Justice \nestimated that there was a backlog of over 180,000 untested rape kits. \nIn 2004, responding to studies like this one, then-Senator Biden, \nChairman Leahy and others worked to pass the Debbie Smith Act, a law \nnamed after a rape survivor whose backlogged rape kit was tested six \nyears after her assault. That act provided federal funding for the \ntesting of backlogged DNA evidence. Unfortunately, it did not require \nthose funds to test DNA evidence in rape kits.\n  Because of this loophole--and because many States and localities \nsimply did not use the Debbie Smith funds they were allocated--the \npromise of the Debbie Smith Act remains unfulfilled. Since 2004, the \nfederal government has distributed about $500 millions in Debbie Smith \ngrants to law enforcement agencies around the country. Local figures \nsuggest that these funds have not had their intended effect. In March \n2009, Los Angeles County had 12,500 untested rape kits in police \nstorage. L.A. County is not alone. This fall, the Houston Police \nDepartment found at least 4,000 untested rape kits in storage, and \nDetroit reported a backlog of possibly 10,000 kits.\n  Those are just three cities. This means that potentially hundreds of \nthousands of rape kits are sitting, untested, in police departments and \ncrime labs around the country. That is hundreds of thousands of women \nwho have not seen justice. That is countless assailants still free and \ncountless new assaults that have occurred because of this. The New York \nTimes recently highlighted a case which occurred years after the \npassage of The Debbie Smith Act where a rapist struck twice while the \nrape kit for one of his earlier victims sat unprocessed at a State \ncrime lab. Sadly, that lab's four month processing delay was one of the \nshortest in the state.\n  When rape kits are not tested, rapists are not caught. When rape kits \nare not tested, more women are raped. Having a backlog of thousands of \nkits endangers our communities and sends a clear message to \nperpetrators and survivors of sexual violence: that cases of sexual \nassault are not a priority. Unfortunately, because our Nation lacks any \nmechanism to track rape kit backlogs, we have no way of knowing the \nfull scope of this rape kit backlog and the national tragedy that it \ncauses.\n  The Justice for Survivors of Sexual Assault Act of 2009, which I am \nintroducing today with Senator Grassley, Senator Feinstein, and Senator \nHatch, addresses the national rape kit backlog and several other \nproblems that work to deny justice to survivors of sexual assault. \nThese include the denial of free rape kits to survivors of sexual \nassault, and the shortage of trained health professionals capable of \nadministering rape kit exams.\n  First, this bill will create strong financial incentives for states \nto clear their rape kit backlogs once and for all. This bill will \nreward states who make progress in clearing up their rape kit backlog \nand start processing their incoming rape kits in a timely manner. It \nwill penalize those that don't, while allowing them the opportunity to \nregain any lost funds. Having a backlog is not an impossible situation \nto remedy. In just a few years, the city of New York cleaned up their \nrape kit backlog, and as a result, saw its arrest rate for rapes jump \nfrom 40 to 70 percent.\n  Second, this bill will put measures in place to track progress and \nhold States and localities accountable. Law enforcement agencies will \nbe responsible for reporting their reductions of rape kit backlogs, and \nthe Department of Justice will be responsible for analyzing that data \nand reporting back to Congress.\n  Third, this bill will guarantee that survivors of sexual assault \ndon't ever pay for their rape kits. Right now, States must cover the \nfull cost of a rape kit examination, either upfront or through \nreimbursement. But some states don't even cover half of the cost. \nSurvivors who live in States who are in compliance with the law still \nmistakenly receive bills because of the confusing nature of the \nreimbursement process. We don't bill criminals for fingerprint \nprocessing. Survivors of sexual assault should never see the bill for \ntheir rape kit exam, let alone pay any upfront costs.\n  Fourth, this bill will train more health professionals to administer \nrape kit exams. If survivors of sexual assault are lucky enough to have \ntheir rape kit processed, it is important to ensure it is not declared \ninadmissible in court due to faulty evidence collection.\n  Lastly, this bill will provide funds for a study on the availability \nof trained health professionals to administer rape kit exams at Indian \nHealth Services facilities. Recent studies have shown that Native \nAmerican women suffer a disproportionately high amount of sexual \nviolence, and we need to make sure that IHS has the proper resources it \nneeds to serve survivors.\n  We have waited too long to address the rape kit backlog in the United \nStates to the detriment of survivors and our communities. It is time to \naggressively clear rape kit backlogs and put rapists where they belong: \noff our streets and behind bars. With the Federal Government beginning \nto collect more DNA samples from convicted, non-violent offenders and \ndozens of State governments following its lead inaction now would mean \nthat rape kits wait longer on the shelf, rape survivors wait longer for \njustice, and rapists spend more time on the streets.\n  Survivors of sexual assault do not deserve this. They deserve \njustice. I want to continue Congress's work in trying to address this \nissue. In doing so, I follow in the footsteps of people like Vice \nPresident Biden and Chairman Leahy, who have consistently and \npowerfully championed sexual assault survivors within the Senate \nJudiciary Committee and on the floor of the Senate.\n  I ask that my colleagues join Senator Grassley, Senator Feinstein, \nSenator Hatch, and me in supporting the Justice for Survivors of Sexual \nAssault Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S11214]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2736\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Survivors of \n     Sexual Assault Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Rape is a serious problem in the United States.\n       (2) The Department of Justice reports that in 2006, there \n     were an estimated 261,000 rapes and sexual assaults, and \n     studies show only \\1/3\\ of rapes are reported.\n       (3) The collection and testing of DNA evidence is a \n     critical tool in solving rape cases. Law enforcement \n     officials using the Combined DNA Index System have matched \n     unknown DNA evidence taken from crime scenes with known \n     offender DNA profiles in the State and National DNA database \n     2,371 times.\n       (4) Despite the availability of funding under the \n     amendments made by the Debbie Smith Act of 2004 (title II of \n     Public Law 108-405; 118 Stat. 2266) there exists a \n     significant rape kit backlog in the United States.\n       (5) A 1999 study commissioned by the National Institute of \n     Justice estimated that there was an annual backlog of 180,000 \n     rape kits that had not been analyzed.\n       (6) No agency regularly collects information regarding the \n     scope of the rape kit backlog in the United States.\n       (7) Certain States cap reimbursement for rape kits at \n     levels that are less than \\1/2\\ the average cost of a rape \n     kit in those States. Yet, section 2010 of title I of the \n     Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. \n     3796gg-4) requires that in order to be eligible for grants \n     under part T of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets \n     Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796gg et seq.) (commonly known as \n     ``STOP Grants'') States shall administer rape kits to \n     survivors free of charge or provide full reimbursement.\n       (8) There is a lack of sexual assault nurse examiners and \n     health professionals who have received specialized training \n     specific to sexual assault victims.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to seek appropriate means to \n     address the problems surrounding forensic evidence collection \n     in cases of sexual assault, including rape kit backlogs, \n     reimbursement for or free provision of rape kits, and the \n     availability of trained health professionals to administer \n     rape kit examinations.\n\n     SEC. 4. RAPE KIT BACKLOGS.\n\n       (a) Additional Protocol Requirement for Receiving Edward \n     Byrne Grants.--Section 502 of title I of the Omnibus Crime \n     Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3752) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (6); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following:\n       ``(5) A certification that the applicant has implemented a \n     policy requiring all rape kits collected by or on behalf of \n     the applicant to be sent to crime laboratories for forensic \n     analysis.''.\n       (b) Additional Debbie Smith Grant Requirements;

and\n       (C) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(8) if the State or unit of local government has a rape \n     kit backlog, include a plan to eliminate the rape kit backlog \n     that includes performance measures to assess progress of the \n     State or local unit of government toward a 50 percent \n     reduction in the rape kit backlog over a 2-year period; and\n       ``(9) specify the portion of the amounts made available \n     under the grant under this section that the State or unit of \n     local government shall use for the purpose of DNA analyses of \n     samples from untested rape kits.'';\n       (3) in subsection (f)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by striking ``and'' at the end;\n       (B) by redesignating paragraph (2) as paragraph (3);

A bill to relocate to Jerusalem the United States Embassy in \nIsrael, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Jerusalem \nEmbassy Relocation Act of 2009. My colleagues and I have sponsored this \nimportant piece of legislation in order to pave the way for the United \nStates to correct a longstanding and--I believe--dangerous deficiency \nin our diplomatic relations and foreign policy. For too long, our \nembassy in Israel has been located in a different city than Jerusalem, \nwhich is the capital of Israel according to longstanding Israeli and \nAmerican law and practice. The time has come to remove the barriers \nthat have encouraged this state of affairs to continue, and that is \nprecisely what this legislation will do, by repealing the waiver \nincluded in the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995 that has\n\n[[Page S11216]]\n\nbeen abused by the Executive Branch for 14 years.\n  Jerusalem is the spiritual center of the Jewish faith. First \nconquered by King David more than 3000 years ago, there has always been \na Jewish presence there, a fact attested to by incalculable \narchaeological evidence. Although at various times the Jewish people \nlost sovereignty in the land of Israel--to the Babylonians, Greeks, \nRomans, Byzantines, Ottomans, British--Jerusalem has never served as \nthe capital of any other political or religious entity in history. In \nevery year during the nearly two thousand year exile in 70 A.D., Jews \naround the world concluded their Passover seder with the phrase, ``Next \nYear in Jerusalem.'' Despite the depths of despair to which the Jewish \npeople descended throughout their long exile, Jerusalem always remained \nat the center of Jewish religious life.\n  Since 1950, just two years after the miraculous rebirth of the State \nof Israel, Jerusalem has served as Israel's capital. The seat of \nParliament, Prime Minister's residence, and Supreme Court, all reside \nthere, in addition to numerous ministries and government buildings. \nAmerican officials conduct business with Israeli officials in \nJerusalem, in de facto recognition of the status of the city. The \nJerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, passed into law by an overwhelming vote \nof Congress, stated unequivocally as a matter of United States policy \nthat ``Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of \nIsrael,'' and ``the United States Embassy in Israel should be \nestablished in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.\n  This is our policy, yet for some reason our embassy remains in Tel \nAviv. This is despite the fact that the government of Israel many times \nhas declared Jerusalem to be the eternal and undivided capital of \nIsrael, a policy reflected in American law. Such a state of affairs \nconstitutes an ongoing affront to the people of Israel who, under \ninternational law, have the sovereign right to choose the location of \ntheir capital. It also harms the interests of American citizens living \nin Israel, who face procedural and substantive harm as a result of the \nconfusing diplomatic structure that has arisen in place of a Jerusalem \nembassy.\n  The failure of the State Department to relocate the embassy is not \nonly inconvenient and inefficient, but also is dangerous. The State \nDepartment's refusal to acknowledge clear U.S. law and policy \nradicalizes Israel's opponents by creating the false hope that the U.S. \nwould support the division of Jerusalem. Were the embassy to be moved \nto Jerusalem, and Israel's capital respected in both American law and \nin practice, then Palestinians and Arab governments would have no \nchoice but to accept the unchanging reality of Jerusalem, which is that \nIsrael, regardless of the political party or government in power, will \nnot move its capital away from this city.\n  I and my fellow sponsors of this legislation recognize that the \nExecutive Branch generally has discretion over diplomatic arrangements. \nHowever, when a waiver included for the limited purpose of national \nsecurity becomes perfunctory and contradicts the clear will of the \nCongress, the time has come to reevaluate the wisdom of such a waiver. \nThis bill simply restores the statutory effect of the Jerusalem Embassy \nAct, updating the timeline of fiscal years required for action, but \nwithout the waiver.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this necessary and appropriate \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Grassley):\n  S. 2738. A bill to authorize National Mall Liberty Fund D.C. to \nestablish a memorial on Federal land in the District of Columbia to \nhonor free persons and slaves who fought for independence, liberty, and \njustice for all during the American Revolution; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the National \nLiberty Memorial Act, a bill I am introducing with my colleague Senator \nGrassley. This important legislation would authorize the construction \nof a memorial in Washington, DC honoring the African American patriots \nwho fought in the Revolutionary War.\n  For too long, the role these brave Americans played in the founding \nof our Nation has been relegated to the dusty back pages of history. \nFortunately, historians are now beginning to uncover their forgotten \nheroism, and they estimate that more than 5,000 slaves and free blacks \nfought in the army, navy, and militia during the Revolutionary War. \nThey served and struggled in major battles from Lexington and Concord \nto Yorktown, fighting side by side with white soldiers. More than 400 \nof these brave Americans hailed from my home state of Connecticut.\n  More than 20 years ago, Congress authorized a memorial to black \nRevolutionary War soldiers and sailors, those who provided civilian \nassistance, and the many slaves who fled slavery or filed petitions to \ncourts or legislatures for their freedom. Unfortunately, the group \noriginally authorized to raise funds for and build the memorial was \nunable to conclude its task, and there remains no memorial to the \nimportant, and too often unacknowledged, contributions made by these \n5,000 Americans.\n  But a group of committed citizens has formed the Liberty Fund DC to \ncomplete this memorial and ensure that these patriots receive the \ntribute they deserve here in our Nation's capital. I am honored to work \nalongside them in completing this mission.\n  The time has come to recognize the sacrifice and the impact of the \nAfrican Americans who fought for the birth of our country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the National Liberty Memorial Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL, of New Mexico:\n  S. 2741. A bill to establish telehealth pilot projects, expand access \nto stroke telehealth services under the Medicare program, improve \naccess to ``store-and-forward'' telehealth services in facilities of \nthe Indian Health Service and Federally qualified health centers, \nreimburse facilities of the Indian Health Service as originating sites, \nestablish regulations to consider credentialing and privileging \nstandards for originating sites with respect to receiving telehealth \nservices, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, access to quality, affordable \nhealth care is an issue that impacts every American across our country. \nWhether someone is struggling to find coverage for themselves or their \nfamily members, or searching in vain for a doctor who is accepting new \npatients, or giving advice to a friend who has just lost his job and, \nand as a result, his health insurance, no American is spared.\n  These problems hit particularly hard in America's rural communities. \nResidents there are more likely to be uninsured than their urban \ncounterparts, have higher rates of chronic disease, and are often \nforced to travel hundreds of miles for preventive or emergency care, if \nthey can find it at all.\n  As we continue moving forward with health care reform, we must make \nsure we do not leave our rural communities behind. In my home State of \nNew Mexico, for example, 30 of our 33 counties are designated as \nmedically underserved. That is why I am please to introduce the Rural \nTECH Act of 2009, Rural Telemedicine Enhancing Community Health. \nThrough this legislation, I propose that we use technology to connect \nexperts with providers, facilities and patients in rural areas, and to \nextend critical health care services to underserved areas across the \ncountry.\n  Telehealth technology can help diagnose and treat patients, provide \neducation and training, and conduct community-based research. It uses \nvideo-conferencing, the Internet, and handheld mobile devices to \nprovide consultation and case reviews, direct patient care and \ncoordinate support groups, for example. There are many benefits with \ntelehealth, including increased access to education and care, such as \nconnecting remote generalists to urban specialists. This knowledge \nbridge will help remote areas retain health care providers, and improve \nthe continuity of care. it also would allow patients to stay in their \nhomes and communities, rather than spend precious time and money to \ntravel for treatment and care. In New Mexico, Dr. Steve Adelsheim at \nthe University of New Mexico has been using telehealth during the past \nfew months to provide therapy to a Navajo teenager who is at high risk \nof suicide.\n\n[[Page S11217]]\n\n  My bill would create three telehealth pilot projects, expand access \nto stroke telehealth services, and improve access to ``store-and-\nforward'' telehealth services in Indian Health Service, IHS, and \nFederally Qualified Health Centers, FQHCs. I'd like to tell you a bit \nabout each today.\n  First, the creation of three telehealth pilot projects. These \nprojects would analyze tie clinical heath outcomes and cost-\neffectiveness of telehealth systems in medically underserved and tribal \nareas. The first pilot project focuses on using telehealth for \nbehavioral health interventions, such as post traumatic stress \ndisorder. A second pilot project focuses on increasing the capacity of \nhealth care workers to provide health services in rural areas, using \nknowledge networks like New Mexico's Project ECHO. And lastly, I am \nproposing a pilot project for stroke rehabilitation using telehealth \ntechnology.\n\n  Second, we will expand access to telehealth services for strokes, a \nleading cause of death and long-term disability. Travel time to \nhospitals and shortages of neurologists--especially in rural areas--are \namong the barriers to stroke treatment. However, Primary Stroke Centers \nare not accessible for much of the population. For example, there is \nonly one certified Primary Stroke Center in my State, at the University \nof New Mexico Hospital. This bill would connect many more residents \nwith needed services. In New Mexico alone, there are almost 173,000 \nMedicare beneficiaries who would gain access to telestroke services.\n  Third, we will improve access to store-and-forward telehealth \nservices. These services allow rural health facilities to hold and \nshare transmission of medical training, diagnostic information and \nother data, which is important for remote areas. This bill also would \nallow IHS facilities to be reimbursed as users of telehealth services. \nFinally, it would establish regulations for credentialing and \nprivileging telehealth providers at rural sites, saving important \nresources and time as they accept telehealth services from an area of \nspecialty.\n  I am pleased to note that my bill is supported by the University of \nNew Mexico Center for Telehealth and Cybermedicine Research, the \nAmerican Telemedicine Association, and the Telehealth Leadership \nInitiative. In addition, it is supported by the New Mexico Stroke \nAdvisory Committee, the American Heart Association/American Stroke \nAssociation, the American Academy of Neurology, the American Physical \nTherapy Association, the American Occupational Therapy Association, and \nthe American Speech-Language-Hearing Association. I want to thank each \nof these groups for their support and encouragement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Webb, Mrs. Lincoln, and Ms. \n        Landrieu):\n  S. 2743. A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to provide for \nthe award of a military service medal to members of the Armed Forces \nwho served honorably during the Cold War, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Armed Services.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues Senator \nWebb, Senator Lincoln, and Senator Landrieu to introduce the Cold War \nMedal Act of 2009. This legislation would provide the authority for the \nsecretaries of the military departments to award Cold War Service \nMedals to the courageous American patriots who for nearly half-a-\ncentury defended the Nation, and indeed, freedom-loving peoples \nthroughout the world, against the advance of communist ideology.\n  From the end of World War II to dissolution of the Soviet Union in \n1991, the Cold War veterans were in the vanguard of this Nation's \ndefenses. They manned the missile silos, ships, and aircraft, on ready \nalert status or on far off patrols, or demonstrated their resolve in \nhundreds of exercises and operations worldwide. The commitment, \nmotivation, and fortitude of the Cold War Veterans was second to none.\n  Astonishingly, no medal exists to recognize the dedication of our \npatriots who so nobly stood watch in the cause of promoting world \npeace. Although there have been instances where medals or ribbons, such \nas the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, Korean Defense Service Medal, \nand Vietnam Service Medal, have been issued, the vast majority of Cold \nWar Veterans did not receive any medal to pay tribute to their \ndedication and patriotism during this extraordinary period in American \nhistory. It is only fitting that these brave servicemembers who served \nhonorably during this era receive the recognition for their efforts in \nthe form of the Cold War Service Medal.\n  Specifically, the Cold War Service Medal Act of 2009 would allow the \nDefense Department to issue a Cold War Service Medal to any honorably \ndischarged veteran who served on active duty for not less than two \nyears or was deployed for thirty days or more during the period from \nSeptember 2, 1945, to December 26, 1991. In the case of those veterans \nwho are now deceased, the medal could be issued to their family or \nrepresentative, as determined by the Defense Department. The bill would \nalso express the sense of Congress that the secretary of Defense should \nexpedite the design of the medal and expedite the establishment and \nimplementation mechanisms to facilitate the issuance of the Cold War \nService Medal.\n  The award of the Cold War Service Medal is supported by the American \nCold War Veterans, the American Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, \nand many other veterans' services organizations.\n  With November 9, 2009, the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin \nWall which marked the beginning of the end of the Cold War, quickly \napproaching, Senator Webb, Senator Lincoln, Senator Landrieu, and I \ninvite our colleagues to cosponsor this significant legislation to \nhonor our Cold War Veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11217-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11217-S11218]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 338--DESIGNATING NOVEMBER 14, 2009, AS ``NATIONAL \n                READING EDUCATION ASSISTANCE DOGS DAY''\n\n  Mr. HATCH (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Cochran, \nand Mr. Risch) submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 338\n\n       Whereas reading provides children with an essential \n     foundation for all future learning;\n       Whereas the Reading Education Assistance Dogs (R.E.A.D.) \n     program was founded in November of 1999 to improve the \n     literacy skills of children through the mentoring assistance \n     of trained, registered, and insured pet partner reading \n     volunteer teams;\n       Whereas children who participate in the R.E.A.D. program \n     make significant improvements in fluency, comprehension, \n     confidence, and many additional academic and social \n     dimensions;\n       Whereas the R.E.A.D. program now has an active presence in \n     49 States, 3 provinces in Canada, Europe, Asia, and beyond \n     with more than 2,400 trained and registered volunteer teams \n     participating and influencing thousands of children in \n     classrooms and libraries across the Nation;\n       Whereas the program has received awards and recognition \n     from distinguished entities including the International \n     Reading Association, the Delta Society, the Latham \n     Foundation, the American Library Association, and PBS \n     Television; and\n       Whereas the program has garnered enthusiastic coverage from \n     national media, including major television networks NBC, CBS, \n     and ABC, as well as international television and print \n     coverage: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate, in honor of the 10th anniversary \n     of the R.E.A.D. program, designates November 14, 2009, as \n     ``National Reading Education Assistance Dogs Day''.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to submit a resolution \nregarding the 10th Anniversary of the Reading Education Assistance \nDogs, R.E.A.D., program by designating November 14, 2009, as ``National \nReading Assistance Dogs Day.'' This is a nationwide program promoted by \na number of organizations throughout the U.S. and even throughout \ncountries around the world as an innovative, successful approach aimed \nat assisting some of our nation's most vulnerable citizens, our \nchildren, learn how to read.\n  The R.E.A.D. program was the first literacy program in the country to \nuse therapy animals as reading companions for children. This unique \nmethod provides children an opportunity to improve their reading skills \nin a comfortable environment by reading aloud to dogs. After 10 years \nof results, the program has proven to be incredibly successful in \nhelping children who are struggling with this most-crucial and\n\n[[Page S11218]]\n\nbasic of skills. Simply put, this is a program that fills a vital place \nin the spectrum of a child's literary education and with over 2,400 \nvoluntary therapy teams around the world, it would be an understatement \nto say this program has not touched and improved thousands of young \nlives.\n  Over the span of the previous 10 years, this is an achievement that \nis virtually impossible to measure, yet today, as small token of my own \npersonal appreciation, I submit a resolution that would designate \nSaturday, November 14, 2009, as National Reading Education Assistance \nDogs Day. Once agreed to, this resolution will recognize the thousands \nof lives that have been touched as a direct result of this initiative. \nI am grateful to be the sponsor of a resolution recognizing such an \naccomplishment and am joined by Senators Bingaman, McCaskill, Cochran, \nand Risch in this effort. I commend Intermountain Therapy Animals, a \nnonprofit organization based in Utah, for first launching this program \njust ten short years ago. Therefore, in addition to the numerous news \nstories, television programs, and awards highlighting the value and \nbenefit of this program, I urge my Senate colleagues and every American \nto join me in recognizing 10 successful years of the R.E.A.D. program \nwith hopes of many more years of success to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11218-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11218-S11221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 339--TO EXPRESS THE SENSE OF THE SENATE IN SUPPORT OF \n         PERMITTING THE TELEVISING OF SUPREME COURT PROCEEDINGS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Feingold, Mr. \nDurbin, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Schumer) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 339\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Supreme Court should \n     permit live television coverage of all open sessions of the \n     Court unless the Court decides, by a vote of the majority of \n     justices, that allowing such coverage in a particular case \n     would constitute a violation of the due process rights of 1 \n     or more of the parties before the Court.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution urging the Supreme Court to permit live \ntelevision coverage of its open proceedings. This is different from \nprevious legislation which I have introduced which would require the \nCourt to permit live television coverage.\n  I offer this resolution on behalf of Senator Cornyn, Senator Kaufman, \nSenator Feingold, Senator Durbin, Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nWhitehouse, and Senator Schumer.\n  The previous bills, which would have required the Supreme Court to \nopen its proceedings to live television coverage, were voted out of the \nJudiciary Committee in the 109th Congress by a vote of 12 to 6 and the \n110th Congress by a vote of 11 to 8.\n  The basis for the legislative action is on the recognized authority \nof Congress to establish administrative matters for the Court. For \nexample, the Congress determines how many Justices there will be--nine; \nthe Congress determines how many Justices are required for a quorum--\nsix; the Congress determines that the Court will begin its operation on \nthe first day of October; the Congress has set time limits.\n  The shift in the resolution for urging the Court is to take a milder \napproach to avoid a confrontation and to avoid a possible \nconstitutional clash on the separation of powers.\n  There is no doubt that the Court would have the last word if the \nCongress required live television coverage. And, as I say, there are \nanalogous administrative matters which the Congress does control. But \nas a first step, today the resolution urges the Court to open its \nproceedings for live television coverage.\n  The thrust of this resolution is that the Court should be televised, \njust as the Senate is televised, just as the House is televised, to \nfamiliarize the American people with what the Court does. The average \nperson knows very little about what the Court does.\n  The Supreme Court itself has held that newspapers have a right to be \nin a courtroom. In an electronic age, television and radio ought to \nhave the same standing.\n  The importance of the Court is seen in the scope of the cases which \nthey decide and the kinds of cases which they do not decide. For \nexample, the Court makes a determination on life, a woman's right to \nchoose, makes a determination on the application of the death penalty, \na determination on civil rights, on Guantanamo, on wireless \nwiretapping, on congressional authority, on Executive authority.\n  The Court is the final word since 1803, in the case of Marbury v. \nMadison, when the Court decided the Court would be the final word. That \nwas the statement of Chief Justice Marshall, and it has stood for the \nlife of our country. I believe it is a sound judgment for the Supreme \nCourt to have the final word. But if the Framers were to rewrite the \nConstitution, I think the Court would now be article I instead of the \nCongress being article I, and the executive branch--the President--\nbeing article II.\n  It is also important to note what the Court does not decide. The \nCourt declined to hear the terrorist surveillance program. That \nwarrantless wiretap program was found unconstitutional by the Federal \ncourt in Detroit. It was reversed by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \non standing ground, with a very vigorous and better reasoned dissent. \nStanding is a very flexible doctrine and usually made when the Court \nsimply doesn't want to take up the issue. But the terrorist \nsurveillance program presented the sharpest conflict--perhaps the \nsharpest conflict between congressional authority, under article I, \nwith the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act establishing the \nexclusive way to conduct wiretaps and the President's article II powers \nas Commander in Chief to conduct warrantless wiretaps.\n  The Supreme Court denied hearing the case of the survivors of victims \nof 9/11 against Saudi Arabia, even though congressional mandate is \nclear that sovereign immunity does not apply to foreign government \nofficials.\n  Just in the past few years, the Supreme Court has decided cases of \nenormous importance. A few illustrate the proposition: The Court did \ndecide cutting-edge issues on whether local school districts may \nfulfill the promise of Brown v. Board of Education by taking voluntary \nremedial steps to maintain integrated schools; whether public \nuniversities may consider race when evaluating applicants for admission \nin order to ensure diversity within their student bodies; whether \ncitizens have a constitutional right to own guns; whether States may \nexercise the power of eminent domain to take a personal residence in \norder to make room for commercial development.\n  The Court has also declined to hear cases involving splits--that is, \ndifferences of judgment--between different courts of appeals. It is not \nan effective administration of the judicial system if the case may be \ndecided differently depending on whether a person litigates in the \nFirst Circuit or in the Eleventh Circuit and then the district courts, \nwhere the circuit has not ruled, speculate as to what the court of \nappeals would have decided.\n  We had a confirmation hearing yesterday with Judge Vanaskie of the \nMiddle District of Pennsylvania. I asked him if he had seen situations \nwhere there were circuit splits, but your circuit hasn't decided, and \nhow do you handle that case. Judge Vanaskie pointed out that was very \nproblematic. There are major matters where the Supreme Court has left \nthese circuit splits standing. For example, whether jurors may consult \nthe Bible during their deliberations in a criminal case, whether a \ncivil lawsuit must be dismissed predicated on state secret, whether the \nspouse of a U.S. citizen remains eligible for an immigration visa after \nthe citizen dies, whether an employee who alleges that he or she was \nunlawfully discriminated against for claiming benefits or exercising \nother rights under an employer-sponsored health care or pension plan, \nor when does a collective bargaining agreement confer on retirees the \nright to lifetime health care benefits? may a Federal court toll the \nstatute of limitations in a suit brought under the Federal Tort Claims \nAct?\n  These are illustrative of very important decisions which the Supreme \nCourt does not decide. Congress can't\n\n[[Page S11219]]\n\ntell the Supreme Court what to decide, but Congress may mandate the \nCourt's jurisdiction. If this were in the public view, if the Court \nwere accountable for not handling such cases, I think the Court might \nwell take a different view.\n  It is not as if the Court is too busy to hear these cases. Take a \nbrief survey of the Court's docket. In 1886, there were 1,396 cases on \nthe Supreme Court docket. It decided 451. In 1926, there were 223 \nsigned opinions. So it was down from 451 in 1886 to 223 in 1926. Then \nby 1987, it was down to 146. In 2007, the Court heard argument in only \n75 cases and issued only 67 signed opinions. So it is perfectly clear \nthat the Court's docket, with the four clerks--which each one of the \nSupreme Court Justices has--could well accommodate a more vigorous \nworkload.\n  In the written statement that I will include when I finish these \nextemporaneous remarks, I have cited several recent cases where the \nCourt has not followed well-established precedent. Well, they have the \nauthority to overrule their own precedents, but it is something the \npublic ought to have an idea on and an understanding of.\n  I think this is a particularly good time for the Court to consider \ntelevising itself under the resolution urging them to be televised \nsince Justice Souter recently left the Court. Justice Souter made the \nfamous statement that if the Supreme Court were to be televised, the \ncameras would roll in over his dead body. The members of the Supreme \nCourt are very concerned about what their fellows think, and it may \nwell have been that in light of a strenuous objection by Justice \nSouter, when he was on the Court, that would have tipped the scales. \nBut listen to what the Justices have had to say on the issue of \ntelevising the Supreme Court.\n  I have made it a practice to question the nominees for the Supreme \nCourt to get their views on television. Justice Paul Stevens said: \nLiterally hundreds of people have stood in line for hours in order to \nhear oral argument only to be denied admission because the courtroom \nwas filled.\n  The practice is, if you can get in at all, you stay for 3 minutes and \nthen you are ushered out to let other people in because it is a small \nchamber.\n  Justice John Paul Stevens said: Television in the Court is worth a \ntry.\n  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said: I don't see any problem with having \nproceedings televised. I think it would be good for the public.\n  Justice Breyer said--at a time when he was chief judge of the First \nCircuit--I voted in the judicial conference in favor of experimenting \nwith television in the courtroom. The judicial conference made an \nanalysis of television--made a favorable recommendation--and some \ncircuit courts and some lower courts have been televised.\n  Justice Sotomayor, in her recent confirmation hearing, said, \nreferring to her experience with cameras in the courtroom, that the \nexperience has ``generally been positive, and I would certainly recount \nthat,'' referring to her colleagues on the Supreme Court.\n  Justice Alito said, in the Third Circuit, there was a debate and he \nargued we should do it; that is, televise it. He said: I would keep an \nopen mind on the subject with respect to the Supreme Court.\n  The fact is the Justices frequently appear on television on their \nown. For example, Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Stevens appeared on \ninterviews on ABC's ``Prime Time.'' Justice Ginsburg has appeared on \nCBS News. Justice Breyer has been on ``FOX News Sunday.'' Justices \nScalia and Thomas have appeared on CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' All the \nJustices appeared for interviews that C-SPAN recently aired during its \n``Supreme Court Week.''\n  Public opinion polls are strongly in favor of having the Supreme \nCourt televised. There have been numerous editorials in support, and \nrecently the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom opened its proceedings \nfor television.\n  That is a very brief statement of a more expansive statement, which I \nhave prepared, and I think the reasons for opening the Court are \noverwhelming. In a Democratic society, there should be transparency at \nall levels of government. The judicial independence of the Supreme \nCourt is of vital importance to be maintained, and they have life \ntenure, but there is no reason why the American people should not \nunderstand what they are doing.\n  The American people should understand that when they take a case such \nas Bush v. Gore, where there is a challenge on the counting of the \nvotes in Florida and where Justice Scalia says there would be \nirreparable harm in allowing the votes in Florida to be counted because \nit might undermine the legitimacy of the new administration, the \nAmerican people ought to have maximum access to understand what the \nCourt is doing. The American people ought to have maximum access to \nknow that the Supreme Court of the United States declined to hear a \ndecision on whether the President had authority to conduct warrantless \nwiretaps. The American people ought to know that all these circuit \nsplits remain unresolved at a time when the workload and the agenda and \nthe docket of the Supreme Court has declined enormously.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat this point a ``Dear Colleague'' letter signed by Senator Cornyn and \nmyself.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             United States Senate,\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 November 5, 2009.\n       Dear Colleague: We write to ask for your co-sponsorship on \n     a Sense of the Senate Resolution which urges the Supreme \n     Court to permit live television coverage of its open \n     proceedings. This would provide a modest level of \n     transparency and accountability to the Supreme Court whose \n     members enjoy life tenure and decide so many cutting-edge \n     issues which border on making the law rather than \n     interpreting the law. There is little public understanding \n     about the Supreme Court's role even though it decides major \n     issues such as a woman's right to choose, the death penalty, \n     civil rights, 2nd Amendment gun rights, and the scope of \n     Congress's Article I power and the President's Article II \n     power.\n       The Court declines to hear many important cases where \n     conflicting decisions are rendered by different Circuit \n     Courts of Appeals. That results in different treatment for \n     different litigants depending on what Circuit their case is \n     brought. It leaves uncertainty in other Circuits since there \n     is a question about which Circuit precedent should be \n     followed.\n       The Court has time to resolve Circuit splits and hear many \n     other important cases which it declines since its docket is \n     so light compared to prior years. In 1886, the Supreme Court \n     decided 451 of the 1,309 cases on its docket. In 1926, the \n     Court issued 223 signed opinions. In the first year of the \n     Rehnquist Court, 1987, the Court issued 146 opinions. During \n     the 2007 term, the Court held argument in 75 cases and issued \n     67 signed opinions.\n       Few Americans have any real opportunity to observe its \n     proceedings. Most who visit the Court for an oral argument \n     will be allowed only a three-minute seating, if they are \n     seated at all. Recently, the UK's highest court decided to \n     allow TV cameras into its courtroom. A recent C-SPAN poll \n     reveals that two-thirds of Americans support televising the \n     Court's proceedings.\n       This Sense of the Senate Resolution differs from previous \n     legislative proposals in urging rather than requiring the \n     Supreme Court to permit TV coverage. While there is \n     substantial authority for Congress to require such coverage \n     based on analogous administrative matters, we believe the \n     milder approach should be followed first which may draw a \n     favorable response and would avoid any possible \n     confrontation.\n       If you have any questions or wish to co-sponsor this \n     Resolution, please contact the undersigned or have your staff \n     contact Matthew Wiener (extension 4-6598) or Matthew Johnson \n     (extension 4-7840).\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter,\n     John Cornyn.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record an extensive floor statement and that the Congressional \nRecord contain my introduction of the floor statement. Frequently, when \nthe floor statement occurs right after the oral extemporaneous \ncomments, the reader may wonder why the speaker is repeating himself on \nso many of the same points.\n  So, I would like to have the full text as to what I am saying now \nappear in the Congressional Record so that it is understandable why the \nlong text appears after so much of what has already been said.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce a \n     sense-of-the-Senate resolution urging the Supreme Court to \n     permit television coverage of its open proceedings.\n       I have previously introduced legislation on the subject. In \n     the 109th Congress, I introduced S. 1768, on behalf of myself \n     and Senators Allen, Cornyn, Durbin, Feingold,\n\n[[Page S11220]]\n\n     Grassley, Leahy, and Schumer. It would have required the \n     Court to permit television coverage of its proceedings. On \n     March 30, 2006, the Committee on the Judiciary favorably \n     reported S. 1768 by a vote of 12 to 6. In the 110th Congress, \n     I introduced an identical bill, S. 344, on behalf of myself \n     and Senators Comyn, Durbin, Feingold, Grassley and Schumer. \n     On September 8, 2008, the Committee favorably reported the \n     bill by a vote of 11 to 8. Early in this Congress I again \n     introduced an identical bill, S. 446, this time on behalf of \n     myself and Senators Cornyn, Durbin, Feingold, Grassley, \n     Kaufman, Klobuchar, and Schumer.\n       The resolution takes a more restrained and modest approach \n     than does S. 446 and its predecessors. It would do no more \n     than ``urge'' the Court to allow the television coverage of \n     its open proceedings (unless Court decides that television \n     coverage would violate a litigant's due-process rights, which \n     is unlikely).\n       I urge the Senate to pass this non-binding resolution \n     rather than taking action on S. 446 at this time. My reason \n     is not that S. 446 may be unconstitutional. It is not. \n     Congress' well-founded authority to regulate various aspects \n     of the Court's activities--to fix the number of Justices who \n     sit on the Court (nine) and constitute a quorum (six), to set \n     the beginning of the Court's term as the first Monday in \n     October, and to establish the contours of its appellate \n     jurisdiction--would sustain S. 446 against a constitutional \n     challenge. Rather, I have four prudential reasons for \n     proceeding with a non-binding resolution at this time:\n       First, the Court's most outspoken critic of television \n     coverage, Justice Souter, has retired. Justice Souter once \n     said that the ``day you see a camera come into our courtroom, \n     it's going to roll over my dead body.'' Several Justices have \n     indicated their reluctance to permit television coverage in \n     the face of opposition by a colleague. Justice Souter's \n     departure may lead his colleagues to revisit the issue. His \n     replacement, Justice Sotomayor, testified during her \n     confirmation hearings that she had favorable experiences with \n     television coverage while sitting on the court of appeals and \n     that, if confirmed, she would share her experiences with her \n     new colleagues. Some commentators have raised the possibility \n     that Justice Sotomayor will help convince her reluctant \n     colleagues that the time for television coverage has come. \n     (E.g., Editorial, ``Cameras in the Court,'' USA Today, July \n     13, 2009; Editorial, ``Camera shy justice: The Supreme Court \n     should be televised,'' Pittsburgh Post Gazette, July 7, 2009; \n     Editorial, ``Supreme Court TV,'' Los Angeles Times, June 11, \n     2009.) No one knows, of course, what Justice Sotomayor will \n     do. But we should at least give the newly constituted Court \n     some reasonable period of time to consider the issue.\n       Second, a non-binding resolution is likely to draw more \n     support among Senators than a statutory mandate, and it need \n     not be passed by the House or signed by the President. There \n     is no reason to enact a law if a resolution will do.\n       Third, the Court may receive a non-binding resolution more \n     favorably than a statutory mandate. The Court may perceive a \n     mandate as an affront to its constitutional autonomy as a \n     separate branch of government. Justice Kennedy suggested as \n     much during testimony before a Congressional committee. It \n     may even decide to ignore a mandate on the ground that it \n     violates the Constitution's scheme of separation of powers. \n     We need not provoke what might be an unnecessary \n     constitutional challenge.\n       Fourth, the newly established Supreme Court of the United \n     Kingdom has just decided to allow cameras in its courtroom. A \n     press release announcing the Court's opening reports that \n     ``proceedings will be routinely filmed and made available to \n     broadcasters.'' (Supreme Court of the United Kingdom, Press \n     Release, Oct. 1, 2009.) The press release cites the need for \n     ``transparen[cy]'' and the ``crucial role'' that television \n     can play in ``letting the public see how justice is done'' \n     and ``increase[ing] awareness of the UK's legal system and \n     the impact the law has on people's lives.'' (Ibid.) When the \n     Court held its opening session just a few weeks ago, TV \n     cameras sat ``discretely'' in the corners of the courtroom, \n     according to the BBC. (BBC News, ``Supreme Court hears first \n     appeal,'' http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8289949\n.stm.) Hopefully the experience of the United Kingdom's \n     Supreme Court with television coverage will encourage our \n     Supreme Court to follow suit.\n       My extensive floor statements of January 29, 2007, \n     introducing S. 246, and February 13, 2009, introducing S. \n     446, set forth compelling reasons for allowing television \n     coverage of the Supreme Court's open proceedings and also \n     explained why S. 445 is constitutional. (Cong. Record, Jan. \n     29, 2007, S831-34; Cong. Record, Feb. 13, 2009, S2332-36.) I \n     laid out those reasons again on August 5, 2009, when I \n     commented on the state of the Court during the floor debate \n     on now-Justice Sotomayor's nomination. (Cong. Record, Aug. 5, \n     2009, S880006.) This statement summarizes the key points of \n     and supplements my earlier statements.\n       My main point was this: The American people have the right \n     to observe the Court's proceedings. But few Americans have \n     any meaningful opportunity to do so. There are well less than \n     a hundred oral arguments per year. Even those who are able to \n     visit the Court are not likely to see an argument in full. \n     Most will be given just three minutes to watch before they \n     are shuffled out to make room for others. In high-profile \n     cases, most visitors will be denied even a three-minute \n     seating. There are not nearly enough seats to accommodate the \n     demand. Those who wish to follow the Court's proceedings must \n     content themselves with reading the voluminous transcripts or \n     listening to audiotapes released at the end of the Court's \n     term. It should come as no surprise that, according to a \n     recent C-SPAN poll, nearly two-third of Americans favor \n     televising the Court's proceedings.\n       The Court decides too many cutting-edge questions of \n     monumental importance to the American people--not just, as \n     Justice Scalia once suggested in opposing television \n     coverage, disputes between litigants--to deny them a \n     meaningful opportunity to observe its proceedings. Consider \n     just some of the issues the Court has decided in recent \n     years: whether local school districts may fulfill the promise \n     of Brown v. Board of Education by taking voluntary remedial \n     steps to maintain integrated schools (Parents Involved in \n     Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1, 551 U.S. \n     701 (2007)); whether public universities may consider race \n     when evaluating applicants for admission in order to ensure \n     diversity within their student bodies (Grutter v. Bollinger, \n     539 U.S. 306 (2003), and Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 2344 \n     (2003)); whether citizens have a constitutional right to own \n     guns (District of Columbia v. Heller, 128 S. Ct. 2783 \n     (2008)); and whether states may exercise the power of eminent \n     domain to take a personal residence in order to make room for \n     a commercial development (Kelo v. City of New London, 545 \n     U.S. 469 (2005)).\n       And in 2000, of course, the Supreme Court decided what was \n     perhaps the most important--and certainly the most \n     controversial--question of all: who the next president of the \n     United States would be (Bush v. Gore, 531 U.S. 98 (2000)). \n     Can anyone seriously contend that the American people were \n     not entitled to watch the oral argument in the case that \n     ultimately decided the Presidency? Or that reading a \n     transcript or listening to an audio was an adequate \n     substitute for watching the oral argument?\n       Trends over the last few years show that the need for \n     public scrutiny of the Court's work, which only television \n     coverage can adequately provide, is now more important than \n     ever. None is more significant than the Court's declining \n     workload and willingness to leave important issues and \n     circuit splits unresolved.\n       The Court's workload has steadily declined. In 1870, the \n     Court decided 280 of the 636 cases on its docket; in 1880, \n     365 of the 1,202 cases on its docket; and in 1886, 451 of the \n     1,396 cases on its docket. (E.g., Edward A. Hartnett, \n     ``Questioning Certiorari: Some Reflects on Seventy Five Years \n     After the Judges Bill,'' 100 Colum. L. Rev. 1643, 1650 \n     (2006).) In 1926, the year Congress gave the Court nearly \n     complete control of its docket by passing the Judiciary Act \n     of 1925, the Court issued 223 signed opinions. The Court's \n     output has declined significantly ever since. In the first \n     year of the Rehnquist Court, the Court issued 146 opinions; \n     in its last year, the Court issued only 74. (E.g., Kenneth W. \n     Starr, ``The Supreme Court and Its Shrinking Docket: The \n     Ghost of William Howard Taft,'' 90 Minnesota Law Review 1363, \n     1367-68 (2006).)\n       Chief Justice Rehnquist's successor, John Roberts, said \n     during his confirmation hearing that the Court could and \n     should take more cases. But it has not done so. During the \n     2005 Term, it heard argument in 87 cases, and issued 69 \n     signed opinions; during the 2006 Term, it heard argument in \n     78 cases and issued 68 signed opinions; and during the 2007 \n     Term, it heard argument in 75 cases and issued 67 signed \n     opinions. The numbers were much the same during the recently \n     concluded 2008 Term: The Court heard argument in 78 cases \n     and issued 75 signed opinions. A recent article in the \n     Duke Law Journal notes that ``[e]ven though it possess \n     resources unimaginable to its predecessors, including . . \n     . a bevy of talented clerks, the Supreme Court decides \n     only a trickle of cases.'' The article goes on to observe \n     that the ``most striking feature of contemporary Supreme \n     Court jurisprudence is how little of it there is.'' \n     (Tracey E. George & Christopher Guthrie, ``Remaking the \n     United States Supreme Court in the Courts' of Appeals \n     Image,'' 58 Duke Law Journal 1439, 1441-42 (2009).)\n       As Kenneth Starr has observed, Congress gave the Supreme \n     Court control over what cases it hears so it can focus on \n     ``two broad objectives: (i) to resolve important questions of \n     law and (ii) to maintain uniformity in federal law.'' (Starr, \n     supra, at 1364.) It is clear that the Court has failed to \n     meet either objective and that only by putting its ``shoulder \n     to the wheel and working] harder,'' to quote Mr. Starr, can \n     it ever hope to do so. (Id. at 1385.)\n       The Court continues to leave important issues unresolved. \n     Recently it even refused to decide the constitutionality of \n     the Bush Administration's Terrorist Surveillance Program--\n     commonly referred to as the ``warrantless wiretapping \n     program.'' This program, which began soon after the 9-11 \n     attacks, operated in secret until The New York Times exposed \n     it in 2005. Well-deserved public condemnation followed its \n     exposure. In 2006, a federal district court declared the \n     program unconstitutional. A divided court of appeals reversed \n     on the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to bring \n     suit, thereby leaving the merits unaddressed. In 2008, the \n     plaintiffs asked the Supreme Court to hear case, but it \n     declined. This year I introduced legislation (S. 877) to \n     require the\n\n[[Page S11221]]\n\n     Court to exercise jurisdiction over appeals challenging the \n     constitutionality of the Program.\n       More recently, the Court refused to decide whether the \n     Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act shields Saudi Arabia and its \n     officials from damages suits arising from their apparent \n     complicity in the 9-11 terrorist attacks. Last year the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled \n     (incorrectly, in my view) that the Act immunizes them from \n     suit. The victims petitioned the Court for certiorari. In its \n     certiorari-stage brief, the Solicitor General conceded that \n     the Second Circuit had misinterpreted the Act. But late last \n     year the Court denied the petition without dissent and, as \n     usual, without explanation. (In re Terrorist Attacks on \n     September 11, 2001 (No. 08-640).) The result will be to deny \n     legal redress to thousands of 9-11's victims.\n       No less important, the Court also continues to leave too \n     many circuit splits unresolved. The article in the Duke Law \n     Journal I cited a moment ago notes that the Roberts Court \n     ``is unable to address even half'' of the circuit splits \n     ``identified by litigants.'' (George and Guthrie, supra, at \n     1449.) Mr. Starr notes that the ``Supreme Court by and large \n     does not even pretend to maintain the uniformity of federal \n     law.'' (Starr, supra, at 1364.) Among the questions on which \n     the circuits have recently split are: May jurors consult the \n     Bible during their deliberations in a criminal case and, if \n     so, under what circumstances? Must a civil lawsuit predicated \n     on a ``state secret'' be dismissed? Does the spouse of a \n     United States citizen remain eligible for an immigrant visa \n     after the citizen dies? Must an employee who alleges that he \n     was unlawfully discriminated against for claiming benefits or \n     exercising other rights under an employer-sponsored \n     healthcare or pension plan ``exhaust administrative \n     remedies'' (that is, first allow the plan to address his \n     claim) before filing suit in court? When does a collective \n     bargaining agreement confer on retirees the right to lifetime \n     healthcare benefits? May a federal court ``toll'' the statute \n     of limitations in a suit brought against the federal \n     government under the Federal Tort Claims Act if the plaintiff \n     establishes that the government withheld information on which \n     his claim is based? Is a defendant convicted of drug \n     trafficking with a gun subject to additional prison time \n     under a penalty-enhancing statute, or is his sentence limited \n     to the period of time provided for in the federal drug-\n     trafficking law? When may a federal agency withhold \n     information in response to a FOIA request or court subpoena \n     on the ground that it would disclose the agency's ``internal \n     deliberations.'' Should a federal admiralty claim, to which a \n     jury trial right does not attach, be tried to a jury if it is \n     joined with a non-admiralty claim?\n       Two developments since I gave my last floor speech have \n     served only to reinforce my conclusion that public scrutiny \n     must be brought to bear on the Court.\n       The first is the Court's well-documented disregard of \n     precedent, which the Court took to new levels during its 2008 \n     Term. (E.g., Erwin Chemerinsky, ``Forward, Supreme Court \n     Review,'' 43 Tulsa L. Rev. 627 (2008).) Consider three \n     especially significant opinions handed down just this year: \n     (1) 14 Penn Plaza, LLC v. Pyett, which held that an employee \n     can be compelled to arbitrate a statutory discrimination \n     claim under a collectively bargained-for arbitration clause \n     to which he or she did not consent, contrary to the Court's \n     thirty-five-year-old decision in Alexander v. Gardner-Denver \n     Co., 415 U.S. 36 (1974) ; (2) Gross v. FBL Financial \n     Services, Inc. (2009), which held that in age discrimination \n     cases, unlike cases brought under Title VII of the Civil \n     Rights Act of 1964, the employer never bears the burden of \n     proof no matter how compelling a showing of discrimination \n     the plaintiff makes, contrary to the Court's thirty-year-old \n     decision in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, 490 U.S. 228 (1989); \n     and (3) Ashcroft v. Iqbal, which gave license to district \n     court judges to evaluate the ``plausibility'' of a \n     complaint's allegations, contrary to well-established rules \n     of pleadings that date back at least fifty years to Conley v. \n     Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957). Legislation to overturn each of \n     these decisions is now pending.\n       Each of these examples reflects a second recent trend: the \n     Court's bias in favor of corporate interests over the public \n     interest. This has been the subject of extensive commentary. \n     One commentator, Professor Jeffrey Rosen, has characterized \n     the Court as ``Supreme Court, Inc.'' as a result of its \n     decidedly pro-business rulings. (Jeffrey Rosen, ``Supreme \n     Court, Inc.,'' The New York Times, Mar. 16, 2008.) Another, \n     Professor Erwin Chemerinsky, has characterized the current \n     Court as the ``most pro-business Court of any since the mid-\n     1930's.'' (Chemerinsky, ``The Roberts Court at Age Three, 54 \n     Wayne Law Review 947 (2008).)\n       A final point: While the Justices have so far refused to \n     appear on television during open courtroom proceedings, they \n     have not been shy about appearing on television outside the \n     courtroom. Chief Justice Roberts and Stevens have appeared \n     for interviews on ABC's ``Prime Time,'' Justice Ginsburg on \n     CBS News, Justice Breyer on ``Fox News Sunday,'' and Justices \n     Scalia and Thomas on CBS's ``60 Minutes.'' All of the \n     Justices appeared for interviews that C-SPAN aired recently \n     during its ``Supreme Court Week'' series. Justice Breyer and \n     Auto even appeared on television to debate how the Court \n     should interpret the Constitution and statutes. We cannot \n     accept the Justices' plea for anonymity when they so \n     regularly appear before the camera.\n       I note in conclusion that, since my last floor speech, the \n     media has continued to call for the televising of the Supreme \n     Court's proceedings. At least a dozen editorials have \n     appeared during 2009 alone. (E.g., ``Televised justice would \n     be for all,'' Boston Herald, August 7, 2009; ``Cameras in the \n     court,'' USA Today, July 13, 2009; ``Camera shy justice: The \n     Supreme Court should be televised,'' Pittsburgh Post Gazette, \n     July 7, 2009; ``Supreme Court TV,'' Los Angeles Times, June \n     11, 2009.) One editorial writer, The National Law Journal's \n     Tony Mauro, makes the case especially well, when he writes: \n     ``The Internet Age demands transparency from all institutions \n     all the time. Any government body that lags behind is in \n     danger of losing legitimacy, relevance and, at the very \n     least, public awareness. . . . It does not take a battery of \n     surveys to realize that the public will learn and understand \n     more about the Supreme Court . . . if its proceedings are on \n     view nationwide.'' (``Court, cameras, action! Souter's \n     departure could clear the way for far more transparency at \n     the Supreme Court,'' USA Today, May 27, 2009.) A list of 2009 \n     editorials, as compiled by C-SPAN, is appended.\n       Television coverage of the Supreme Court is long overdue. \n     It is time for Congress to act. I urge my colleagues to \n     support the resolution I am introducing today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11221-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S11221]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 340--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR DESIGNATION OF A NATIONAL \n VETERANS HISTORY PROJECT WEEK TO ENCOURAGE PUBLIC PARTICIPATION IN A \n NATIONWIDE PROJECT THAT COLLECTS AND PRESERVES THE STORIES OF THE MEN \n      AND WOMEN WHO SERVED OUR NATION IN TIMES OF WAR AND CONFLICT\n\n  Mr. CRAPO (for himself and Mrs. Lincoln) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs:\n\n                              S.

Res. 341\n\n       Whereas the people and government of Yemen currently face \n     tremendous security challenges, including the presence of a \n     substantial number of al Qaeda militants, a rebellion in the \n     northern part of the country,\n\n[[Page S11222]]\n\n     unrest in southern regions, and piracy in the Gulf of Aden;\n       Whereas these security challenges are compounded by a lack \n     of governance throughout portions of the country;\n       Whereas this lack of governance creates a de facto safe \n     haven for al Qaeda and militant forces in regions of Yemen;\n       Whereas Yemen also faces significant development \n     challenges, reflected in its ranking of 140 out of 182 \n     countries in the United Nations Development Program's 2009 \n     Human Development Index;\n       Whereas Yemen is also confronted with limited and rapidly \n     depleting natural resources, including oil, which accounts \n     for over 75 percent of government revenue, and water, \\1/3\\ \n     of which goes to the cultivation of qat, a narcotic to which \n     a vast number of Yemenis are addicted;\n       Whereas government subsidies are contributing to the \n     depletion of Yemen's scarce resources;\n       Whereas the people of Yemen suffer from a lack of certain \n     government services, including a robust education and skills \n     training system;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2009 International \n     Religious Freedom Report notes that nearly all of the once-\n     sizeable Jewish population in Yemen has emigrated, and, based \n     on fears for the Jewish community's safety in the country, \n     the United States Government has initiated a special process \n     to refer Yemeni Jews for refugee resettlement in the United \n     States;\n       Whereas women in Yemen have faced entrenched \n     discrimination, obstacles in accessing basic education, and \n     gender-based violence in their homes, communities, and \n     workplaces while little is done to enforce or bolster the \n     equality of women;\n       Whereas these challenges pose a threat not only to the \n     Republic of Yemen, but to the region and to the national \n     security of the United States;\n       Whereas, to the extent that Yemen serves as a base for \n     terrorist operations and recruitment, these threats must be \n     given sufficient consideration in the global strategy of the \n     United States to combat terrorism;\n       Whereas this threat has materialized in the past, including \n     the March 18 and September 17, 2008, attacks on the United \n     States Embassy in Sana'a and the October 12, 2000, attack on \n     the U.S.S.

Mr. President, today I would like to draw attention to a \ndangerous situation that has implications for the national security of \nthe U.S. and our allies, a situation involving dire humanitarian \ncircumstances, with over 150,000 displaced persons since 2004. I am \nspeaking about the situation in Yemen.\n  Senator Lugar and I are introducing a resolution supporting peace, \nsecurity, and the innocent civilians affected by conflict in Yemen. \nThis resolution calls on the President and international community to \nuse all appropriate measures to prevent Yemen from becoming a failed \nstate.\n  The gravity of the challenges Yemen faces should not be ignored. To \ndocument a few of these challenges: Yemen is home to a substantial \nnumber of al-Qaeda militants, a rebellion in the northern part of the \ncountry, unrest in southern regions, and piracy in the Gulf of Aden. \nYemen has limited and rapidly depleting natural resources including \noil, which accounts for over 75 percent of government revenue, and \nwater. Yemen is underdeveloped, ranking 140th out of 182 countries in \nthe United Nations Development Program's 2009 Human Development Index. \nThousands of Yemenis are currently displaced as a result of the ongoing \nconflict between the Government of Yemen and al-Houthi rebel forces. \nRegions of Yemen have a large degree of lawlessness; religious \nminorities--particularly the Jewish population--have emigrated due to \nsafety concerns; and human rights violations persist.\n  The U.S., the international community, and the people of Yemen must \ndo all that we can to prevent Yemen from becoming a failed state. \nDisrupting, dismantling, and defeating al-Qaeda and violent extremism \nrequires a global strategy that includes preventing Yemen from serving \nas a base for terrorist operations conducted elsewhere. Americans and \nour allies are all too familiar with the dangers of terrorists \noperating unimpeded. The March 18 and September 17, 2008, attacks on \nthe U.S. Embassy in Sana'a and the October 12, 2000 attack on the \nU.S.S. Cole remind us of this threat specifically in Yemen.\n  Aside from Yemen's impact on the national security of America and our \nallies, we cannot ignore the tremendous hardships many in Yemen \ncurrently endure. Yemenis deserve to have basic security, basic human \nrights, and their basic needs met. We need to stand with those who want \nto live in peace and achieve improved living conditions. I am \nespecially concerned with the plight of those displaced by conflict in \nYemen, and I applaud efforts taken by the Obama administration and \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to assist these displaced \npersons. I urge the Government of Yemen and rebel forces to halt \nhostilities, allow medical and humanitarian aid to reach civilians \ndisplaced by conflict, and create an environment that will enable a \nreturn to normal life for internally displaced persons in Yemen.\n  I would like to thank the senior Senator from Indiana, who is the \nRanking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, for \ncosponsoring this resolution on this important issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11222-1", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11222-S11223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 342--RECOGNIZING NATIONAL AMERICAN INDIAN AND ALASKA \n   NATIVE HERITAGE MONTH AND CELEBRATING THE HERITAGE AND CULTURE OF \n AMERICAN INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES AND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICAN \n            INDIANS AND ALASKA NATIVES TO THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Barrasso, Mr. Baucus, Mr. Begich, Mr. \nBingaman, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Conrad, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Franken, Mr. \nJohnson, Mr. McCain, Mr. Merkley, Ms. Murkowski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. \nTester, Mr. Thune, Mr. Udall of Colorado, and Mr. Udall of New Mexico) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Federal Executive Boards.''.\n\n\n                         Emergency Preparedness\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, Senator Voinovich and I have offered a \nfloor amendment to S. 806, the Federal Executive Board Authorization \nAct of 2009, to clearly authorize and provide guidance for the existing \nwork of Federal Executive Boards, FEBs, in emergency preparedness and \ncontinuity of operations, COOP.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I want to thank Senator Akaka for \nleading this amendment to recognize FEBs' role in preparing the Federal \nworkforce for emergencies. FEBs participate in a number of activities \nin this regard, including working with the Department of Health and \nHuman Services to brief the Federal workforce on points of distribution \nthat can be set up to dispense medication during health emergencies and \nworking with the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, and the Chief \nHuman Officers Council to distribute information on human resources \nflexibilities available during snow storms and other emergencies. Our \nfloor amendment clarifies that these activities can and should \ncontinue.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Senator Voinovich has mentioned, FEBs \nalready participate in a range of emergency preparedness efforts. These \ninclude working with OPM and individual agencies to develop COOP plans \nand taking other actions to prepare the Federal workforce for and \nprotect them from public health dangers, inclement weather, and other \nemergencies. In 2004, the Government Accountability Office, GAO, \nreleased a report on COOP planning in the federal sector, which \nrecognized that FEBs are uniquely positioned to coordinate emergency \npreparedness efforts among the Federal workforce, given their \nresponsibility for improving coordination among federal activities \noutside of Washington, D.C. Following GAO's recommendation, OPM and the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency began more closely coordinating \ntheir efforts to improve guidance to federal agencies on emergency \npreparation and COOP.\n  Our amendment recognizes and provides guidance for such coordination. \nSpecifically, our amendment requires FEBs to facilitate communication \nand collaboration on emergency preparedness and COOP activities for the \nFederal workforce in areas where FEBs exist. Our amendment also \nrequires each FEB to develop relationships with State and local \ngovernments and nongovernmental organizations to help fulfill the roles \nand responsibilities of that FEB, and requires that the communication, \ncollaboration, and training to prepare the Federal workforce for \nemergencies and COOP be defined through memoranda of understanding, \nMOU, between the Director of OPM and the headquarters of appropriate \nagencies when necessary.\n  We do not intend for MOUs to be created for every activity that FEBs \nparticipate in, nor with every agency participating in FEBs. As the \nsubstitute amendment states, MOUs should be created where appropriate. \nOPM may need MOUs with those agencies with which FEBs coordinate most \nactively because they play a substantial role in preparing the Federal \nworkforce for emergencies and COOP.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I concur with my colleague. Our floor \namendment requires FEBs to coordinate with appropriate agencies for \npreparedness, response, and COOP. We do not mean that OPM must enter \ninto a memorandum of understanding with every agency that participates \nin an FEB or every agency that is affected by an FEB. We believe OPM \nshould have the discretion and flexibility to determine which agencies \nare the ``appropriate agencies'' to coordinate with in any particular \nsituation as well as the discretion to decide when that coordination \nneeds to be defined in memoranda of understanding or other formal \nagreement.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I thank my good friend and colleague from \nOhio for entering into this colloquy.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 342, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 342) recognizing National American \n     Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month and celebrating the \n     heritage and culture of American Indians and Alaska Natives \n     and the contributions of American Indians and Alaska Natives \n     to the United States.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, on October 30, 2009, President Obama \nissued a proclamation designating November 2009 as National American \nIndian and Alaska Native Heritage Month. This President follows a \ntradition of Presidents since 1990 of issuing proclamations honoring \nthe significant contributions of tribal governments and individual \nNative Americans to our Nation's history and development.\n  Congress also has traditionally recognized the contributions of \nNative Americans to the United States in the form of resolutions, \nfindings, coins and medals. The resolution introduced here today \ncontinues in that tradition.\n  This resolution recognizes some of the many contributions that Native \nAmericans have made to help build our great Nation as well as the \ncontinued contributions of Native Americans to the growth of the United \nStates. Native Americans have made significant contributions in the \nfields of agriculture, medicine, music, language, and art. They were an \ninfluencing force in the founding documents of our Federal Government. \nIndian tribes have even made use of Native languages to develop an \nunbreakable military code that helped defeat the Axis powers in World \nWar II. These remarkable tribes and individual Native Americans have \nshaped our Nation's history in so many very meaningful ways.\n  Through this resolution, we recognize and celebrate these and many \nother contributions of tribal governments and Native Americans during \nthe month of November. It is particularly important that President \nObama has decided to host a Tribal Leaders Summit at the White House. \nThe President will meet with tribal leaders in Washington, DC, November \n5, 2009, to discuss the many issues facing tribal communities \nthroughout the Nation.\n  We have several very important pieces of legislation before this body \nthat I hope to move in the interest of the First Americans. S. 1790, \nthe Indian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization and Extension Act of \n2009, was introduced on October 15, 2009, after much consultation and \ndiscussion among tribal leaders and Indian health experts. I will work \nvery hard this Congress to get this important piece of legislation to \nthe President's desk. In addition, after many, many hearings and \nnumerous listening sessions, I introduced S. 797, the Tribal Law and \nOrder Act of 2009, earlier this year. This important piece of \nlegislation has strong bipartisan support and will help to improve the \nstatus of law and order on tribal lands. The bill has been approved by \nthe Indian Affairs Committee and is waiting for approval by the full \nSenate.\n  I urge all citizens, and local, State, and Federal governments and \nagencies to take time this month to learn more about the many facets of \nNative American history, traditions, and their important contributions \nto the formation of the United States. Mr. President, I ask that this \nresolution be adopted quickly and that it act as encouragement to all \npeople of the United States to observe the month of November as \nNational American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table, with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 342) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 342\n\n       Whereas from November 1, 2009, through November 30, 2009, \n     the United States celebrates National American Indian and \n     Alaska Native Heritage Month;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives are descendants \n     of the original, indigenous inhabitants of what is now the \n     United States;\n       Whereas, in 2000, the United States Census Bureau reported \n     that there were more than 4,000,000 people in the United \n     States of American Indian and Alaska Native descent;\n       Whereas, on December 2, 1989, the Committee on Indian \n     Affairs of the Senate held a hearing exploring the \n     contributions of the Iroquois Confederacy, and its influence \n     on the Founding Fathers in the drafting of the Constitution \n     of the United States with the concepts of freedom of speech, \n     the separation of governmental powers, and checks and \n     balances among the branches of government;\n       Whereas the Senate has reaffirmed that a major national \n     goal of the United States is to provide the resources, \n     processes, and structure that will enable Indian Tribes and \n     tribal members to obtain the quantity and quality of health \n     care services and opportunities that will eliminate the \n     health disparities between American Indians and the general \n     population of the United States;\n       Whereas Congress recently reaffirmed its trust \n     responsibility to improve the housing conditions and \n     socioeconomic status of American Indians and Alaska Natives \n     by providing affordable homes in a safe and healthy \n     environment;\n       Whereas, throughout its course of dealing with Indian \n     Tribes, the United States Government has engaged in a \n     government-to-government relationship with Tribes;\n       Whereas the United States Government owes a trust \n     obligation to Tribes, acknowledged in treaties, statutes, and \n     decisions of the Supreme Court, to protect the interests and \n     welfare of tribal governments and their members;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives have \n     consistently served with honor and distinction in the Armed \n     Forces of the United States, some as early as the \n     Revolutionary War, and continue to serve in the Armed Forces \n     in greater numbers per capita than any other group in the \n     United States;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives speak and \n     preserve indigenous languages and have contributed hundreds \n     of words to the English language, including the names of \n     people and locations in the United States;\n       Whereas Congress has recognized Native American code \n     talkers who served with honor and distinction in World War I \n     and World War II, using indigenous languages as an \n     unbreakable military code, saving countless American lives;\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives are deeply \n     rooted in tradition and culture, which drives their strength \n     of community; and\n       Whereas American Indians and Alaska Natives of all ages \n     celebrate the great achievements of their ancestors and \n     heroes and continue to share their stories with future \n     generations: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the celebration of National American Indian \n     and Alaska Native Heritage Month during the month of November \n     2009;\n       (2) honors the heritage and culture of American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives and the contributions of American Indians and \n     Alaska Natives to the United States; and\n       (3) urges the people of the United States to observe \n     National American Indian and Alaska Native Heritage Month \n     with appropriate programs and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/11/05/senate-section/article/S11236-2", "month": "11", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S11236-S11237]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              APPOINTMENT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
