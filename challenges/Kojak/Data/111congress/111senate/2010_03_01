Mr. President, every night too many out-of-work Nevadans \nand Americans, people who want to work, who need to support their \nfamilies but can't find a job, go to bed with at least the comfort of \nhaving unemployment insurance and health benefits. Last night, more \nthan a million people throughout America who went to sleep relying on \nthose benefits woke up without the confidence they will be there now. \nEarly this morning, when they would rather be spending their mornings \nworking, mothers and fathers in every State woke up to line up at the \nunemployment office in a long line. News reports today are that these \nlines\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nare very long today, all over the country, from Virginia to Nevada to \nKentucky. They are long because these people are worried about how they \nare going to put food on the table and pay the bills. For far too many \nAmericans, those benefits were set to expire last night. So six times \nlast week, Democrats asked to extend their unemployment benefits for a \nshort time while we work on a longer extension. Six times, Republicans \nsaid no. They didn't say no to us; that is, Members of the Senate, they \nsaid no to the families in their own States and all States who count on \nus to act when we need action, who count on us to respond in the event \nof an emergency. This is an emergency.\n  Republicans in the Senate are standing between these families and the \nhelp they need while these benefits expire. It might work because under \nthe Senate rules they can do that, but it certainly doesn't work for \nworking families whose need to buy groceries does not expire. The need \nto heat your homes, put gas in the car, make payments for furniture you \nbuy, the car you bought, your house payment, the need to take medicine \nor support an aging parent or to take care of your kids, they don't \nexpire.\n  Those opposed to helping our fellow citizens at their time of \ngreatest need want to talk about process. My Republican colleagues came \nto the floor and talked about process. They had a right to do that. \nUnder the rules, I guess that is true. But if you can't afford to feed \nyour kids, process doesn't mean anything to you.\n  We often talk about the cost of inaction. It is the reason we insist \non creating jobs and making health care more affordable and on \nstrengthening national security. When we talk about the cost of \ninaction, it is more than just rhetoric; it comes with dire \nconsequences. Americans who woke up this morning without the benefits \nthey need now know that better than anyone else.\n  The Associated Press runs all over the country--a newswire. Among \nother things, this article says this morning:\n\n       Two thousand federal transportation workers will be \n     furloughed without pay [today].\n\n  The reason we are talking about 2,000, this doesn't count the \nthousands and thousands, up to 1 million people who are not going to \nhave jobs as a result of not extending the highway bill. That is what \nwe want to do--let these people work--because what has happened is that \neven the inspectors can't go out and do their jobs, so people are just \nwalking away from these jobs. Secretary LaHood, the Secretary of \nTransportation--a Republican Congressman until he was appointed--said \nconstruction workers will be sent home from jobsites because Federal \ninspectors must be furloughed. They named a long list of construction \nsites that will be halted: George Washington Parkway in Virginia, the \nHumpback Bridge--I don't know where that is in Virginia--bridge \nconstruction in Coeur d'Alene, ID. All over the country, this is \nhappening. The safety inspectors have no pay, so they have to leave. \nNothing is happening. This is going to lead to untold numbers of \npeople--I said up to 1 million people--who will not be able to work.\n  It is really wrong what has taken place here. It is not too late to \nright that wrong. I hope Republicans will reconsider, think about their \nconstituents standing in the unemployment lines as we speak. I hope \nthey reconsider.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S826-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4691\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, just a brief explanation of why we are \nwhere we are with this extension bill, a brief extension of 30 days.\n  There was an agreement between the majority leader of the Finance \nCommittee and the minority leader on the Finance Committee, Senators \nBaucus and Grassley, on a 3-month extension of these very same \nprovisions. There were more provisions in the bill also. It cost a \nlittle more than the $10 billion that is asked for because it was a 3-\nmonth extension. Senator Reid pulled that bill from the floor of the \nSenate. He did it. The leader of the Democrats pulled that bill from \nthe floor.\n  I support extending unemployment benefits, COBRA benefits, flood \ninsurance, the highway bill fix, the doc fix, small business loans, \ndistant network television for satellite viewers. If we can't find $10 \nbillion to pay for something we all support, we will never pay for \nanything in the Senate. I have offered several ways to do this, \nincluding trying to negotiate with the majority leader's staff. None \nhave been successful.\n  We cannot keep adding to the debt. It is over $14 trillion and going \nup fast. If the budget before us passes, it will add another $1.5 \ntrillion to the debt.\n  Recently, we passed pay-go. For those who don't know what pay-go is, \nit means you have to pay for everything you bring before the Senate. \nYou can't charge it on the debt. You can't charge it. That is what pay-\ngo says. Understanding that, I hope the American people understand my \nserious objection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S826-5", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S826-S827]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 4691\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4691; that the amendment \nat the desk, which offers a full offset, be agreed to; the bill, as \namended, be read a third time and passed; and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, history is something I think \nyou have to be involved in to understand what really transpired.\n  First of all, there was no bill on the floor for me to take off the \nfloor. There was discussion between Democrats and Republicans. On the \nThursday before we left for the last weeklong break we took, I was in \nthe back hall with Senators Grassley, Baucus, and McConnell. Senator \nMcConnell, my friend, said they weren't ready to agree to anything yet.\n  Well, it is very clear if we are going to extend benefits for a lot \nof tax provisions that are very important to business, then we should \nat least consider extending benefits for people who are down and out in \nthe same period of time.\n  So understand, the bill that came before the Senate included a jobs \npackage that extends the highway benefits for 1 year, saving a million \njobs, creating jobs by allowing small businesses--or any businesses--to \nhire somebody who has been out of work for 60 days. They do not have to \npay their withholding tax and they get a $1,000 tax credit at the end \nof the year.\n  In addition to that, to help small businesses, we had a provision to \nallow small businesses to write off and not depreciate up to $250,000 \nof purchases in a year--very important to create and\n\n[[Page S827]]\n\nstimulate business--and we also had in that bill a provision to \nstimulate the economy by extending the Build America Bonds that were so \nsuccessful in our Recovery Act and those funds expired.\n  One can have all the excuses one wants. The fact is, my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle are opposing extending unemployment \nbenefits for people who are out of work.\n  I would also say this: Pay-go is very interesting. I am glad my \nfriend brought that up. I am glad he brought up the big deficit because \nit is very big. But where was my friend from Kentucky when we had two \nwars that were unpaid for during the Bush administration, tax cuts that \ncost more than $1 trillion unpaid for? Where were my friend and the \nRepublicans objecting to that?\n  Pay-go is important, and we passed pay-go here--we, the Democrats, \npassed it. My friend did not vote for it. It passed because Democrats \nvoted for it. Not a single Republican voted for it. We had these in \neffect during the Clinton years, and it worked. We paid down the debt \nin the last Clinton years.\n  We also understand how important the debt of this country is. It \nstarted to build up so strong during the 8 years of the Bush \nadministration. We brought to this floor--no one worked harder than the \nActing President pro tempore to come up with something to address the \ndebt with the chairman of our Budget Committee and others.\n  We wanted a debt commission, and we brought to this floor a debt \ncommission, a good one. It was based upon what we did with military \nbase closings. We tried for decades to close bases that were \nunnecessary in the country anymore, after World War II was over, the \nKorean war was over, Vietnam. We did not need all those bases. But \nbecause of what happens when trying to close a base because of local \npolitics, we could not do it. So we passed a bill that said we are \ngoing to have a base closing commission. They will come back with \nrecommendations, and the House and the Senate have a choice: either \nvote no or yes on their recommendations. And they voted yes, both the \nHouse and the Senate, and we closed numerous bases all over the \ncountry.\n  The debt commission we established was based upon that--the same \nthing--and we voted, we Democrats voted. It would have passed. Why did \nit not pass? Because seven Republicans who cosponsored the legislation \nvoted against it.\n  So we do not need lectures here on debt. What we need is to recognize \nthere are poor people all over America who are desperate today, and \npeople who are working, making good money on these road projects all \nover America today who are being told to go home because we do not have \ninspectors to take care of their work.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, unless my friend has more to say, I suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, it was my privilege last Thursday, \nalong with some other Members of the Senate, to attend a health care \nsummit at the invitation of President Obama. It went on a long time. We \nlearned one thing we already knew, that our President is smart and \nknows a lot about health care. So he stayed the whole time.\n  But it gave those of us on the Republican side a chance we do not \nhave the opportunity to have as often, which is, to be on center stage \nand let the American people know, A, who we are, and, B, what our ideas \nare. So it was a terrific way for us to show, for example, that our \ngoal is to reduce health care costs, that we wish to move step by step \ntoward that goal.\n  We identified a number of areas, such as being able to buy health \ninsurance across State lines, allowing small business health plans to \npool together, reducing junk lawsuits--all of which will tend to bring \ndown the cost of premiums, which is what most Americans want.\n  During the discussion, early on, actually, the President and I had a \nlittle disagreement about whether his plan, which is based upon the \nSenate bill, which passed on Christmas Eve, would raise premiums. What \nI had said in my opening remarks on behalf of Republicans was that \nmillions of Americans, under the Democratic plan, would pay higher \ninsurance premiums in the individual market because of government \nmandates and taxes. The President says that is wrong. I cited a \nCongressional Budget Office report to show I was right. And rather than \ndispute the President of the United States in public--I thought I had \nenough time to make my case--I said I would send him a letter, which I \ndid that same day. So I ask unanimous consent, Mr. President, to have \nprinted in the Record the letter I gave to President Obama on Thursday.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 25, 2010.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President, The White House, Pennsylvania Avenue, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: During today's discussion on health \n     care, you and I disagreed about whether the health care bill \n     that passed the Senate on a party-line vote on December 24 \n     would cause health insurance premiums to rise even faster \n     than if Congress did not act. I believe premiums will rise \n     because of independent analysis of the bill:\n       On November 30, the non-partisan Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) wrote in a letter to Senator Bayh that ``CBO and \n     JCT estimate that the average premium per person covered \n     (including dependents) for new nongroup policies would be \n     about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the \n     average premium for nongroup coverage in that same year under \n     current law.''\n       When you asserted that CBO says premiums will decline by 14 \n     to 20 percent under the Senate bill, you are leaving out an \n     important part of CBO's calculations. These reductions are \n     overwhelmed by a 27 to 30 percent increase in premiums due to \n     the mandated coverage requirements in the legislation. CBO \n     added those figures together to arrive at a net increase of \n     10 to 13 percent--as shown in their chart in that same \n     letter.\n       In that same letter, CBO wrote, ``The legislation would \n     impose several new fees on firms in the health sector. New \n     fees would be imposed on providers of health insurance and on \n     manufacturers and importers of medical devices. Both of those \n     fees would be largely passed through to consumers in the form \n     of higher premiums for private coverage.''\n       On December 10, the chief actuary for the Centers for \n     Medicare and Medicaid Services--who works for your \n     administration--concurred with the CBO. In his analysis, the \n     actuary said, ``We anticipate such fees would generally be \n     passed through to health consumers in the form of higher drug \n     and device prices and higher insurance premiums.'' He also \n     said, ``The additional demand for health services could be \n     difficult to meet initially with existing health provider \n     resources and could lead to price increases, cost-shifting, \n     and/or changes in providers' willingness to treat patients \n     with low-reimbursement health coverage.''\n       For these reasons, the Senate-passed bill will, indeed, \n     cause Americans' insurance premiums to rise, which is the \n     opposite of the goal I believe we should pursue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Lamar Alexander.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. But today what I wish to do in the next few minutes is \nexplain why I believe I am correct, that under the President's health \ninsurance plan, which is based upon the Senate plan, for millions of \nAmericans in the individual market, premiums would go up because of \none-size-fits-all government mandates, because of taxes that are passed \non to consumers; but for other reasons as well--by shifting costs.\n  When you dump 15 million people or 18 million people into a program \ncalled Medicaid, what happens is, we do not pay the doctors and the \nhospitals well enough to take care of those folks. So\n\n[[Page S828]]\n\nthose providers shift the costs to people who are paying with private \ninsurance, and premiums go up.\n  Costs for young people in the individual market will go up under this \nplan because if you put in a rule that says my insurance at my age \ncannot go up more than a certain amount compared with my son's \ninsurance, then his insurance goes up, and because a scheme like the \nDemocratic plan depends upon requiring everybody to buy insurance. \nThere is a weak provision for that, and I suspect many young people \nwill rather pay the $750 fine rather than buy a $2,500 insurance \npolicy, which they think they cannot afford.\n  The President made the point in his usual very persuasive way that, \nwait a minute, actually you would be getting better insurance. But that \nis comparing apples and oranges. As George Will said on ABC's ``This \nWeek'' yesterday--he asked this question: If the government required \nyou to buy a better, more expensive car, even if it was better than the \ncar you have, it would still be more expensive, would it not?\n  That is the case with the President's health care plan. In fact, \npremiums will go up for millions of Americans in the individual market, \nup more than they otherwise would over the next several years--and we \nall know how rapidly they are rising--and the whole exercise we have \nbeen going through over the last year is to bring premiums down, not \nhelp drive premiums up.\n  What I said to the President, with respect, was that the \nCongressional Budget Office, on November 30, said this about the Senate \nbill:\n\n       The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \n     Taxation estimate that the average premium per person covered \n     for new nongroup--\n\n  That means individual policies--\n\n     would be about 10 to 13 percent higher in 2016 than the \n     average premium for nongroup--\n\n  That is individual coverage--\n\n     in the same year under current law.\n\n  In other words, if you buy an individual policy--that means not a \npolicy with your employer--by 2016 it will be at an average of 10 to 13 \npercent higher than it otherwise would.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the relevant \nparts of the Congressional Budget Office letter of November 30 to \nSenator Evan Bayh on this point.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 30, 2009.\n     Hon. Evan Bayh,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The attachment to this letter responds to \n     your request--and the interest expressed by many other \n     Members--for an analysis of how proposals being considered by \n     the Congress to change the health care and health insurance \n     systems would affect premiums paid for health insurance in \n     various markets. Specifically, the Congressional Budget \n     Office (CBO) and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation \n     have analyzed how health insurance premiums might be affected \n     by enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act, as proposed by Senator Reid on November 18, 2009.\n       I hope this information is helpful to you. If you have any \n     further questions, please contact me or the CBO staff. The \n     primary staff contact for this analysis is Philip Ellis.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,\n                                                         Director.\n       Attachment.\n\n                          Summary of Findings\n\n       The effects of the proposal on premiums would differ across \n     insurance markets (see Table 1). The largest effects would be \n     seen in the nongroup market, which would grow in size under \n     the proposal but would still account for only 17 percent of \n     the overall insurance market in 2016. The effects on premiums \n     would be much smaller in the small group and large group \n     markets, which would make up 13 percent and 70 percent of the \n     total insurance market, respectively.\n\n\n                           Nongroup Policies\n\n       CBO and JCT estimate that the average premium per person \n     covered (including dependents) for new nongroup policies \n     would be about 10 percent to 13 percent higher in 2016 than \n     the average premium for nongroup coverage in that same year \n     under current law. About half of those enrollees would \n     receive government subsidies that would reduce their costs \n     well below the premiums that would be charged for such \n     policies under current law.\n\n[[Page S829]]\n\n     [GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS01MR10.001\n     \n\n\n[[Page S830]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Now, the President said: Wait a minute. The premiums \nin the individual market will go down 14 to 20 percent. That is also in \nthe same letter. Of course, he is right about that. They go down \nbecause of administrative efficiencies and new enrollment, but he left \nout that there are other factors involved so that the government \nmandates will drive them up 27 to 30 percent or, in the end, the \naverage, as the CBO said, premium per person covered in an individual \npolicy would be up 10 to 13 percent.\n  The bill has subsidies in it for some Americans. The same letter says \nabout half of Americans who buy in the individual market will get a \nsubsidy. Well, we are paying for that subsidy, but let's concede that \npoint. Still, that leaves half of the people in the individual market \nfor whom premiums will go up on an average of 10 to 13 percent.\n  Why is that? One reason is because the Senate bill says people will \nhave to buy a richer policy than they have today. That means it has a \nhigher actuarial value. They call it in the bill ``minimum creditable \ncoverage.'' It means this is the amount of insurance I think you should \nhave before you buy a policy. That might be a good decision. It \nundoubtedly would be good to have the insurance. It just costs 27 to 30 \npercent more than today's average.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses wrote a December 12 \nletter in opposition to the Senate bill saying the benefit mandates \nwill put small business owners ``at risk of having to drop coverage due \nto cost increases that outpace their health budgets.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nNFIB to Senator McConnell and Senator Reid, dated December 8.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                                 December 8, 2009.\n     Sen. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Sen. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Reid and McConnell: As the Senate continues \n     to debate the future of comprehensive healthcare reform, the \n     National Federation of Independent Business, the nation's \n     leading small business association, is writing in opposition \n     to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. \n     3590).\n       When evaluating healthcare reform options, small business \n     owners ask themselves two specific questions. First, will the \n     bill lower insurance costs? Second, will the bill increase \n     the overall cost of doing business? If a bill increases the \n     cost of doing business or fails to reduce insurance costs, \n     then the bill fails to achieve their No. 1 goal--lower costs.\n       In both cases, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act (H.R. 3590) fails the small business test and, therefore, \n     fails small business. The most recent CBO study detailing the \n     effect that H.R. 3590 will have on insurance premiums \n     reinforces that, despite claims by its supporters, the bill \n     will not deliver the widely-promised help to the small \n     business community. Instead, CBO findings report that the \n     bill will increase non-group premiums by 10 to 13 percent and \n     result in, at best, a 2 percent decrease for small group \n     coverage by 2016. These findings tell small business all it \n     needs to know--that the current bill does not do enough to \n     reduce costs for small business owners and their employees.\n       Despite the inclusion of insurance market reforms in the \n     small-group and individual marketplaces, the savings that may \n     materialize are too small for too few and the increase in \n     premium costs are too great for too many. Those costs, along \n     with greater government involvement, higher taxes and new \n     mandates that are disproportionately targeted at small \n     business and are being used to finance H.R. 3590, create a \n     reality that is worse than the status quo for small business. \n     The shortcomings of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act include:\n\n\n               A New Small Business Health Insurance Tax\n\n       Unlike large businesses, which self-insure and find \n     security under the blanket of ERISA, most small businesses \n     are only able to find and purchase insurance in the fully-\n     insured marketplace. The Senate bill includes a new $6.7 \n     billion annual tax ($60.7 billion over 10 years) that falls \n     almost exclusively on small business because the fee is \n     assessed on the insurance companies. CBO's most recent study \n     reinforces those costs will ultimately be passed on to their \n     consumers, leaving the cost to be disproportionately borne by \n     small business consumers in the individual and small-group \n     marketplace whose only choice is to purchase those products \n     or forgo insurance altogether.\n\n\n   A New Mandate that Punishes Employers, Employees and Hinders Job \n                                Creation\n\n       Employer mandates fail employers and employees in two ways. \n     First, mandates do nothing to address the core issue facing \n     small business--high healthcare costs. Second, mandates \n     destroy job creation opportunities for employees. The job \n     loss, whether through lost hiring or greater reliance on \n     part-time employees, harms low-wage or entry-level workers \n     the most. The employer mandate in H.R. 3590 sets up \n     potentially troubling outcomes for this sector of the \n     workforce. The multiple penalties assessed on full-time \n     workers will most certainly result in a reduction of full-\n     time workers to part-time workers and discourage the hiring \n     of those entrants into the workforce who might qualify for a \n     government subsidy, hardly an outcome that contributes to a \n     greater insured population.\n\n\n             A Poorly-Structured Small Business Tax Credit\n\n       As structured, the small business tax credit will do \n     little, if nothing, to propel either more firms to take up \n     coverage or produce greater overall affordability. Due to its \n     short-term temporary nature and the limitations based on the \n     business' average wage, its benefit is, at best, a temporary \n     solution to the long-term cost and affordability problem. A \n     tax credit that is poorly structured is not going to provide \n     sustainable and long-term relief from high healthcare costs, \n     and the recent CBO finding that the tax credit would benefit \n     only 12 percent of the small business population illustrates \n     its lack of effectiveness.\n\n\n     A Benefit Package that is Too High a Hurdle for Small Business\n\n       NFIB has voiced concern over establishing a benefit \n     threshold that is too high a price tag for small businesses \n     to meet. Small businesses are especially price sensitive. \n     They need purchasing choices that provide the flexibility in \n     coverage options that reflect their marketplace and business \n     needs. If Congress doesn't adjust the actuarial value \n     standards in the legislation, what may be affordable this \n     year may be unaffordable next year. As a result, small \n     business owners will be at risk of having to drop coverage \n     due to cost increases that outpace their healthcare budgets.\n\n\n    Destructive Rating Reforms and Phase-In Timelines that Threaten \n                         Affordability for All\n\n       NFIB supports balanced federal rating reforms that protect \n     access and affordability, regardless of an individual or \n     group's health status. However, the excessively tight age \n     rating (3:1) in H.R. 3590 will increase more costs than it \n     will decrease, and make coverage unaffordable for the very \n     populations that are most beneficial to the insurance pool--\n     the young and the healthy. Independent actuaries have \n     analyzed the negative impact of such tight bands and have \n     indicated that there will be devastating effects to the long-\n     term viability of a pool without action to correct this \n     rating imbalance.\n       Additionally, to prevent volatile spikes in insurance \n     premiums, also known as ``rate shock,'' federal rating \n     reforms must be appropriately applied to all marketplaces and \n     phased in over a responsible period of time. If this is not \n     done, then certain plans, including ``grandfathered plans,'' \n     will utilize different rating practices when underwriting \n     risk, which can create adverse selection issues. Those \n     selection problems will have a striking negative impact on \n     the new exchanges--exchanges that are meant to improve, \n     rather than decrease, affordability for small business and \n     individuals.\n\n\n        National Plans that Provide Limited Promise for Success\n\n       Leveling the playing field for small business starts with \n     allowing uniform benefit packages to be purchased across \n     state lines. If done right, this can provide a greater \n     security that, as people change jobs and move from state to \n     state, they can keep the benefit plan that meets their \n     healthcare needs. National plans would be particularly \n     helpful for states with smaller populations and where \n     consumers lack a robust marketplace with choice and \n     competition for private plans. Specifically, the state ``opt-\n     out'' language in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act would create more disincentives than incentives for \n     carriers to embark on these new opportunities. If the \n     national plan section is not significantly restructured to \n     make national plans a viable option, then these new \n     opportunities will never materialize for small business.\n\n\n      Threatens Flexibility and Choice for Employers and Employees\n\n       Small employers need more affordable health insurance \n     options and new alternatives for employers to voluntarily \n     contribute to individually-owned plans. Provisions also need \n     to be structured to insure that options are widely available \n     to both employers and employees. The simple cafeteria plan \n     language in H.R. 3590 excludes the owners of many ``pass-\n     through'' business entities from participating in these \n     arrangements. If owners are unable to participate in the \n     plan, they will be less likely to provide insurance to their \n     workforce. Finally, small business needs the freedom and \n     flexibility to preserve options that are already proven to \n     work. Prohibiting the use of HSA, FSA and HRA funds to \n     purchase over-the-counter medications, along with the $2,500 \n     limit on FSA contributions, diminishes that flexibility and \n     threatens to further limit the options employers have to \n     provide meaningful healthcare to their employees.\n\n[[Page S831]]\n\n                New Paperwork Costs on Small Businesses\n\n       The cost associated with tax paperwork is the most \n     expensive paperwork burden that the federal government \n     imposes on small business owners. The Senate bill \n     dramatically increases that cost with a new reporting \n     requirement that is levied on business transactions of more \n     than $600 annually, leaving small business buried in \n     paperwork and increasing their paperwork compliance expenses.\n\n\n          An Unprecedented New Payroll Tax on Small Employers\n\n       Since its creation the payroll taxes that fund the Medicare \n     programs have not been wage-based and are dedicated \n     specifically to funding Medicare. The Senate bill changes the \n     nature of the tax and creates a precedent to use payroll \n     taxes to pay for non-Medicare programs.\n\n\n              The Absence of Real Medical Liability Reform\n\n       NFIB strongly supports medical liability reform as a means \n     to both inject more fairness into the medical malpractice \n     legal system, and to reduce unnecessary litigation and legal \n     costs. Taking serious steps to adopt meaningful medical \n     liability reform is a significant step toward restoring \n     common sense to our medical liability litigation system. It \n     also is especially critical to improving access to healthcare \n     for those living in rural areas, where it is becoming \n     increasingly difficult for those in need to locate \n     specialists such as OB/GYNs and surgeons.\n\n\n        The Creation of a New Government-Run Healthcare Program\n\n       A government-run plan will drive the private healthcare \n     marketplace out of business. Private insurers will be unable \n     to compete in a climate where the rules and practices are \n     tilted in favor of a massive government-run plan. This means \n     millions could lose their current coverage. This will \n     decrease choice and increase costs. On both accounts, the \n     government-run plan will leave small business with a single \n     option the government-run plan, which is the exact opposite \n     outcome small businesses want from healthcare reform.\n       There is near universal agreement that, if done right, \n     small business has much to gain from healthcare reform. But \n     if it is done wrong, then small business will have the most \n     to lose. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, \n     which is short on savings and long on costs, is the wrong \n     reform, at the wrong time and will increase healthcare costs \n     and the cost of doing business. NFIB remains committed to \n     healthcare reform, and urges the Senate to develop common \n     sense solutions to lower healthcare costs while ensuring that \n     policies empower small business with the ability to make the \n     investments necessary to move our economy forward.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                                    Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The one-size-fits-all provision in the Democratic bill \nsays all individual and small group policies must have an actuarial \nvalue of 60 percent.\n  Senator Susan Collins of Maine, who was the insurance commissioner of \nMaine, made a speech on the Senate floor on December 18, and pointed \nout that 87 percent of the individual policies that are purchased in \nMaine today would cost more under the Reid bill.\n  I commend to my colleagues the Senator's testimony of December 18, \n2010.\n  Senator Collins used the example that the most popular individual \nmarket policy sold in Maine costs a 40-year-old about $185 a month. \nUnder the Senate bill that 40-year-old would have to pay at least $420 \na month, more than twice as much for the policy that meets the new \nminimum standard, or face a $750 penalty. It is true Maine citizens, as \nis true for all Americans--about half of them--would receive subsidies \nto help them buy that policy, but the average premium for the other \nhalf of the 87 percent is going to go up under the Democratic bill.\n  We believe Americans ought to have more choices than that. That is a \nfundamental difference of opinion. Should Washington decide you need to \nbuy a richer policy, or should you decide that for yourself based upon \nthe other needs of your family?\n  The Congressional Budget Office does state, as I have mentioned, that \nthere are a number of enrollees--about half--who would have the \nsubsidies, and that is in the letter I have already introduced into the \nRecord. But someone is paying for those subsidies: the taxpayers are \npaying for them, which brings up the second reason I said on Thursday \nthat premiums for millions of Americans in the individual market will \ngo up.\n  The commonsense idea is that if you tax an insurance company or a \nmedical device company or a manufacturer of drugs, they will pass the \ntaxes on to whom? To us, who are buying insurance policies or medical \ndevices or drugs. So we end up paying. In fact, one part of the \nPresident's proposal deliberately does that. It is a 40-percent excise \ntax on insurance companies for what we call Cadillac plans, the high-\ncost private insurance plans.\n  A letter from the Joint Committee on Taxation, dated February 24, \nsays the 40-percent excise tax will raise $32.7 billion, all of which \nwill be passed along to consumers in the form of higher insurance \npremiums. That may be a good thing. In fact, I think it is because it \nhelps to discourage the purchase of more expensive policies. But it \ndoes raise premiums in the individual market.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation Memorandum on High Cost Plans, dated \nSeptember 29, says:\n\n       The excise tax would be mainly passed along through \n     increases in premiums.\n\n  Because the new tax is indexed to regular inflation plus 1 percent \ninstead of medical inflation, which goes up very much higher and \nquicker, the new tax, like the alternative minimum tax, will pretty \nsoon start to hit Chevy and Buick insurance policies and not just \nCadillac policies.\n  But there are other taxes in the President's proposal. There are up \nto $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes, which will be passed on to consumers: \n$20 billion in excise taxes on lifesaving medical devices, $33 billion \non drugs, and $60 billion on health insurance companies. In the \npreviously mentioned CBO letter and a JCT letter to Senator Grassley in \nOctober of last year, both said these taxes will be passed on to \npatients, increasing health insurance premiums.\n  The Chief Actuary of the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, \nwho is a part of the Obama administration said:\n\n       We anticipate such fees would be generally passed through \n     to health consumers in the form of higher drug and device \n     prices and higher insurance premiums.\n\n  That was on December 10 of last year, about the Senate bill.\n  The Lewin Group, on October 30, said:\n\n       Employer spending would increase steadily under the \n     [Democratic] act, reflecting the cost of paying the various \n     excise taxes under the act. Total employer health spending \n     would increase by 2.1 percent by 2019.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the executive \nsummary of the Lewin Group letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                           Executive Summary\n\n       In this study we estimate the impact of The America's \n     Healthy Future Act as adopted by the Senate Finance \n     Committee. The Act would require most Americans to have \n     health insurance. To assure access to affordable coverage, \n     the Bill expands the Medicaid program to 133 percent of the \n     Federal Poverty Level (FPL) for all adults. It also provides \n     a new premium tax credit for people living between 133 \n     percent and 400 percent of the FPL (e.g., $88,000 for a \n     family of four).\n       In addition, the Act establishes an ``exchange'' that \n     presents consumers with a selection of health coverage \n     alternatives that is available to individuals and firms with \n     fewer than 100 workers. States would have the option to \n     extend eligibility to larger employers beginning in 2017. \n     Only people participating in the exchange who do not have \n     access to employer coverage would be eligible for the premium \n     tax credit. The Act also reforms insurance markets by \n     assuring guaranteed issue of coverage and prohibiting plans \n     from varying premiums with health status.\n       Employers with more than 50 workers are required to pay a \n     penalty for each uninsured worker receiving a premium tax \n     credit through the exchange. The Act also provides an \n     employer health insurance tax credit for up to two years for \n     firms with fewer than 25 workers with an average employee \n     earnings of less than $40,000. Workers offered coverage by an \n     employer are not eligible for premium subsidies offered in \n     the exchange unless the cost of employer coverage exceeds 10 \n     percent of income.\n       The Act is funded with reductions in spending under \n     Medicare and Medicaid, a new excise tax on high cost health \n     plans (premiums over $8,000 for individuals and $21,000 for \n     families). It also includes a second excise tax on insurance, \n     new excise taxes on branded prescription drugs and device \n     manufacturers, and other changes in revenues.\n       In this study we provide estimates of the program's impact \n     on coverage and spending for the federal government, state \n     and local governments, private employers and consumers. To \n     demonstrate the long-term impact of the Act, we provide \n     estimates for a 20-year period from 2010 through 2029.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The National Federation of Independent Business letter \nsays the same. There are other reasons the premiums will go up.\n\n[[Page S832]]\n\n  Mr. President, seeing no one else here, I wonder if I might ask \nunanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the President.\n  Here is a third reason, in addition to government mandates and taxes, \nthat will cause premiums to rise. We call it cost-shift. Premiums will \nincrease because the bill dumps 15 million to 18 million more Americans \ninto the government program called Medicaid.

Foster, Chief Actuary\n     Subject: Estimated Financial Effects of the ``Patient \n         Protection and Affordable Care Act,'' as Passed by the \n         Senate on December 24, 2009.\n\n       The Office of the Actuary has prepared this memorandum in \n     our longstanding capacity as an independent technical advisor \n     to both the Administration and the Congress. The costs, \n     savings, and coverage impacts shown herein represent our best \n     estimates for the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. \n     We offer this analysis in the hope that it will be of \n     interest and value to policy makers as they develop and \n     debate national health care reforms. The statements, \n     estimates, and other information provided in this memorandum \n     are those of the Office of the Actuary and do not represent \n     an official position of the Department of Health & Human \n     Services or the Administration.\n       This memorandum summarizes the Office of the Actuary's \n     estimates of the financial and coverage effects through \n     fiscal year 2019 of selected provisions of the ``Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act'' (PPACA) as passed by the \n     Senate on December 24, 2009 (H.R. 3590, as amended). Included \n     are the estimated net Federal expenditures in support of \n     expanded health insurance coverage, the associated numbers of \n     people by insured status, the changes in Medicare and \n     Medicaid expenditures and revenues, and the overall impact on \n     total national health expenditures. Except where noted, we \n     have not estimated the impact of the various tax and fee \n     proposals or the impact on income and payroll taxes due to \n     economic effects of the legislation. Similarly, the impact on \n     Federal administrative expenses is excluded. A summary of the \n     data, assumptions, and methodology underlying our estimates \n     of national health reform proposals is available in the \n     appendix to our October 21 memorandum on H.R. 3200.\n\n\n                                summary\n\n       The table shown on page 2 presents financial impacts of the \n     selected PPACA provisions on the Federal Budget in fiscal \n     years 2010-2019. We have grouped the provisions of the bill \n     into six major categories:\n       (i) Coverage proposals, which include the mandated coverage \n     for health insurance, the expansion of Medicaid eligibility \n     to those with incomes at or under 133 percent of the Federal \n     poverty level (FPL), and the additional funding for the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP);\n       (ii) Medicare provisions;\n       (iii) Medicaid and CHIP provisions other than the coverage \n     expansion and CHIP funding;\n       (iv) Proposals aimed in part at changing the trend in \n     health spending growth;\n       (v) The Community Living Assistance Services and Supports \n     (CLASS) proposal; and\n       (vi) Immediate health insurance reforms.\n       The estimated costs and savings shown in the table are \n     based on the effective dates specified in the bill as passed. \n     Additionally, we assume that employers and individuals would \n     take roughly 3 to 5 years to fully adapt to the insurance \n     coverage provisions and that the enrollment of additional \n     individuals under the Medicaid coverage expansion would be \n     completed by the third year of implementation. Because of \n     these transition effects and the fact that most of the \n     coverage provisions would be in effect for only 6 of the 10 \n     years of the budget period, the cost estimates shown in this \n     memorandum do not represent a full 10-year cost for the \n     proposed legislation.\n\n     ESTIMATED FEDERAL COSTS (+) OR SAVINGS (-) UNDER SELECTED PROVISIONS OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AS PASSED BY THE SENATE\n                                                                      [In billions]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                               Fiscal year--\n          Provisions          -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Total, 2010-\n                                  2010       2011       2012       2013       2014       2015       2016       2017       2018       2019         19\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTotal*.......................      $11.6       $0.1     -$14.8     -$32.8      $14.7      $63.0      $71.4      $60.9      $55.8      $49.7       $279.5\nCoverage ....................        4.7        6.6        1.7  .........       86.5      128.0      150.1      156.4      167.9      180.7        882.5\nMedicare.....................        2.2       -3.6      -12.1      -23.4      -62.6      -55.1      -70.2      -87.6     -104.6     -123.7       -540.7\nMedicaid/CHIP................       -0.4       -0.1        0.2       -3.8       -3.1       -3.8       -3.9       -4.1       -4.0       -3.9        -27.1\nCost trend...................  .........  .........  .........  .........       -0.0       -0.1       -0.2       -0.4       -0.6       -0.9         -2.3\nCLASS program................  .........       -2.8       -4.5       -5.6       -5.9       -6.0       -4.3       -3.4       -2.8       -2.4        -37.8\nImmediate reforms............        5.0  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........  .........          5.0\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n* Excludes Title IX revenue provisions except for section 9015, certain provisions with limited impacts, and Federal administrative costs.\n  Includes expansion of Medicaid eligibility and additional funding for CHIP.\n Includes estimated non-Medicare Federal savings from provisions for comparative effectiveness research, prevention and wellness, fraud and abuse, and\n  administrative simplification. Excludes impacts of other provisions that would affect cost growth rates, such as the productivity adjustments to\n  Medicare payment rates, which are reflected in the Medicare line.\n\n       As indicated in the table above, the provisions in support \n     of expanding health insurance coverage (including the \n     Medicaid eligibility changes and additional CHIP funding) are \n     estimated to cost $882 billion through fiscal year 2019. The \n     net savings from the Medicare, Medicaid, growth-trend, and \n     CLASS proposals are estimated to total about $603 billion, \n     leaving a net cost for this period of $279 billion before \n     consideration of additional Federal administrative expenses \n     and the increase in Federal revenues that would result from \n     the excise tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health \n     insurance coverage and other revenue provisions. (The \n     additional Hospital Insurance payroll tax income under \n     section 9015 of the PPACA is included in the estimated \n     Medicare savings shown here.) The Congressional Budget Office \n     and Joint Committee on Taxation have estimated that the total \n     net amount of Medicare savings and additional tax and other \n     revenues would somewhat more than offset the cost of the \n     national coverage provisions, resulting in an overall \n     reduction in the Federal deficit through 2019.\n       The chart shown below summarizes the estimated impacts of \n     the PPACA on insurance coverage. The mandated coverage \n     provisions, which include new responsibilities for both \n     individuals and employers, and the creation of the Health \n     Benefit Exchanges (hereafter referred to as the \n     ``Exchanges''), would lead to shifts across coverage types \n     and a substantial overall reduction in the number of \n     uninsured, as many of these individuals become covered \n     through their employers, Medicaid, or the Exchanges.\n       By calendar year 2019, the mandates, coupled with the \n     Medicaid expansion, would reduce the number of uninsured from \n     57 million, as projected under current law, to an estimated \n     23 million under the PPACA. The additional 34 million people \n     who would become insured by 2019 reflect the net effect of \n     several shifts. First, an estimated 18 million would gain \n     primary Medicaid coverage as a result of the expansion of \n     eligibility to all legal resident adults under 133 percent of \n     the FPL (In addition, roughly 2 million people with employer-\n     sponsored health insurance would enroll in Medicaid for \n     supplemental coverage.) Another 21 million persons (most of \n     whom are currently uninsured) would receive individual \n     insurance coverage through the newly created Exchanges, with \n     the majority of these qualifying for Federal premium and \n     cost-sharing subsidies. Finally, we estimate that the number \n     of individuals with employer-sponsored health insurance would \n     decrease overall by about 4 million, reflecting both gains \n     and losses in such coverage under the PPACA.\n       As described in more detail in a later section of this \n     memorandum, we estimate that overall national health \n     expenditures under this bill would increase by an estimated \n     total of $222 billion (0.6 percent) during calendar years \n     2010-2019, principally reflecting the net impact of (i) \n     greater utilization of health care services by individuals \n     becoming newly covered (or having more complete coverage), \n     (ii) lower prices paid to health providers for the subset of \n     those individuals who become covered by Medicaid, and (iii) \n     lower payments and payment updates for Medicare services, \n     together with net Medicaid savings from provisions other than \n     the coverage expansion. Although several provisions would \n     help to reduce health care cost growth, their impact would be \n     more than offset through 2019 by the higher health \n     expenditures resulting from the coverage expansions.\n       The actual future impacts of the PPACA on health \n     expenditures, insured status, individual decisions, and \n     employer behavior are very uncertain. The legislation would \n     result in numerous changes in the way that health care \n     insurance is provided and paid for in the U.S., and the scope \n     and magnitude of these changes are such that few precedents \n     exist for use in estimation. Consequently, the estimates \n     presented here are subject to a substantially greater degree \n     of uncertainty than\n\n[[Page S833]]\n\n     is usually the case with more routine health care proposals.\n       The balance of this memorandum discusses these financial \n     and coverage estimates--and their limitations--in greater \n     detail.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The point is, Medicaid only pays doctors and hospitals \nabout 60 percent of the cost of serving the 60 million patients who are \nnow there. The Democratic bill would add 15 million to 18 million more \npatients. So what do the doctors and hospitals do? They see these \npatients, but then they shift the costs to the patients they see who \nhave private insurance.\n  The President himself said that adds about $1,000 to every policy \ntoday, this cost-shifting. I have included that comment from the Chief \nActuary.\n  The PriceWaterhouseCoopers report on the Senate Finance Committee \nbill in October of 2009 indicated that the net effect of the bills \nbefore Congress will make the Medicare and Medicaid cost-shift even \nmore severe, raising the cost of private insurance premiums for large \nemployers by $255 a year between 2015 and 2019.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the relevant \nportions of the PriceWaterhouseCoopers report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    Potential Impact of Health Reform on the Cost of Private Health \n                           Insurance Coverage\n\n\n                    issue C--increased cost shifting\n\n       Today, certain costs (e.g., hospital expenses) are shifted \n     to the private sector (employers and consumers) as some \n     participants in the system pay less than their share of the \n     cost of their care. Public programs such as Medicare and \n     Medicaid reimburse less than the cost of care for hospitals' \n     services. In addition, the uninsured or underinsured may not \n     be able to cover the full cost of care, and this cost is then \n     also transferred to the private market.\n       The initial hope of health reform was that by improving \n     coverage of the currently uninsured, a significant percentage \n     of uncompensated care would be eliminated. This is still \n     anticipated to happen. However, the cost shift ``gains'' from \n     decreasing the numbers of uninsured now appear to be more \n     than offset by the losses from proposed cutbacks in Medicare \n     and Medicaid spending allocated to the hospital sector.\n       It should also be noted that the impact of covering the \n     uninsured may be different in communities constrained by \n     limited hospital capacity. In those communities, covering the \n     uninsured could actually increase cost-shifting if the newly \n     insured increase demand for healthcare services and the \n     overall mix of hospital patients migrates towards lower \n     paying government programs.\n       The net impact is likely to result in an increase in cost \n     shifting which translates into a 0.8 percent average annual \n     increase in the private sector spending between 2010 and \n     2019, or $145 on average per year for family coverage in a \n     large group plan (and $55 for single coverage). We note that \n     this cost burden ramps up over the projection period, with an \n     average annual increase in health costs of 1.2 percent over \n     the second five-year period. We assume that this increased \n     cost to the private sector will ultimately impact the cost of \n     coverage for individuals and businesses in both the insured \n     and self-insured market. As a result, premium costs for large \n     group plans will be $37 higher each year between 2010 and \n     2014 for family coverage ($14 for single coverage), and $255 \n     higher each year between 2015 and 2019 ($96 for single \n     coverage).\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Younger Americans in the individual market will pay \nhigher premiums under the Democratic plan because, as I mentioned \nearlier, it will mandate for individual coverage that I can't pay more \nthan three times as much as my son can pay for an insurance premium. \nThat might help keep my premiums down, but it is going to send his up \npretty far because 42 States, including Tennessee, allow more variance \nof that. So young people across America, who include about 30 percent \nof the uninsured, are in for a big surprise when their individual \npolicies jump up 30 to 35 percent, which is what the Oliver Wyman \nreport on September 28 said theirs might do, or when, since they are \nuninsured, they are required to buy insurance and they find the \ninsurance they are required to buy is very expensive.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the conclusion \nof the Oliver Wyman report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       As Congress considers approaches to maximize health \n     insurance coverage in the United States, it is important to \n     consider the impact of premium rate compression on current \n     purchasers and the uninsured. Providing affordable premiums \n     to young people is critical to encourage their participation \n     and ensure the long-term sustainability of the insurance pool \n     in the years following health insurance reform.\n       Requiring a young person to pay multiples of their expected \n     medical expenses for health insurance is likely to cause \n     these individuals to decline to purchase coverage. \n     Maintaining adequate flexibility in rating will minimize the \n     rate shock that many could see in the marketplace and \n     encourage higher levels of coverage over time. Moreover, the \n     elimination of health status as a rating factor will already \n     provide significant benefit to older individuals, who are \n     more likely to suffer from chronic health conditions.\n       In conclusion, our modeling demonstrates that the 5:1 age \n     band, as originally included in the Senate Finance \n     Committee's Chairman's Mark, will reduce disruption compared \n     to tight age bands. Maintaining 5:1 age bands will encourage \n     more young people to participate in the insurance market, \n     thereby keeping average rates more affordable. This, in turn, \n     will result in higher overall levels of participation in the \n     insurance market and fewer uninsured.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Finally, the young and the healthy can skip out of \nthis. That will drive up premiums. They may decide they would rather \npay a $750 fine than $2,500 for a health insurance policy they think \nthey don't need.\n  The American Academies of Actuaries wrote a letter on the Reid bill \non November 20 that said: ``Any premium variations by age limited to a \n3.1 ratio between the highest and lowest premiums,'' and then it goes \non to say, ``would cause higher premiums on average relative to current \npremiums.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter from \nthe American Academy of Actuaries of November 20, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                November 20, 2009.\n     Re: Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n\n     Hon. Harry Reid\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     The American Academy of Actuaries' Health Practice Council \n     commends members of the Senate as you prepare to debate and \n     vote on the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. We \n     share with you the goals of reducing the numbers of \n     uninsured, increasing the availability of affordable \n     coverage, controlling health spending growth, and improving \n     the quality of care. On behalf of the council, I appreciate \n     this opportunity to provide the following comments outlining \n     the three key criteria that need to be considered when \n     evaluating whether this legislation will lead to a viable \n     health insurance system, and how the legislation can be \n     improved to meet these goals. In particular:\n       For insurance markets to be viable, they must attract a \n     broad section of risks. Implementing market reforms to \n     prohibit insurers from denying coverage and to restrict how \n     much premiums can vary will result in adverse selection and \n     upward pressure on premiums unless lower-risk individuals \n     have incentives to purchase coverage. An individual mandate \n     can bring lower-risk individuals into the pool. To be \n     effective, however, the penalties for not complying with the \n     mandate must be meaningful relative to the premium faced. The \n     penalties in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \n     are very low, which is especially problematic given the \n     bill's limits on premium variations by age, which will raise \n     premiums for younger individuals. Strengthening the bill's \n     individual mandate through higher financial penalties is \n     needed to reduce adverse selection that would arise due to \n     the new issue and rating restrictions.\n       Market competition requires a level playing field. All \n     plans, including any new public plans or health insurance \n     cooperatives must operate under the same rules. As written, \n     the public plan and cooperatives established under the \n     legislation would be subject to the same market rules and \n     benefit requirements that apply to public plans. They would \n     also be required to negotiate rates with providers. The bill \n     should retain these provisions and also ensure that start-up \n     funds provided to these plans are adequate to meet not only \n     pre-operational expenses but also solvency needs.\n       For long-term sustainability, health spending growth must \n     be reduced. Provisions to control health care spending should \n     include not only one-time improvements that will help address \n     short-term goals, but also options that permanently reduce \n     spending growth to address long-term goals. The Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act includes provisions that \n     aim to reduce long-term spending growth by shifting the \n     health care payment and delivery systems to focus on cost-\n     effective and high-quality care. Many of these efforts take \n     the form of studies and demonstration projects. Policymakers \n     need to focus intently on finding ways to control spending \n     and ensuring that\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\n     promising approaches and successful demonstration projects \n     are adopted on a broad scale in a timely manner. . .\n       To this end, the Act also includes provisions that would \n     help shift the health care payment and delivery systems from \n     rewarding quantity of care to rewarding quality of care. The \n     legislation includes many cost containment and quality \n     improvement strategies focused on the Medicare program, \n     including provider payment and delivery system reforms that \n     provide incentives for coordinated and cost-effective care. \n     Such a comprehensive and coordinated approach to addressing \n     quality and costs is needed to fundamentally transform the \n     health system to ensure its long-term sustainability. \n     However, acknowledging that the impact on health spending and \n     health outcomes of many potential programs is still unclear, \n     the legislation directs many of these efforts in the form of \n     studies and demonstration projects. Analyses from the Centers \n     on Medicare and Medicaid Services and from the Congressional \n     Budget Office suggest that at least in their current limited \n     form, these provisions will have only a minimal impact on \n     health spending growth. Policymakers need to focus intently \n     on finding ways to control spending and ensuring that \n     promising approaches and successful demonstration projects \n     are adopted on a broad scale and in a timely manner.\n\n\n                                Summary\n\n       The American Academy of Actuaries' Health Practice Council \n     strongly supports three key considerations for a sustainable \n     health insurance system with increased access to affordable \n     health insurance. In particular, for insurance markets to be \n     viable they must attract a broad cross section of risks; \n     market competition requires a level playing field; and for \n     long-term sustainability, health spending growth must be \n     reduced.\n       Outcomes of the reforms before you, because they involve so \n     many complex interactions including market behavior, may not \n     be fully known until implementation. Even actuaries must make \n     certain assumptions in their projections, based on experience \n     and expertise, as to what the exact effects will be. However, \n     as the full Senate casts votes, we urge you to first and \n     foremost examine these criteria as a litmus for determining \n     the success of this reform effort. In particular, we believe \n     that strengthening the individual mandate through higher \n     financial penalties is needed to reduce the adverse selection \n     that would arise due to the new issue and rating \n     restrictions.\n       We welcome the opportunity to serve as an ongoing resource \n     to you as health care reform legislation is considered in the \n     Senate and through remainder of the legislative process. If \n     you have any questions or would like to discuss these \n     comments further, please contact Heather Jerbi, the Academy's \n     senior health policy analyst (202.785.7869; \n     Jerbi@actuary.org).\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Cori E. Uccello,\n                                             Senior Health Fellow.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. All in all, these factors suggest why, when Senator \nCollins took a look at Maine, she found that 87 percent of people in \nMaine are paying less for their individual policies than the policies \nwould cost under the Reid bill. It is true that half or more of them \nwould receive some subsidy, which would reduce their costs, but around \nhalf of them will pay more. In Tennessee, Blue Cross Blue Shield, which \ncovers about one-third of Tennessee's individual market, estimates the \npremiums for those individuals will increase by 30 to 45 percent under \nthe Reid bill.\n  I ask unanimous consent to include a chart which demonstrates that.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS01MR10.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. At our summit on Thursday, there were a number of good \nideas about reducing health care costs that the President seemed to \nshare with Republican Members who were there. There was some obvious \nirritation on the part of the majority leader and others when we said \nthings such as there is $\\1/2\\ trillion worth of cuts in Medicare, \nwhich there are. Our real objection to it is that the cuts are not used \nto save Medicare, which is going broke, but spent on a new program--\n$\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes. There is $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes.\n  As I have just said, they tend to increase premiums for millions of \nAmericans. There are premium increases. There is a deficit increase.\n  It is true the CBO has said that what was presented to them didn't \nincrease the deficit, but what was not included in what was presented \nwas paying doctors to serve patients in the government program we call \nMedicare. That is like having a horse race without the horses. How are \nyou going to have a comprehensive health care bill and not include \nwithin its costs paying doctors to serve patients in the government \nprogram? When you put it in, the deficit goes up.\n  Then there is a problem of the passing off to States these expanded \nMedicaid costs without paying for them. I know as a former Governor--\nand I see the former Governor of Virginia in the chair--I struggled \nwith that every single year. All the Governors are today in both \nparties. They don't want us sending them a bill for expanded health \ncare. They can't pay the bills they have. We shouldn't do that. If we \nwant to expand it, we should pay for it. That is another part of the \nbill.\n  So I came to the floor today to, No. 1, express my appreciation to \nthe President for inviting us Thursday. It gave us a chance to show who \nwe are and what we are for. I thought it was a good discussion. I \nbelieve there are 8 or 10, maybe a dozen different good ideas Senator \nCoburn and people on both sides of the aisle suggested. There are some \ndifferences between those ideas but, basically, they represent a way to \nmove forward to reduce health care costs. That is what we ought to do. \nWe don't do comprehensive very well in the Senate. Comprehensive \nimmigration failed of its own weight. Comprehensive economy-wide cap \nand trade seems to be failing, again of its own weight. Comprehensive \nhealth care is very difficult to pass. That shouldn't be a surprise to \nany of us. This is a very big, difficult, complicated country with \npeople of many different backgrounds and, in my judgment, we are just \nnot wise enough for a few of us to rewrite the rules for 17 percent of \nour economy.\n  I think the American people have tuned into that. They want us to fix \nhealth care, but they want us to reduce costs. Again, we on the \nRepublican side are ready to set that goal and, as we said 173 \ndifferent times on the Senate floor the last six months of last year, \nwe have offered 6 steps to move toward that goal. Maybe the President \ncan think of six more. Maybe we can think of six more. We did that with \nthe America COMPETES Act. We asked the national academies: What are the \n10 steps that can help us become more competitive as a country? They \ngave us 20, and we passed most of them. In clean energy, we are coming \ntogether on nuclear power, offshore drilling, and energy development. \nThose are steps toward a goal that would be a more sensible way for us \nto work.\n  In the meantime, the unpleasant truth is, the current bill being \nconsidered--will cut Medicare, not spend it on Medicare--will raise \ntaxes, and it will, as I have tried to demonstrate with respect to the \nPresident, raise individual premiums because of the one-size-fits-all \ngovernment mandates and tax increases.\n  Finally, I commend to my colleagues today's editorial from the Wall \nStreet Journal detailing how the Massachusetts health care plan has \nunexpectedly caused premiums to rise over the last couple years and \nwhat lesson there might be in that for us.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I now call up my amendment by number and \nurge its consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the amendment \nby number.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3336.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, Martin Luther King, Jr., once said:\n\n       Life's most urgent question is: What are you doing for \n     others?\n\n  Pretty much all of us came here to the Senate to work on that urgent \nquestion. Pretty much all of us came here to help other Americans.\n  On a number of levels, the legislation before us today is urgent \nlegislation. The legislation before us today is urgent because it would \nprevent millions of Americans from falling through the safety net.\n  The legislation before us is urgent because it would extend vital \nsafety net programs that expired yesterday.\n  The legislation before us is urgent because it would put cash in the \nhands of Americans who could spend it quickly, boosting economic \ndemand.\n  The legislation before us today is urgent because it would extend \ncritical programs and tax incentives that create jobs.\n  The legislation before us today is urgent because it is important \nthat we here can do this for other Americans.\n  Since the recession began, more than 7 million Americans have lost \ntheir jobs. The unemployment rate remains nearly 10 percent. For \nAmericans without a job, this great recession is a great depression. If \nyou do not have a job, it is a depression.\n  Last week, with a solid bipartisan vote, we passed legislation to \nhelp create jobs. We can and should do more, and by extending this \npackage of vital provisions we can do just that.\n  The provisions in this bill are important to American families. They \nare important to communities that have suffered a natural disaster. \nThey are important to businesses competing in the global economy. They \nare important to furthering America's commitment to energy \nindependence.\n  The need is urgent. Yesterday many of these important provisions \nexpired. Millions of Americans are being put at risk. The expiration of \nthese provisions has left gaping holes in the safety net.\n  Among the provisions that expired yesterday are these: expanded \nunemployment insurance benefits; COBRA subsidies to help people keep \ntheir health insurance; a provision that keeps folks right at the \npoverty line from losing their benefits; the small business loan \nprogram; the temporary measure to prevent a 21-percent cut to doctors \nunder Medicare; the Flood Insurance Program; the Satellite Home Viewer \nAct.\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\n  Unless we reinstate the programs in this bill, there will be real \nworld consequences for the people who depend on these programs today.\n  Take unemployment insurance. This bill would extend the program for \nexpanded unemployment benefits. These benefits expired on Sunday. The \nbill would extend what is called Federal emergency unemployment \ncompensation. This bill would extend 100 percent Federal extended \nbenefits. That is a program where State governments normally have to \npay 50 percent. We would also extend the additional $25 a week for each \nbeneficiary receiving unemployment benefits.\n  According to the National Employment Law Project, 5.6 million people \nare currently benefiting from one of the Federal unemployment benefits. \nMr. President, 5.6 million people today benefit. Between March and \nNovember of last year, we distributed nearly $8.3 billion in additional \nbenefits through the additional $25-a-week supplement.\n  For example, my office received word about one unemployed Montana \nworker who had been living in a homeless shelter for more than a month. \nThis Montanan used emergency unemployment compensation benefits to move \ncloser to an out-of-State relative. The relative helped the Montanan \nthrough this difficult time. With the help of emergency unemployment \ncompensation benefits and the help of family, this Montanan was able to \nfind work again.\n  Unemployment benefits also make good economic sense. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office estimates that every dollar spent on \nunemployment benefits generates up to $1.90 in additional gross \ndomestic product. That is $1 to $1.90. This makes unemployment benefits \none of the most cost-effective policies for stimulating the economy.\n  By helping our unemployment workers through this long recession, we \nhelp to keep the neighborhood gas station operating. We help to keep a \nhouse from foreclosure. And we help to keep our economy from further \ndamage.\n  We must act immediately to help the more than 1 million people who \nlost their benefits yesterday. My heart goes out to them and to their \nfamilies and hope that they can hold on while we work to clear up this \nmess, in order to clear this bill and bring them the help they deserve \nand on which they have been depending.\n  A second vital program in this bill that expired yesterday is a \nprogram that provides a tax benefit for COBRA health benefits. What is \nthat? That is the program that helps workers who lose their jobs to \nkeep their health insurance. When workers lose their jobs, they lose \nmore than just their paychecks. Unfortunately, they often lose their \nability to afford health care coverage as well.\n\n  Today, roughly 60 percent of the nonelderly population receives \nhealth insurance through their jobs. In most cases, unemployed workers \nhave the right to keep their work coverage for up to 18 months through \nthe COBRA program. But to receive COBRA health benefits, workers must \ntypically pay all of the premium costs, plus an additional 2 percent \nfor administrative costs; that is, they pay 102 percent. That is not \nright.\n  For a family of four, the average monthly COBRA premium is $1,100. \nFor most people out of work, that is simply unaffordable. How can a \nfamily who is out of work pay health benefits at a rate of $1,100 a \nmonth? They cannot do it.\n  The Recovery Act helped unemployed workers and their families to \ncover the costs. This assistance helped millions of unemployed workers \nand their families to maintain health insurance while they look for a \nnew job.\n  Unfortunately, COBRA assistance expired yesterday, and that is the \nprovision that gave a 65-percent subsidy. It expired yesterday. This \nmeans workers who lose their jobs today or afterwards will not be \neligible for COBRA assistance. They can still buy health insurance \nthrough the COBRA program if they can find the dollars to pay full \nfreight. That is 102 percent of their current premium. For many folks, \nthat is simply unaffordable. Unless we act, the ranks of those living \nin fear without health insurance will grow even more.\n  Third, without this legislation, physicians who treat our seniors and \nmilitary families will face an immediate 21-percent pay cut. That is \nright, an immediate 21-percent cut in pay. That is more than families \nlost in net worth during the worst of the recession in 2008, and that \nis nearly twice as much as home prices fell last year.\n  This cut would force doctors to stop seeing patients. This cut would \nmean less access to care for our parents and our grandparents. This cut \nwould mean our doctors would be forced to cut their own costs, \npotentially forcing them to lay off staff.\n  Thankfully, the administration announced on Friday it will use its \nexisting authority to delay the effect of this cut for the immediate \nfuture. But that is not going to last very long. We cannot delay action \nany longer. Seniors, military families, and physicians deserve better.\n  In Montana, 2,000 doctors serve 140,000 seniors who depend on \nMedicare for lifesaving health care. Montana has 32,000 military \nfamilies who should not be turned away from their doctor's door either. \nThey deserve access to the best health care we can give them. They \ndeserve a Congress willing to put politics aside and put them first.\n  This bill before us today will avert the 21-percent cut because of \nthe so-called sustainable growth rate. We adopt here another short-term \nstopgap. Next time, we hope and expect that we will come back to a \nlong-term solution. We must find one.\n  By exempting part of the SGR from the new statutory pay-go rules, the \nSenate recently recognized that a long-term solution will require a \nshort-term investment. The House followed suit. I hope this push will \naid us in finding a permanent solution for the sake of our seniors' \ncontinued access to medical care.\n  A fourth provision in this bill affects the 2009 poverty guidelines. \nWhy is this important? Let me tell you. Dozens of programs are \navailable to help lower income Americans. We all know the important \nrole these programs play in keeping those less fortunate fed, keeping \nthem healthy and safe. I am talking about programs such as Medicaid, \nthe Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program--formerly known as food \nstamps--the School Lunch Program, and the Low Income Home Emergency \nAssistance Program, otherwise known as LIHEAP.\n  Eligibility for these and many other programs is based on the Federal \npoverty guidelines. These guidelines are updated every year for \ninflation. But the update for this year, 2010, will cause people who \nare currently eligible for and benefiting from these programs to lose \ntheir eligibility. You may wonder why at a time of economic crisis \npoverty-based program eligibility would decrease. You might think that \nsounds counterintuitive.\n\n  One of the effects of the current economic crisis is that inflation \nwent down. That means the average cost of everyday things, such as \nclothes, transportation, and rent, is less than it was the year before. \nHowever, because the Federal poverty guidelines are based on the \naverage cost of everyday goods, the poverty level for 2010 would be \nless than it was for 2009. This is the first time in the history of the \nguidelines that such a decrease would occur. That, clearly, is not the \nright outcome. We should not make fewer people eligible for poverty-\nbased programs at precisely the time when those safety-net programs are \nserving the very purpose for which they were created. Safety-net \nprograms are there to help people when times are tough. That is their \npurpose. But there is a simple solution: we can simply leave the \nguidelines developed for 2009 in place. That way, people who were \neligible can remain eligible. Leaving the 2009 guidelines in place \nwould mean people would not lose their health care by being kicked off \nof Medicaid. It would mean families would not go hungry because they \nlost their eligibility for a number of nutrition programs. It would \nmean low-income folks could still heat their homes this cold and snowy \nwinter thanks to LIHEAP. Keeping the 2009 guidelines in place would not \nincrease eligibility. It would mean we would avoid pulling the safety \nnet out from under the people it is there to protect.\n  Fifth, for individuals and families, this bill provides much needed \ntax relief in a time of economic uncertainty. For example, many \nstudents don't have the books or supplies they need. Some\n\n[[Page S838]]\n\nteachers have to buy classroom supplies using money from their own \npockets, if you can believe it. This bill extends the expense deduction \nfor teachers buying school supplies for their classrooms. It extends \nthe qualified tuition deduction to help with college costs. The bill \nprovides much needed relief to families who have suffered from natural \ndisasters. It extends a package of disaster relief provisions developed \nto address all federally declared disaster areas with immediate, \nreliable, and robust tax relief.\n  It extends important business provisions to help create jobs and make \nour companies competitive in a global economy. America counts for one-\nthird of the world's investment in scientific research and development. \nWe rank first among all countries, but relative to the size of our \neconomy, America is in sixth place. The trends show that maintaining \nAmerican leadership in the future depends on an increased commitment to \nscience and research. Yet our R tax credit expired at the end of last \nyear. This will put American corporations at a competitive \ndisadvantage. Corporations are unsure if they will be able to obtain \nthe R credit next year, and they need to plan for the future.\n  American financial services companies successfully compete in world \nfinancial markets. We need to make sure the U.S. tax rules do not \nchange that. This legislation extends the active financing exception to \nsubpart F. In so doing, it preserves the international competitiveness \nof American-based financial services companies, while including \nsafeguards to ensure that only truly active businesses benefit. This \nprovision will put the American financial services industry on an equal \nfooting with foreign-based competitors that are not taxed on active \nfinancial services income.\n  Several energy tax incentives also expired at the end of last year. \nThis bill extends those incentives to encourage continued investment in \ntechnologies that promote energy independence. For example, the bill \nextends incentives for new hybrid battery technology and the \nconstruction of new energy-efficient homes.\n  Sixth, in addition to these important provisions that provide direct \nassistance and job creation, the bill includes other proposals that \nwill provide relief for businesses and individuals. One such provision \nis pension funding relief. These days, American employers are faced \nwith the need to make higher pension contributions. Several factors \nhave combined to require these higher contributions: There is the \nfunding changes of the Pension Protection Act of 2006, there is the \nslide in the stock market in 2008, and then there is the ensuing great \nrecession. These requirements for higher contributions are coming upon \nemployers just when they are facing lower asset values and lower cash \nflow. Meeting these requirements could divert resources employers could \nuse to keep workers on the payroll.\n  We addressed this bind temporarily in the Worker, Retiree and \nEmployer Recovery Act of 2008, but employers are still facing the \nprospect of closing plants and stores. Employers are still faced with \nthe possibility of terminating workers in order to make up for lost \nasset values. The bill contains additional temporary, targeted, and \nappropriate relief for these employers. At the same time, the bill \nstill maintains the pension and security system.\n  Seventh, this bill would also extend several important health \nprovisions that expired at the end of 2009. Notable among these is the \nexceptions process for Medicare therapy caps. Extending this provision \nwill help ensure Medicare beneficiaries will continue to receive access \nto the therapy services they need. Several rural policies are also \nextended.\n  Eighth, these tough economic times have hit the States hard as well. \nSo included in this bill is a 6-month extension of the additional \nFederal financial assistance for State Medicaid Programs. This will \nallow States to plan for their next fiscal year with the certainty of \ncontinued help from the Federal Government. Additional Federal Medicaid \nmatch money--known as FMAP--helps the economy grow. According to \neconomist Mark Zandi, this funding has return on investment of about \n$1.40 for every dollar invested. The Nation's Governors have repeatedly \nasked for an extension of this Federal assistance, and this bill \nanswers their pleas.\n  With so many Americans out of work, our country needs Congress to \nenact this legislation. This bill continues valuable tax incentives to \nfamilies and businesses that will help them in these difficult economic \ntimes. The bill sustains vital safety-net programs that will also help \nfoster economic growth.\n  As I said at the outset, this is not just ordinary legislation; this \nis urgent legislation. It would prevent millions of Americans from \nfalling through the safety net. It would extend vital programs that \nexpired yesterday--expired yesterday. It would put cash in the hands of \nAmericans who would spend it quickly, boosting economic demand. It \nwould extend critical programs and tax incentives that create jobs. It \nis an important bill that we here can do for other Americans. So let's \nhelp America's businesses to create more jobs. Let's join to work \nacross the aisle on this commonsense legislation, and let's enact these \ntax incentives and safety-net provisions into law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield myself such time as I might consume. Maybe I \nbetter ask, are we under a time agreement?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is no time limit.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, the Senate starts debate on \nexpiring tax and health provisions, for people outside Washington. \nAround here, those tax provisions are generally referred to with the \nword ``extenders.'' But before I discuss the bill before us, I would \nlike to make a couple points on the process, before I get into the \nsubstance of the substitute before the Senate. What I find surprising \nis, we are taking up a package that, similar to last week's exercise, \nabsolutely belongs to the Senate Democratic leadership; that is to say, \nwe are not taking up a bipartisan package that I put together with my \nfriend, Finance Committee Chairman Baucus.\n  To be sure, some of the structure reflects the agreement I have with \nSenator Baucus, but this package is almost three times the size of the \npackage we agreed upon. Virtually all the additional cost is due to \nproposals I would not have agreed to in representing the people of Iowa \nor the Republican conference.\n  I was under the impression the Senate Democratic leadership was \ngenuine in its desire to work on a bipartisan basis, but clearly I was \nmistaken. Although the Senate Democratic leadership was highly involved \nin the development of that original bipartisan bill, they arbitrarily \ndecided to replace it with a bill that skews toward their liberal wing. \nSo my first comment to my colleagues, also to the media and to the \nentire Nation, is: Don't let this package be mislabeled as the Baucus-\nGrassley package. It is not the package my friend, Chairman Baucus, and \nI negotiated. Again, the package before the Senate dramatically differs \nin cost, balance, and dramatically is different in intent from the \nBaucus-Grassley compromise announced on February 12.\n  My second preliminary comment goes to the way in which these expiring \ntax provisions have been described by many on the other side, including \nthose in the Democratic leadership. If you roll the videotape back a \nweek or so, you would hear a lot of disparaging comments about these \nroutine, bipartisan extenders. From my perspective, those comments were \nmade in an effort to sully the bipartisan agreement reached by Chairman \nBaucus and this Senator. If you take a look at newspaper accounts of a \nweek or so ago, you come away with the impression that the tax \nextenders are partisan work of Republicans and only for Republican \ninterests. A representative sample comes from one report which \ndescribes the bipartisan bill as:\n\n       . . . an extension of soon-to-expire tax breaks that are \n     highly beneficial to major corporations, known as tax \n     extenders, as well as other corporate giveaways that had been \n     designed to win GOP support.\n\n\n[[Page S839]]\n\n\n  The Washington Post included this attribution to the Senate \nDemocratic leadership in an article last week:\n\n       \"We're pretty close,'' [the majority leader] said Friday \n     during a television appearance in Nevada, adding that he \n     thought, `fat cats' would have benefited too much from the \n     larger Baucus-Grassley bill.''\n\n  That quote happens to be from the majority leader.\n  The portrait that was painted by certain members of the majority and \nwas echoed without critical examination--and in some press reports was \noutright inaccurate. For one thing, the tax extenders included \nprovisions such as deductions for qualified tuition and related \nexpenses and also the deduction for certain expenses for elementary and \nsecondary schoolteachers. If you are going to college or if you are a \ngrade school teacher, the Senate Democratic leadership apparently views \nyou as a fat cat. If your house was destroyed in a recent natural \ndisaster and you still need any of the temporary disaster relief \nprovisions contained in the extenders package, too bad because helping \nyou would amount to a corporate giveaway in the eyes of some. Such \ndistortion of the extenders--some of them have been on the books for a \nlong period of time; some of them passing this body by consensus--\nbelittles helping some people who have needs.\n  Again, I wish to say the tax extenders have been routinely passed \nrepeatedly because they are bipartisan and, frankly, very popular. \nDemocrats have consistently voted in favor of extending these tax \nprovisions. Let me tell you what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released \nrecently, a very strong statement when the House passed these very same \ntax extenders at the end of last year saying this was ``good for \nbusiness, good for homeowners, and good for our community.''\n  That was December of 2009, not very long ago.\n  In 2006, the then Democratic leader released a blistering statement \n``after Bush Republicans in the Senate blocked passage of critical tax \nextenders American families and businesses are paying the price because \nthis Do Nothing Republican Congress refuses to extend important tax \nbreaks.''\n  Recent bipartisan votes in the Senate extending bipartisan tax \nprovisions had come in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 \nand the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006. By the way, that passed \nthe Senate by unanimous consent. Then we had the Working Family Tax \nRelief Act of 2004, which originally passed the Senate by voice vote, \nalthough the conference report only received 92 votes in favor and a \nwhopping 3 against it.\n  Let me give what the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service has \nto say about the history of these extenders which are now before us, \nwhich should have been passed in December. They have been consistently \nwidely supported because they mention the Tax Relief Extension Act of \n1999, which passed the Senate by unanimous consent and one vote against \nit on the conference report. One Member on the other side said:\n\n       Our side isn't sure that the Republicans are real \n     interested in developing good policy and to move forward \n     together. Instead, they are more inclined to play rope-a-dope \n     again. My own view is, let's test them.\n\n  So we are testing each other when we are talking about merely \nreimposing some policy that has been on the books for a long period of \ntime and just happens to sunset, to force some review by Congress.\n  We had another Member of this large 59-vote majority exclaim:\n\n       It looks more like a tax bill than a jobs bill to me. What \n     the Democratic caucus is going to put on the floor is \n     something that's more focused on job creation than tax \n     breaks.\n\n  Reading these comments, I found myself obviously scratching my head. \nThe only explanation for this behavior is, certain Senators decided \nlast week it serves a deeply partisan goal to slander what had been for \nseveral years bipartisan and popular tax provisions benefiting many \ndifferent people.\n  The Washington Post article I quoted from earlier includes a \nstatement from a Democratic Senate leadership aide saying that ``no \ndecisions have been made, but anyone expecting us immediately to go \nback to a bill that includes tax extenders will be sorely \ndisappointed.''\n  You can imagine that, today, a little over a week after these \ncomments, I scratch my head, once again. We have before us the expiring \ntax and health provisions that were disparaged just a short time ago. \nHave they morphed from corporate tax pork? Have they suddenly \nreacquired their bipartisan character? Are these time-sensitive items, \nnow expired for more than 2 months, suddenly jobs related?\n  We are beginning another debate, a jobs bill debate. So I wanted to \nfocus on the economy, small business, and jobs after giving you that \npartisanship that should not have existed a week ago, to explain that \nit existed and not much has changed since then, but all of a sudden \nthere is some idea of being bipartisan.\n  So we are going to talk about the substance of this bill. We all \nagree our Nation is currently facing challenging economic times. While \nthere have been some signs of improvement such as the recent growth in \nour gross domestic product, job losses continue to mount and many hard-\nworking Americans are struggling to make ends meet.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 8 million jobs have \nbeen lost since our economy officially slipped into recession in \nDecember 2007. The unemployment rate is currently 9.7 percent, which is \nsimply an unacceptable level. The lack of job creation continues \ndespite aggressive action taken at the Federal level in order to \nstabilize the economy.\n  This includes the enactment of TARP and the $800 billion stimulus \nbill. However, these bills were all missing a critical ingredient for \nspurring job creation, and that was substantial tax relief targeted to \nsmall business.\n  Everybody knows small business is where the jobs are created in \nAmerica; 70 percent of the net new jobs. In October 2008, Congress \nenacted the Troubled Asset Relief Program that we all call TARP around \nhere, T-A-R-P. That was a $700 billion financial bailout bill that we \nwere told had to be enacted immediately in order to deal with the so-\ncalled toxic assets to keep credit from drying up, which would have \nchoked off the lifeblood of the American economy.\n  What we actually got--because we sure did not take out these toxic \nassets. So what we actually got was direct infusion of cash into the \nlargest Wall Street banks, which was 180 degrees different than what we \nwere told by Treasury before that bill was voted on, and the purpose of \nthat bill as well. Later came the bailout of General Motors and \nChrysler using TARP money after the Senate had just voted not to bail \nout GM and Chrysler.\n  This inconsistent policy by Treasury created uncertainty in the \nfinancial markets and the business community. Moreover, exorbitant \nbonuses were paid to executives and the management of firms that would \nhave been out of a job if not for Congress and Treasury and the Federal \nReserve intervening.\n  How effective was the bailout in improving the credit markets? In \nOctober 2009, the Government Accountability Office released a report \nreviewing TARP's first-year performance. The GAO report found credit \nhad improved based on certain market indicators. However, they were not \nable to determine how much, if any, was attributed to TARP as compared \nto general market forces or other Federal action.\n  While it is unclear the extent credit has been freed up as a result \nof TARP, it is clear who has reaped the benefits of those programs. \nThis past year, many financial firms, including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan \nChase, and others who received TARP funds, posted record or near-record \nprofits.\n  While Wall Street executives have clearly benefitted form TARP, small \nbusinesses and their employers have not been that fortunate. Small \nbusinesses continue to struggle to obtain credit in order to expand \ntheir operations, purchase inventories, and even make payroll. The so-\ncalled stimulus bill, enacted almost solely by an overwhelming \nDemocratic majority in Congress last February, has not spurred job \ncreation either.\n  This massive $800 billion spending bill was hastily rushed to the \nfloor of the Senate with little time to deliberate its merit. Lawrence \nSummers, the Director of President Obama's National Economic Council, \nsaid:\n\n       The test for the stimulus is whether it is timely, \n     targeted, and temporary.\n\n\n[[Page S840]]\n\n\n  This stimulus bill hit the trifecta. It has failed in all three. \nThrough a report issued in January 2009 by the current Chair of \nPresident Obama's Council of Economic Advisors, Christine Roemer, the \nadministration predicted that the stimulus would save or create 3 \nmillion jobs. We were told by the Obama administration that if the bill \nwas not passed quickly we would experience unemployment of 9 percent.\n  At this point we have a chart. The middle line, where it says 9 \npercent, the White House projected unemployment at 9 percent with no \nstimulus. However, we were also told by the Obama administration that \nif the stimulus bill passed, unemployment would not go over 8 percent, \nand that would be the bottom line.\n  Well, the bill was passed. But what did we get for $800 billion of \ndebt before interest that was laid at the feet of our children and our \ngrandchildren? The unemployment rate jumped from 7.7 percent in January \nright before the stimulus was enacted, to a high of 10.1 percent in \nOctober.\n  While unemployment recently dipped slightly to 9.7 percent--you can \nsee that is the red line at the top--this was not due to job creation \nbut because millions of individuals have literally given up looking for \nwork and obviously do not show up in the unemployment statistics.\n  The Obama administration also stated that ``more than 90 percent of \nthe jobs created are likely to be in the private sector.''\n  In all, 3.3 million jobs have been lost since the stimulus bill was \nenacted. That is 3.3 million compared to the 3.7 million the President \nsaid. Of course, 3.2 million of those jobs were in the private sector.\n  In summary, the Obama administration was terribly inaccurate \nregarding its stimulus jobs projection. At the time the stimulus bill \nwas passed, I raised concerns that the bill was not targeted enough at \nsmall businesses and job creation. However, my point of view lost out \nand less than one-half of 1 percent of the bill included tax relief for \nsmall business.\n  The money in the stimulus bill gave tax credits to people who buy \nelectric plug-in golf carts or to pay for rattle-snake husbandry in \nOregon, among other ill-advised provisions, which would have been \nbetter allocated to small business tax relief, the place where \nemployment starts. Since the stimulus, small businesses have been \nbearing the brunt of job losses in our economy. However, the words of \nthose on the other side regarding the importance of small business job \ncreation do not match their action when looking at the paltry amount of \nsmall business tax relief being provided.\n  Again, in the jobs bill, or stimulus bill, or whatever you want to \ncall it that passed the Senate last week, there was only one provision \ndirected solely to small business tax relief. That was a provision I \nsupported which increased expensing of equipment purchased by small \nbusinesses. But it is a very small provision. It only gave small \nbusinesses what they have already been getting for the last couple of \nyears, just extending it; in other words, just extending that figure. \nThat provision was only $35 million out of $62 billion, the $15 billion \nthat everyone talks about, plus the $47 billion for the highway trust \nfund that is typically not mentioned.\n  Last year, I introduced S. 1381, the Small Business Tax Relief Act. \nMy bill would double the amount of equipment that small businesses \ncould expense and would make those higher levels permanent instead of \njust for 1 year, as the Reid bill did.\n  In my negotiations on the jobs bill, I sought to include provisions \nfor my small business tax relief bill. But there was no agreement to \nput small business tax relief provisions for my bill in the bipartisan \ncompromise that we reached. Instead, we were asked to defer those \nprovisions to a future tax bill.\n  According to ADP, national employment data from January 2009 through \nJanuary 2010, small businesses with fewer than 500 employees saw \nemployment decline by 2.67 million jobs, while large businesses with \n500 or more employees saw employment decline by 694,000.\n  While I am sure many of us disagree about the effectiveness of the \nfinancial bailout and stimulus spending in getting our economy back on \ntrack, I know for sure that we all agree there has been a lack of job \ncreation and too many people continue to be unemployed. Because the \nstimulus bill has so clearly failed in what it was supposed to do, \nwhich was to create jobs, and the administration and the congressional \nDemocratic leadership are running away from the word ``stimulus'' \nfaster than the Triple Crown winning horse Secretariat. Everything \nproposed now is called a ``jobs bill'' even if it includes proposals \nthat were always labeled ``stimulus'' in the past.\n  Only 6 percent of Americans believe the stimulus bill created jobs. \nThat is less than the 7 percent of Americans who believe that Elvis is \nstill alive. Last week, the Senate passed a bill that included \nprovisions designed to increase hiring. This includes a payroll tax \nholiday for businesses that hire unemployed workers and a tax credit \nfor the retention of newly hired individuals throughout all of 2010.\n  The payroll tax holiday part of this proposal is likely to spark some \nmodest hiring at businesses at the margins among those who have seen \nsome improvement in their business but are on the fence about whether \nto hire somebody now or wait a while. However, many businesses continue \nto struggle and will not hire new employees just because it is the \nstated policy goal of Congress.\n  Before a business can hire a new employee, they need to know that new \nemployee will generate additional revenue that exceeds the cost of the \nemployee. The latest survey of the Small Business Economic Trends--and \nthat is produced by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, \nor NFIB, as we know it--shows that many small businesses may not be in \na place that they can afford to hire new employees even with the \nprovisions of that bill passing the Senate last week called the Payroll \nTax Holiday.\n  I have a chart from the National Federation of Independent Businesses \nto which I now want to refer. That chart has selected components from \nthe Small Business Optimism Index. While many components of this index \nimproved slightly from December, it is clear that small businesses \ncontinue to struggle. You will see from the chart a net negative 1 \npercent of owners who plan to create new jobs in the next 3 months. You \nwill see on the chart a net positive of only 1 percent of business \nowners expect the economy to improve. Only 4 percent of business owners \nsaid it was a good time to expand, and a net negative 42 percent of \nowners reported higher earnings.\n  This last component is especially important for businesses when it \ncomes to hiring new employees. If earnings are declining, there is \nlittle a payroll holiday will do to spark hiring since businesses need \nto know that the revenue generated by the additional employees will \nexceed the cost, not just today but in the future.\n  Before I go on to this NFIB survey, at the grassroots of my State, I \nhad the opportunity the previous weekend to spend part of a Friday and \npart of a Sunday afternoon in what is called the Des Moines Home and \nGarden Show which has probably been around for 30 years or so, that one \nweekend a year. On the Saturday in between, I had an opportunity to \nattend a like show called the Home Improvement Show in Waterloo. You \nwalk around and talk to vendors, small business people. You kind of \nlook at what do they expect Congress to do about creating jobs. I never \ngot anything positive about something we might do, but I got a lot of \nideas that they want us to do that said: You have to give us some \ncertainty.\n  Do you know what they quoted. They quoted the big tax increase coming \nup at the end of this year as some of that uncertainty. They quoted the \ncap-and-trade tax that possibly could pass the Senate. Then they quoted \nthe potential cost to small business because of the health care reform \nbill. They said: Take all of those potential things out of the picture, \nand we will start hiring. But it is the uncertainty that is out there \nof what Congress is going to do to us that is keeping us from hiring \npeople.\n  I want to go back to the NFIB survey. When businesses are asked what \nthe single most important problem facing their business is, the answer \nis lack of sales. That is in addition to the uncertainty I related. But \nthis is closely\n\n[[Page S841]]\n\nfollowed by what I did say, taxes, and then government regulation, and \nredtape. I am glad my colleagues on the other side have recognized that \ntrue job creation comes through the private sector and have thus sought \nhiring incentives through payroll tax relief.\n  However, this minor tax relief is a drop in the bucket considering \nthe challenges small businesses face due to the economy and proposed \nincreased taxes and redtape included in the President's budget. Whether \nwe are speaking about cap and trade that will drastically increase \nenergy costs, health care reform that would mandate small businesses \noffer health benefits that will increase the cost of labor, or the call \nfor tax increases on so-called wealthy taxpayers earning over $200,000 \nthat will largely fall on the backs of small businesses, if our \nintention is to increase long-term employment, the last thing we should \nbe doing at this time of economic uncertainty is to increase taxes and \nplace additional burdens on those who are responsible for creating 70 \npercent of the jobs in our economy; namely, small business.\n  Providing small businesses a payroll tax holiday while intending to \nimpose increased taxes, regulations, and mandates amounts to throwing \nthem a few peanuts while taking away their supper. In recent months, I \nhave spoken at length about the impact of tax increases set to kick in \n10 months from today. I have examined the impact of these tax increases \non small businesses. I think Members ought to take a closer look at it \nbefore we actually enact big tax hikes.\n  The President and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nproposed increasing the two marginal tax rates from 33 and 35 percent \nto 36 and 39.6 percent, respectively; increasing the tax rates on \ncapital gains and dividends to 20 percent, fully reinstating the \npersonal exemption phaseout for those making over $200,000, and fully \nreinstating the limitation on itemized deductions for those making more \nthan $200,000.\n  With these two provisions fully reinstated, the individuals in the \ntop two rates could see their marginal tax rates increase over 15 \npercent or more. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle respond \nthat these proposals will only hit ``wealthy individuals'' and only a \nsmall percentage of small businesses fall into this category. I have \nbeen trying to tell them for 3 or 4 years that what they want to talk \nabout, the small percentage of small businesses falling into that \ncategory--I will not convince them, because I don't know what they are \nreading--is wrong. Because small business is going to be hit very \ndefinitely by these increases. What my colleagues fail to understand is \nthat the small businesses that fit into this group are not static but \nconsist of different businesses over time that go in and out of the top \ntwo tax brackets depending on the market.\n  Data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, which is a nonpartisan \nofficial congressional scorekeeper on tax issues, shows that 44 percent \nof the flowthrough business income will be hit with the increase in the \ntop two tax rates proposed by the President. This hits small businesses \nparticularly hard since most small businesses are organized as \nflowthrough entities. It will increase taxes on single small business \nowners who make more than $200,000 per year, even if they plow all of \ntheir income back into their small business to keep paying their \nworkers and hire additional workers. Increasing taxes on this group \npunishes their success and limits their ability to reinvest in their \ncompany. It prevents them from putting away funds for tough economic \ntimes to keep their business afloat.\n  Government is currently creating a climate of uncertainty where the \nprivate sector does not know what we will do next, what taxes will be \nraised, and what regulatory barriers will be put in their way. We can \nstart to put some certainty back into the business world by declaring \nwe will not increase taxes on businesses 1 dime, by making the 2001 and \n2003 bipartisan tax measures permanent.\n  Let me be clear: Businesses do not want to be certain that the \ngovernment is going to raise their taxes and make them go up through \nmore redtape. They want to be certain that it is not going to happen. \nUntil then, many will simply sit on the sidelines and not hire more \nworkers, as I reported from my weekend before last at a couple affairs \nin the State of Iowa.\n  Moreover, we can directly provide targeted relief to small \nbusinesses. Last June, I proposed legislation to do that. I introduced \nthe Small Business Tax Relief Act to lower taxes on job-creating small \nbusinesses. Since the Democratic leadership barred any amendments last \nweek, I am hopeful we will debate and vote on an amendment offered by \nSenator Thune. Many provisions in my bill are contained in the Thune \nbill. My bill contains a number of provisions that will leave more \nmoney in the hands of small businesses so they can hire more, continue \nto pay the salaries of their current employees, and make additional \ninvestments. This includes allowing flowthrough small businesses, \npartnerships, S corporations, LLCs, and sole partnerships to deduct 20 \npercent of their income, effectively reducing their taxes by 20 \npercent. My bill also includes tax relief for small business owners \nfrom the unfair alternative minimum tax. It takes general business \ncredits, such as the employer-provided childcare credit, out of the \nalternative minimum tax. This would allow a mom-and-pop retail store \nthat provides childcare for its employees to get the same tax relief a \nFortune 500 company gets when it provides childcare for its employees.\n  My bill would also allow more than nearly 2 million small C \ncorporations to benefit from the lower tax rates for the smallest C \ncorporations. There are so many small C corporations because they were \nformed as C corporations before other entities such as LLCs became more \nwidely used.\n  Among other provisions, my bill would also lower the potential tax \nburden on small C corporations that convert to S corporations.\n  The NFIB has written a letter supporting my small business tax relief \nbill, stating:\n\n       To get the small business economy moving again, small \n     businesses need the tools and incentives to expand and grow \n     their businesses. S. 1381 provides the kind of tools and \n     incentives that small business needs.\n\n  I want to talk about an opportunity for true bipartisanship that was \nkilled by the Democratic leadership. The same day Chairman Baucus and I \nreleased a bipartisan bill that contained significant compromises, \nbehind closed doors the Democratic leadership cherry-picked four \nprovisions out of the larger bill Chairman Baucus and I agreed to. \nThose provisions had been agreed to in a meeting of senior Members of \nthe other side only while Chairman Baucus and I were negotiating. I was \nextremely disappointed to see the Democratic leadership blow up the \nbipartisan deal Chairman Baucus and I reached. To pour a little salt \ninto the wound, the Democratic leadership then prohibited any Senator \non either side of the aisle from even offering an amendment to improve \na bill that he hijacked. One of the four provisions the Democratic \nleaders cherry-picked is Build America Bonds. If it had been just me \ndrafting the bill, I wouldn't have included this provision. However, \nfor the sake of bipartisanship and compromise in the context of a much \nlarger bill, I reluctantly agreed that putting this provision in the \nbill would not cause the overall bill to lose my support. Build America \nBonds is a very rich spending program disguised as tax cuts. Bloomberg \nreported that large Wall Street investment banks have been charging 37 \npercent higher underwriting fees on Build America Bonds deals than on \nother deals. Therefore, American taxpayers appear to be funding huge \nunderwriting fees for large Wall Street investment banks as part of the \nBuild America Bonds program.\n\n  Democratic leadership has said the Build America Bonds program is \nabout creating jobs. I wanted to know whether it is about lining the \npockets of Wall Street executives. So last week I asked the Goldman \nSachs CEO a number of questions about these much larger underwriting \nfees subsidized by American taxpayers. I expect to have that discussion \nshortly.\n  Turning back to the bill being debated this week, the Thune \namendment, which incorporates many of the provisions from my small \nbusiness tax relief bill, provides substantial small business tax \nrelief and should be adopted.\n  In this bill, I hope we can all work toward improving our economy, \nnot through more government but by letting the engine of job creation, \nmeaning small business, keep more of its\n\n[[Page S842]]\n\nown money in the form of substantial small business tax relief.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Democratic whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. First, let me serve notice on the Republican side that I \nwill be making a unanimous consent request about the extension of \nunemployment benefits so that Senator Bunning or someone else on his \nbehalf will be on the floor if they care to object.\n  Let me say, before my friend from Iowa leaves the floor, one of the \nreasons we can't get to the issues you want is because we are in the \nmidst of a filibuster by the Senator from Kentucky who has stopped us \nfrom extending unemployment benefits, COBRA benefits for 30 days. As I \nunderstand it, that filibuster now applies to a noncontroversial \njudicial nominee. So we have multiple filibusters holding us back from \nconsidering some of the measures you mentioned. I might say, some of \nthem I find appealing and hope we can make them part of the package. \nThe reason why your initial agreement with Senator Baucus met some \nresistance on our side of the aisle is that we thought there was a lack \nof balance. Although I support the tax extenders being extended for the \nremainder of the year in your initial agreement with Senator Baucus, \nthe extension of unemployment benefits and COBRA was only for a few \nmonths. We felt that both should be extended until the end of the year. \nI hope we can reach that agreement when we come back to the amendment \nthat is pending before us, as soon as the filibusters that have been \ninitiated by the Senator from Kentucky are completed.\n  Let me say a word about those filibusters. We tried last week to \nextend for 30 days unemployment benefits that would run out across \nAmerica, starting literally at midnight last night. There was one \nobjection from Senator Bunning from Kentucky; he objected to extending \nunemployment benefits and COBRA benefits. The net result of this one \nSenator's objection is to put us into a procedural process that could \nliterally take days.\n\n  What happens to the people who were on unemployment during that \nperiod of time? They are cut off. Fifteen thousand people on \nunemployment in Illinois last night were cut off because of the Senator \nfrom Kentucky, and roughly 400,000 nationwide have seen their \nunemployment benefits cut off.\n  I met two of those people in Chicago yesterday. They have been \nunemployed for extended periods of time, and they have been spending \nliterally every day trying to find a job. One of them has a little 3-\nyear-old daughter. I asked him: What is going to happen now that you do \nnot have your unemployment check?\n  He said: I don't know. The first thing I will do is default on my \nstudent loan. I will have to do that. I can't make my payment if I want \nto put food on the table.\n  So there are real-life consequences to your objection, and the real-\nlife consequences are being visited on innocent people who, through no \nfault of their own, lost their job and cannot find one in an economy \nwhere we have five unemployed people for every job available.\n  In your State of Kentucky, my State of Illinois, and virtually every \nother State, these people are struggling. Some of them have reached the \nend of the rope. They are making decisions you and I would never want \nto face about whether they are going to have to give up a home--\nliterally give up a home. And it could happen.\n  It is great to have a political debate in the Senate. We should. That \nis what the Senate is supposed to be about. But when the victims in the \nmiddle of the debate are unemployed people, I do not think that is \nfair. I do not think it is fundamentally fair. These people are \ntrying--this one young man, David Seanior, showed me a list of 300 \napplications he had made to try to find a job during the last year. He \nsaid: I go online every day. This is a man who had worked for years, \nhad a strong work record, until he was laid off. He said: I just can't \nfind anything. I am desperate. I am trying everything I can think of, \nand now you are going to cut off my unemployment benefits.\n  Frankly, we came to the Senate floor last Thursday night to urge the \nSenator from Kentucky to reconsider his objection. The net result of \nthis is going to create hardship all across America, and it gets worse \nby the day. We estimate that roughly 2,000 more people tonight will \nlose their unemployment benefits in Illinois. So by next Sunday, \ninstead of 15,000 losing their checks, it will be up to nearly 30,000. \nBy the end of March, the total is estimated to be 65,000 people who \nwill lose their unemployment checks because of the objection of Senator \nBunning of Kentucky and this initiation of a filibuster.\n  I do not think that is what we should do. This is an economic \nemergency facing this Nation. It is not the first time Senator Bunning \nhas been asked to extend unemployment benefits that were not paid for. \nSee, that is his issue: You are not paying for the unemployment \nbenefits. You should not extend it.\n  Senator Bunning voted for the fiscal year 2008 war supplemental bill \nwhich extended unemployment insurance benefits for 13 weeks. He also \nsupported ending debate and did not object to the voice vote of a \nmeasure to extend unemployment benefits for an additional 7 weeks for \nworkers who exhausted their current compensation by March 31, 2009. \nThat bill also extended benefits for an additional 13 weeks--half the \nduration of regular unemployment compensation--for workers in States \nwith unemployment rates of 6 percent or higher. Neither of the \nextensions he voted for--one in a record vote and one by voice vote--\nhad any budget offsets. So to argue that now we are taking a stand on \nprinciple, the fact is, twice, at least--I do not know if there were \nmore times--the Senator has reached an opposite conclusion and agreed \nwith the majority, the bipartisan majority, that we were truly in an \neconomic emergency.\n  There is one other aspect of this which is troubling, and that is the \nfirst casualty of most people who are unemployed is health insurance. \nThe employer is not paying it any longer. If you want to continue \nhealth insurance, COBRA lets you pay for it all, and it is too \nexpensive--roughly $1,300 a month for health insurance for a family in \nmy State of Illinois, and the unemployment compensation is about $1,100 \na month. So do the math and understand that most people cannot do it.\n  So President Obama said, as part of our effort to turn this economy \naround, we will help people pay for their health insurance through \nCOBRA. We will pay I believe the figure is 65 percent of the premiums \nso people will be paying one-third of their health insurance premiums \nwhen they have lost a job--still a substantial sum of money: $300 or \n$400 they would have to pay each month. But imagine if you had a sick \nchild at home, and imagine that child needed at least the possibility \nof coverage should they be hospitalized for diabetes or cancer or \nwhatever the cause may be. If you get a gap in coverage and you lose \nyour health insurance because you cannot afford to make the payment, \nyou could find yourself in a predicament where you not only do not have \nhealth insurance but the prospect of buying additional health insurance \nis next to zero.\n  Senator Bunning's objection cut off this benefit, this 65-percent \nbenefit on health insurance. We have tried to extend it for 30 days. So \nthat means these people will not only lose their unemployment check, \nthey will lose this help with their COBRA benefit.\n  I have been, once in my life, in a predicament being a father with a \nsick child and no health insurance. Mr. President, I want to tell you, \nif there is something that tears you apart as a dad, it is going into a \nhospital with no health insurance with a sick baby. I have been there. \nI have done that. Thank God it happened years ago and my little girl \nmade it through that episode.\n  But we are forcing literally hundreds of thousands of Americans into \nthis situation because of the objection and the filibuster of one \nSenator from Kentucky. That is unfair--not only unfortunate but unfair. \nIf we are going to fight a battle over our budget deficit and get \ninvolved in lengthy debates, as we can, there are plenty of chances to \ndo it. We will have a budget resolution in just a few months. We will \nhave a score--at least a dozen--of appropriations bills to fight this \nbattle over, and I think the battle can be joined.\n  We said to the Senator from Kentucky: If you want to offer an \namendment to pay for the unemployment\n\n[[Page S843]]\n\nbenefits and the COBRA benefits, you are entitled to offer that \namendment. You are entitled to come to the Senate floor, express your \npoint of view on how this should be paid for, and to accept the will of \nthe Senate. Let them vote on your amendment. If they agree with you, \nfine. If they disagree, it will be a matter of public record. You will \nhave your day on the floor of the Senate, which is about the best most \nof us could hope for in this job.\n  But the Senator from Kentucky said: No, I am not going to do it \nbecause I might lose. Well, yes, you might win and you might lose, and \nthat is what we all face when we come forward with an idea on how to \ndeal with the budget deficit. I do not think it is fair to insist that \nit is my way or the highway when it comes to something as basic as \nunemployment benefits and health care for the people who are unemployed \nacross America.\n  As I visit these unemployment offices and meet with these people, I \nfind a lot of determined folks whom you would think would have given up \na heck of a long time ago still trying. They consider it a victory if \nat the end of the day one of the posted jobs on the Internet leads to \nan interview. They are that desperate. Yet we are saying to them: We \nare going to cut off the money you need to feed your family in an \neffort to make a point about deficit reduction. That, I think, is \nunfortunate.\n  We have asked for an extension of unemployments benefits repeatedly \nbecause we are in the worst shape in our economy in 75 years, and a lot \nof people are struggling to make ends meet. I know there are those who \nargue that at some point we have to cut off these unemployment \nbenefits. But I would ask them to consider this as well: Unemployment \nassistance is the most direct infusion of money into the economy. Those \nwho are economists tell us the first dollar you give in \nunemployment assistance is going to be spent immediately. It is not \ngoing to be banked, saved, or invested. These folks need it, and they \nwill spend it the day after they get it, for obvious needs, and that \ncreates more economic activity.\n\n  So you are not only doing the right thing that a caring nation does \nwhen so many of us are facing hard times, it is an economic stimulus--\nNo. 1, incidentally, by the Congressional Budget Office--in terms of \nwhat we can do to get this economy moving forward. It is not just a \nmatter of helping those who are helpless; it is a matter of injecting \nmoney into the economy in the most efficient way.\n  I am afraid this has happened before. The last time the Senate \nextended unemployment, the other side of the aisle objected three \ntimes--the leaders on those three occasions. Incidentally, that \nextension of unemployment benefits was completely paid for. So it \nappears whether it was paid for or not paid for, there is objection on \nthe Republican side of the aisle.\n  I do not get it. I do not understand it. President Obama is doing his \nbest to get this economy moving forward. He inherited a weak economy \nthat was losing 700,000 to 800,000 jobs a month. Things have improved \nsomewhat, though they are not where we want them to be, and I believe \nwe ought to be standing behind the people in our Nation who are \nstruggling to find a job and get back to work. Many of them are trying \nto keep families together and care for their children.\n  Last week, nearly 500,000 Americans filed for unemployment for the \nfirst time. The number surged to just below 500,000 last week. It \nclimbed more than 12 percent over the past 2 weeks. I wish that were \nnot the case but it is. So you see, the economy is still struggling. I \nbelieve the first thing we ought to do is to care for our own. If \nsomeone came to the floor with an emergency request now because of a \ndrought, a flood, a hurricane, a tornado, we would honor it. We do that \nalmost on a regular basis because at some point you say: First, help \nthese poor people. Then deal with the budget challenge it brings at \nanother time.\n  But now, when it comes to helping our own, the citizens of this \ncountry who are out of work, that, unfortunately, is not the case. \nRight now over 4.6 million Americans continue to collect unemployment. \nThat is up 6,000 from the preceding weeks--the number of claimants.\n  In addition to the filibuster initiated by Senator Bunning hurting \nthose who are unemployed, it is also going to have an impact on the \nSmall Business Administration. Most everyone agrees the key to bringing \nthis economy forward is helping small businesses stay in business and \ncreate jobs. The Small Business Administration loans money to small \nbusinesses, which during difficult times need a helping hand.\n  The Senator's filibuster and his objection has closed down SBA \nprograms that provide credit to small businesses. What are we thinking \nto stop assistance to small businesses at this moment in our history? \nMost of us believe this is central and essential if we are going to \nturn the corner and move forward. Yet the Senator from Kentucky has \nobjected.\n  It also has some ramifications in cutting back on money that is \navailable for transportation. I do not know if the Senator is even \naware of what he has done when it comes to his objection, but in my \nState and many others, we are finding that people are losing their jobs \ntoday. We have been running our Federal transportation program with \nshort-term extensions since September 30 of last year--almost 5 months. \nThese stopgap extensions were underfunding our transportation system \nand hurting our States, cities, counties, and workers. The short-term \nextensions created an unstable environment in the Federal \ntransportation program.\n  We passed a yearlong extension in last week's jobs bill, but the \nHouse could not pass it on time to keep the Transportation Department \nauthorized. So we came to the floor to pass a 30-day extension of \ntransportation law along with the COBRA and unemployment benefits. \nSenator Bunning's objection has basically shut down the highway trust \nfund, the Federal highway trust fund.\n  This is uncharted territory. We do not let surface transportation \nlegislation expire. It has not happened before. The Department of \nTransportation is shutting down highway reimbursements to States. That \nmeans hundreds of millions of dollars that should be flowing from the \nFederal Treasury to these States are not.\n  The Department of Transportation is furloughing nearly 2,000 \nemployees without pay as of today because of Senator Bunning's \nobjection. The Department of Transportation is removing Federal \ninspectors from critical construction projects, forcing work to stop on \nFederal lands.\n  DOT's safety agencies, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, are furloughing employees who work on safety programs--\nprograms that stop drunk driving, reduce traffic injuries, and increase \nchild passenger safety--because of the objection of the Senator from \nKentucky.\n  In my State, we are going to lose 50 Federal Highway Administration \nemployees--furloughed today. These workers have been instructed not to \nreport to work until we pass this extension.\n  Second, the Illinois Department of Transportation will not be \nreceiving Federal reimbursement for projects because of this objection \nby the Senator from Kentucky. They were scheduled to submit the next \nFederal bill for reimbursement as of tomorrow. The Illinois Department \nof Transportation will submit a bill of about $25 million for work \nalready completed to which they are entitled. But because of the \nobjection of the Senator from Kentucky, that bill cannot be paid. There \nis no question that my State is entitled to it. I imagine the State of \nKentucky has a similar situation. The question is whether there is \nanyone there to process it, and because of his objection, there is not.\n  Delays in Federal reimbursements will make it difficult for the \nIllinois Department of Transportation to pay the contractors and \nworkers on these projects. So the ripple effect of this is the money \ndoesn't go back to the construction companies or to the workers and \ntheir families, leading to unemployment.\n\n  The Senator from Kentucky is opposed to extending unemployment \ncompensation. The unemployment rate, incidentally, in the construction \nindustry is 24 percent nationwide. Laying off more construction workers \nat this time is exactly the opposite of what we ought to be doing in \nthis economy. Future work on Illinois transportation projects could be \nin jeopardy if\n\n[[Page S844]]\n\nwe do not pass an extension. The Illinois Department of Transportation \nis scheduled to release the largest bid lettings on April 23 for \nprojects underway this construction season, and so the construction \nseason will be delayed.\n  I am trying to give the whole picture. As we wait for the Senator \nfrom Kentucky to agree to a short-term extension of these critical \nprograms, we are jeopardizing jobs, more people will be unemployed, and \nwe are jeopardizing future projects which will be shortchanged because \nconstruction seasons are limited.\n  This 1-month extension of transportation law--and that is all we are \nasking for--has already had overwhelming bipartisan support in the \npast, and the 1-month extension itself costs nothing. Last week, we \npassed a 1-year transportation fix as part of the jobs bill.\n  The following groups have written letters urging us to move on this \nextension: the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials, the American Road and Transportation Builders Association, \nthe Associated General Contractors of America, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, the Laborers International Union, and the American Automobile \nAssociation.\n  The House did its work last week and passed this 30-day extension, \nsending it over to us, where we learned Thursday night that the Senator \nfrom Kentucky was going to object. Nine of us took to the floor \nThursday night and made a request several times for him to withdraw his \nobjection, which he refused to do. I made another request on Friday \nmorning on the floor and the Senator continued his objection and then \nseveral today.\n  So I am going to make the 11th request of the Senator from Kentucky, \non behalf of the people I represent in Illinois, some 15,000 who have \nlost their unemployment checks because of his filibuster, and 400,000 \nacross America who are wondering: What happened? What did we do wrong \nhere? Why aren't we receiving the check we need for the necessities of \nlife?\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4691, the 30-day extension of \nprovisions which expired on Sunday, February 28, including unemployment \ninsurance, COBRA, flood insurance, the Satellite Home Viewer Act, \nhighway funding, SBA business loans and small business provisions of \nthe American Recovery Act, SGR and poverty guidelines, received from \nthe House and at the desk; that the bill be read three times, passed, \nand the motions to reconsider be made and laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BUNNING. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, keep in mind we have repeatedly offered to \nthe Senator from Kentucky an opportunity for a vote: Bring your \napproach to the floor. Let the Senate decide. Accept the decision of \nthe Senate, win or lose. That is the most any Senator can ask for. Yet \nhe wants more. He wants a guarantee that he wins. Well, there is no \nguarantee you win in the Senate. There is no guarantee you win in \nbaseball. You do the best you can. Under these circumstances, I think \nwhat we have reached is a point that is difficult to understand and \nexplain.\n  I would like to invite my Republican colleagues--all of them--to come \nto the floor and express themselves on this. If they believe we should \ncut off unemployment benefits, health insurance benefits, close down \nthe U.S. Department of Transportation's work in the States, close down \nthe SBA programs for small businesses, I hope they will come and \nexpress that point of view. They should, if they feel that way. If they \nfeel, as I do, that this is unfair and unfortunate, if they will come \nforward and join us on the floor, we can try to build up some momentum \nfor moving this issue forward.\n  There are people in every State of the Union who are suffering today \nbecause of the objection of one Senator, because of the filibuster of \none Senator, and that is a sad indication of what has happened in the \nSenate; that we have reached this point and that even offering an up-\nor-down vote on an amendment is not enough.\n  What the Senator is looking for is a guaranteed result. We can't give \nhim that guaranteed result.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, it is amazing to me the Senator from \nIllinois has what we call a convenient memory. Just last week there was \na bipartisan bill proposed by Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley that \nwould have covered the extension of unemployment benefits, COBRA health \ncare assistance, flood insurance, highway bill assistance, the doc fix, \nsmall business loans, and the Rural Satellite Television Viewer Act. \nThe convenient memory loss of the Senator from Illinois has allowed him \nto forget that his leader, Senator Reid, did not allow that bill to \ncome to the floor and instead substituted his jobs bill. The majority \nleader's jobs bill was also not fully paid for, by the way. Ten billion \ndollars wasn't; five billion dollars was. So $10 billion from the jobs \nbill that was passed went to the bottom of the deficit.\n  There comes a time when 100 Senators are for something we all \nsupport, if we can't find $10 billion to pay for it, we are not going \nto pay for anything. We will not pay for anything fully on the floor of \nthe Senate.\n  He said I only offered one way to pay for this. That is untrue. I \noffered more than one way. I negotiated with the leader--the leader's \nstaff, rather--and we had worked out a 2-week extension for $5 billion \nwith a different pay-for. The debt we have arrived at, even the head of \nthe Federal Reserve Bank, Chairman Bernanke, said is not sustainable. \nIt is unsustainable. What does that mean to the American people, to the \nsame people who are struggling to pay for bills, who are on \nunemployment, who could have been covered had the Baucus-Grassley bill \nbeen considered and could have been covered not for 30 days but for 3 \nmonths? Because there were some tax extenders in that bill, the \nDemocratic majority stopped the bill from being considered.\n  I am not filibustering the bill. A filibuster is somebody who talks a \nlong time. I am exercising my right as a Senator, duly elected from \nKentucky, to object to a UC. That is completely different than \nfilibustering. Everybody knows a Member of this body, any 100 of us can \nobject to anything that is brought to the floor of the Senate, whether \nit be a nominee, whether it be a judge, whether it be somebody who is \nappointed to the Treasury. Anybody can object. There is a procedure \nthat takes place that can overcome that objection. Why doesn't the \nDemocratic majority use that procedure?\n  So I am going to take one more shot. As long as we continue to have \nthe extenders being brought forth unpaid for, I am going to object.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4691; that the amendment at the desk, \nwhich offers a full offset, be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be read \na third time and passed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nSenator, again, is asking that he win without a vote. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, we tried and we will continue trying. As \nmany people who get up and propose that UC, I will be there, whenever \nit is. I want it passed as badly as the Senator from Illinois does \nbecause I also have people in Kentucky who have the same problems as \nhis people do in Illinois. All the States that are represented by two \nSenators do as well, but let's do it and pay for it because the money \nis available in many areas. The money was available for the Grassley-\nBaucus bill, which extended things for a year, in some cases, and \nextended these provisions I am talking about and the Senator from \nIllinois is talking about for a full 3 months. We would not be in this \nposition if the Senator from Nevada had allowed that bill to come to \nthe floor.\n  Thank you. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, until my voice gives out, I wish to address \nthe bill that is on the floor. The bill has been denominated by my \ncolleagues on\n\n[[Page S845]]\n\nthe Democratic side as a jobs bill, but it will not create any new jobs \nand when considered in conjunction with the health care legislation the \nPresident has proposed will actually cost jobs and I wish to address \nthat.\n  This legislation extends some current provisions of law, including \ntax provisions, unemployment compensation, COBRA insurance. It extends \na provision of Federal subsidies to the States for Medicaid, and there \nare a few other provisions. None of these create new jobs. The tax \nextenders are useful. That is our Washington, DC, speak for provisions \nof the Tax Code that last 1 year and have to be renewed each year. They \nare generally used to enable businesses to deduct from their taxes \nordinary business expenses and include things such as research and \ndevelopment tax credits which I think are supported by all 100 \nSenators. So we do this every year. We extend these tax provisions for \nanother year. It should have been done at the end of last year; it \nwasn't. So it has to be done now and made retroactive to the beginning \nof the year. One could argue that some of those may theoretically \ncreate a few jobs, but they are something we do every year, and they \nare not for the purpose of creating jobs; they are simply good business \npractices. So this bill takes on the usual business of the Senate. \nThere is nothing new, as I said, to create jobs.\n  What of the subject of unemployment coverage extension which we have \njust been debating? That doesn't create new jobs. In fact, if anything, \ncontinuing to pay people unemployment compensation is a disincentive \nfor them to seek new work. I am sure most of them would like work and \nprobably have tried to seek it, but you can't argue it is a job \nenhancer. If anything, as I said, it is a disincentive and the same \nthing with the COBRA extension and the other extensions here. So it is \nnot a jobs bill, and it is beyond me how it could be denominated as \nsuch.\n  Moreover--and the reason for my colleague's objection to the \ntemporary bill--the Congressional Budget Office preliminary estimate \nshows this bill adds $104 billion to the deficit over the next 10 \nyears, and that is in addition to the $10 billion that would be added \nthat my colleague, Senator Bunning, has been talking about. This number \nis primarily due to the extension of unemployment insurance, the \nexpanded COBRA extension, and the new Federal assistance to States for \nMedicaid patients. These are given emergency designations. As a result, \nwe don't have to supply an offset, a spending reduction, to pay for the \ncost of these provisions.\n  This comes just a week after our Democratic colleagues were bragging \nabout the fact that they passed a bill called the pay-go bill.\n  The pay-go bill is supposed to require that if we are going to spend \nmoney, we find an offset in the form of a spending deduction or revenue \nenhancement that covers the cost of that new spending. We predicted \nthat as soon as we passed the pay-go legislation, our Democratic \ncolleagues would come to the floor and seek to have their next \nlegislation exempted from it. Sure enough, that is exactly what was \ndone.\n  Both the matter Senator Bunning has objected to and the bill we are \non now have to be exempted from the pay-go requirements and, therefore, \nadd to the Federal deficit--in this case, $104 billion. Some of these \nprovisions are useful provisions. But the truth is you can't, on the \none hand, say everything we do has to be offset with spending cuts or \ntax increases and then waive the pay-go legislation every time you want \nto do it--as it turns out so far, every time we have considered \nlegislation.\n  The reality is, we could pay for this legislation and, as Senator \nBunning said, we could pay for the so-called temporary extension of \nunemployment benefits because we have money we authorized and \nappropriated earlier in the so-called stimulus bill which would more \nthan offset the cost of this legislation. Republicans, of course, would \nlike to offer an amendment to pay for it from the stimulus funds. \nAccording to recovery.gov, the Web site for the stimulus bill, only \n$186 billion of the $499 billion in appropriated and direct spending \nfrom the stimulus has been spent so far.\n  That means $313 billion or 63 percent remains unspent. So $160 \nbillion of these funds hasn't even been made available to be spent yet.\n  The original CBO estimate of the stimulus shows 21 percent of the \nmoney, $122 billion of the appropriated and direct spending, will not \noccur until 2012 or thereafter. We have an immediate crisis. Our \nDemocratic colleagues say we have to extend unemployment insurance. In \nfact, it is such an immediate crisis, they have to waive the pay-go \nrequirements that would ordinarily apply because it is an emergency.\n  If that is the case, then why not simply take this money that isn't \ngoing to be spent until after 2012 and pay for the legislation that is \nbefore us right now? Why would we put aside stimulus money to spend in \n2012 when people need it today? That is the very argument my colleague \nfrom Illinois was making to my colleague from Kentucky. Why pile on the \ndeficit if we have this money available? Therefore, my colleague from \nKentucky made a good point when he suggested this money should be paid \nfor out of the stimulus funding. I am sorry to see my Democratic \ncolleagues object to that request.\n  The conclusion is, therefore, the bill will do nothing to create new \njobs. What is more, when considered in conjunction with the health care \nlegislation, it will actually cause a loss of jobs.\n  The President, who talked about his plan last Thursday at the so-\ncalled health care summit, noted that the bill costs a lot of money \nand, therefore, they had to raise taxes in order to pay for it. Among \nother things, the President's plan, unlike the plan that passed the \nHouse or the Senate, would raise the Medicare payroll tax on small \nbusinesses. It would raise taxes by 31 percent. It would also apply the \nMedicare payroll tax to investment income, such as interest, dividends, \nrent, and royalties.\n  We all know if you tax something, you get less of it. Taxing \ninvestment income would, therefore, reduce investment in the economy. \nPutting a tax on the employment of people means businesses are going to \nhire fewer people or there are going to be fewer people on their \npayroll. We cannot afford to lose more people to unemployment. We need \nto begin hiring people. How do we do that? You surely don't do it by \nmaking it more costly to employ people or by increasing by almost one-\nthird the Medicare payroll tax. That makes no sense. To apply it now to \ninvestment income will directly drive down productivity and economic \ngrowth. Less investment will, obviously, lead to lower productivity, \nslower economic growth, weaker wages and salaries, and lower household \nwealth.\n  For example, each new dollar of tax paid by a small business is one \nless dollar that could go toward hiring new employees.\n  The Heritage Foundation just did a study on this proposal. It found \nthat between 2011 and 2020, regarding this investment income proposal \nalone, it would result in an average of 115,000 lost job opportunities \nper year; it would reduce household disposable income by $17.3 billion \nper year; it would cut wages and salaries by $14 billion per year; and \nit would decrease household wealth by $267 billion per year.\n  Last week, Congress passed a new job-hiring tax credit. With great \nfanfare, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle said this is the \nway to help small businesses hire more people. The whole idea was to \nput more people to work. The very same week, the President announces \nhis health care proposal that will make it harder for people to go back \nto work. If the goal is to get more people to work, I submit that my \nDemocratic friends should shelve their health care plan, which will \nhave the opposite result. It is very hard to justify legislation that \nis going to hurt job creation.\n  As I say, when you consider the fact that, No. 1, the bill before us \ncreates no new jobs--and I challenge my Democratic friends to show us \nhow doing what we always do and what was done last year--extending the \nR tax credit, extending COBRA insurance, extending unemployment \nbenefits--creates jobs. What is the estimate for job creation by the \nCBO on this? It can't be very much.\n  Finally, my colleague from Illinois, in responding to Senator Bunning \na little bit ago, said Republicans always object--and we have many \ntimes on previous occasions--to the consideration\n\n[[Page S846]]\n\nof unemployment legislation. I recall back in October--in fact, I will \nquote from a story, dated October 13, 2009, by Dan Friedman. He says:\n\n       Last Thursday, Democrats announced a deal that gave all 50 \n     States a 14-week extension.\n\n  I think that was about three extensions ago. I have forgotten \nexactly.\n\n       The Senate Finance Committee Chairman, Max Baucus, within \n     hours of that sought unanimous consent to pass the bill. Even \n     though Republicans had already indicated that they would \n     object so that they could try to amend the bill to replace \n     the extension of the tax or to provide a pay-for in the \n     Democrats' plan with the use of stimulus money.\n\n  It noted the fact that I had also asked that we see the CBO score on \nthat. It noted that Senators Reid, Baucus, and other Democrats quickly \nbashed Republicans: ``The delay is a threat to millions of workers \nstruggling to feed their families as they retain or search for new \njobs,'' my friend, the chairman of the committee, said.\n  Earlier in this particular article--I will read how it starts off:\n\n       Senate Democrats in recent weeks have repeatedly used \n     unanimous consent agreement requests to rack up talking \n     points against Senate Republicans--a tactic that GOP aides \n     said the majority is using deceptively to blame Republicans \n     rather than internal disputes for stalled legislation. Senate \n     leaders have long used the tactic of asking for unanimous \n     consent to pass legislation they know will draw an objection \n     from the minority and then blasting the objectors for \n     obstruction.\n\n  I fear that is what we are seeing here. Immediately after Democrats, \nbehind closed doors, develop legislation, they immediately come to the \nfloor and say: Let's pass it, and Republicans say: Let's at least see \nhow much it costs and give us a chance to amend it. We thought the \nDemocrats liked to do that. Oh, no, we cannot have that, not when it \napplies to unemployment extension.\n  That is all my colleague from Kentucky is trying to do. As I said, \nthat is $10 billion not paid for. The bill before us is another $104 \nbillion not paid for, and it doesn't create a single new job. Yet my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are unwilling to use stimulus \nmoney to pay for it.\n  I will be very interested, when we do have an opportunity to amend \nthe bill before us--I assume we will, and I assume one of those will be \nto pay for the bill with the stimulus funds--maybe we can make it clear \nthese are not funds that would be spent until after the year 2012. It \nwill be interesting to see if my Senate colleagues who support pay-go \nwould support that kind of amendment. After all, if this is supposed to \nbe a stimulus bill for job creation, you would think it could be used \nfor that purpose.\n\n  I hope my colleagues will consider that every time we pass one of \nthese bills, we are adding to the deficit and we are not creating new \njobs. It is a legitimate point for Republicans to make. I hope we will \nhave the opportunity to address that subject with amendments as this \nbill goes forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Arizona argues that \nunemployment insurance is a disincentive to jobs. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth. I don't think anybody who is out of work and \nreceiving unemployment insurance believes that payment is sufficient \nnot to find a job. The payments are so much lower than a salary or wage \nwould be, it is ridiculous. There are five unemployed Americans today \nfor every job opening in the economy--five unemployed Americans who are \nlooking for work but cannot find it. That is the case and has been the \ncase for a long time. People are looking for work. They are not \nunemployed because they have a choice. It is because of the recession \nthat struck and the economy. It is not because people don't want to \nwork.\n  An additional point. Many of us asked the CBO to rank what measures \nwould be most effective in helping the economy. The one they came up \nwith was unemployment benefits because unemployment benefits generate \nabout $1.90 in GDP growth for every $1 we paid out in terms of \nunemployment benefits.\n  I wished to make the point--and I don't know if the Senator meant \nthis, but he strongly implied it, and I took him to mean that \nunemployment insurance is a disincentive for people to look for work. I \ndon't think it is because the benefits are so low and so many are \nlooking for work--it is the economy or recession that cost us jobs.\n  Mr. KYL. If my colleague will yield, I said it is not a job creator. \nIf anything, it could be argued it is a disincentive for work because \npeople are being paid even though they are not working. I certainly did \nnot say, and would never imply, that the reason people don't have jobs \nis because they are not looking for them. It is true that a lot of \nAmericans have gotten so tired of looking for jobs or believe they are \nnot going to find them that they have stopped looking and, as a result, \nthe unemployment numbers are probably higher than the roughly 10 \npercent that is quoted now. Some people believe it could be as much as \n17 percent. This is why I have supported every extension of \nunemployment benefits. I have voted for them. As my colleague says, \nthere are five people looking for every job that exists. If they cannot \nget the jobs, they needed support.\n  But what I said is true, and if my colleague can find a source that \nsays it is not true, show me. But providing unemployment benefits \ndoesn't create jobs. The bill we have before us is denominated around \nhere as a jobs bill. That is the biggest single expenditure in the \nbill, and it doesn't create jobs.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate that. I have a question. First of all, \nunemployment benefits in Montana are about $300 a month. That is all. \nIt is $300 a month in Montana. I know doggone well that is not enough \nto keep anybody going very long. Lots of folks are looking for jobs, \nand they are not available. Failure to pass the extenders bill could be \nfairly stated as a job destroyer because there are so many people who \nhave taken advantage of many provisions of the bill--for example, the \nR tax credit, which the Senator mentioned, and there are other \nprovisions in the bill, such as the teachers expense, for example, and \nthere is a deduction for tuition. Take unemployment. Say unemployment \ninsurance was not continued. That would be a huge drag on the economy. \nIf the provisions we are seeking merely to extend were not passed, it \nwould be a job destroyer.\n  The President's office said, and many commentators have often said, \nour goal is to save or create so many jobs. It is hard to know what is \nsaved or created sometimes. But we certainly want to save jobs too. We \ndon't want the recession to be worse. Failure to pass this legislation \nis certainly going to cause tremendous hardship on a lot of Americans, \nand it would be a disincentive for the economy to turn around. It would \nbe a disincentive for unemployment rates to come down to a lower level \nthat we all find acceptable. Failure to pass this bill is a jobs \ndestroyer.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I respond to my colleague, the point I was \nmaking is that it is hard to describe this as a jobs bill because it \ndoes not create jobs. Each year, we extend these tax provisions. That \nis why we in Washington call it the tax extenders bill. This is not \nsome new job creator. I agree with my colleague that to the extent we \ncontinue this in practice--though everybody who takes advantage of it \nknows it will be extended. So they have not made decisions based upon \nthe prospect that we are not going to do it. They know we are going to \ndo it retroactively, so it is not creating any new jobs. I support the \nextension. I think it is a good thing. But let's don't call it a jobs \nbill.\n  By contrast, as I said, the health care legislation my colleague \nsupports is a job killer. I pointed out just one provision: 115,000 \njobs per year lost just because of the one provision taxing the so-\ncalled passive income, the dividends. And we are not even sure whether \ncapital gains are taxed in that. Their estimate may even be low.\n  The reality is, if we are really talking about saving or creating \njobs, let's forget this massive health care legislation that now adds \ntwo more job-killing provisions to it: a 31-percent increase in the \npayroll tax and taxing for the first time passive income as a part of \nMedicare. That is a job killer.\n  If we are going to talk about jobs with regard to the legislation we \nhave before us, I think it is a fair point to also talk about \nlegislation our colleagues on the other side of the aisle want very \nmuch to try to get passed.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't want to prolong this too long, but \nthe\n\n[[Page S847]]\n\nfact is, the President's Council of Economic Advisers has concluded \nthis legislation; that is, the health care reform legislation which is \nnot before us right now, actually would create jobs, new jobs. That is \nthe conclusion of the economic advisers.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3337 to Amendment No. 3336\n\n(Purpose: To reduce the deficit by establishing discretionary spending \n                                 caps)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I have at the desk amendment No. 3337. I \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mrs. McCaskill, proposes an amendment numbered 3337 to \n     amendment No. 3336.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, this is the Sessions-McCaskill \namendment, offered with Senator McCaskill, my colleague from Missouri. \nIt is a bipartisan amendment, and it is one that I think is very \nimportant. I hope my colleagues will give it serious consideration. We \nhave close to enough votes to make it law. I am absolutely convinced it \nis one thing that will work to reduce the surging deficits in our \ncountry.\n  The week before last, I traveled my State of Alabama--25 stops, 6 \ndays of travel. People continually expressed to me their concern about \nthe financial future of our country. They want us to do something about \nit.\n  I heard some of my colleagues express things like: This is just \npopulist anger. It will pass off. We need to keep a cool head here. We \ndon't really have to change how we do business. Things are going to \nwork out somehow, someway, although nothing in the numbers show that.\n  Mr. Bernanke, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, said last week in \nhis testimony before Congress that our path is unsustainable. That is \nnot the first time he said that. Virtually every economist who has \nopined in the last 6 months or more on our economy has said our \nspending levels are unsustainable and threaten the viability of our \ncountry's economic system. It is very troubling. We all know that, and \nwe do not need to go into a whole lot of discussion about it.\n  The gross debt of our country has grown to approximately $12 \ntrillion--the highest in our Nation's history. Some of this is internal \ndebt. We owe Social Security and Medicare and other trust funds that \nmay be in surplus. But we also owe trillions on the public debt--the \namount of debt this country owes outside the government. Within 5 years \nour public debt will double, and in 10 years the public debt will \ntriple. I will show a chart on that point before I go into the details \nof it. One of the consequences of the public debt is that we pay \ninterest and we have to get nations or individuals to loan us their \nmoney by buying our Treasury bills, bonds and notes. When they give us \ntheir money, this is not free. We have to pay them interest on all of \nthe debt we run up. This bill that is on the floor today will add to \nthe debt again because it is not paid for.\n  This chart is what we get in stunning numbers. It shows that in 2009, \ninterest on the public debt--the debt we owe to people outside our \ngovernment--was $187 billion. The Congressional Budget Office scores it \nbased on the 10-year budget President Obama submitted to us. If his \nbudget is in effect for 10 years, the deficit would go up every single \nyear. The debt will continue to go up every single year, and in the \noutyears the annual deficits will approach $1 trillion each year. The \ninterest on the debt in 1 year would be $799 billion. That is well \nabove the current defense budget. Aid to education is $50 billion or \n$60 billion. State and Federal aid to highways last year and the year \nbefore last was $40 billion. Mr. President, $800 billion in interest in \n1 year? It is a stunning number, a breathtaking number. It is going to \ncrowd out all kinds of plans some of my spending colleagues would like \nto effectuate in future years because we are not going to have the \nmoney or else we are going to inflate the currency and damage this \neconomy in a most systemic way.\n  This disturbing trend of higher and higher deficits and deficit \nspending shows no sign of stopping. As of September 30, the end of our \nfiscal year, we finished with a record $1.4 trillion deficit. That is \nmore than three times the highest deficit we have ever had. It is \nprojected that as of September 30 of this year we will have a $1.4 \ntrillion or $1.5 trillion deficit this year, which would be the highest \never again in consecutive years. It is stunning. We cannot continue to \nspend the way we are spending.\n  Between 1990 and 2002, however, Congress took some steps that \nactually worked to help get us out of a spiral of spending deficits. It \nwas successful. What we did was we passed statutory caps on \ndiscretionary spending only, not Social Security, Medicare and those \nkinds of programs. We kept it to 1 to 2 percent growth each year. As \nthis chart shows, these caps led to a surplus. The chart is upside down \nreally. These are the surplus years. These are the deficit years. \nDuring these years, we begin to show a decline in deficits, all the way \nto the surpluses. When it expired, it jumped up again. This looks like \na high deficit, and it was a very high deficit in 2004. That was about \nthe highest, at that point $400 billion.\n  I just made the point that this past fiscal year, it was $1,400 \nbillion and next year it is going to be $1,500 billion. We lost some \ndiscipline when we allowed those statutory caps or spending levels to \nbe breached and go away.\n  This amendment Senator McCaskill and I have offered both restores and \nstrengthens the procedures that were proven to work in the 1990s. It \nwould create 4-year discretionary spending caps or limits, and it would \nset those limits at the level of the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution \nCongress passed last year.\n  Last year, we passed a budget resolution, not 10 years as proposed by \nPresident Obama but 5 years. It is currently in effect. One of the \nthings you learn around here is the only part of the budget that has \nany teeth is the year you are in. The discretionary spending on the \nomnibus bill that covered half the appropriations bills contained an \nincrease of 12 percent. We are not doing a very good job at that. The \nbudget has no teeth in these outer years. The amendment proposes, \nthough, a fairly responsible spending increase of 2 percent or so a \nyear over these 4 years.\n\n  One could say: Senator Sessions, your State is cutting its budget. My \nState is having to reduce its budget. My city is reducing its budget. \nMy county is reducing its budget. My family is reducing our budget. Why \ncan't you guys reduce the budget? And the answer is, we can, of course.\n  Some have suggested and the President has suggested that we should \nhave a freeze on the budget, which I would support. But I am just \nsaying to my colleagues, last year our discretionary spending accounts \nhad double digit increases; if we pass this amendment so that we have a \nstatutory limit of 1 to 2 percent increases for the next 4 years and it \nis subject to a two-thirds vote point of order in the Congress if there \nis a proposal to go above that on the basis of some emergency need, I \nthink we will have a much better chance of making the kinds of tough \ndecisions to contain this ever-growing spending level than we have been \ndoing in the last several years.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill that passed last year increased \nFederal spending 12 percent in 1 year. That is a lot. At 7 percent, \nyour money will double in 10 years. At 12 percent, the spending in \nthose accounts would double in 6 or 7 years, no doubt about it, unless \nsomething is done about those trends.\n  I think this legislation Senator McCaskill and I have offered will \nget us there. I was pleased to see that 17 Democratic Senators voted \nfor the bill because I think there is a growing bipartisan consensus \nthat we can do better.\n  A 2-percent containment in the growth of spending will not cause the \nUnited States to sink into the ocean. We are still going to exist. The \nAmerican people are still going to have a government in Washington. \nThere are still going to be bureaucrats here to take care of us if we \njust have a 2-percent growth in the discretionary account instead of 12 \nor whatever that number was last year.\n  I note that the President suggested freezing some of the accounts. \nThough\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nthere are some very significant gimmicks in it that make it much less \ntight than it would appear from his State of the Union Address, it \nstill indicates that the President himself knows we have to reduce our \nspending, and in some of these accounts we could easily freeze them \nwith no damage to our Nation. I salute him for that.\n  This bill would create spending limits, not based on what Jeff \nSessions says the limit should be, but these are the limits in the \nPresident's budget, that first 5 years of it that he proposed and that \nCongress passed last year. We would be simply saying this would be a \nhard limit on how much we can spend. Now if we need to spend more than \nthat on an emergency, we would have to have strong support in the \nCongress to create an emergency designation to spend above that. We \nhave been able to do that many times in the past when a true emergency \narrived.\n\n  Some say: Jeff, you are focusing too much on the discretionary \nspending. Entitlements are bigger--Social Security, Medicare, those \nkind of things--and they are a bigger problem than discretionary \nspending. Well, there are three reasons we have to act on discretionary \nspending. One is that while entitlements, such as Social Security and \nMedicare, are large, they actually have a net surplus right now. In \nfact, Congress raided $137 billion from Social Security in fiscal year \n2009 to pay for other things, such as the $800 billion stimulus package \nthat we passed--that Congress passed--last year.\n  Of course, a $137 billion Social Security surplus won't pay for the \nCongress's $800 billion stimulus package, so where did the rest of the \nmoney come from? We borrowed it on the world market, on which we are \npaying interest. And what about the Social Security surplus; is that \nfree money? No, it is not, because Social Security is heading to \ndefault. When we take the Social Security surplus into the U.S. \nTreasury and spend it on increasing discretionary spending by 12 \npercent, we give them back a debt instrument, an IOU--a Treasury bond.\n  I am told they are in some location in West Virginia. I am sure the \nchairman of the committee knows that but I want to go out and see them. \nThey have notes out there, Treasury bills, evidencing the debt of the \nU.S. Treasury to the Social Security Administration. As soon as Social \nSecurity goes into deficit, it is going to call those notes. So it does \nnot make much difference whether you borrowed it from Social Security \nor you borrowed it from the public. The interest rates are very \nsimilar, too. The government pays interest to Social Security and \nMedicare, when Medicare has a surplus.\n  It is projected that Congress will raid another $90 billion in 2010--\nthis year we are in--to pay for things such as this omnibus bill that \nis on the floor: for increased transportation and HUD funding, which \nwent up 23 percent; create more funding for the State and foreign \noperations accounts, which went up 33 percent this year, for a record \n$1.4 trillion deficit last year, and a projected $1.4-plus trillion for \nfiscal year 2010. All of that was driven not by deficits in Medicare \nand Social Security but from a discretionary spending account.\n  Our appropriators are always saying the problem is all Social \nSecurity and Medicare. But the truth is, almost without exception, we \nhave had surpluses in those accounts and we are spending that to \nsupplement our general fund spending. We give evidence of debt back to \nour seniors from Medicare and Social Security, which the actuaries tell \nus, without any doubt, will soon be in deficit. We are going to call \nthose notes, and the Treasury will have to come up with it.\n  So there is no free lunch. Nothing comes from nothing. If you spend \nmoney you don't have, you borrow it from somewhere. You can print \nmoney, I suppose, and devalue the currency. But everybody has the \nvalue, and the money in their pocket is devalued. It is the same as a \ntax. There is no way to do this in a free way. We have been \nirresponsible, and I think the American people are correct.\n  When I go to townhall meetings, what can I tell them? Oh, we didn't \ndo anything wrong. The Senate and the House, we have been handling your \nmoney fine, my fellow Alabamian. We have done great. Don't complain. \nDon't get mad. You will get over it.\n  We have an $800 billion interest payment coming up in 2019 and our \nchildren and grandchildren are going to pay that. Yet when Senator \nBunning asks that unemployment insurance be paid for out of this \nunspent $800 billion stimulus and not add it to the debt, which our \ngrandchildren will pay, he was able to say with some personal \nconviction--with 42 grandchildren--that he wasn't going to vote for it, \nand he didn't. He didn't support it and he didn't agree to let it pass \nwithout an objection. He said we should have paid for it, and we could \nhave paid for it out of the stimulus.\n  Another reason I think we need to focus on discretionary spending is \nbecause, unlike the entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare, \ndiscretionary spending has overhead. There is some, but really very \nlittle overhead in Social Security and Medicare. And we can do better. \nI know Chairman Baucus has worked on Medicare overhead. I don't know \nhow much can be squeezed out of Social Security overhead; not a lot, \nbecause most of it is that check that goes out to seniors, who count on \nit every month. But there is overhead in discretionary spending--all \nthe things we spend our money on. Trust me, I have been in the Federal \nGovernment; I have worked there. I know it can be made more efficient.\n  This past year, we increased spending on the Department of the \nInterior and EPA by 17 percent total. I think the EPA account went up \n33 percent. In 1 year they got a 33-percent increase in their budget. \nAnd by the by, this does not include any of the $800 billion stimulus \nfunds that were allocated--about half of which has gone out. It doesn't \ninclude that. EPA got money out of that, Interior got money out of \nthat, highways got money out of that--large amounts. We are seeing \nunprecedented increases in spending in these accounts.\n  Consider the Department of Agriculture. I remember people criticized \nPresident Bush for spending too much money on Agriculture. If you look \nat his Agriculture budget over the 8 years he was President, it \naveraged less than a 2-percent increase. Last year, our Agriculture \nbudget--not counting the stimulus package, which sent a large amount to \nAgriculture--increased 15 percent. I always try to support the \nAgriculture budget, but I could not support that. That would double the \nentire agriculture spending in, what, 5 years, at compounded increases. \nIt is not responsible. We have to do better.\n  The American people, I think, are upset. This recent CNN poll asked a \ntough question of the voters in America: Which of the following comes \ncloser to your view of the budget deficit--the government should run a \ndeficit if necessary when the country is in a recession and at war, or \nthe government should balance the budget even when the country is in a \nrecession and is at war? Sixty-seven percent said balance the budget, \nyou guys. Because they have heard these excuses before. They have heard \nall of it before. What they are seeing is red ink as far as the eye can \nsee, with record deficits above anything we have ever seen. That is \nwhat I am hearing when I go out and talk to my constituents. And \nfrankly, I am glad I don't have to defend having voted for this \nstimulus package. I am glad I don't have to defend the $700 billion \nWall Street bailout, and $182 billion going to AIG. They sold off one \nof their most profitable companies, or are talking about it, I saw in \nthe paper today, and they are going to bring in $35 billion. They are \ngoing to use a chunk of that to pay down some of that $182 billion \ndebt. But if they keep selling off what they have, how will they have \nany money to pay the rest of it? I think they are not going to pay the \nrest of it.\n  Finally, I will add that spending billions, adding billions to the \nbaseline budget, makes a big difference. I made this chart for the DOD \nappropriations bill. It is an interesting little chart. I hope my \ncolleague can pay a little attention to this weird, fine print chart. \nIt shows what happens when there was gimmicked up on the bill an $18 \nbillion add-on, all unpaid for. There was $18 billion added to the \nDefense bill. If this gets in as baseline spending, which is what it \ntends to do, then next year when you advertise how much you increase \nthe Defense bill, you have this $18 billion in and it adds up, so that \nnext year it is not just $18 billion, it is\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\nthe $18 billion additional money that is in the baseline from the \nprevious year and then you add another $18 billion. Let's say, \nhypothetically, you jack it up each year by $18 billion, and the net \ndeficit is $36 billion; and then next it is $36 billion plus $18 \nbillion; and the next year it is $54 billion plus $18 billion; and the \nnext year it is $72 billion plus $18 billion. You carry that out to the \ntenth year, and it is $162 billion plus $18 billion, or $180 billion \nextra for the Defense budget in 1 year, which is about $990 billion \nover 10 years.\n  So an $18 billion addition, or failure to contain the growth in a \ndiscretionary account, has tremendous ramifications over the years. It \nis this kind of psychology that has led us into this mess. Some of our \nappropriators and others in this Congress, I think, have felt a thrill \nif they can beat the limit on their account. If they have been given an \naccount, and they get $80 billion or $100 billion to spend they can \nfigure a way to gimmick it up $18 billion or $5 billion or $7 billion, \nand they can maneuver it through and then tell you when the bill hits \nthe floor: Well, if you don't vote for it, Sessions, you are against \nagriculture and people back home are going to attack you because you \nvoted against agriculture. And I say: Well, Mr. Senator, you put too \nmuch money in there. I can't vote for it; there is too big an increase. \nTherefore, you are either for agriculture or you are against \nagriculture.\n\n  What they said to Senator Bunning down here the other night, when he \nsaid unemployment insurance should be paid for, was: You are against \nunemployment insurance. You do not want people to have any unemployment \ninsurance. That was absolutely false. They repeated it over and over \nand over again. But he stood like a solid rock and he didn't give in. \nHe said: I am not agreeing to it because you could pay for it, and it \nis increasing the debt on my 42 grandchildren. He didn't agree to it.\n  Well, every now and then somebody stands up in this Senate and says: \nI have had enough. I am not going to say yes this time. I respect him \nfor the courage he showed.\n  The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which is a bipartisan \ngroup in DC, issued a report not long ago that said that freezing all \nnonwar-related discretionary spending next year could save us $60 \nbillion in 1 year, and it will set up a new baseline that would save \nus--as this chart which creates a new baseline mentality shows--$600 \nbillion over 10 years. That is a lot. Even in Washington, $600 billion \nis real money. On the other hand, the committee stated that if we allow \ndiscretionary spending to grow at the projected rate of GDP growth \ninstead of inflation, it would cost us $1.7 trillion more over the next \n10 years.\n  This is a nonbiased group. I don't think anybody would fundamentally \ndisagree with that. So it does make a difference how much money we \nspend on every single account, on every single funding in an \nappropriations bill that comes through this Senate.\n  Can we get bipartisan support for having a tougher line and \ncontaining spending? I think the answer is absolutely we can. Why is \nthere a conflict? The simple fact is the 5-year binding caps that were \npassed in 1990 had broad bipartisan support. In fact, a number of \ncurrently serving Republicans voted for them and 10 of our currently \nserving Democratic Senators did also, including Senator Reid, our \nDemocratic leader, and Senator Inouye, the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee. He voted for them in the 1990s.\n  If we think this through, we have every reason to believe we can get \nthere. The 5-year spending cap that passed in the 1990 budget deal had \neven stronger bipartisan support. It passed again in 1997. I know \nSenator Baucus was here then, and it passed 85 to 15, with 44 currently \nserving Senators supporting it, and 26 of them were Democrats. Senators \nReid, Durbin, Conrad, and Inouye all voted for them. If we could do it \nin 1990, and again in 1997, there is no reason we cannot do it now. In \nfact, I and my staff have met with numerous groups across the political \nspectrum, including the Brookings Institute, the Committee for \nResponsible Federal Government, the Urban Institute, the Progressive \nPolicy Institute, the Concord Coalition, and the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce--everybody we met with has said getting a handle on \ndiscretionary spending is essential.\n\n  Although AARP, the Association of Retired Persons, initially \nexpressed opposition to the amendment, I believe we have addressed \ntheir concerns. Their chief concern was that we would not separate \ndefense and nondefense spending, which would let the defense spending \nraid nondefense accounts. However, we have separated them, so that is \nnot a danger.\n  Of course, one criticism some might give to the bill is that it \nraises the threshold for waiving--breaking the spending limits from 60 \nSenate votes to 67 Senate votes, and they say that is just too \nrestrictive. But we have to raise this threshold because we have a 60-\nvote situation now and we have been able to muster 60 votes to pass \nevery kind of possible emergency bill, and some of those clearly were \nnot emergencies. It takes 67 votes in this Chamber to make a change to \nthe Senate Journal, but we can max out the Senate's credit card with 60 \nvotes. Something doesn't seem right about that. I think, with the \nseriousness of our situation, this would be a good step.\n  Furthermore, the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution already accounted \nfor about $10 billion per year in emergency spending, which we have \nallowed to remain in this amendment. Any emergencies for which that is \ninadequate should be able to receive the support of 67 Senators--if we \nhave an emergency. In fact, all the disaster relief emergencies, those \nkinds of emergencies since the emergency designation was created in \n1990 to try to contain spending, have received support of more than 67 \nSenators. Isn't that interesting? All of our emergency designations for \nhurricanes and earthquakes and fires and storms and the like have \nreceived more than 67 votes. So I think it is just not a good argument \nto say we can't respond to a legitimate emergency.\n  The prospect of massive Federal spending is hurting jobs and growth. \nIn a recent editorial in the Wall Street Journal, Stanford University \neconomics professor Michael Boskin stated:\n\n       The explosion of spending, deficits and debt foreshadows \n     even higher prospective taxes on work, saving, investment and \n     employment. That not only will damage our economic future but \n     is harming jobs and growth now.\n\n  China and other countries may not be able to keep financing our debt \nin the future even if they would like to--which I really think they \nwon't. Professor Allan Meltzer, a well-known scholar on the Federal \nReserve and monetary policy, noted in a column in the Wall Street \nJournal that our current and projected deficits are too large relative \nto current and prospective world savings to rely on other countries \nbeing able to finance them for the next 10 years. In other words, there \nmay not be enough surplus money in the world to buy these debt \ninstruments we are going to have to issue. In fact, a recent Washington \nTimes editorial entitled ``Spending to a Depression'' notes that, since \nChina and other countries are trying to reduce their holdings of \ndollars, we will have to rely more and more on U.S. banks to buy our \nbonds, which will decrease capital available for lending to businesses.\n  On an airplane today, coming back from Alabama, I read an article \nthat made reference to the fact that when the Federal Government puts \nout this much money and interest rates become higher than they have \nbeen. They are currently extraordinarily low, and banks are now buying \nTreasury securities at 3.6 or 3.7 percent interest for 10-year Treasury \nnotes. Instead of loaning to local businesses, banks can get the money \nfrom the Fed at less than 1 percent and they can buy a Federal \nGovernment debt instrument for 3.5 or 4 percent and not have to loan it \nto some businessperson who might be a higher risk. We are crowding out \nresources necessary for economic growth. This is a reality.\n  In a Budget Committee hearing on budget reform on November 10, former \nComptroller of the Currency and GAO head David Walker testified that by \n2040, 30 years from now, we will have to double taxes just to keep up \nwith current commitments. Can you imagine that? The way we are \nspending, we are going to have to double taxes in 30 years. He stated \nthat in 12 years, interest will be the single biggest line item in the \nentire budget, even assuming interest rates do not change from today's\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\nlow rates. But they are going to go up. Everybody knows that. Some are \npredicting the kinds of interest rates we had in the late 1970s. I \ntruly hope that does not occur, but many people believe we do not have \nany idea how high interest rates could surge when the whole world, \nincluding Europe and other places, is spending money it does not have \nand attempting to borrow in the marketplace to have that happen. Mr. \nWalker also said that deficits are the public's largest concern by 20 \npoints, in opinion polls.\n  In a Financial Times editorial in May of last year, Mr. Walker warned \nthat the United States is in danger of losing its triple-A credit \nrating. Moody's made that clear. Moody's stated that the United States \nis in danger of losing its triple-A credit rating. Pierre Cailleteau, \nthe chief economist at Moody's, stated that, unlike several years ago, \n``Now the question of a potential downgrade of the U.S. is not \ninconceivable.'' Under the most pessimistic scenario put forth by \nMoody's, the United States could lose its top rating in 2013--3 years \nfrom now.\n  I was very pleased we had strong bipartisan support for the amendment \npreviously. By allowing us not to apply these budget limits we passed \nlast year to the current year, it gives some relief to our Members of \nthe Senate who complain that next year we will start cutting spending \nbut we should not this year. We will give a little bit there, although \nit will mean we will not save as much money for sure. But I really \nbelieve we need to pass this legislation. I truly hope we can. We only \nneed three or four more votes to make it a reality. I count now, with \nthe ones who voted for it before and a new Senator in the body, we will \nhave 57 votes. We need 60. The situation has not gotten any better, and \nI am hoping my colleagues will look at it afresh and that we might be \nable to reach that number. It will make a difference. It made a \ndifference in the 1990s and led to an actual surplus. I believe it \ncould help us again this time. We have much more serious problems this \ntime. We have more challenges this time. But it could make a very \nsignificant difference in our spending level. It would really be a \nstatement to the entire financial world that we are beginning to take \nsome steps and that next year we are not going to have 12 percent \nincreases in spending for discretionary accounts but we are going to \nhold it to the 1- or 2-percent increase level. I think that might have \nsome psychological improvement in our entire financial condition.\n  I apologize to the fine chairman of the Finance Committee for taking \nthis long, but I really believe it is an important issue. I am so \nhopeful we are getting close to getting the votes to take this positive \nstep.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I appreciate the comments of the Senator from Alabama. He \nis concerned, as we all are, with our current fiscal situation, our \ndebts and our deficits. I might add--this is not an excuse; it is clear \nwe Americans have a problem that has to be addressed--other countries \nare in the same fix. It is not just America. But again, that is no \nexcuse. Our deficits are high primarily because of the financial \ncrisis, working our way through all that. The real test is whether we \nas a country, when times get better and incomes increase, live much \nmore within our means. I certainly hope so. I know every Senator in \nthis body hopes so.\n  More precisely, the Senator from Alabama seeks to place caps on the \nappropriated accounts. That is pretty much the same amendment the \nSenate rejected about a month ago; I think it was January 28.\n  I believe the pending Sessions amendment addresses matters within the \njurisdiction of the Budget Committee. It therefore violates section 306 \nof the Congressional Budget Act. I will not raise that point of order \nat this time, but I believe the amendment does violate the Budget Act.\n  Furthermore, this subject is really more within the purview of the \nAppropriations Committee. I defer to the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee to address this amendment in due course.\n  I also note that the Senator from Minnesota has been waiting very \npatiently to speak. We are all anxious to hear from the Senator from \nMinnesota, so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, did the Senator make a budget point of \norder?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No, I did not.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Franken are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I also would like to take a few minutes \nto speak on another topic, the extension of unemployment benefits and \nCOBRA subsidies. I admire those in this body who take a principled \nstand. The Senate would get more done if all Members were guided by \ntheir basic core principles and put principles ahead of political \nposturing, ahead of party, ahead of polling.\n  To block a legislative measure because it is not fully offset--sure, \nthat could be based on principle. Believe me, I am concerned about our \nbudget deficit. But principles are something you consistently stand \nbehind. That is what makes it a principle, something you care about, \nsomething that guides you throughout your career. That is what makes it \na principle. Principles cannot be ignored, even when it is expedient or \nadvantageous to do so. Yet that is exactly what is happening now. A \nprinciple is being invoked only now that it is convenient.\n  You might remember that when George W. Bush entered office, it was \nwith a $200 billion budget surplus. He also entered office with \nprojections of nearly $1 billion in future surpluses over the next \ndecade, on a glide path to paying off the entire national debt.\n  But instead of doing the sensible thing and paying down our debt when \nwe had the means, the Bush administration racked up massive deficits at \na record pace. Vice President Cheney even said ``deficits do not \nmatter.'' Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan testified that we might pay off \nour debt just too quickly. We were told we might have too much money. \nReally. He did this. He testified to Congress saying that was a real \nworry.\n  Then we paid for an unnecessary war in Iraq, without offsets. We \npassed Medicare Part D without offsets. We passed three different sets \nof tax cuts totaling trillions of dollars, most benefitting the \nwealthiest people in the Nation, without offsets.\n  Yet last Thursday night the Senate repeatedly attempted to extend \nbenefits for America's unemployed workers, and these efforts were \nblocked supposedly because it was not fully offset. For some reason \nbenefits to the wealthiest Americans did not need to be offset, but \nkeeping unemployment benefits flowing to those families who have been \nhardest hit by this recession suddenly need an offset.\n  If this is a matter of principle, it seems to me we have very bizarre \nprinciples. One principle we should all stand behind is supporting \nAmerican families when economic times are tough. Last week, half a \nmillion Americans applied for unemployment benefits for the first time.\n  Despite what some might suggest, our Nation's unemployment crisis is \nnot over. We know unemployment can persist long after recovery begins. \nThis downturn will continue affecting American families for months and \nyears to come.\n  That is why we need to extend Federal unemployment benefits now. \nWithout an extension, over 1 million Americans, including thousands of \nMinnesotans, will lose their benefits this month. Without those \nunemployment benefits, many families will have no other way to keep \npaying their mortgage and buying groceries. Even with some economic \nprogress, there are still six applicants for every job opening, and in \nsome industries there are simply no jobs to be found.\n  Our obligation to America's working families is a serious one. When \nthere are jobs to be had, working and middle-class families keep our \neconomy running. After Wall Street's indiscretions were the cause of an \neconomic collapse and our government bailed them out, we are in no \nplace to tell America's families that there is not enough help to go \naround. Their interests should have been placed ahead of the big banks \nfrom the start.\n  Further, the provisions that are currently being blocked will also \nprovide\n\n[[Page S851]]\n\nfor the vital COBRA subsidy. Right now, the COBRA subsidy is helping \nAmerican families retain their health care coverage while they continue \nto look for work. Facing a medical crisis while being employed and \nuninsured is a burden most families simply cannot withstand. We should \nnot be putting Americans in that position when it is due to no fault of \ntheir own.\n  We should not be driving them to a place where they simply have run \nout of options. This procedural stalling is unacceptable. I have heard \nfrom Minnesota's employment commissioner that the expiration and \nsubsequent agreement on an extension will be an administrative burden \non our State, not to mention an inefficient use of State resources.\n  The delays are also stressful and disruptive for Minnesota's \nfamilies. This is the case in all 50 of our States. So I call on all of \nmy colleagues to come together today and stand behind the principle, \nthe principle of supporting American families when times are tough. \nThis is the principle on which we should all be focused and all be \njudged.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen.) The Senator from South Dakota \nis recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3338 to Amendment No. 3336\n\n       (Purpose: To create additional tax relief for businesses, \n     and for other purposes.)\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 3338 and ask for \nits immediate consideration.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, is the Senator asking unanimous consent \nto set aside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. THUNE. I would like to have my amendment be made pending.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. You wish to set aside the pending amendment?\n  Mr. THUNE. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3338 to amendment No. 3336.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, as we all know, our economy is suffering. \nWe have an unemployment rate that is currently at 9.7 percent. \nFurthermore, we have large portions of the population that are either \nunderemployed or have dropped out of the workforce because of limited \njob prospects.\n  There are a variety of factors that have contributed to this \nrecession. The government's response so far has been largely \nineffective, particularly with regard to employment, and I would argue \nthat the best thing that we can do to address the issue of unemployment \nand having to extend unemployment benefits and COBRA and other types of \nbenefits, all of which are considered in this underlying bill, is to \nget people back to work.\n  That is fundamentally the very best thing that we can be doing--\nfocusing on how we create jobs, how we grow this economy, how we \nprovide opportunities for those who have lost their jobs, who are \nunderemployed, to get back into the workforce. That, to me, ought to be \nthe focus of our efforts in the Senate.\n  The bill that was passed about a year ago, the stimulus legislation \nwhich we now know is going to cost somewhere in the neighborhood of \n$862 billion without interest, with interest well over $1 trillion, was \nall borrowed money. It is going to add $1 trillion to the national \ndebt.\n  Despite that amount of spending, only $6.2 billion was spent on tax \nincentives for small businesses, and another $730 million was spent in \nfunding for the Small Business Administration. So I want to think about \nfor a moment what that means in terms of the dimensions of the bill \nthat was passed last year. We had a $1 trillion bill. Together \nthe incentives for small business in that bill represented less than 1 \npercent of the total cost.\n\n  We all know small businesses have a much greater impact on the \neconomy and on employment than that number represents. Small businesses \nemploy more than half of all of the Nation's private sector employees. \nThey create nearly two-thirds of all of the new jobs and create a \ndisproportionate number of the patents that are issued in our Nation.\n  At the time we voted last year on the stimulus bill, I believe now \nthis was one example of the priorities in that legislation that were \nmisplaced if we are intent on and focused as a laser on creating jobs \nand getting this economy growing again.\n  I made the argument at the time, as did many of my colleagues--and we \noffered amendments in support of that belief--that the best way to get \nthe economy growing again is not to focus on a lot of government \nspending on new government programs, but, in fact, to provide \nincentives for small businesses, the engines of our economy; to get out \nthere and to start investing and to start creating jobs.\n  So I offered an amendment that was an alternative to the stimulus \nbill a year ago, which, according to the economic model developed by \nthe President's economic adviser, would have created twice as many \njobs, and it would have cost half of what this stimulus legislation is \ngoing to end up costing the taxpayers of this country--again, all of \nwhich is borrowed from future generations.\n  While the Senate passed a smaller jobs bill last week, Senators in \nthe Chamber were blocked from offering amendments. I wanted to offer \nthis amendment a week ago when we considered the other jobs bill that \npassed through here. That was a $15 billion jobs bill which I think is \nnow pending action in the House of Representatives.\n  But I am offering this amendment now because we have this underlying \ntax extenders bill, and I think it is important that we discuss and \ndebate how best we can stimulate the economy, how best we can grow the \neconomy, get it expanding again, and how best we can create jobs to get \npeople back to work. It seems to me, again, that ought to be the first \npriority on which we as a Senate get focused.\n  What my amendment would do is, it would, for the year 2010, extend \ndepreciation. It would permanently increase the section 179 deductions \nthat allow small business to expense more of the investment they make \nas opposed to having to depreciate those.\n  By lowering the cost of new capital expenditures, these provisions \nwould encourage companies to invest in new equipment, make capital \npurchases, capital investments; it would increase both growth and \nemployment. It would also eliminate capital gains taxes on small \nbusiness investment.\n  This simple, permanent reduction in taxes was supported by the \nPresident in his State of the Union Address, and it would increase \ninvestment as well in small businesses. This amendment also would allow \na 20-percent deduction for small business income. We currently have a \nlot of small business owners who pay their taxes at the individual \nlevel. It is called flowthrough income. They have a small business. The \nincome flows through to their individual tax returns and so they pay at \nindividual tax rates, and those tax rates are set to rise on small \nbusinesses beginning in 2011. In fact, a lot of our small businesses, \nabout half, are going to be impacted by those increases in marginal \nincome tax rates that will occur in 2011. This would help mitigate the \nimpact of those increases on the 20 million people working in small \nbusinesses, those small businesses which would be taxed at a higher \nrate under the President's tax proposals.\n  Finally, this bill would prevent Davis-Bacon prevailing wage \nrequirements from raising the cost for projects funded under the \nstimulus bill. While I understand the importance of good wages, \nprojects that comply with Davis-Bacon restrictions see labor costs on \naverage 22 percent higher than market rates. This stimulus bill was the \nfirst time where that requirement was inserted into this sort of a \nstimulus bill designed to create jobs and grow the economy. Waiving \nthese provisions will help eliminate the confusion and stretch taxpayer \ndollars so we get more bang for our buck in the amount of dollars \ncurrently out there, hopefully, trying to create jobs.\n  My amendment would be paid for by redirecting unspent or unobligated \nstimulus funds from the bill passed last year. Out of that $862 billion \nin spending, according to what we hear from\n\n[[Page S852]]\n\nthe administration's Web site, recovery.org, about 37 percent of that \nmoney has been spent as of the end of this last year. Bear in mind, a \nlot of that money is obligated, but we understand that the unspent, \nunobligated amount on the spending portion, not on the tax portion, is \nabout $160 billion. It would seem to me that if the purpose of all our \nefforts is to create jobs, we ought to begin to think about who creates \nthose jobs. Two-thirds of the jobs in our economy are created by small \nbusinesses. Why then should we not be focusing our efforts on creating \nincentives for small businesses to invest? Frankly, that would have \nbeen the way I would have gone about the stimulus bill.\n  Many of my colleagues offered amendments, and many of them supported \nmy amendment. I think I had 37 votes for my amendment that would have \nfocused in the stimulus bill of a year ago more on small businesses, \nwhereas the bill that ultimately passed only spent under 1 percent of \nthat total amount, almost $1 trillion, on small businesses which are \nthe economic engine, the job creators in the economy.\n  If we can figure out ways to get small businesses some relief so they \ncan start hiring again, we address all these other issues--9.7 percent \nunemployment which, incidentally, the promises made when the big \nstimulus bill passed last year was that if we didn't pass this stimulus \nbill, unemployment would go up to 8 percent. We have blown way by. That \nis at 9.7 percent. We were told it would create millions of jobs. We \nknow now that since its passage last year, we have actually lost 2.7 \nmillion jobs in the economy. Clearly, the prescription put in place is \nnot working. I argue that is largely because it was misdirected. It was \ndirected toward creating new bureaucracies in Washington, perhaps some \ngovernment jobs, but the fact is, the good-paying, permanent jobs in \nour economy are created in the private economy. The biggest creator of \nthose jobs is small businesses.\n  Frankly, we ought to be looking at what types of policies can we put \nin place that will create an environment in which small businesses can \ngo back out there, make investments, put people back to work and then \nwe start, hopefully, bringing the unemployment rate down, get people \nback employed again, and a lot of these measures we are now having to \ntake with regard to unemployment benefits hopefully would cost the \ntaxpayers a lot less. The best thing we could do for people who are \nwithout a job is to get them back to work. The best way to do that is \nto get small businesses hiring again.\n  One final point. One of the things I hear repeatedly from small \nbusinesses in South Dakota and across the country is there is a sort of \nparalysis about investors looking at investing in different areas and \ndifferent projects. But looking at Washington, DC, and seeing all this \npolicy uncertainty, they see this cloud over the economy. It is \ncreating economic anxiety. What I hear from a lot of small businesses \nand people who create jobs is that they are worried about the policy \nuncertainty in Washington, DC. Is Washington going to pass this massive \nnew health care bill which includes an employer mandate that would \nraise taxes on small businesses? Is Washington going to pass a climate \nchange bill that has punishing energy taxes, particularly on areas in \nthe Midwest? I have a couple of power plants in my State that are on \nice right now because of uncertainty about what is going to happen with \nregard to coal-fired power.\n  There is a lot of uncertainty out there swirling around about what \nCongress might do or, worse yet, what the EPA might do on their own. \nThere is uncertainty about what is going to happen with taxes. Are we \ngoing to see taxes go up in 2011? In fact, for small businesses, about \nhalf who do allow their income from their small business to flow \nthrough to their individual income tax return are going to see those \nmarginal rates increase when they go from 33 to 36 and 35 to 39.6 \npercent, significant tax increases, which is why I have a deduction for \nsmall business income as part of this amendment. We need to bring some \ncertainty to small businesses in the area of taxes, certainty with \nregard to regulation, certainty with regard to the litigation \nenvironment. We have so much uncertainty swirling around Washington, it \nis creating a huge cloud.\n  Now we have a situation where small businesses are making decisions \nbased upon political factors rather than economic factors. We want them \nmaking decisions based upon economic factors, not worrying what has \nbecome the new center of gravity, and that is Washington, DC. \nWashington cannot create permanent, good-paying jobs in our economy. \nThose can only be recreated in the economy as we unleash small \nbusinesses and entrepreneurs and provide incentives for them to do what \nthey do best. That is to grow their businesses and to make capital \ninvestments and to create jobs.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is paid for. It \nis offset. This doesn't add anything to the debt. We don't have to \nborrow money. All we do is redirect unspent, unobligated stimulus \nmoneys, moneys left over from last year's stimulus bill toward small \nbusiness tax incentives which, frankly, many of us argue--and I argued \nat the time and I hope more people agree now--should have been a \ngreater focus of the stimulus in the first place. If we are serious \nabout creating jobs, we have to go to where the job creators are. The \neconomic engine is small business. My amendment creates tax incentives \nfor them to go out and create jobs and does it in a way that doesn't \nadd to the deficit, doesn't add more borrowing and allows the small \nbusinesses to do what they do best.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I rise to address the Republican \nfilibuster attacking the American worker and the Republican filibuster \nattacking America's small businesses.\n  I had the chance to go home this weekend. I started my trip home in \nDeschutes County where there is 14 percent unemployment. Next door to \nDeschutes, Crook County has 16.8 percent unemployment. That is only \ncounting workers officially unemployed as opposed to those who have \ngiven up on finding jobs. I went down to Klamath County to the south, \nwith 12.6 percent unemployment. I went to Hood River and Columbia \nGorge, Washington County, the Portland metropolitan area. Everywhere I \nwent in Oregon, whether it be eastern or western or north or south--\nbecause I was in every quarter this weekend--citizens wanted to know \nwhy are the Republicans attacking the American worker and American \nsmall business?\n  Across this country, our working families are in trouble. They are \nlooking to this body for help. They want to know when are we going to \nget it done. And by ``it,'' they mean extension of unemployment \nbenefits. They want to know when are we going to get extended the COBRA \nhealth benefits. They want to know when we are going to fix the \nMedicare rates that changed today and dropped more than 20 percent so \nthat it is that much harder to get into the door of a doctor if you are \na senior. They want to know why transportation projects are grinding to \na halt, even though we need those jobs.\n  The answer lies in this Chamber. This attack on the American worker \nby the Republican filibuster is unacceptable. This attack on the \nAmerican senior is unacceptable. This attack on American small business \nis unacceptable.\n  Not only does this directly impact working Americans and retired \nAmericans, it also affects the economy. Unemployment insurance, COBRA \nextensions are good for the economy. They help put food on the table. \nThey help pay the rent. All of that money stays in our economy. All of \nit goes for most families, because they have bills to pay to businesses \nin the communities. Those businesses can then pay their workers and pay \ntheir contractors. One of the best bangs for the buck in terms of \neconomic growth is right before us in unemployment insurance and a \nCOBRA extension.\n  I have puzzled over this challenge. Because what I have observed is \nthis: When it comes to giving away money\n\n[[Page S853]]\n\nout of the Treasury to the wealthiest Americans, my colleagues across \nthe aisle are delivering it on a silver platter to the wealthiest and \nbest off. But when it comes to a plan to assist working Americans and \nseniors and small businesses, my colleagues across the aisle, through \nthis Republican filibuster, are taking the hatchet to them. They are \nsaying: Working Americans don't count. We only want to have benefits on \nthe silver platter for the wealthiest.\n  It is working Americans who made this Nation great. It is the \nAmerican middle class that created the strongest economy in the world. \nIt is the American public school system and our working families that \nhave come up with the industriousness and the ingenuity to take this \nNation forward.\n  When I am talking about the silver platter the Republicans have for \nthe wealthiest in America, let's examine the details. Unfunded \nRepublican program, 2001 tax cuts, a $1.35 trillion giveaway, borrowed \nfrom the next generation, from our children. That is quite a gift. That \nis quite a silver platter. The 2003 tax cuts, $350 billion delivered on \na silver platter for the wealthiest Americans. Medicare Part D, an \nunfunded program, $400 billion on a silver platter; the Iraq and \nAfghanistan wars, almost $1 trillion--$944 billion--through June of \n2009. The total this year will exceed $1 trillion, unpaid for, \nunfunded, borrowed from our children.\n\n  There have been some colleagues rising to say how this is a matter of \nbeing consistent in paying for American programs. But when you check \nthe record, they voted time and time again for unfunded giveaways to \nthe wealthiest Americans--the 2001 tax cuts, the 2003 tax cuts. And \nthey voted for other programs I like but they were not funded, and I \ninclude in that Medicare Part D.\n  When I hear a colleague talking about fiscal responsibility, it is a \nlittle like listening to Bernie Madoff talking about tough accounting \nrules; it is a little bit like hearing from Brett Favre about promising \nhe will retire; it is a little bit like listening to Simon Cowell \ndelivering a lecture that people should not utilize sarcasm. Because \nafter these trillions of dollars of unfunded giveaways, my colleagues \nhave put together a Republican filibuster to attack the American worker \nin a completely inconsistent manner.\n  I have a different outlook. I think many of my colleagues here have a \ndifferent outlook. We should be here to make America work for working \nAmericans. That means when they are hurting, we are going to assist \nthem with unemployment insurance, we are going to help with the COBRA \nextension, we are going to help with these loans to small businesses, \nand we are going to help our seniors by fixing that Medicare provision. \nWe are not going to take the hammer to those programs. We are going to \nassist our working families.\n  Because of this Republican filibuster, nearly 1.2 million Americans \nwill lose their benefits, and by June this number will grow to 5 \nmillion unemployed workers who will be left without vital benefits if \nCongress does not act.\n  Let's talk about that small business provision. Small business owners \nhave been hurt because the Small Business Administration's general \nbusiness loan program expired yesterday, making it more difficult for \nour small businesses to access loans in an already difficult business \nclimate.\n  My colleague from South Dakota was just on the floor speaking about \nthe importance of helping small businesses. But I say to him and the \nRepublican filibuster attacking small business in America: Come to this \nfloor and say enough is enough; I am going to stand with our workers \nand our seniors and our small businesses.\n  It is time to end the political posturing, take our eyes off November \nand put our eyes on the challenge of American families, and pass this \nlegislation right away.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, first of all, I want to thank the \nSenator from Oregon for those very passionate comments. We have had the \nopportunity to join in a number of forums to speak out about the \nimportance of creating jobs in America and of helping those who through \nno fault of their own have lost their job, and I thank the Senator for \nhis eloquence and passion again this evening.\n  I come to the floor to also add my voice to what I believe to be an \noutrageous situation. I say this with all due respect to my friend from \nKentucky. We work together on a number of issues, and I look forward to \ncontinuing to do that. But on this I believe what is being done is \nabsolutely wrong. It is outrageous.\n  We are in a situation right now where nearly 135,000 Michigan \nresidents will lose the unemployment assistance they need by the end of \nthis month if we do not take action immediately. That is just in 1 \nmonth as to people who have been hit by nothing less than an economic \ntsunami.\n  We have a sense of urgency when an earthquake happens, when storms \ncome, and the floods come. Well, to families across this country, the \nstorms have come. They have been here--in our case for years--and we \nneed to have the same sense of urgency as any other disaster would call \nus, focusing not only on helping people who have lost their job but in \ncreating jobs.\n  I am proud to be a part of a caucus that has placed jobs at the \nforefront and a President who, last year, started at the beginning of \nthe year with a jobs bill, a Recovery Act, and moving on, and this year \nwith an entire jobs agenda. But the reality is that until jobs are \ncreated, we have millions of people in this country who have played by \nthe rules all their lives, paid their taxes, cared about their \nfamilies, gave back to their communities, and their only sin is the \nfact that they have lost their job through no fault of their own.\n  They are trying to keep a roof over their head, keep food on the \ntable, keep the heat on, trying to make sure their kids have what they \nneed. Most of them are receiving $200 or $300 a week to try to hold it \ntogether while they go job training, while they look every day for \nwork. People want to work. This is not about people who do not want to \nwork. People want to work. But we have six people applying for every \none job in America.\n  So while we focus on job creation and partnering with the private \nsector to make that happen, we have millions of people in America who \ndo not understand how something such as merely extending unemployment \nbenefits could be held up. Last night, the unemployment benefits \nstopped that process now. This month, people are getting notices, \nafraid about what is going to happen to themselves and their families.\n  What we have is a misuse of the rules, in my judgment. What we have \nis an objection, and it is one for which we have been down here many \ntimes. We have the charts now. We have had it happen over 116 times \nthis session, where we have seen objections, bringing to a halt the \nwill of the majority, blocking the democratic process of voting--of \nsimply voting--and being able to solve problems and move things \nforward.\n  I received an e-mail from a woman in Livonia, MI, who lost her job \nlast year. She took the opportunity to go back to school to get new job \nskills to become a registered dietitian. But now, as she is doing that, \nbecause of this obstruction, this woman is going to lose the help she \nneeds to allow her to make it and keep a roof over her head while she \nis turning the corner and gaining new skills to get a new job. The rug \nis, frankly, being pulled out from under her, and I think that is \noutrageous.\n  She is not alone. As I indicated before, we have nearly 135,000 \npeople in Michigan who will lose the help they need under unemployment \nbenefits by the end of this month if we do not act, and act \nimmediately.\n  I received another e-mail from a woman in Greenbush, MI. She and her \nhusband both worked at the same manufacturing plant. It is a common \nstory in Michigan. They both lost their job. She writes:\n\n       We are both seeking work and schooling for new careers. We \n     have both eceived a letter from the unemployment office that \n     our benefits will end. We have no other source of income and \n     we fear we will lose our home.\n\n  This is real for millions of people across this country, millions of \nmiddle-class families who assume that in a disaster, an economic \ndisaster, their government, the people of the country, will step up to \nhelp. That is what unemployment benefits are all about.\n  It is time to act, it is time to stop blocking democracy. If my \nfriend from\n\n[[Page S854]]\n\nKentucky has an amendment to offer, offer it, debate it, and vote. But \njust blocking us from exercising our right to vote is not the American \nway. The American way is to vote, to act, to make decisions, not to \nblock. We have seen way too much of blocking democracy from our \nRepublican colleagues in these last months and months.\n  I also want to speak to other provisions in this bill because I find \nit interesting that within hours of the health care summit last \nThursday, the blocking of this bill showed us what the health care plan \nis by Republicans: cut people off from help with COBRA, cut doctors' \nbenefits. That came within hours of the health care summit. We are now \ngetting calls from people who are concerned about whether their doctor \nis going to be available.\n  Are senior citizens under Medicare going to be able to see their same \ndoctor because of the cuts that will happen if we do not act \nimmediately? People who one day lost their job, the next day lost their \nhealth care--we have been able to help them through the jobs bill we \npassed last February to be able to continue their health insurance \nthrough work. It is expensive to do under something called COBRA, but \nwe have been able to help them do that by helping to pay on a short-\nterm basis for part of that cost.\n  So the health care summit happens on Thursday, and hours later there \nis an objection that will stop health care for hundreds of thousands if \nnot millions of Americans, and stop the ability of doctors to be \nreimbursed at a fair rate to be able to care for their patients. This \nis, in my judgment, an absolutely outrageous situation, and it has to \nstop.\n  I thank our chairman of the Finance Committee for his work and \nadvocacy and being here on the floor calling for us to vote. I am \nhopeful people around the country will speak out loudly between tonight \nand tomorrow and that we will be able to come to the floor and stop \nwhat is effectively blocking the democratic process and blocking our \nability to vote, to make decisions, and to move forward.\n  We have millions of Americans who are counting on us to understand \nwhat is happening in real people's lives every day--not political \ngames, not all the partisanship, but real people's lives--who are going \nto get up tomorrow morning and say: OK, what do I do now? How am I \ngoing to keep my roof over my head? And how am I going to continue to \ngo to school to get that new skills I need? How am I going to put food \non the table for my family? That is what is affecting people across \nthis country.\n  In addition to the millions of people who have lost their job and are \non unemployment, we have millions of others who are one paycheck away \nfrom being in the very same situation--people who could be spending in \nthe economy now to be able to help move things forward, who are afraid \nof what happens next. Part of that fear is not only will they have a \njob, but what happens if they do not? And what is the message that is \nsent if we do not make it clear we will be there for them if that \nhappens? Will they be able to continue to have the basics to keep their \nfamily going?\n  I strongly urge we do everything possible. I know we will stop this \nobstruction, to allow the democratic process to go forward, to allow us \nto vote, to solve problems, to move this bill forward, and send a very \nstrong message that we understand what is happening to millions of \nfamilies who have faced a disaster of epic proportions. It is truly as \nmuch a disaster as anything else any community has ever felt in terms \nof losing their jobs and fighting and working to get something.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we are here to do the people's business. \nThe folks in our home States elected us to do what is right. Most folks \ndon't care too much about the process, as long as we get our job done \nand as long as it is reasonable, within the boundaries of \nreasonableness, and as long as they think we give the subject \nconsiderable thought. I think we agree that is true. I think it is \nlargely true that most of the people would think: Well, gee, why don't \nyou go ahead and pass that extenders thing you are talking about back \nthere because it is the right thing to do.\n  People need to collect their unemployment checks. They need their \nhealth insurance. Some of these tax provisions need to be continued; \notherwise, this is a job-killer action the other side is taking. It is \na job destroyer. To not continue these provisions actually destroys \njobs. That is not what we want to do.\n  On another matter: The Senator from South Dakota proposes an \namendment to make a series of tax cuts for small business. I might say \nthat some of these tax cuts, the ones he proposes, actually have merit. \nWe in the Finance Committee hope to address small business tax cuts in \na markup perhaps as early as this month. This is a jobs agenda. It is \nadditional legislation to help create jobs, preserve jobs, and help the \nrecovery come along a little more quickly.\n  The offset, however, that the Senator from South Dakota proposes is \nanother matter. The Senator from South Dakota seeks to pay for his \namendment by cutting funding from the Recovery Act, and that idea does \nnot have much merit, at least not in this Senator's judgment. Pretty \nmuch the last thing we should do is to be seeking to cut the Recovery \nAct.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the independent \norganization we rely upon around here--both sides of the aisle in both \nbodies--says the Recovery Act is working. The Congressional Budget Act \nsays that in the third quarter of last year, for example, the Recovery \nAct caused between 600,000 and 1.6 million people to have jobs. That \nsounds as though it is working to me. The CBO also said these people \nhad jobs who would not otherwise have had jobs. I, therefore, think we \nshould not be cutting back on the Recovery Act; rather, we should let \nit work its will.\n  The investments the Senator from South Dakota seeks to cut in \naddition are largely within the jurisdiction of the Appropriations \nCommittee and, thus, I will defer to the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee who I think at the appropriate time will have quite a bit to \nsay about this Thune amendment and will speak to it at greater length. \nI suggest that is an appropriate time to have a more lengthy discussion \non this matter.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S854-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S854-S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n             CONGRATULATIONS TO MINNESOTA'S 2010 OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, 50 years ago this month, a group of \nathletes gathered in Squaw Valley, CA, for the Winter Olympics. A part \nof the U.S. contingent--the 1960 men's ice hockey team--unexpectedly \nsurprised the world and brought home the Olympic gold medal by \ndefeating the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and Canada. Of these 17 \nremarkable men, 8 were from my home State, the great State of \nMinnesota. As anyone could see from watching this year's games, this \noutsized contribution from Minnesotans continues to this day.\n  Twenty years after this ``forgotten miracle,'' Team USA again shocked \nthe world by miraculously defeating Finland and the vaunted Soviet \nUnion to again win the gold medal. Thirteen Minnesotans played for the \n1980 ``Miracle on Ice'' team, and a 14th was their coach.\n  This year's Olympic men's ice hockey team was considered by many not \nto have a chance for a medal. They were too young, too inexperienced; \nthey had not played together before. And the U.S. men had not defeated \nCanada in Olympic play in 50 years. Yet a week ago, despite being the \nunderdog, Team USA upset the favored Canadians in their own arena.\n  After defeating Switzerland and soundly beating Finland in the semi-\nfinals, Team USA played Canada a second time last night for the gold \nmedal. Although we fell behind early, Zach\n\n[[Page S855]]\n\nParise--a Prior Lake, MN, native--tied the game with under a minute to \nplay. Sadly for us, Canada would end up scoring in overtime to win the \ngold medal. But that cannot take away from what was truly a golden \nperformance by the Americans. Jamie Langenbrunner, from Cloquet, did a \nstand-up job as captain, leading and pulling together a team that also \nincluded Minnesotans Erik Johnson, from Bloomington, and David Backes, \nfrom Blaine.\n  The American women's ice hockey team was expected to be great. And \nthey were. Before falling to Canada, they had outscored their opponents \n40-2. With Edina native Natalie Darwitz as captain, as well as Jenny \nPotter from Edina and Gigi Marvin from Warroad, they brought home a \nwell-earned silver medal.\n  And of the 12 members of the U.S. Olympic curling team, 8 are from \nMinnesota. Natalie Nicholson of Bemidji and Allison Pottinger of Eden \nPrairie were on the women's team. The men's team was an all-Minnesota \naffair with John Shuster and Jason Smith of Chisholm, Chris Plys and \nJeff Isaacson of Duluth and John Benton of St. Michael. Even their \ncoach, Phil Drobnick is from Eveleth, MN.\n  Tony Benshoof of White Bear Lake is an Olympic luger. Kaylin \nRichardson of Edina was in her second Olympics, competing in alpine \nskiing. Wynn Roberts of Battle Lake was a competitor in the biathlon. \nRebekah Bradford of Apple Valley is an Olympic speedskater. And Caitlin \nCompton and Garrott Kuzzy, each of Minneapolis, competed in cross-\ncountry skiing.\n  And there are many other Olympic athletes, like Lindsey Vonn, who \nhave strong Minnesota ties but reside now in other States--which have \nmountains.\n  Yesterday marked the end of the 2010 Winter Olympic Games in \nVancouver. I am so proud to see that there were more athletes in this \nyear's Olympics from Minnesota than from any other State. Twenty-one \nMinnesotans took part in these games. Most were in their first \nOlympics. A few others were in their second Games. Natalie Darwitz has \nbeen to three. Jenny Potter has now been to four, winning a medal every \ntime. Isn't that something--four-time medal-winning Olympian and mother \nof two.\n  Twenty-one athletes from all over Minnesota who now will be going \nback to tending a bar or being a teacher or being an engineer or a mom. \nNatalie Nicholson will return to Red Lake Indian Reservation as a nurse \npractitioner. The men's ice hockey players will be going back to finish \nthe National Hockey League season. John Shuster will be getting \nmarried. All will continue to inspire us.\n  I congratulate every single one of these competitors. Each has shown \ntremendous grit and determination to earn a place representing our \nNation at these Winter Olympics. Whether you won a medal, or simply \ngave it your all and competed, each of you is a champion.\n  Olympians make the children of our State and Nation dream of what \nthey might do, and grownups like me dream of what we wish we could do, \nall while fulfilling their dreams on the world's stage and representing \nour Nation admirably. We owe them thanks for their hard work, their \nperseverance, and most of all their heart. And I hope I have the chance \nin the coming weeks to meet with each of these Minnesota athletes so I \ncan congratulate them in person.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S855-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING JESSE WHITE TUMBLERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to congratulate a well-loved \nChicago institution on a landmark anniversary.\n  For 50 years, the Jesse White Tumblers troupe has delighted audiences \nin Illinois and beyond and opened doors of opportunity for thousands of \nyoung people.\n  Jesse White, the man who gave the team its name, is probably best \nknown today as Illinois' secretary of state and the first African \nAmerican ever elected to statewide office in the ``Land of Lincoln.''\n  As a child, Jesse White was studious and well behaved. He was also a \nphenomenal athlete. His passion for sports won him a scholarship to \nAlabama State University, where he was all-conference in baseball and \nbasketball for all 4 years.\n  After college, Jesse White served 2 years in the U.S. Army as a \nparatrooper.\n  Then sports opened another door for him. Jesse White was able to \nfulfill what for many of us is only a dream. He played professional \nbaseball for the Chicago Cubs Triple-A farm team.\n  Returning to Chicago after his baseball days, Jesse White decided to \nbecome a Chicago Public Schools teacher. He also worked nights as a \nphysical education teacher for the Chicago Park District.\n  In 1959, the park district asked him to create an acrobatic show. The \nresult was so impressive that the troupe began performing on a regular \nbasis. Its mission was--and remains--to keep children in school, off of \ndrugs, and out of gangs in the Chicago area. And it has been a huge \nsuccess.\n  A half century later, more than 11,000 young people have participated \nin the Jesse White Tumblers. Becoming a Jesse White Tumbler is no easy \ntask. Thousands of young people apply every year but only a fraction \nare chosen. To make the team, members must stay in school and maintain \nat least a C average. They have to obey the law and stay out of gangs \nand away from drugs and alcohol. In exchange, the young athletes get to \nexperience the excitement and glory of performing before appreciative \nfans. They also receive tutoring and college scholarship opportunities, \nperformance fees, and a chance to travel and perform around the world.\n  The power of the Jesse White Tumblers to transform young lives and \nopen new doors may be best illustrated by the story of three brothers. \nThey performed together with the Tumblers, but at some point they \ndecided together to drop out and join a gang. One of the brothers was \nmurdered by a rival gang. The second brother, seeking to avenge his \nbrother's death, killed an innocent man by mistake and ended up going \nto jail for murder. Instead of following in his brothers' footsteps, \nthe third brother decided to rejoin the Jesse White Tumblers. The \ndirection and discipline he received helped him not only avoid the \npitfalls of his siblings but helped him earn a college education and \neventually a law degree from the University of Notre Dame.\n  Multiply that story hundreds or even thousands of times and you begin \nto understand the importance of the Jesse White Tumblers.\n  The Jesse White Tumblers have earned their reputation as an icon in \nthe State of Illinois. The program has done wonders, and I wish it \nanother 50 years of continued success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S855-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S855-S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            LIBRARY OF CONGRESS OFFICE IN JAKARTA, INDONESIA\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, as my colleagues are aware, the Library \nof Congress, LOC, diligently works to keep the Congress fully informed \non a plethora of issues. Today I would like to highlight the important \nwork of a component of the LOC that is less known to colleagues, and \nthat is its operation in Southeast Asia. The work of this regional \noperation immensely contributes to U.S. understanding of Southeast \nAsia, the Pacific Islands, China and India, thereby facilitating our \nforeign policy objectives.\n  The LOC office is one of six overseas offices operated by the \nOverseas Operations Division of the LOC. Staff to the overseas offices \n``acquire, catalog, preserve and distribute library and research \nmaterials . . . and provide assistance to the U.S. Congress.''\n  For too many Americans, Southeast Asia is a distant unknown. In \nreality, the region is of significant economic importance to the \nAmerican people. The approximately 580-million citizens--and \nconsumers--of the 10 nations comprising the Association of Southeast \nAsian Nations, ASEAN, represent the fourth largest market for American \nexports.\n  Based in Jakarta, the mission of the LOC regional operation is \ndiverse. Primary among its responsibilities is to provide research and \ninformation services to the U.S. Congress and the Congressional \nResearch Service. Jakarta LOC staff also manage the Cooperative \nAcquisitions Program, CAPSEA, whereby they acquire materials from \ncountries in the region on behalf of the LOC and member institutions, \nwhich\n\n[[Page S856]]\n\ninclude 30 U.S. research libraries and 10 international research \nlibraries.\n  It is important to note the ongoing, extensive assistance the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee receives from the Jakarta LOC office. \nResearch and preparation for committee projects on issues ranging from \nglobal food security, to international trade, nonproliferation, the \nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative, EITI, counterterrorism \nand human trafficking, have been augmented by the diligent efforts of \nLOC staff in Jakarta and elsewhere in the region.\n  The Jakarta LOC office ensures that the U.S. Congress and the \nCongressional Research Service have up-to-date legal and legislative \nregional information, and it assists other U.S. Government agencies in \nproviding and sharing open source information as well as acquiring \npublications.\n  The Jakarta LOC office has also worked with the House Democracy \nPartnership, HDP, and The Asia Foundation to create a legislative \nlibrary for the National Parliament of Timor-Leste and to train the \nlibrary staff, and is cooperating with the HDP to develop a \nparliamentary research service and an improved information technology \nsystem there.\n  Indonesia is a young democracy. Its Parliament is confronted with \nmany challenges, including the development of its own operational and \nstaff infrastructure. The LOC office in Jakarta serves as a bridge \nfacilitating communications and meetings between the staff of the U.S. \nCongress and the Indonesian Parliament. Our counterparts in the \nIndonesian Parliament have expressed appreciation for this initiative.\n  In conclusion, I am grateful for the assistance provided to the U.S. \nSenate by the Southeast Asia LOC office, and wanted to take this \nopportunity to openly convey my appreciation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S856-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING SAM HAMILTON\n\n Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I speak today to \ncommemorate the life of a true friend of Florida, Mr. Sam Hamilton, who \npassed away on Saturday. In September of last year, Mr. Hamilton became \nthe Director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. That was a \nfitting position for a man who had dedicated 30 years to protecting the \nNation's natural resources and wildlife.\n  Long before he was Director of Fish and Wildlife, Mr. Hamilton was \ncommitted to this country's wild spaces. Just last month, I was \nfortunate enough to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for an \nEverglades restoration project called the Picayune Strand, and Mr. \nHamilton was there. It was a proud day for us all, but certainly for a \nman who had worked so long on Everglades issues and knew how much this \nproject would benefit the endangered Florida panther. On that unusually \ncold morning, he spoke about his experience in the Youth Conservation \nCorps at 15 years old in Mississippi and how that molded his dedication \nto wildlife conservation. Mr. Hamilton started his career with the U.S. \nFish and Wildlife Service in Texas. He moved up the ranks to become the \nsoutheast region's director based in Atlanta.\n  During his time in Atlanta, he oversaw the Service's role in \nrestoring the Everglades ecosystem. He took the Service's role of \nadvising Federal agencies with regard to the Endangered Species Act \nseriously. He knew the ins and outs of the Apalachicola-Chatahoochee-\nFlint River Basin, and worked to protect the threatened and endangered \nspecies that call that system home, like the gulf sturgeon and the \npurple bankclimber mussel.\n  Mr. Hamilton was an avid fisher and hunter, and this gave him \nperspective on how to work with people from different backgrounds \ntowards a common goal of conserving America's wildlife and the habitat \nthat sustains it. I know that I echo my friends at the Department of \nthe Interior like Secretary Ken Salazar and the Assistant Secretary for \nFish and Wildlife and Parks Tom Strickland when I say that Mr. Hamilton \nwill be sorely missed and his great contributions to my state and the \ncountry at large will not be forgotten. And to his family: wife Becky, \nsons Sam Jr. and Clay, and grandson Davis, you are in our thoughts \nduring this difficult time. Thank you for helping your husband, father, \nand grandfather to serve this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S856-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO KATHERINE PATERSON\n\n Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I wish to acknowledge the \nlifetime work and recent achievements of Katherine Paterson of Barre, \nVT. Recently, Ms. Paterson was named National Ambassador for Young \nPeople's Literature by the Librarian of Congress James H. Billington.\n  Katherine Paterson's accomplishments as an author surely merit her \nappointment. She has twice been awarded the prestigious Newbery Medal, \nonce for ``Bridge to Terabithia'' and a second time for ``Jacob Have I \nLoved.'' In addition, she won the National Book Award, also twice, for \n``The Great Gilly Hopkins'' and ``The Master Puppeteer.'' Nor are these \nthe only major recognitions of her importance as one of the major \nwriters of our time. She has won 19 additional literary awards for \nother works, including the Hans Christian Andersen Medal, the Astrid \nLindgren Memorial Award and the Governor's Award for Excellence in the \nArts, which was awarded to her by her home State of Vermont.\n  Katherine Paterson was named a Living Legend by the Library of \nCongress in 2000.\n  Her most recent book is ``The Day of the Pelican,'' a moving, \ndramatic story of a refugee family's flight from war-torn Kosovo to \nAmerica. It is the 2010 selection for Vermont Reads, a statewide \nreading program.\n  Katherine Paterson has long been dedicated to promoting literacy \namong young people, which makes her appointment as National Ambassador \nfor Young People's Literature particularly appropriate. She has chosen \n``Read for Your Life'' as the theme for her platform for the upcoming 2 \nyears as National Ambassador. Throughout her tenure, she will be a most \narticulate advocate for the importance of literature in young people's \nlives.\n  We in Vermont are proud of Katherine Paterson's accomplishments as a \nwriter. We are proud of her dedication to literacy among young readers. \nAnd, at this moment, we are proud that our national library, the \nLibrary of Congress, has conferred upon her this new honor, and the \nenlarged task of being the Nation's leading advocate for young people's \nliterature.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S856-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S856-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S856-5", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S856-S857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          PROPOSED CONSTITUTION FOR THE VIRGIN ISLANDS--PM 47\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  In accordance with the requirements of Public Law 94-584 (the \n``Act''), I hereby transmit to the Congress a proposed constitution for \nthe United States Virgin Islands (USVI). The constitution, drafted by \nthe Fifth Constitutional Convention of the United States Virgin \nIslands, was submitted to me on December 31, 2009, by Governor John P. \ndeJongh, United States Virgin Islands. In submitting the proposed \nconstitution, Governor deJongh expressed his concerns about several \nprovisions of the proposed constitution, but he also expressed his hope \nthat the people of the United States Virgin Islands continue to ``move \nahead towards [their] goal of increased local governmental autonomy.''\n  The Act requires that I submit this proposed constitution to the \nCongress,\n\n[[Page S857]]\n\nalong with my comments. The Congress then has 60 days to amend, modify, \nor approve the proposed constitution. If approved, or approved with \nmodification, the constitution will be submitted for a referendum in \nthe Virgin Islands for acceptance or rejection by the people.\n  In carrying out my responsibilities pursuant to the Act, I asked the \nDepartment of Justice, in consultation with the Department of the \nInterior, to provide its views of the proposed constitution. The \nDepartment of Justice concluded that several features of the proposed \nconstitution warrant analysis and comment, including: (1) the absence \nof an express recognition of United States sovereignty and the \nsupremacy of Federal law; (2) provisions for a special election on the \nUSVI's territorial status; (3) provisions conferring legal advantages \non certain groups defined by place and timing of birth, timing of \nresidency, or ancestry; (4) residence requirements for certain offices; \n(5) provisions guaranteeing legislative representation of certain \ngeographic areas; (6) provisions addressing territorial waters and \nmarine resources; (7) imprecise language in certain provisions of the \nproposed constitution's bill of rights; (8) the possible need to repeal \ncertain Federal laws if the proposed USVI constitution is adopted; and \n(9) the effect of congressional action or inaction on the proposed \nconstitution.\n  To assist the Congress in its deliberations about this important \nmatter, I attach the analysis of the Department of Justice, with which \nthe Department of the Interior concurs.

A bill to amend the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation \nAct of 1977 to permit the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund to be used \nfor transportation and use of dredged materials for abandoned mine \nreclamation, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation concerning the beneficial use of materials derived from \nriver dredging activities. This concept was the subject of a Committee \nResolution passed by the Committee on Environment and Public Works on \nOctober 26, 2005.\n  This legislation relates directly to the deepening of the Delaware \nRiver, which was authorized in the 1992 Water Resources Development \nAct. The project deepens from 40 to 45 feet the main shipping channel \nof the Delaware River from Philadelphia and Camden, NJ, to the mouth of \nthe Delaware Bay. Deepening the river will help sustain and grow the \nmaritime economy of the Delaware Valley region, as the river's current \ndepth, which has remained stagnant since 1941, does not accommodate the \nsize of most modern ships.\n  Despite the tremendous benefit the deepening will have on the region, \nsome concerns have been raised regarding the disposal of the dredge \nmaterial that will be produced during the deepening process. Currently, \nthe Army Corps of Engineers dredges the river every year to maintain \nthe 40-foot depth and deposits materials in Corps-owned sites along the \nriver. While capacity remains at these sites, there are compelling \nquestions about whether dredge material may have other useful purposes.\n  On October 26, 2005, the Committee on Environment and Public Works \npassed a Resolution requesting the Army Corps of Engineers to study the \nbeneficial uses of dredge material from the Delaware River, including \nthe potential for use in coal and other mine restoration areas. The \nCorps has undertaken this study with funding I secured for the past \nseveral years and intend to request this year and in the future. The \noutcome of this study could yield tremendous benefits for the Nation, \nincluding in the Delaware Valley region and in Pennsylvania, where \nthere are already proposals to use the dredge materials.\n  One such proposal involves using dredge material from the Delaware \nRiver Deepening project to reclaim abandoned mine lands in northeast \nPennsylvania. One likely benefit would be stream quality improvement in \nthe Pocono Mountains due to a reduction in acid mine flows. This \nproposal would also help advance an economic development project in \nHazleton, PA, which could potentially create thousands of jobs and \ncontribute to the economic development of a region still impacted by \nthe decline of the coal industry. The use of dredge material for these \npurposes has been endorsed by numerous local elected officials, state \nlegislators and members of the community.\n  The legislation I have introduced would authorize the use of funding \nunder the Abandoned Mine Reclamation Fund for the transportation and \nuse of dredge material in the reclamation of abandoned mines. \nSpecifically, an eligible use of this funding would be for dredging \nmaterial from the Delaware River for use in abandoned mines around the \nState of Pennsylvania. This use could significantly reduce the amount \nof additional dredge material deposited along the river as well as \nadvance the mine cleanup effort which has been ongoing for decades in \nPennsylvania.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/01/senate-section/article/S859-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S859-S860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 427--DESIGNATING THE FIRST WEEK OF APRIL 2010 AS \n                  ``NATIONAL ASBESTOS AWARENESS WEEK''\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS (for himself, Mr. Tester, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Isakson, Mrs. \nMurray, Mr. Reid, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Leahy) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 428\n\n       Whereas since his election as the President of Venezuela in \n     1998, Hugo Chavez has systematically weakened democratic \n     institutions in Venezuela by restricting individual rights \n     and the activities of political parties, discouraging the \n     free exchange of ideas, and centralizing and expanding the \n     powers of the Executive over the other branches of government \n     and the people of Venezuela;\n       Whereas Article 57 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian \n     Republic of Venezuela guarantees the right of all citizens to \n     freely express their thoughts and opinions;\n       Whereas Article 68 of the Constitution of the Bolivarian \n     Republic of Venezuela guarantees the right of all citizens to \n     peacefully demonstrate and prohibits the use of firearms or \n     toxic substances to control peaceful demonstrations;\n       Whereas on May 24, 2007, the Senate approved by unanimous \n     consent Senate Resolution 211, 110th Congress, expressing \n     profound concern about the transgression against freedom of \n     thought and expression that was being carried out in \n     Venezuela by the refusal of President Chavez to renew the \n     broadcasting license of ``Radio Caracas Television'', also \n     known as RCTV;\n       Whereas on May 24, 2007, the European Parliament adopted a \n     Resolution criticizing the non-renewal of the RCTV license \n     for undermining the right of the press to hold the \n     authorities to account;\n       Whereas Venezuela and Cuba are the only 2 Western \n     Hemisphere countries listed in the United States Commission \n     for International Religious Freedom ``Watch List'' as \n     countries requiring close monitoring due to the nature and \n     extent of violation of religious freedom engaged in or \n     tolerated by their governments;\n       Whereas the 2009 Report of the United States Commission for \n     International Religious Freedom states that in Venezuela, \n     ``religious communities and leaders viewed as political \n     opponents are routinely targeted and harassed by government \n     officials;\n       Whereas several international human rights organizations \n     have consistently expressed serious concerns regarding \n     weakening of respect for human rights in Venezuela;\n       Whereas on January 24, 2010, President Chavez ordered what \n     amounted to a shutdown of ``Radio Caracas Television \n     Internacional'' due to its failure to air one of his \n     speeches;\n       Whereas on the night of January 25, 2010, 2 students were \n     killed and 5 others were injured by gunfire during peaceful \n     demonstrations against the order by President Chavez to \n     shutdown RCTV Internacional;\n       Whereas the Government of Venezuela has increasingly failed \n     to address the legitimate needs of its people for greater \n     economic, political, and social opportunities and has \n     aggravated political divisions in Venezuela; and\n       Whereas the Government of Venezuela has engaged in a \n     military build-up that goes beyond the reasonable security \n     concerns of the Venezuelan state and threatens to launch a \n     destabilizing regional arms race: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the recurring and ongoing repression of \n     peaceful demonstrators in Venezuela by security forces and \n     government-affiliated groups;\n       (2) mourns the loss of life resulting from actions taken by \n     authorities in Venezuela to violently disband peaceful \n     protestors, including the students killed on January 25, \n     2010, during demonstrations against President Chavez's \n     decision to shutdown ``Radio Caracas Television \n     Internacional'';\n       (3) urges both the people and the Government of Venezuela \n     to choose a path towards democracy, transparency, and \n     tolerance in order to begin the process of achieving national \n     reconciliation and a rebuilding of democratic institutions in \n     their country;\n       (4) urges the people of Venezuela to remain vigilant \n     against further encroachments on their constitutional and \n     internationally-recognized civil and human rights;\n       (5) urges President Barack Obama to clearly reject and call \n     attention to the violent measures taken by authorities in \n     Venezuela against citizens who are exercising their \n     constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties;\n       (6) urges the United States Ambassador to the Organization \n     of American States to call on the member states of the \n     Organization of American States to investigate events taking \n     place in Venezuela and adopt the necessary measures to ensure \n     the Government of Venezuela abides by its commitments under \n     the Inter-American Democratic Charter;
