Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the conference report to company \nH.R. 4173, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 4173, to provide for \n     financial regulatory reform, to protect consumers and \n     investors, to enhance Federal understanding of insurance \n     issues, to regulate the over-the-counter derivatives markets, \n     and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. shall be equally divided and controlled by the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Shelby, \nor their designees, with the final 20 minutes divided equally between \nthe two managers and the two leaders.\n  The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Madam President, I strongly support the Dodd-Frank \nconference report. I commend the chairman for all of his work to \naddress so many issues vitally important to working families. I thank \nmy friend from Connecticut for working closely with me to ensure this \nlegislation will educate, protect, and empower consumers and investors.\n  An Office of Financial Education within the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau is created by the legislation. The office is tasked \nwith developing and implementing initiatives to educate and empower \nconsumers. A strategy to improve financial literacy among consumers, \nthat includes measurable goals and benchmarks, must be developed. The \nadministrator of the bureau will serve as vice-chairman of the \nFinancial Literacy and Education Commission to ensure meaningful \nparticipation in Federal efforts intended to help educate, protect, and \nempower working families.\n  The conference report also addresses investor literacy. A financial \nliteracy study must be conducted by the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC. The SEC will be required to develop an investor \nfinancial literacy strategy intended to bring about positive behavioral \nchange among investors.\n  Essential consumer and investor protections for working families are \nincluded in the conference report. A regulatory structure that will \nhave a greater emphasis on investor and consumer protections is \nestablished. Regulators failed to protect consumers and that \ncontributed significantly to the financial crisis. Prospective \nhomebuyers were steered into mortgage products that had risks and costs \nthat they could not understand or afford. The Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau will be empowered to restrict predatory financial \nproducts and unfair business practices in order to prevent unscrupulous \nfinancial services providers from taking advantage of consumers.\n  I take great pride in my contributions to the investor protection \nportion of the legislation. Section 915 will strengthen the ability of \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission to better represent the \ninterests of retail investors by creating an investor advocate within \nthe SEC. The investor advocate is tasked with assisting retail \ninvestors to resolve significant problems with the SEC or the self-\nregulatory organization, SROs. The investor advocate's mission includes \nidentifying areas where investors would benefit from changes in \nCommission or SRO policies and problems that investors have with \nfinancial service providers and investment products. The investor \nadvocate will recommend policy changes to the Commission and Congress \non behalf of investors.\n  The investor advocate is precisely the kind of external check, with \nindependent reporting lines and independently determined compensation, \nthat cannot be provided within the current structure of the SEC. It is \nnot that the SEC does not advocate on behalf of investors, it is that \nit does not have a structure by which any meaningful self-evaluation \ncan be conducted. This would be an entirely new function. The investor \nadvocate would help to ensure that the interests of retail investors \nare built into rulemaking proposals from the outset and that agency \npriorities reflect the issues confronting investors. The investor \nadvocate will act as the chief ombudsman for retail investors and \nincrease transparency and accountability at the SEC. The investor \nadvocate will be best equipped to act in response to feedback from \ninvestors and potentially avoid situations such as the mishandling of \ninformation that could have exposed ponzi schemes much earlier. We also \nworked with our colleagues in the other Chamber to include an ombudsman \nthat will be appointed by and report to the investor advocate.\n  I also worked to include in the legislation clarified authority for \nthe SEC to effectively require disclosures prior to the sale of \nfinancial products and services. Working families rely on their mutual \nfund investments and other financial products to pay for their \nchildren's education, prepare for retirement, and be better able to \nattain other financial goals. This provision will ensure that working \nfamilies have the relevant and useful information they need when they \nare making decisions that determine their financial future.\n  Unfortunately, too many investors do not know the difference between \na broker and an investment advisor. Even fewer are likely to know that \ntheir broker has no obligation to act in their best interest. \nInvestment advisors currently have fiduciary obligations. However, \nbrokers must only meet a suitability standard that fails to \nsufficiently protect investors.\n  In a complicated financial marketplace, for investors in which \nrevenue sharing agreements and commissions can vary significantly for \nsimilar products, we must ensure that all investment professionals that \noffer personalized investment advice have a fiduciary duty imposed on \nthem.\n  In 2005, I first introduced legislation that would have imposed a \nfiduciary duty on brokers. I knew then that action was necessary. I am \nproud that a vital investor protection was also included in the \nconference report that will ensure that a fiduciary duty is imposed on \nbrokers when giving personalized investment advice. This change is \nnecessary because it will ensure that all financial professionals, \nwhether they are an investment advisor or a broker, have the same duty \nto act in the best interests of their clients. Investors must be able \nto trust that their broker is acting in their best interest and we must \nnot allow brokers to push higher commission products that may be \ninappropriate for a particular client. I appreciate all of the efforts \nof Chairman Frank, Senator Menendez, and Senator Johnson for all of \ntheir efforts on this important new investor protection.\n  This legislation also includes landmark consumer protections for \nremittance transactions. Working families often send substantial \nportions of their earnings to family members living abroad. In Hawaii, \nmany of my constituents remit money to their family members living in \nthe Philippines. Consumers can have serious problems with their \nremittance transactions, such as being overcharged or not having their \nmoney reach the intended recipient. Remittances are not currently \nregulated under Federal law, and State\n\n[[Page S5871]]\n\nlaws provide inadequate consumer protections.\n  The conference report modifies the Electronic Fund Transfer Act to \nestablish consumer protections for remittances. It will require simple \ndisclosures about the cost of sending remittances to be provided to the \nconsumer prior to and after the transaction. A complaint and error \nresolution process for remittance transactions would be established. I \nappreciate all of the efforts of the chairman, Representative \nGutierrez, and the Department of the Treasury for working with me on \nthis important piece of the bill for immigrant communities.\n  This legislation also includes essential economic empowerment \nopportunities for working families. Title XII, Improving Access to \nMainstream Financial Institutions, is the most important economic \nempowerment provision in the bill. I appreciate the assistance provided \nby my friend from Wisconsin, Senator Kohl in helping me put this title \ntogether. I appreciate the support and contributions made to this title \nprovided Senators Schumer, Brown, Merkley, and Menendez.\n  I grew up in a family that did not have a bank account. My parents \nkept their money in a box divided into different sections so that money \ncould be separated for various purposes. Church donations were kept in \none part. Money for clothes was kept in another and there was a portion \nof the box reserved for food expenses. When there was no longer any \nmoney in the food section, we did not eat. Obviously, money in the box \nwas not earning interest. It was not secure.\n  I know personally the challenges that are presented to families \nunable to save or borrow when they need small loans to pay for \nunexpected expenses. Unexpected medical expenses or a car repair bill \nmay require small loans to help working families overcome these \nobstacles.\n  Mainstream financial institutions are a vital component to economic \nempowerment. Unbanked or underbanked families need access to credit \nunions and banks and they need to be able to borrow on affordable \nterms. Banks and credit unions provide alternatives to high-cost and \noften predatory fringe financial service providers such as check \ncashers and payday lenders. Unfortunately, approximately one in four \nfamilies are unbanked or underbanked.\n  Many of the unbanked and underbanked are low and moderate-income \nfamilies that cannot afford to have their earnings diminished by \nreliance on these high-cost and often predatory financial services. \nUnbanked families are unable to save securely for education expenses, a \ndown payment on a first home, or other future financial needs. \nUnderbanked consumers rely on nontraditional forms of credit that often \nhave extraordinarily high interest rates. Regular checking accounts may \nbe too expensive for some consumers unable to maintain minimum balances \nor afford monthly fees. Poor credit histories may also limit their \nability to open accounts. Cultural differences or language barriers \nalso present challenges that can hinder the ability of consumers to \naccess financial services. I also want to clarify that in section 1204, \nsmall dollar-value loans and financial education and counseling \nrelating to conducting transactions in and managing accounts are only \nexamples of, and not limitations on, eligible activities.\n  More must be done to promote product development, outreach, and \nfinancial education opportunities intended to empower consumers. Title \nXII authorizes programs intended to assist low and moderate-income \nindividuals establish bank or credit union accounts and encourage \ngreater use of mainstream financial services. It will also encourage \nthe development of small, affordable loans as an alternative to more \ncostly payday loans.\n  There is a great need for working families to have access to \naffordable small loans. This legislation would encourage banks and \ncredit unions to develop consumer friendly payday loan alternatives. \nConsumers who apply for these loans would be provided with financial \nliteracy and educational opportunities.\n  The National Credit Union Administration has provided assistance to \ndevelop these small consumer-friendly loans. Windward Community Credit \nUnion in Hawaii implemented a very successful program for the U.S. \nMarines and other community members in need of affordable short term \ncredit. More working families need access to affordable small loans. \nThis program will encourage mainstream financial service providers to \ndevelop affordable small loan products.\n  I thank the Banking Committee staff for all of their extraordinary \nwork, including Levon Bagramian, Julie Chon, Brian Filipowich, Amy \nFriend, Catherine Galicia, Lynsey Graham Rea, Matthew Green, Marc \nJarsulic, Mark Jickling, Deborah Katz, Jonathan Miller, Misha Mintz-\nRoth, Dean Shahinian, Ed Silverman, and Charles Yi.\n  I also express my appreciation for all of the work done by the \nlegislative assistants of members of the Committee, including Laura \nSwanson, Kara Stein, Jonah Crane, Ellen Chube, Michael Passante, Lee \nDrutman, Graham Steele, Alison O'Donnell, Hilary Swab, Harry Stein, \nKarolina Arias, Nathan Steinwald, Andy Green, Brian Appel, and Matt \nPippin.\n  In conclusion, this bill will improve the lives of working families \nin our country because it will educate, protect, and empower consumers \nand investors.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I take this time to urge my colleagues \nto vote for cloture on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act and to vote for final passage.\n  First, I congratulate Senator Dodd for the leadership he has shown in \nmarshaling this legislation through some very difficult challenges in \nthe Congress, getting it through the Senate floor, working out the \ndifferences between the House and Senate, so we now are on the verge of \npassing the most significant reform of Wall Street in many years.\n  This bill corrects a regulatory structure that today allows reckless \ngambling on Wall Street; that creates too big to fail, where government \nbailouts are necessary to keep companies afloat because there are no \nother options available to our regulators. It ends reckless gambling on \nWall Street. It ends the need for government bailouts of institutions \nthat are too big to fail. It provides for strong consumer protection--\nprotection for many forms of lending but, most importantly, the \nresidential mortgage market.\n  We saw in this financial crisis that even responsible consumers \nsuffered at the hands of aggressive lenders with dubious intentions. \nThis legislation will create a consumer bureau that will end those \ntypes of practices, that will be on the side of the consumer, that is \nindependent, so the consumer is represented in the financial structure.\n  I want to highlight some provisions that were included in this \nlegislation I worked on with our colleagues to get included in the \nbill. I am very grateful to Senator Dodd, the leadership of the Banking \nCommittee, and our representatives in conference who were able to \ninclude provisions that I think add to the importance of this bill.\n  The first provision I want to talk about is a provision I worked on \nwith Senator Enzi and Senator Brownback that will make permanent the \nfederally insured deposit limits from $100,000 to $250,000. We did that \nrecently in order to encourage more deposits, to help our economy, to \nprovide capital for businesses. This limit included in this bill is now \nmade permanent at $250,000.\n  Insured deposits have been the stabilizing force for our Nation's \nbanking system for the past 75 years. They promote public confidence in \nour banking system and prevent bank runs. They are particularly \nimportant to community banks. I know many of us talk about what we can \ndo to help our small businesses, how can we free up more credit to get \nsmall businesses the loans they need in order to create the jobs that \nare needed for our economy. We all know community banks are the most \nstable source of funds for investments in our communities and small \nbusinesses.\n  Community banks rely more on insured deposits than large banks. Madam \nPresident, 85 percent to 90 percent of the funds community banks have \nare included in insured deposits. So this amendment that will make \npermanent the $250,000 limit will help provide a more steady source of \nfunds for\n\n[[Page S5872]]\n\nour community banks which will allow them to be able to invest in our \ncommunities.\n  Another provision that is included in this conference report is one I \nworked on with my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, dealing \nwith the enhanced supervision for nonbank financial companies. What we \nare talking about are mutual funds and their advisers, to make sure \nthey are not inadvertently subjected to unworkable standards. Here we \nare talking about promoting funds necessary for venture capital and \nequity investments in our communities, to make sure there is a \ndifference between the type of activities of mutual fund operators who \nrely primarily on risk investment and those that are primarily involved \nin insured deposits. I appreciate the conference committee clarifying \nthat provision in the conference report, which Senator Mikulski and I \nencouraged them to do.\n  Another provision I want to talk about very briefly is one I worked \non with Senator Grassley dealing with whistleblower protections at \nnationally recognized statistical rating organizations, NRSROs as they \nare known. But I think most people in our country know them as credit \nrating agencies. These are companies such as Moody's and Standard & \nPoor's. There are about 10 in our country that are supposed to do \nindependent credit ratings for securities.\n  As I am sure many people are now aware, they played a significant \nrole in the unrealistic confidence in securities during our recent \neconomic downturn.\n  We want to make sure our credit rating agencies, in fact, carry out \nthe responsibilities they are supposed to carry out as independent \nevaluators. But competition, pressure, and inherent conflicts have made \nthat uncertain. The whistleblower protections that are extended in this \nlegislation will allow employees to come forward with information \nwithout fear of retribution by their employer. It is a very important \nprovision, and I am glad it was included in the final legislation.\n  Lastly, let me talk about the extractive industries transparency \ninitiative, an amendment Senator Lugar and I worked very hard on, that \nis included in the final conference report. I have spoken on the Senate \nfloor previously about this provision, and I particularly thank Senator \nLeahy for his leadership in the conference on this issue and Senator \nDodd for his help in getting it included in the final conference \nreport.\n  Oil, gas, and mining companies registered with the U.S. Securities \nand Exchange Commission will be required under this legislation to \ndisclose their payments to governments for access to oil, gas, or \nminerals. Many of these oil companies or gas companies or mineral \ncompanies operate in countries that are autocratic, unstable, or both, \nand they have to make payments to those countries in order to be able \nto get access to those mineral rights. This legislation--the amendment \nthat is included in this bill--will require public disclosure of those \npayments.\n  Why is that so important? And why was it included in the final \nconference report? First, transparency encourages and provides for more \nstable governments. We rely on these energy sources or mineral supplies \nin countries that are of questionable stability.\n  If this disclosure will help make those countries more stable, it \nprovides security for the United States in their supply source, whether \nit is an energy or mineral supply source. So this amendment that is \nincluded in the conference report will help with U.S. energy security.\n  Secondly, investors have a right to know. If you are going to invest \nin an oil company, you have a right to know where they are doing \nbusiness, where they are making payments. I would think this is \ninformation that may affect your decision as to whether you want to \ntake this risk in investing in that company. So this amendment provides \ngreater disclosure for investors to be able to make intelligent \ndecisions as to whether to invest in an oil or gas or mineral company.\n  Third, as we know, with the lack of transparency, the payments become \na source of corruption for government officials in many of these \nresource-wealthy countries. It is interesting; it is known as the \n``resource curse,'' not the ``resource blessing'' in many countries \naround the world. It is interesting that some of our most wealthy \nmineral countries are the poorest countries as far as their people in \nthe world. The citizens of these countries are entitled to have their \nmineral wealth be used to elevate their personal status. By giving the \ncitizens the information about how payments are made to their country, \nthey have a much better chance to hold their government officials \naccountable.\n  So we not only are protecting investors and helping in energy \nsecurity, we are helping to alleviate poverty internationally by \nallowing the people of the countries that have mineral wealth to hold \ntheir officials accountable, to use those payments to help the people \nof that nation.\n  This proposal has been endorsed by the G8, the International Monetary \nFund, and the World Bank. With the passage of the conference report, \nthe United States will be the leader internationally on extractive \nindustries transparency, and I think that is a proud moment not only \nfor the Senate but for our Nation.\n  This is a good bill for many reasons. It is a well-organized, \ncommonsense regulatory structure to protect our Nation from another \nfinancial crisis, with strong investor and consumer protection, placing \nlimits on institutions deemed too big to fail, protecting not only \ninvestors and consumers but also taxpayers.\n  Over the past 30 years, our regulatory framework did not keep pace \nwith financial innovation. It was particularly impotent with regard to \noversight of the so-called shadow banking system, which evolved in \nlarge part simply to avoid regulation.\n  Decreased regulation led to irresponsible behavior by financiers, \ninvestors, lenders, and consumers. Collectively, we failed to mitigate \nrisk and we ignored established principles of finance--prudence, \nsolvency, and accountability. We can shift risk, but we cannot make it \nmagically disappear. Bubbles do burst eventually.\n  Everyone played a part in the crisis. Together, we suffer the \nconsequences. No man is an island; we are all connected.\n  Risky mortgage lending--practices including no-doc or stated income \nloans--no down payments, and subprime lending led to unprecedented \nforeclosures.\n  Consumers securing mortgages beyond their means and horrible \npredatory lending practices permeated our culture.\n  Even responsible consumers suffered at the hands of aggressive \nlenders with dubious intentions.\n  The mortgage lending system was seriously flawed. America got hit by \na tidal wave of foreclosures. Declining home values affect everyone in \nthe community.\n  And problems in mortgage lending became exacerbated when these bad \nmortgages were packaged into securities and sliced and diced and sold \nto investors with AAA credit ratings.\n  Careful underwriting went out the window because the loan originators \nsold the notes as fast as they could write them.\n  The bill the Senate is considering goes a long way to restore the \norder we need in the financial markets, improve oversight of the \nmortgage industry, and address the numerous other issues that led to \nthe worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. This bill holds \nWall Street more accountable and provides the strongest consumer \nprotections ever for American families and small businesses.\n  I know there are partisan disagreements on some parts of this \nlegislation and it was a challenge to get to this point, but the \nchairman and ranking member of the Banking Committee did an outstanding \njob on this bill and are to be commended for their effort. This is a \nlandmark bill, like Sarbanes-Oxley and the original Securities and \nExchange Commission Act. The lesson we had to learn, again, is that \nbusiness--especially big business--cannot regulate itself adequately. I \nthink H.R. 4173 strikes the right balance in reining in the financial \nservices industry without being unduly burdensome.\n  I would like to review some of the provisions I worked on that have \nbeen included in the bill.\n  As I have said, Senators Enzi and Brownback joined me in proposing \nchanges to the deposit insurance program. The Independent Community \nBankers of America, ICBA, the American Bankers Association, ABA, and\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\nthe National Credit Union Association, NCUA, all supported our \namendment--now found in section 335 of the bill--to make the temporary \nincrease in the federally insured deposit limit from $100,000 to \n$250,000--a permanent increase. An increase in the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, FDIC, and National Credit Union Share Insurance \nFund, NCUSIF, limit is significant because deposit insurance has been \nthe stabilizing force of our Nation's banking system for 75 years.\n  By raising the limit permanently, we provide safe and secure \ndepositories for small businesses and individuals alike. FDIC insurance \nprevents bank runs and has been proven to increase public confidence in \nthe system. FDIC insurance limits are especially significant to \ncommunity banks, which rely on deposits much more heavily than larger \nbanks. On average, smaller banks derive 85 percent to 90 percent of \ntheir funding from deposits. Ensuring a stable funding source for \ncommunity banks helps these institutions to continue providing \ncrucially important capital to the small businesses whose growth is at \nthe heart of our economic recovery.\n  And as I mentioned earlier, during Senate consideration of the bill, \nI offered an amendment with Senator Mikulski to ensure that mutual \nfunds and their advisers are not inadvertently subjected to unworkable \nstandards in the unlikely event the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil designates them as systemically risky. In section 115 of the \nbill, the new council is given the flexibility to consider capital \nstructure, riskiness, complexity, financial activities, size, and other \nfactors when determining heightened regulatory standards. This is \nimportant for addressing the unique characteristics of companies that \nare structured differently from banks and bank holding companies.\n  Further, I am gratified the House and Senate conferees saw fit to \nretain an amendment, amendment No. 3840, Senator Grassley and I offered \nto the bill to extend whistleblower protections to employees of \nnationally recognized statistical rating organizations, NRSROs. The \nprovision is section 922(b) of the bill.\n  NRSROs are the companies, such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's, \nwhich issue credit ratings that the U.S. Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC, permits other financial firms to use for certain \nregulatory purposes. There are 10 NRSROs at present, including some \nprivately held firms.\n  The NRSROs played a large role--by overestimating the safety of \nresidential mortgage-backed securities, RMBS, and collateralized debt \nobligations, CDOs--in creating the housing bubble and making it bigger. \nThen, by making tardy but massive simultaneous downgrades of these \nsecurities, they contributed to the collapse of the subprime secondary \nmarket and the ``fire sale'' of assets, exacerbating the financial \ncrisis.\n  A Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, PSI, hearing made it \nquite clear that competitive pressures and inherent conflicts of \ninterest affected the objectivity of the ratings issued by the NRSROs.\n  Since NRSRO ratings are used for various regulatory purposes, such as \ndetermining net capital requirements and the soundness of insurance \ncompany reserves, it makes sense to extend whistleblower protections to \nemployees who might come across malfeasance at a credit rating agency.\n  There are many reasons for the massive failure of the NRSROs. The \nWall Street reform bill contains several provisions to improve SEC and \ncongressional oversight of the NRSROs and how they function. Extending \nwhistleblower status to the employees of these firms enhances the \nprovisions already in the underlying bill.\n  As I have also said, my distinguished colleague, Senator Lugar, and I \nworked particularly hard on the energy security through transparency \nprovision in this bill, which is section 1504--Disclosure of Payments \nby Resource Extraction Issuers. I am especially grateful to Senator \nLeahy, who championed this provision in the conference committee.\n  The geography and nature of the oil, gas, and mining industry is such \nthat companies often have to operate in countries that are autocratic, \nunstable, or both. Investors need to know the full extent of a \ncompany's exposure when it operates in countries where it is subject to \nexpropriation, political and social turmoil, and reputational risks.\n  In Nigeria, for example, American companies have had to take oil \nfields offline because of rebel activity and instability in the Niger \nDelta. Last year, Nigeria was producing almost a million barrels of oil \nless than it was able to produce because of conflict and instability. \nWith so much production offline, American oil companies such as Chevron \nand Exxon have laid off workers and paid higher production costs \nbecause of added security.\n  This bipartisan amendment goes a long way to achieving transparency \nin this critical sector by requiring all foreign and domestic companies \nregistered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, to \ninclude in their annual report to the SEC how much they pay each \ngovernment for access to its oil, gas, and minerals. This amendment is \na critical part of the increased transparency and good governance that \nwe are striving to achieve in the financial industry.\n  Our amendment is vitally important. Transparency helps create more \nstable governments, which in turn allows U.S. companies to operate more \nfreely--and on a level playing field--in markets that are otherwise too \nrisky or unstable.\n  Let me point out three key results we expect from this provision:\n  No. 1, enhancing U.S. energy security. The reliability of oil and gas \nsupplies is undermined by the instability caused when local populations \ndo not receive the benefit of their resource exports. Enhancing \nopenness in revenue flows allows for greater public scrutiny of how \nrevenues are used. Increased transparency can help create more stable, \ndemocratic governments, as well as more reliable energy suppliers.\n  No. 2, strengthening energy markets. The extractive industries are \ncapital-intensive and dependent on long-term stability to generate \nfavorable returns. Leading energy companies recognize that more \ntransparent investment climates are better for their bottom lines.\n  No. 3, helping to alleviate poverty. Too many resource-rich countries \nthat should be well off are home to many of the world's poor instead. \nThis is a phenomenon known as the ``resource curse.'' Oil, gas \nreserves, and minerals don't automatically confer wealth on the people \nwho live in countries where those resources are located. Many resource-\nrich countries rank at the bottom of most measures of human \ndevelopment, making them a breeding ground for poverty and instability. \nRevenue transparency will help the citizens of resource-rich countries \nhold their governments more accountable and ensure that their country's \nnatural resource wealth is used wisely for the benefit of the entire \nnation and for future generations.\n  The wave of the future is transparency, and these principles of \ntransparency have been endorsed by the G8, the International Monetary \nFund, the World Bank, and a number of regional development banks. It is \nclear to the financial leaders of the world that transparency in \nnatural resource development is vital to holding the rulers in these \ncountries accountable for the needs of their citizens and preventing \nthem from simply building up their personal offshore bank accounts. I \nam proud to stand here today and say that the United States is now the \nleader in creating a new standard for revenue transparency in the \nextractive industries.\n  These are some of the provisions I worked on, but they are a small \npart of the overall bill, which is very strong.\n  Forty years ago, conservative economist Milton Friedman wrote a New \nYork Times Magazine article entitled ``The Social Responsibility of \nBusiness is to Increase its Profits.'' In this article, quoting from \nhis earlier book ``Capitalism and Freedom,'' from 1962, he concluded:\n\n       There is one and only one social responsibility of \n     business--to use its resources and engage in activities \n     designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within \n     the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and \n     free competition without deception or fraud.\n\n  Even this minimalist position suggests that markets need rules. And \nyet we embarked on a 30-year path to deregulate financial services, to \nease the rules, and remove the watchdogs. We have learned a bitter \nlesson that markets are not self-correcting--at least\n\n[[Page S5874]]\n\nnot without catastrophic consequences. Millions of Americans have lost \ntheir jobs, their savings, their homes, and their retirement security. \nBusinesses have been wiped out. We have gone from easy credit to no \ncredit.\n  Now that the financial hurricane has wreaked its devastation, it is \ntime to rebuild.\n  H.R. 4173 is part of that process. The bill creates well-organized, \ncommonsense regulatory structures to protect our Nation from another \nfinancial crisis. Chairman Dodd and Chairman Frank have produced a bill \nthat addresses the feasibility of our reliance on credit rating \nagencies, our appetite for systemic risk, and the need to limit the \nregulatory burden on our small institutions. They have produced a bill \nthat provides strong investor and consumer protections, encourages \nwhistleblowers, reduces interchange fees for small businesses, and \nplaces limits on institutions deemed too big to fail. I know that \nMaryland banks and investment companies appreciate the attention paid \nin this bill to their concerns regarding bank and thrift oversight, \nsystemic risk regulation, and the effects of the mortgage crisis.\n  While Members of Congress may not agree on every aspect of this bill, \nit is worthy of our support. Indeed, given the stakes, it is imperative \nthat we pass H.R. 4173.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture and support passage.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today in strong opposition to \nH.R. 4173. I think it is interesting to note we have had a number of \nspeakers who are proponents of this legislation come forward--just as \nmy good friend from Maryland just did--and say we are going to be the \nleader, the United States is going to be the leader in the financial \nworld market with these changes.\n  Well, the fact is, other countries that have strong financial markets \nhave said publicly just the opposite. What I am afraid we are setting \nourselves up for, and what I talked about a lot during the course of \nthe debate on the Senate floor relative to this bill, is that what we \nare going to wind up doing is we are going to be driving jobs and \nbusiness overseas with this massive piece of legislation that truly \ndoes not address the problem.\n  There is nothing in these 2,300 pages that deals with the primary \ncatalyst of the market instability in our economy--the bailout \nbehemoths, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The bill simply ignores the \ndevastating impact these two entities continue to have not only on our \ncapital markets but also on our Nation's deficit, already demanding \nover $145 billion in taxpayer assistance, and with no end in sight as \nto what it is ultimately going to cost the taxpayers of this country.\n  The newly created consumer protection bureau is an affirmation that \nthe proponents of the legislation have acknowledged government failures \nwere a significant cause of our economic turmoil. But they still \nbelieve bigger government is the solution going forward, and despite \nfailure after failure among various regulatory agencies, a new agency \nis the answer to these shortcomings, and this time it is going to be \ndifferent.\n  Instead of addressing the problems of the consumer protections in \nplace under our current regulatory structure, this new oversight agency \nis an added layer of bureaucracy with the authority to examine and \nenforce new regulations for not only all mortgage-related businesses, \nbut also small mom-and-pop businesses on Main Street such as payday \nlenders, check cashers, and other nonfinancial firms. These types of \nentities were clearly not the cause of the economic crisis, yet they \nwill now be subject to the same regulations as the large financial \ninstitutions on Wall Street. This is simply another example of the \nmajority party's preference for a one-size-fits-all regulatory \nstructure, stifling economic growth.\n  Having participated in the conference committee, I unfortunately \nwitnessed firsthand the complete disregard for addressing the real \nissues at hand. As ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, I have \nspent a great deal of time understanding the over-the-counter \nderivatives market--its complexities, and its legitimate utility. I \nhave found that both Republicans and Democrats generally agree on the \nmajor issues relating to derivatives regulation. We all generally agree \nthere needs to be greater transparency, registration, more clearing, \nand compliance with a whole host of business conduct and efficient \nmarket operation regulations. This is important, because it is a 180-\ndegree shift away from current law where over-the-counter swaps are \nessentially unregulated today.\n  Within this general agreement that swaps need to go from unregulated \nto fully regulated, we have had disagreements about who should be \nrequired to clear their transactions and how best to require swaps to \nbe transacted and reported. These disagreements are significant because \nthey involve real burdens and duties which will result in real costs to \nbusinesses and consumers. I wish to make sure our new regulations are \ntargeted to serve a useful purpose. Unfortunately, this legislation \nwill enable regulators to impose restrictions on businesses that had \nabsolutely nothing to do with creating the financial crisis. Every \nindustry in the country uses derivatives to manage their business risks \nand many of them will now be forced to clear their derivative \ntransactions. This seems simple enough, until you realize that clearing \ndoes not make risk within the financial system disappear. Risk is \nsimply transferred from the individual counterparties to the \nclearinghouses, a service provided at considerable expense in the form \nof margin posted to the clearinghouse. So this bill will not eliminate \nrisk, but it simply transfers risk from one place to another and \nimposes costs on market participants who had nothing to do with \ncreating the financial crisis. I truly fear that consumers will \nultimately pay the price.\n  For example, this legislation would force the farm credit system \ninstitutions to run their interest rate swaps through a clearinghouse \nwhich will result in additional costs in the form of higher interest \nrates to their customers without doing anything to lessen the systemic \nrisk. Let me be clear as to who this will ultimately affect. It is very \nclear that our farmers and ranchers, our electric cooperatives, and our \nethanol facilities which seek financing from these institutions will \nbear this burden.\n  Institutions such as Cobank will be forced to clear their swaps and \nexecute them on a trading facility which will impose significant new \ncosts and result in higher rates for their customer, or, worse, \ndiscourage them from managing their risk which will again result in \nhigher costs for their borrowers. And why? Because this legislation \nbroadly applies regulation, treating all financial institutions the \nsame. Cobank and Goldman Sachs are not the same and should not be \nregulated in the same manner. Cobank should have the option to clear \ntheir swaps, not be mandated to do so.\n  While the conference report provides an exemption for some businesses \nfrom this derivative clearing mandate, it also imposes new margin \nrequirements on derivative dealers for these same uncleared \ntransactions. Who will likely pay for these new margin requirements in \nthe form of higher fees? Again, it is pretty clear the public and \nprivate companies across the Nation that had nothing to do with the \nfinancial crisis and that are simply seeking to minimize risk will bear \nthis burden. The entire point of exempting some of them from the \nclearing mandate was to ensure that they do not bear the burden of \nincreased margin costs, but this language would indirectly subject \nthese businesses to the expense of margins imposed on their dealer \ncounterparties--counterparties that will be forced to recoup this cost \nin the form of fees, and businesses will be forced to pass their costs \non to consumers.\n  I encourage all Members of this body to look at yesterday's Wall \nStreet Journal. There is a front-page story on derivatives. When we \ncome to the floor and start debating derivatives, most people's eyes \nglaze over because it is complex and an issue that is very difficult to \nunderstand. But in that article it explains the simplicity that the \nderivatives world imparts itself in. The article goes through a process \nof a farmer in Nebraska and his use of derivatives; then his ultimate \npurchaser of his product--the rancher--and how that rancher uses \nderivatives to eliminate risk and hopefully guarantee a profit in his \nbusiness. Then it describes\n\n[[Page S5875]]\n\nhow the slaughterhouse takes the product from the livestock operator, \nthe market operator, and uses derivatives in their business; and then \nultimately the guy who owns the trucking company and how he uses \nderivatives. It is very clear in this article that these guys' lives \nare going to change from a business perspective. They are not going to \nbe able to use derivatives in the way they used them before. They had \nnothing to do with the financial crisis that developed in this country.\n  Also related to derivatives were considerable improvements made to \nthe so-called ``swap desk push out'' provision. I commend the chairman \nfor his work on that. Banks would be able to continue to engage in \ninterest rate and foreign currency swaps which is essential to the \nbusiness of banks. However, I remain concerned that forcing swap dealer \nbanks to spin off their commodity trading will hurt those utilities and \nairlines wishing to hedge their energy risks in the immediate future. \nThey will be forced to establish new credit ratings and standings with \nthese affiliates rather than take advantage of their longstanding \nrelationship with their current bank. I fail to understand why forcing \nthese entities to spin off any aspect of their swap business is \nnecessary.\n  I wholeheartedly support efforts to make the swaps market more \ntransparent. It needs to be. I believe this will be accomplished once \nregulators have access to the data which has to date been completely \nunavailable to them. The public will benefit from knowing who is \nparticipating in these markets, and we will finally have the data we \nneed to make informed policy decisions related to derivatives.\n  Our economy needs more opportunities for all businesses to grow and \nprosper. Time and again, it is the small- and medium-sized businesses \nthat create the lion's share of jobs after a major economic recession. \nWe need to foster and incubate these small- and medium-sized businesses \nright now and not hamper them. We need to ensure they are able to \naccess capital and manage their risk through the use of derivatives. \nRight now, there are a lot of these small- and medium-sized companies \nthat are ready to expand but cannot get adequate access to capital \nbecause lenders are saying it is too risky and regulators won't allow \nthese lenders to help.\n  So I believe there is a need to respond to what went wrong in our \nfinancial system and I support doing so in a responsible way that will \ncontinue to allow Main Street businesses to manage their risk \nappropriately, hold those responsible for this mess accountable, and \nnot create huge new government bureaucracies. Unfortunately, this \nlegislation falls short of these goals.\n  I am pleased the chairman of the Banking Committee is here, because I \ndo want to say publicly--and I have told him this privately and I will \ncontinue to say it--that he had a very difficult job, and while we \ndisagreed on a lot of major issues, he was always open for discussion. \nHe allowed participation on the floor as well as discussions off the \nfloor, and for that I thank him. He knows that I obviously cannot vote \nfor this bill, but he has proven himself to be a very valued Member of \nthe Senate by the way he has conducted himself throughout this whole \nprocess, and for that I thank him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before my colleague leaves the floor, let \nme thank him as well. Of course, hope always springs eternal. The vote \nhasn't occurred yet, so we never know. We might get his vote yet.\n  I don't serve on the Agriculture Committee with him. Senator \nChambliss was a very valued member of this conference. Obviously, a lot \nof work took place in the Agriculture Committee dealing with areas of \nthe bill that he has spent several minutes talking about. He raises \nvery good points. I would be the last person to suggest as a coauthor \nof the bill that we have crafted the perfect piece of legislation. As \nhe points out, these are highly complicated areas. One of the reasons \nwe tried not to write a series of regulations far beyond the competency \nof those of us in this Chamber is because it is complicated. Obviously, \nwe have delegated the ultimate responsibility that we now have, which \nis to watch, the oversight, to the regulatory community, to make sure \nthey do this right.\n  I pointed out yesterday, and he has pointed out again today, when we \nget into a situation such as this crisis, certain words become \npejorative, and ``derivatives'' unfortunately has become that, and it \nshouldn't. These are very critical components for capital formation, \njob growth, and wealth in our country. Hedging against risk is \nabsolutely essential. So they are vitally important elements in our \neconomy. I hope people, when they hear the word ``derivative'' being \nspoken won't assume this is somehow a bad idea. One almost gets the \nsense that people feel that way. I don't at all.\n  I look forward in the coming weeks and months, as regulators begin to \nwork with this bill if, in fact, it passes, that we will do that. A lot \nof the record has been established in this area, and through no small \nmeasure due to the Senator from Georgia, and I thank him for his work \nas well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I note the absence of a quorum, and I ask that the \ntime be equally divided on both sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, I rise today to offer some remarks on \nthe Dodd-Frank regulation conference report, which is now before the \nSenate.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, the financial crisis exposed massive deficiencies \nin the structure and culture of our financial regulatory system. Years \nof technological advances, product development, and the advent of \nglobal capital markets rendered the system ill-suited to achieve its \nmission in the modern economy. Decades of insulation from \naccountability distracted regulators from focusing on that mission. \nInstead of acting to preserve safe and sound markets, the regulators \nprimarily became focused on expanding the scope of their bureaucratic \nreach.\n  After the crisis, which cost trillions of dollars and millions of \njobs, it was clear that significant reform was necessary. Despite broad \nagreement on the need for reform, the majority decided it would rather \nmove forward with a partisan bill. The result is the 2,300-page \nlegislative monster before us that expands the scope and the power of \nineffective bureaucracies. It creates vast new bureaucracies with \nlittle accountability and seriously undermines the competitiveness of \nthe American economy.\n  Unfortunately, the bill does very little to make our financial system \nsafer. Therefore, I will oppose the Dodd-Frank bill and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  This was not a preordained outcome; it is the direct result of \ndecisions made by the Obama administration. Had they sincerely wanted \nto produce a bipartisan bill, I have no doubt we could have crafted a \nstrong bill that would garner 80 or more votes in the Senate. If the \nAmerican people haven't noticed by now, that is not how things work \nunder the Democratic rule.\n  Unfortunately, the partisan manner in which this bill was constructed \nis not its greatest shortcoming. One would have assumed that the scope \nof the crisis--trillions of dollars lost and millions of jobs \neliminated--would have compelled the Banking Committee to spend the \ntime necessary to thoroughly examine the crisis and develop the best \npossible legislation in response. Unfortunately, such an assumption \nwould be entirely unfounded. The Banking Committee never produced a \nsingle report on or conducted an investigation into any aspect of the \nfinancial crisis.\n  In contrast, during the Great Depression, the Banking Committee set \nup an entire subcommittee to examine what regulatory reforms were \nneeded. The Pecora Commission, as it came to be known, interviewed, \nunder oath, the big actors on Wall Street and produced a multivolume \nreport.\n  Unfortunately, this time around, the Democratic-run committee gave \nWall Street executives a pass, I believe. There were no investigations, \nno depositions, and no subpoenas. In fact, Chairman Dodd, my friend and \ncolleague, never called on the likes of\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\nRobert Rubin and Lloyd Blankfein to testify before the Banking \nCommittee. Not a single individual from AIG's financial products \ndivision was questioned by the committee or its staff. Although \nCongress did establish the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to do \nthe work that the majority party, I believe, refused to do, the \nCommission's work will not be completed until the end of this year.\n  Most amazingly, the Banking Committee didn't even hold a single \nhearing on the final bill before its markup. The committee never took \nthe time to receive public testimony or survey experts about the likely \noutcomes the legislation would produce. We know the majority heard from \nWall Street lobbyists, government regulators, and liberal activists, \nbut they clearly decided they did not want the American people to have \na chance to understand and comment on the bill before us today before \nit was enacted. The question is, Why? The majority knows that this bill \nis a job killer and will saddle Americans with billions of dollars in \nhidden taxes and fees. Allowing the public to weigh in on this bill \nwould have spelled the end of the Democratic version of reform. I \nbelieve we owed more to those who lost their jobs, their homes, and \ntheir life savings. I believe this truly was a missed opportunity.\n  The difference between what we needed to do, what we could have done, \nand what the majority has chosen to do is considerable. I will speak on \nthis.\n  Congress could have focused this legislation on financial stability. \nIt could have utilized the findings of the Financial Crisis Inquiry \nCommission. Instead, the Democratic majority chose to adopt legislative \nlanguage penned by Federal regulators in search of expanded turf. They \nchose to legislate for the political favor of community organizing \ngroups and liberal activists seeking expansive new bureaucracies that \nthey could leverage for their own political advantage. The result is an \nactivist bill that has little to do with the recent or any crisis and a \nlot to do with expanding the government to satisfy special interests.\n  Congress could have written a bill to address the problem of too big \nto fail once and for all. In fact, the Shelby-Dodd amendment began to \naddress this problem right here on the floor. Unfortunately, the \nDemocrats once again overreached at the eleventh hour and undermined \nthe seriousness of our effort by emphasizing social activism over \nfinancial stability. Democrats insisted that the overall financial \nstability mission of the Financial Stability Oversight Council was less \nimportant than the political needs of certain preferred constituencies. \nThis dangerous mixing of social activism and financial stability \nfollows the exact same model that led us to the crisis in the first \nplace; that is, private enterprise co-opted through political mandates \nto achieve social goals. Fannie and Freddie proved this combination can \nbe highly destructive.\n  Congress could have written legislation to address key issues known \nto have played a key role in the recent crisis. On the government-\nsponsored enterprises, Fannie and Freddie, the bill is silent, aside \nfrom a mere study. On the triparty repo market, the bill is silent. On \nruns in money markets, the bill is silent. On the reliance of market \nparticipants on short-term commercial paper funding, the bill is \nsilent. On maturity transformations that allowed the shadow banking \nsystem to effectively create money out of AAA-rated securities, thereby \nmaking the system much more vulnerable, the bill is silent. On the \nfinancial system's overall vulnerability to liquidity crises, the bill \nagain is silent. We know with certainty that all of these factors--none \nof which is addressed in the bill--were integral to the recent \nfinancial crisis. While we don't want to write legislation that only \ndeals with the last crisis, we do want to enact a law that addresses \nwhat we know were systemic problems. This bill fails to do so.\n  Congress could have written a bill to streamline regulation and \neliminate the gaps that firms exploit in a race to the regulatory \nbottom. This bill does the opposite by making our financial regulatory \nsystem even more complex. We will still have the Fed, FDIC, SEC, CFTC, \nOCC, and the remainder of the regulatory alphabet soup. In fact, most \nof the existing regulators that so recently failed us have been given \nexpanded power and scope. This bill will also add new letters to the \nalready-confused soup, such as the CFPB and the OFR. In addition to \nincreased regulatory complexity, there will be new special activist \noffices within each regulator for almost every imaginable special \ninterest.\n  Congress could have set up reasonable new research capabilities in \nits new Stability Oversight Council to complement financial research \nperformed by the Federal Reserve and others. Instead, the Democrats \ndecided to establish the Office of Financial Research with an \nunconstrained director and a focus on broad information collecting and \nprocessing.\n  I believe this office will not only fail to detect systemic threats \nin the asset price bubbles in the future, it will threaten civil \nliberties and the privacy of Americans, waste billions of dollars of \ntaxpayer resources, and lull markets into the false belief that this \nnew government power will protect the financial system from risky \ntrades.\n  Congress could have been transparent in identifying the bill's fiscal \neffects and costs. Instead, the majority wrote a bill that hijacks \ntaxpayer resources but hides that fact from public view. Just as the \nadministration refuses to acknowledge trillions of dollars of \ncontingent taxpayer liabilities residing with Fannie and Freddie, this \nbill refuses to provide Americans with a transparent view of the costs \nof the new multibillion-dollar consumer protection bureaucracy.\n  According to the report on the bill offered by the majority, the \nconsumer bureaucracy's budget is ``paid for by the Federal Reserve \nSystem.'' Make no mistake, ``paid for by the Fed'' means paid for \nultimately by the taxpayers.\n  Taxpayers will be on the hook for billions of dollars of unchecked, \nunencumbered, and unappropriated spending financed by the inflationary \nmoney printing authority of the Federal Reserve which will be hidden \nfrom the American people in the arcane Federal budget.\n  Congress could have also used this legislative opportunity to begin \nthe process of reforming the failed mortgage giants Fannie and Freddie, \nwhose ever growing bailouts have no upper limit. When it became clear \nthat this was not the intention of the Democrats, Republicans sought to \naddress the current and worsening conditions of the GSEs.\n  We suggested establishing taxpayer protections, such as portfolio \ncaps, on the mortgage giants. We recommended making the cost of Freddie \nand Fannie bailouts transparent to the public; that is, to the \ntaxpayer. We offered initial steps toward the inevitable unwinding of \nthese failed institutions. Yet at every turn, the Democratic majority \nblocked Republican efforts to establish at least a foundation for \nreform.\n  The Democratic-preferred approach in this bill to reforming the \nmortgage giants is a study. Let me repeat that notion. In order to \naddress a bailout that has already cost American taxpayers roughly $150 \nbillion to date, with unlimited future taxpayer exposure, the Democrats \npropose a study. It does not take a study to determine that $150 \nbillion in unlimited loss exposure needs to be addressed immediately--\nnow.\n  Congress could have focused on securities market practices that were \nknown to have contributed to systemic risks in our financial system. \nInstead, Democrats overreached once again.\n  For example, the bill gives the Securities and Exchange Commission, \nwhich has failed to carry out its existing mandates, a new systemic \nrisk mandate to oversee advisers to hedge funds and private equity \nfunds. Yet no one contends private funds were a cause of the recent \ncrisis or that the demise of any private fund during the crisis \nresulted in a systemwide shock.\n  Congress could have acted to curtail Wall Street's speculative \nexcesses and enhance Main Street's access to credit. But instead, in \nthis bill large financial firms on Wall Street seem to have benefited, \njudging by the behavior of the stock prices, while the legislation \nalmost surely will increase uncertainties and costs for Main Street and \nAmerica's job creators.\n  The actual provisions in the bill will benefit big Wall Street \ninstitutions because they substantially increase the amount and cost of \nfinancial regulation. Only large financial institutions will have the \nresources to navigate all\n\n[[Page S5877]]\n\nof the new laws and regulations that this legislation will generate. As \na result, this bill, disproportionately will hurt small and medium-\nsized banks which had nothing to do with the crisis.\n  While the largest financial institutions will get special regulation \nunder this bill, the unintended result will be lower funding costs for \nthese firms. That will benefit the big banks and hurt the small banks. \nTherefore, this bill will result in higher fees, less choice, and fewer \nopportunities to responsibly obtain credit for blameless consumers.\n  Moreover, this bill raises taxes which, as we all know, are \nultimately borne by consumers. Make no mistake, when Wall Street writes \na check to pay its higher taxes, the ones who end up paying those taxes \nare American consumers and workers.\n  Congress could have written legislation for consumer protection that \nrespects both American consumers and the need for safety and soundness \nin our financial system.\n  Instead, the Dodd-Frank bill was basically constructed by architects \nin the Treasury Department who have a certain condescension for \nAmerican consumers and their choices.\n  The ultimate goal is to substitute the judgment of a benevolent \nbureaucrat for that of the American consumer, thereby controlling \nconsumer behavior without regard for the safety and soundness of our \nbanking system.\n  The American people are being told not to worry, however, because it \nis all being done for their own good.\n  While a consumer protection agency might sound like a good idea, the \nway it is constructed in this bill will slow economic growth and kill \njobs by imposing massive new regulatory burdens on businesses, large \nand small. It will stifle innovation in consumer financial products, \nand it will reduce small business activity. It will lead to reduced \nconsumer credit and higher costs for available credit.\n  Less credit at higher price will dampen the very small business \nengines of job creation that our economy desperately needs right now. \nThat is a price I am not willing to pay.\n  Congress could have implemented reforms to improve derivatives market \nactivities. Instead, the bill's derivatives title seems to be inspired \nby a desire to be punitive or to provide short-term political support \nduring an election, or both. Instead of imposing a rational and \neffective regulatory framework on the OTC derivatives market, the bill \nruns roughshod over the Main Street businesses that use derivatives to \nprotect themselves every day.\n  The Dodd-Frank bill will increase companies' costs and limit their \naccess to risk-mitigating derivatives without making our financial \nsystem safer in the process. As a result, there will be fewer \nopportunities for businesses to grow, fewer jobs for the unemployed, \nand higher prices for consumers.\n  Congress could have written a bill to put an end to overreliance on \ncredit agencies and underreliance on their own due diligence. Instead, \nthe Dodd-Frank bill sets up new regulations and liability provisions to \ngive the impression that ratings are accurate. It then takes a \ncontradictory direction and instructs regulators to replace references \nto ratings with other standards of creditworthiness.\n  To make matters even more confusing, the bill also provides for the \nestablishment of a government-sponsored body that will select a credit \nrating agency to perform an initial rating of a security issue.\n  I anticipate the net effect of these conflicting provisions will be a \nreduction of competition among credit rating agencies. Potential \ncompetitors either will be deterred by all of the new regulatory \nrequirements or be destroyed by the liability provisions set up in the \nbill. The lack of competition led to poor quality ratings in the runup \nto the crisis. This bill perpetuates and, in fact, worsens that \nproblem.\n  Congress could have eased regulatory burdens on small and medium-\nsized businesses not integral to the recent crisis or any crisis. \nInstead, Main Street corporations will be subject to a panoply of new \ncorporate governance and executive compensation requirements.\n\n  These new requirements will be costly and potentially harmful to \nshareholders because they empower special interests and encourage \nshort-term thinking by managers. These features were included solely \nfor the purpose of appeasing unions and other special interest \nlobbyists, and there is no demonstrated link between these changes and \nthe enhanced stability of our financial system or improved investor \nprotection.\n  We are getting toward the end. Congress could have held hearings or \nanalyzed a number of changes this bill makes to the securities laws. \nInstead, dramatic changes in those laws were written with little \ndiscussion and no analysis.\n  Throughout this process, there has been a lot of talk about the \ninfluence of Wall Street over this bill. To be sure, in the early \nstages of the negotiations, Wall Street and the big banks were very \nengaged.\n  I think the American people know, however, that in the end, the real \ninfluence peddlers on this bill were not Wall Street lobbyists but \nrather liberal activists and Washington bureaucrats. Wall Street and \nthe big banks just happen to be the incidental beneficiaries of their \nsuccess.\n  When Chairman Dodd and I began this process, we agreed that the \nbureaucratic status quo was unacceptable and that radical change was \nnecessary. With that in mind, we agreed to consolidate all the \nfinancial regulators and constrain the Fed to its monetary policy role.\n  This was not a result the big banks wanted. The last thing a large \nregulated financial institution wants is a new regulator. After all, \nthey spent years and millions of dollars developing a relationship with \nour current regulators.\n  A major regulatory reorganization would seriously upset the status \nquo and cost them a great deal of money. Neither Chairman Dodd nor I \nwere persuaded, however. Change was necessary and change was going to \ncome.\n  Unfortunately, that vision of reform began to die as the bureaucrats \nand the liberal left began to exercise their influence over the bill. \nWhen it became apparent that I was not willing to embrace the left's \nexpansive consumer bureaucracy, it also became apparent that actual \nregulatory reform was not what the majority was seeking.\n  All other serious reform was scuttled by the Democrats in defense of \nthe new consumer bureaucracy. That was the point at which Chairman Dodd \nand I began to seek a new negotiating partner, ultimately to no avail.\n  As the Fed and the other regulators began to regain their foothold \nwith the Democrats and the administration and the activist left \nconsolidated its support around an expansive new bureaucracy, all the \nDemocrats will succeed in doing, with the help of a few Republicans, is \ngive the failed bureaucracies more power, more money, and a pat on the \nback with the hope they will do a better job next time.\n  That is not real reform. That is just more of the same.\n  We had an opportunity to lead the world by creating a modern, \nefficient, and competitive regulatory structure that will serve our \neconomy for years to come. Instead, I believe we squandered that \nopportunity by barely expanding our obsolete, inefficient, and \nuncompetitive system. To make it even worse, they have added to the \nbureaucratic morass several more unrestrained and unaccountable \nagencies.\n  It became apparent early on to me that the administration and the \nDemocratic majority were not interested in regulatory reform. All they \nwere trying to do is exploit the crisis in order to expand government \nfurther and reward special interests.\n  The Dodd-Frank bill will not enhance systemic stability. It will not \nprevent future bailouts of politically favored institutions and groups \nby the government.\n  The bill serves only to expand the Federal bureaucracy and the \ngovernment control of the private sector. It will impose large costs on \nthe taxpayers and businesses.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to reject this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Alabama. Once \nagain--I say this with the respect--I feel as if I am listening to the \nfirst speech back in November when I offered the original proposal of \nthis bill and wonder if we have been in the same\n\n[[Page S5878]]\n\nChamber and same city over the last several years.\n  I am not going to use the time between now and 11 a.m. when we are \ngoing to vote on the cloture motion. I will not go through the long \nlist, page after page of amendments that were adopted as part of this \nbill offered by my good friends on the minority side.\n  We had 80 hearings held over 2 years, with countless efforts to reach \nout and bring in people. One can make a lot of accusations about the \nbill, but this was a very inclusive process. Half the amendments \nadopted on the floor in this Chamber during consideration of this \nlegislation over 4 weeks were ones offered by the minority and were \naccepted and bipartisan amendments. There was never an alternative \noffered. There was never a substitute offered. It was a question of \nwhether people wanted to amend this legislation.\n  It is not a perfect bill, I will be the first to admit. We do not \nknow ultimately how well the ideas we incorporated will achieve the \nresults we all desire. It will take the next economic crisis--as \ncertainly it will come--to determine whether the provisions of this \nbill will provide this generation or the next generation of regulators \nwith the tools necessary to minimize the effects of that crisis when it \nhappens. But we believe we have done the best we could under the \ncircumstances to see to it we never have another bailout of another \nmajor financial institution at taxpayer expense.\n  In fact, it was the Shelby-Dodd amendment adopted in this Chamber--it \nwas the second amendment we considered--that actually completed the \nprocess of seeing to it there would be bankruptcy or resolution of \nfinancial institutions that got themselves into so much trouble that \nthey put the entire system at risk. We set up an oversight council to \nmake sure we could observe what was occurring not only here at home but \naround the globe--matters such as Greece or Spain that could put our \neconomy at risk. So it isn't just one set of eyes but having those \nresponsible for seeing to it that our economy remains safe and sound \nhave the opportunity to provide the early warning that never occurred.\n\n  We didn't need a Pecora Commission to find out what was going wrong. \nWe had mortgages being sold in this country to people who couldn't \nafford them, marketing them in a way that guaranteed failure, \nsecuritizing them so they could be paid and then skipping town in a \nsense. I didn't need to have hours of hearings to find out what was the \ncause of it. The question was, How do we try to put a system in place \nto minimize the future kind of risks our Nation would face. It wasn't \njust to deal with those who created the problem but, rather, to look \nahead--not in a punitive way--and to set up an architecture and \nstructure to allow us to get to that point where we could be confident \nwe were addressing these issues.\n  Thirdly, of course, we tried to deal with exotic instruments that had \ncaused so much of the difficulty. The derivatives market was a $90 \nbillion market, and it mushroomed in less than a decade to $600 \ntrillion, putting our Nation at risk because of a lack of transparency \nand accountability to determine what was occurring in those markets. To \nconsider it a radical idea that we might want to have accountability \nand transparency I find remarkable considering what our country has \nbeen through.\n  Also, we provided a consumer protection bureau. What a radical idea \nthat is--the idea that people who buy mortgages or have a student loan, \na credit card, a car loan, might have someplace in this city that \nwatches out for them so their jobs, their homes, their retirement \naccounts are not lost. So while this bureau is in place in this bill, \nthe idea was at least to see to it that people, when they have the \nproblems they have been through or are going through, someone is \nwatching out for them.\n  We have a Consumer Product Safety Commission to address the purchase \nof a faulty product, but what happens when someone abuses or takes \nadvantage, as happens in so many cases in financial areas? People \nshould have a chance to have a redress of their grievance or to at \nleast from the outset have an opportunity to address that before it \nbecomes a broader problem.\n  So, Madam President, again, we have debated this now for 2 years and \ncountless opportunities. We spent 4 weeks on the floor of this Chamber, \namendments were offered, and never once--I guess on one occasion we had \na supermajority vote. There was only one tabling motion I know of. I \ndid everything I could to make this as inclusive a process as possible.\n  I understand some people don't like the bill. It saddens me, in a \nway, that it has once again become sort of a mindless partisan argument \nrather than talking about what we need to be doing. This is not the end \nof all of it, obviously. Oversight will be required, consultation in \nthe coming weeks and months and years, to make this work well. But, \nMadam President, I can't imagine another process that has been as \ninclusive.\n  My colleagues will recall that almost 10 months, going on almost a \nyear ago, I invited both Democrats and Republicans on the Banking \nCommittee to assume responsibility for major sections of this bill, \nwhich they did do, by the way, and made a significant contribution to \nthe product. So while I respect those who want to vote against the \nbill, and that is their right to do so, find some arguments based on \nthe merits rather than arguing about whether there was a process that \nwas inclusive or that allowed people the opportunity to be heard.\n  Again, we have the right to be heard, but we don't have the right \nnecessarily to have our ideas become the law of the land. That is what \na body like this is for.\n  So this is a major undertaking, one that is historic in its \nproportions, and it is an attempt to set in place a structure that will \nallow us to minimize problems in the future. I can't legislate \nintegrity. I can't legislate wisdom. I can't legislate passion or \ncompetency. What we can do is to create the tools and the architecture \nthat allow good people to do a good job on behalf of the American \npublic. That is what a bill like this is designed to do.\n  I regret I can't give jobs back, restore foreclosed homes, or put \nretirement monies back into accounts. What I can do is to see to it \nthat we never, ever again have to go through what this Nation has been \nthrough. That is what this effort has been about over the last several \nyears, to try to create that structure, that architecture. It will be \nincumbent now on the present administration and those who follow to \nnominate good people to head up these operations, to attract good \npublic servants who will fill the jobs of these various regulatory \nbodies to see to it that they do the work we all want them to do.\n  Again, I can't legislate that. I can merely create the opportunity \nfor that kind of protection to occur--to modernize a financial system, \nto lead the world, if we can, in harmonizing rules so we don't have the \nkind of sovereign shopping that was going on with regulatory bodies, \nwhere major financial institutions would shop around the world as to \nthe nation of least resistance or the regulator of least resistance.\n  We need to see to it that we have the unanimity or at least the \nharmonization of rules that will allow us to have a more orderly system \nin our globe because, as we have all painfully learned, matters that \noccur thousands of miles away can affect the economy in our own \ncountry.\n  So for all those reasons, Madam President, I thank my colleagues for \ntheir efforts over the last 2 years. I thank the leadership for \nproviding the opportunity and time for us to do this in this Chamber. I \nthank my colleague in the House, Barney Frank, and his colleagues for \nthe work in which they engaged in order to produce a bill there. We \nspent 2 weeks, some 70 hours of debating the conference report, where \nmore amendments were adopted--again, offered by my colleagues, \nRepublicans and Democrats--to make this as good a bill as we could in \nall of this.\n  So with that, Madam President, I will reserve some comments for \nlater, but as we approach this vote in the next few minutes, I urge my \ncolleagues to invoke cloture, to allow us to then have an up-or-down \nvote on this bill, and to do what we can to restore some trust and \nconfidence and optimism for the American people. In the midst of the \nworst economic crisis in the lives of most Americans, this \ninstitution--the Senate--rose to the occasion and crafted a bill to \naddress the financial\n\n[[Page S5879]]\n\nservice structure of our Nation to once again give us the hope that we \ncan see wealth created, jobs produced, and an economy that will offer \nopportunities for the next generation of Americans.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the cloture motion, and I urge them \nto support the bill when the vote occurs later today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, later today, we will have a decisive \nvote on the financial regulatory bill that does nothing to reform the \ngovernment-sponsored enterprises that many people believe to have been \nat the root of the financial crisis this bill grew out of--a bill that \nwas meant to rein in Wall Street but which is now supported by some of \nWall Street's biggest banks and opposed by small community banks in my \nState; a bill that is meant to help the economy but which is widely \nexpected to stifle growth and kill more jobs in the middle of a deep \nrecession; and a bill that, according to the papers, the vast majority \nof Americans simply don't think will work.\n  As it turns out, the American people don't seem to like this \ngovernment-driven solution to the financial crisis any more than they \nliked the Democrats government-driven solution to the Nation's health \ncare crisis. They do not think this bill will solve the problems in the \nfinancial sector any more than they think the health care bill will \nlead to lower costs or better care. One survey this week indicates that \n7 in 10 Democrats have little confidence the proposals in this bill \nwill avert or lessen the impact of another financial catastrophe, and \nnearly 70 percent of them doubt it will make their savings more secure.\n  It is easy to see why. The Wall Street Journal calls this bill's \n2,300 pages ``the biggest wave of new Federal financial rulemaking in \nthree generations.'' The chairman of the Banking Committee has famously \nsaid last month we would not know how this bill works until it is in \nplace. But here are some initial indicators about its scope according \nto a study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce on the new bureaucratic \nlandscape under this bill: 70 new Federal regulations through the new \nBureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 54 new Federal regulations \nthrough the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 11 new Federal \nregulations through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, 30 new \nFederal regulations through the Federal Reserve, and 205 new \nregulations through the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  Those are just some of them. All told, this bill would impose 533 new \nregulations on individuals and small businesses, regulations that will \ninevitably lead to the kind of confusion and uncertainty that will make \nit even harder for struggling businesses to dig themselves out of the \nrecession. It is just this kind of uncertainty that will deter lending \nand freeze up credit as lenders wait to see how they will be affected \nby the new regulations. It is just this kind of uncertainty that \nbusinesses cite time and time again as one of the greatest challenges \nto our economic recovery.\n  So here is a bill that fails to address the root causes of the kind \nof crisis it is meant to prevent, that creates a vast new unaccountable \nbureaucracy, that--if past experience is any guide--will lead to \ncountless burdensome, unintended consequences for individuals and small \nbusinesses; a bill that constricts credit and stifles growth in the \nmiddle of the worst economic period in memory; and perhaps most \ndistressing of all, a bill that punishes farmers, florists, doctors, \nretailers, and countless others across the country and far away from \nWall Street who had absolutely nothing to do with the panic of 2008.\n  In other words, once again, the administration and its Democratic \nallies in Congress have taken a crisis and used it rather than solving \nit. How else can you explain the fact a bill that was meant to address \nthe excesses on Wall Street is expected to hit individuals and \nindustries that had nothing to do with the crisis it was meant to \nprevent?\n  Did anybody think when this bill was first proposed that it would end \nup hurting storefront check cashers, city governments, small \nmanufacturers, home buyers, credit bureaus, and farmers in places such \nas Kansas and Kentucky?\n  This is precisely the kind of thing Americans are tired of--a \ngovernment simply out of control. Only in Washington would you create a \ncommission aimed at looking into the causes of a crisis, then put \ntogether and pass a 2,300-page bill in response to that crisis before \nthe commission even has a chance to report its findings and issue \nrecommendations. The White House will call this a victory. But as \ncredit tightens, regulations multiply, and job creation slows even \nfurther as a result of this bill, they will have a hard time convincing \nthe American people this is a victory for them.\n  Obviously, I will be opposing this bill, and I would encourage my \ncolleagues to oppose it as well.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent the time during the quorum be equally charged to \nboth sides.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, the Wall Street earthquake that sent shock \nwaves around the world has not hit anywhere as hard as it hit Nevada. \nYou can draw a straight line from unchecked greed on Wall Street to the \ncollapse of the housing market on Main Streets throughout my State and \naround the country. As soon as the big banks went down, foreclosure \nsigns went up.\n  How did this happen? Let's put it this way: When you go to any of the \ngreat casinos across Nevada and put your chips on the table, you are \ngambling with your own money. If you win, you win, and if you lose, you \nlose. But Wall Street rigged the game. They put our money on the table. \nWhen they won, they won big. The jackpots they took home were in the \nbillions. And when they lost--and, boy, did they lose--they came crying \nto the taxpayers for help. The winnings were theirs to enjoy but the \nlosses were all of ours, to share and to shoulder.\n  That is the way the market worked. It worked for a few fortunate ones \nin the big firms and worked against everyone else. So when I say that \nis how the market worked, what I mean is that it didn't work at all. It \nwas badly broken and it nearly bankrupted us. It cost 8 million workers \ntheir jobs, millions of retirees their savings, and millions of \nfamilies their homes. It shattered our faith in our financial system.\n  But there is another problem. We have been talking about this rigged \nsystem, this raw deal, in the past tense, but it is not a thing of the \npast. It is very much in the present. The rules that allowed Nevada's \neconomy to collapse are still the same rules of the road today. That \nmeans every new day we do not act we run the risk of it happening all \nover again. That is a gamble I am not willing to take.\n  The bill before us makes sure we do not have to take that gamble. The \nfirst question was, How did this happen? The next question is, What are \nwe going to do about it?\n  No. 1, we are saying to those who gamed the system that the game is \nover. We are cracking down on those who gambled away what so many have \nworked so hard to put away.\n  No. 2, we are saying to the families and taxpayers, never again will \nyou be asked to bail out a big bank when the bank loses its risky bets.\n  Let me say that again because it is one of the most important parts \nof this bill: No more bailouts because no bank is too big to fail. We \nare going to give consumers and investors the strongest protections \nthey have ever had against abusive banks, mortgage companies, credit \ncard companies, and credit rating agencies. We are going to bring \nderivative markets that operate in the darkness out into the light. We \nare going to hold Wall Street accountable because we know we are \naccountable to the American people. This is about our ability to trust \nour financial system, it is about giving families the peace of\n\n[[Page S5880]]\n\nmind they deserve, the peace of mind that comes with the knowledge they \nwill be able to keep their homes and their savings will be safe.\n  We need a free market to thrive and grow and succeed. We acknowledge \nthat. But there also have to be some rules, not to stifle but to \nsafeguard us; rules so that when these firms fail they don't bring us \ndown with them.\n  When this earthquake hit there was not nearly enough oversight, \ntransparency, or accountability to shield us from the fallout. This law \nwill change that. It will strengthen all three.\n  We are at the finish line this morning but getting here has not been \neasy. Wall Street doesn't like this bill. Of course it doesn't. Why \nwould they want us to change the system they rigged, the system that \nmade them all rich? Their cronies in Washington don't like it either. \nThe top Republican in the House very publicly said the plight of \nmillions was as small and insignificant as an ant, an insect; \nforeclosures, homes underwater, jobs lost--like an ant. The head of the \nRepublican party asked us to simply trust Wall Street to look after \nitself.\n  We all know this crisis is enormous and we all know Wall Street is \nnot going to reform itself. Rather than standing up for the taxpayers, \nthose who are about to vote no are standing with the same bankers who \ngambled away our jobs and homes and our economic security in the first \nplace. Just like their Wall Street friends, it seems our opponents care \nmore about making short-term gains than they do about what is right for \nthe economy in the long run. I think that is a mistake and I think it \nis a shame.\n  This is not about dollars and cents only, it is about fairness. It is \nabout justice. It is about making sure there is not a next time. It is \nabout jobs. It is about rescuing our economy.\n  I know Wall Street reform is complicated. There are not many people \nwho know all the ins and outs of derivative trading and credit default \nswaps or mortgage-backed securities. But the principle before us is \nquite simple. It is not complicated at all. You either believe that we \nneed to strengthen the oversight of Wall Street or you don't. You \neither believe we need to strengthen protections for consumers or you \ndon't.\n  Our choice today is between learning from the mistakes of the past or \ndangerously letting them happen all over again.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The cloture motion having been \npresented under rule XXII, the Chair directs the clerk to report the \nmotion to invoke cloture.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the conference \n     report to accompany H.R. 4173, the Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act.\n     Harry Reid, Christopher J.

On this vote, the yeas are 60 and \nthe nays are 38. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am about to propose a unanimous-consent \nrequest that has been agreed to by the respective leaders.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the postcloture time be considered \nexpired at 2 p.m., with the time until then equally divided and \ncontrolled between Senators Dodd and Shelby or their designees; that \nduring this period, if and when a budget point of order is raised \nagainst the conference report, then an applicable waiver of the point \nof order be considered made; that at 2 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote \non the motion to waive the applicable budget point of order; that if \nthe waiver is successful, without further intervening action or debate, \nthe Senate vote on adoption of the conference report.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I rise to make a point of order that the \nSenator from Connecticut alluded to. We have rules around here we have \nset up to discipline ourselves on spending. Unfortunately, we \nconsistently ignore and waive them. That is one of the reasons we have \na $13 trillion debt. That is one of the reasons we will have a $1.4 \ntrillion deficit this year alone. This bill violates those rules. This \nbill violates one of the sections of those rules which says that in any \n10-year period, we shall not have more than a $5 billion effect on the \ndeficit in a negative way; that we need to otherwise pay for what we \nare doing. Therefore, this bill does violate the Budget Act.\n  If we are going to have any fiscal discipline around here--and we \nhear a lot of people talking about that--we should be living by the \nrules we have to assert fiscal discipline. Therefore, I make a point of \norder that the pending bill violates section 311(b) of S. Con. Res. 70 \nof the 110th Congress.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and the waiver provisions of \napplicable budget resolutions, I move to waive all applicable sections \nof that act and those budget resolutions for purposes of the pending \nconference report and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I understand the vote will occur somewhere around 2 \no'clock.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I see my colleague from Texas is seeking \nrecognition. I wish to publicly thank her. She made a substantial \ncontribution to this bill on several amendments that were adopted \nduring debate on the floor. I thank her for them. They added to the \nvalue of the legislation. I am not sure what her comments will be right \nnow, but I thank her for her contributions.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I appreciate the comments of the \nchairman. He accommodated many of the amendments I had, particularly as \nit concerns community banks. That was a huge concern in the original\n\n[[Page S5881]]\n\ndraft of the bill. I thank the chairman for accommodating those \nconcerns. It did make it a better bill.\n  I wish to return to the aftermath of the financial crisis, when \nCongress was tasked with the responsibility of modernizing our \nfinancial regulatory structure so that we would have proper oversight \nof today's banking system and financial markets. We were called to fill \nin gaps in regulations which allowed American home buyers to simply \nsign on the dotted line to purchase a house that was in many instances \nbeyond their means, to let companies hide trillions of dollars in \nassets from regulators, and ultimately led our government to lose \nhundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars to bail out financial \ninstitutions--Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, GM, Chrysler, and AIG. Thus, \nwere financial regulatory reform to succeed, we needed to enhance \nmortgage underwriting standards, bring greater transparency to the \nderivatives markets, and once and for all end too big to fail. The \nconference report before us takes steps toward these goals.\n  The legislation puts in place measures to address too big to fail; \nhowever, it falls short in fully addressing the risk of future \ngovernment bailouts by failing to make changes to the Bankruptcy Code. \nIn this legislation, we have also made strides to strengthen mortgage \nunderwriting standards.\n  I am concerned that a newly formed Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau will take the lead rather than our banking regulators, and this \nis one of the biggest concerns I have with the bill.\n  I am pleased that the conference report includes numerous measures \nfor which I fought. I thank Chairman Dodd for his willingness to work \nwith me and his constructive approach to making changes to the bill, \nincluding a more level playing field for community banks across the \ncountry to compete through my amendment to bring parity to FDIC \ninsurance assessments; my amendment, along with Senator Klobuchar, to \nallow State-chartered banks and small and medium-size bank holding \ncompanies to retain Federal Reserve supervision so that our monetary \npolicy truly reflects economic conditions throughout the country, not \njust on Wall Street; relief for small and medium-size public companies \nfrom the burden of rule 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley; and assurance that \nthe Volcker rule's proprietary trading restrictions will not extend to \nthe insurance affiliates of insurance companies with depository \ninstitutions. These are positive changes for which I give the chairman \ngreat credit. However, these positive changes are greatly outweighed by \nmisplaced priorities to create new layers of bureaucracy while failing \nto address the root causes of the financial crisis--Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac.\n  Additionally, there are a series of provisions that are troubling to \nme. No. 1 is this consumer protection bureau. It is using the faults of \nWall Street banks and executives to create a cumbersome new bureaucracy \nwhich will impose job-killing regulation at the expense of Main Street \nsmall businesses and families. The Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, with endless authority over all facets of our economy, is not \nthe answer.\n  I am particularly concerned about the effect this bureau will have on \nwell-regulated, safe, sound community banks. These banks largely \navoided the subprime market, and they didn't engage in the risky \nspeculative trades that contributed to the financial meltdown. However, \nthese community banks are going to have 27 new or expanded types of \nregulation after this bill is passed. The consumer bureau could \nultimately determine what products community banks can offer, on what \nterms they can offer these products, and under what settings and \ncircumstances. Overall, the consumer bureau will result in fewer \nproducts and services for American families and small businesses.\n  The Texas Bankers Association tells me consumer bureau rules could \nresult in the end of free checking accounts, higher fees on all \nconsumer services, and less opportunity to negotiate on loans. It is \nnot the big banks on Wall Street voicing concerns and opposition to \nthis bill. The opposition is coming from community bankers in Texas who \nare worried they will be unduly penalized for faults they did not \ncommit.\n  Small businesses are also against this new consumer bureau. The U.S. \nChamber of Commerce and the National Federation of Independent Business \nare very concerned about this bureau.\n  We need community banks to continue extending credit to worthy \nfamilies looking for a home and to small businesses to invest in and \ncreate jobs. I cosponsored an amendment during Senate consideration to \nensure that safety and soundness regulators would have a say in the \nrules and regulations imposed on their institutions. That amendment was \nrejected, leaving community banks subject to this new bureau's \nunlimited and unchecked rulemaking authority.\n  I am also concerned with the treatment of derivatives in this \nlegislation. I am concerned that the lack of transparency that needed \nreform has been exchanged for a regulation I do not think is going to \nproperly regulate derivatives.\n  However, we must also protect end users such as airlines, utilities, \nmanufacturers, and oil and gas companies. These companies use \nderivatives as a cost effective strategy to control price and risk. \nMany structure derivatives contracts are unique to their business, \nmaking it difficult to clear and trade on a market. I share concerns \nfrom derivatives end users that this mandate to post margins with cash, \nrather than collateral, will remove capital from investment and job \ncreation.\n  While Senator Dodd and Senator Lincoln say that this legislation will \nnot impose margin requirements, I worry that there is not a statutory \nexemption for end users. End users may even choose market volatility \ninstead of risk-controlling derivatives altogether, exposing Americans \nto higher prices, slower economic growth, and more job losses.\n  We should seek transparency through greater reporting requirements, \nbut businesses should not be forced to arbitrarily move money to margin \naccounts.\n  I am concerned that this legislation will cost more jobs at a \nparticularly harmful time with national unemployment hovering around 10 \npercent. The Chamber of Commerce reports that the margin requirement on \nOTC derivatives could cost 100,000 to 120,000 jobs in S 500 companies \nalone.\n  This legislation does nothing to rein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. \nSince the government takeover of these two GSEs, taxpayers have paid \n$145 billion to keep them afloat. The CBO reports that the government's \ncost to bail out Fannie and Freddie will eventually reach $381 billion.\n  These costs contributed to a Federal deficit which has topped $1 \ntrillion for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2010. They have helped \npush our national debt to $13 trillion. A couple of weeks ago, the CBO \nreported that United States debt will reach 62 percent of GDP by the \nend of this year, the highest since just after World War II. We cannot \ncontinue to this dangerous path and mirror the crisis that currently \nravages Europe.\n  We cannot sustain these debts and deficits. We offered solutions to \nrein in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. During Senate consideration of this \nlegislation, I cosponsored amendments--No. 3839 and No. 4020--which \nwould have re-imposed the cap of Federal assistance to the GSEs at $200 \nbillion each. These amendments would have brought Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac onto our budget so that Americans could see their true \ncost. And they would have brought an end to Fannie and Freddie's \ngovernment conservatorship in 2 years. Unfortunately, these amendments \nwere rejected. Furthermore, the conference committee would not even \npermit amendments to be offered on the GSEs. Instead, this legislation \ncalls for a report, punting the plan for Fannie and Freddie that we \nneed to the future. We need reform of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac now, \nbut this legislation does not even allow for debate of the GSEs.\n  The American people are frustrated with our government, and this \nlegislation is an example of why. Under the guise of financial \nregulatory reform, this legislation continues the unprecedented growth \nin government.\n  The American people want sensible financial reform. However, this \npurported financial regulatory reform legislation does not even address \nthe root causes of the crisis: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Instead, it \nuses the crisis to add layers of Federal bureaucracy,\n\n[[Page S5882]]\n\nand threatens to slow down our economic recovery, risking job loss and \nrestricting access to credit.\n  For these reasons, this legislation is not the reform we need, which \nis why I must oppose the conference report for H.R. 4173.\n  We need to fully look at some of the concerns in this bill with the \nhope that when it passes--I cannot support it, but it will pass--these \ncautions will be looked at going forward to perhaps, when the problems \ncome to light later, make some changes to the law that will better \naccommodate the needs of consumers and small businesses and community \nbanks in the country.\n  There are good parts of this bill. I think the chairman deserves a \nlot of credit for pushing this financial reform, knowing that we needed \nto do it. I don't think it fully meets the test of doing what we should \nbe doing, but I do think it is a first step, and the chairman is to be \ncommended for his leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, my friend and colleague from Texas serves \non the Banking Committee. I thank her and Senator Klobuchar. There was \na series of amendments in which Senator Hutchison was involved. They \nadded value to this bill, and I thank her for it.\n  I mentioned yesterday, as a relatively junior member of the Banking \nCommittee, there was no Member of this Chamber who added as much to the \nbill as the Senator from Virginia. There are not words nor time for me \nto adequately express my gratitude for his involvement. Literally \nalmost on an hourly basis, he was involved, along with Senator Corker \nof Tennessee. They spent hours on their own talking with other people \nabout how to fashion two of the most critical titles of this bill. Let \nme express my gratitude once again to Senator Mark Warner of Virginia \nand thank him immensely for his contribution. He did a great job.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Madam President, I thank the chairman for those kind \nremarks. It is a good feeling for all of us who have labored on this \nlegislation--Members and staff--that we are finally coming to a \nsuccessful conclusion on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act and it is going to be enacted into law.\n  As those equally controversial pieces of legislation in the 1930s \nstood the test of time for decades, I think this bill will stand the \ntest of time for decades as well in terms of creating a new set of \nrules of the road for not just America's financial sector but, in a \nsense, the world's financial sector for decades to come.\n  While not perfect--no piece of legislation is--one of the things that \ngives me some confidence that the right balance has been struck is that \nthis bill has been criticized by both the left and the right. Some on \nthe left, some on the Democratic side, have said the bill has not gone \nfar enough in putting more requirements and restrictions on our \nfinancial institutions. Some of my colleagues on the Republican side, \non the right, have said this bill goes too far.\n  The fact that it is getting perhaps that left-and-right criticism \nputs us maybe in that right-in-the-middle section, which is the \nappropriate balance we tried to strike since the chairman started this \neffort well over 2 years ago.\n  I think it is important at times we remember why we are here. Two \nyears ago, the markets were in chaos. President Bush and Secretary \nPaulson had created TARP with a $700 billion unprecedented bailout to \nshore up our financial system. President Obama was in crisis mode with \nour economy still in free-fall from day one. The Dow was at 6,500, and \nthere was a lot of talk of nationalizing banks.\n  Well, close to a year and a half to 2 years later, we have seen \nstimuluses and stress tests. We have seen a DOW that now has touched \n11,000. While the economy is not creating jobs at the rate any of us \nwould like to see, the talk of financial Armageddon or complete \ncollapse has disappeared.\n  I think we went into this process with three goals: First, the \ntaxpayers must never again hear that a company is too big to fail. \nSecond, we had to fix our regulatory system to make sure the huge gaps \nthat existed that allowed systemic regulatory arbitrage could no longer \ntake place. And, finally, consumers and investors had to have \nconfidence that our markets were fair, transparent, and that there \nwould be an officer on the beat to make sure some of the excesses that \ntook place in 2005, 2006, and 2007--where folks were being put into \nhomes they could never afford to pay for or having financial \ninstruments that were being created under the guise of lowering the \ncost of risk that were more about simply creating fee income--would \nnever again prey on unweary investors or on homeowners who got \nthemselves into trouble.\n  I think one of the most interesting critiques that some still make of \nthe bill is that we have not addressed too big to fail. Well, candidly, \nwith the United States moving first on this legislation, and the rest \nof the world waiting for the United States to move, we hear from our \nEuropean colleagues that the framework we have set up, actually, they \nhope to emulate. We have created a new regulatory structure so the \nregulators can get out of their silos--depository institutions on one \nside, security institutions on another, derivatives trading on a \nthird--and make sure we have a full systemic risk council so we can \nmeasure risk wherever it exists, regardless of the charter of the \norganization.\n  While some said we ought to go ahead and limit the asset size of some \nof our institutions, just on size alone, I think the chairman wisely \ndecided as we went through a year and a half of hearings, what often \nprecipitated the greatest risks to our system was not size alone--\nAmerica has only 4 of the 50 largest banks in the world--but it was the \ninterconnectedness, their leverage, their failure to have appropriate \nrisk management plans in place.\n  This new systemic risk council is specifically charged with making \nsure our large, more complex institutions have more stringent capital \nrequirements, leverage ratios, liquidity requirements, and risk \nmanagement tools. We even created two whole new categories, that while \nnot fully tested--both of these categories actually came from \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--they could be important new \nsteps to prevent these large institutions from failing.\n  One is contingent debt that large institutions would have to have \nthat if they get themselves even close to trouble, that debt would \nconvert into equity, consequently diluting existing shareholders and \nmanagement and keeping pressure on the board to make sure management \nwould not take that risk.\n  Finally, a tool that, again, if implemented correctly, will be \ntremendously powerful; that is, to ensure that all these large, complex \ninstitutions provide a plan about how they will be able to unwind in an \norderly fashion through traditional bankruptcy provisions. Our goal is \nto always have bankruptcy be the appropriate response. If that \nliquidation plan or if that debt plan is not blessed by the council of \nregulators, the council of regulators can dismember, break up, or put \nother restrictions on these large institutions.\n  I think Senator Dodd made the decision to task my good friend, \nSenator Corker of Tennessee, and I with this issue: If those processes \nstill do not work, how do we make sure we have an orderly liquidation \nprocess? Our goal was twofold: One, taxpayers should never have to bear \nthe risk; and, two, if an entity goes into liquidation, it will not \ncome out. Liquidation or resolution is not an attempt to stand up an \ninstitution. But we wanted to make clear to shareholders, to \nmanagement, if you go into resolution, you are toast, as my colleague, \nSenator Corker, often said.\n  We think we have reached that goal, and I am particularly proud of \ntitles I and II of this bill. Actually, when Chairman Dodd and Senator \nShelby put some amendments to it, it was endorsed by 95 of our \ncolleagues. It is the broadest bipartisan section of this legislation. \nThis bill addresses a number of other vital areas as well. It allows a \nsingle depository place to get the appropriate day-to-day information \non our financial institutions--that still did not exist until we \ncreated the Financial Services Oversight Council--and having the \nability to get on a daily basis the level of interconnectiveness of a \nfuture AIG.\n\n[[Page S5883]]\n\n  It puts in place a consumer protection bureau to make sure, for \nexample, mortgages are regulated in a way that consumers can \nunderstand, regardless of the charter of the organization. We often \nfound banks had a fairly good ability to regulate some of their \nmortgages; whereas, mortgage lenders and others, who were unregulated, \nhad no such restrictions. Now we have an even playing field.\n  It finally puts in place--there is some debate on this issue--an \nappropriate process to regulate derivatives and to bring these critical \nbut potentially dangerous instruments out of the shadows, and the vast \nmajority of these instruments will now be traded in a more transparent \nway on exchanges.\n  There is more to be done. Domestic and international implementation \nis vitally important. As I mentioned at the outset, the United States--\nand this is one of the things that is kind of remarkable, when I hear \nfrom some of my colleagues we have moved too quickly or this bill does \ntoo much--candidly, the whole rest of the world has been waiting on \nAmerica to act to set the template for broad-based financial reform. \nNow that we have acted, I think particularly Europe and Asia will \nfollow our stead. But making sure we do this with appropriate \ninternational implementation is terribly important--the Basel \ncircumstances--but also making sure we have the regulatory approach \nacross the world correct so there is not an international ability to \narbitrage with these large financial institutions.\n\n  I know some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have also \nraised the question that this bill does not fully address the GSEs. \nThey are right. But I think it was the right and conscious decision of \nthe chairman and others that to disrupt an already still fragile \nhousing market at this moment in time in a piece of legislation that \nhas already been accused by some as being too broad and covering too \nmany items was not the appropriate choice.\n  We will have to come back and deal with GSEs. We have to make sure, \nas we deal with GSEs, international implementation, we stay vigilant. \nWe have given the regulators the tools. How they use these tools will \nbe up to us in Congress to make sure they are implemented correctly \nwith appropriate oversight.\n  I am, in certain ways, disappointed this bill is not being passed \nwith broader bipartisan legislation. But we have only gotten here \nbecause there is bipartisan support.\n  I want to close acknowledging again--the chairman was very kind in \nhis remarks--I cannot think, in my short tenure in the Senate, of any \nother Senator who has worked harder on a piece of legislation, who has \nbeen more relentless, who has had more twists and turns, who has had \nmore ``we are there; but, oh, my gosh, we may not be there,'' who has \nhad probably more 10 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning, 4 o'clock in \nthe morning, I believe at one point, telephone calls and meetings with \nother Members.\n  As the Senator from Texas mentioned earlier, even though the Senator \nfrom Texas could not support the overall bill, our chairman has worked \nwith all Members regardless of party to try to accommodate their \ninterests. I commend the Senator from Texas for pointing out, for \nexample, the community-based and independent banks come out of this \nlegislation as one of the real winners in terms of their ability to \nhave more fair competition with the larger institutions.\n  So I commend the chairman, and I commend all of my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, even those who perhaps will not vote for the final \nproduct but were a part of building the product, where their ideas were \nimplemented.\n  When we think about the Glass-Steagalls, and when we think about the \nbills that created the SEC, when we think about the legislation in the \n1930s, in the moment of crisis, that created the financial framework \nfor 20th-century American capitalism, what this bill has done--there \nwill be work done to improve and fully implement it, but what this bill \nhas done has set a framework for 21st-century American capitalism and, \nin a certain way, a framework for 21st-century capitalism across the \nworld in a way that America can remain the center for financial markets \nbut at the same time making sure both consumers and the investing \npublic are protected in this new and very challenging world.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I again extend my compliments to the \nchairman and all who have been involved in this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I, too, would like to speak to the \nconference report on financial regulatory reform, which we will \npresumably vote on in a couple of hours. I think we all agree that the \npurpose of financial regulatory reform should have been to tackle the \nproblems that led to the financial crisis in the first place. That \nmeans serious reform must, at the very least, end too-big-to-fail \nfinancial institutions and rein in two government-sponsored \nenterprises, the GSEs, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n  But despite its size and the hype behind it, the bill before us fails \nin those two key respects. Moreover, even though Main Street did not \ncause the problem, the bill is so pervasive in its regulatory reach \nthat it creates new burdens for Main Street businesses. I am not sure \nthat is what the bill's supporters want or its authors intend, but that \nwill be the result.\n  For example, a July 4 Wall Street Journal news article entitled \n``Finance Overall Casts Long Shadow on the Plains'' explains how new \nderivatives rules will harm America's livestock farmers.\n  There are other problems with the bill. The biggest new problem it \ncauses is the harm to the availability of credit, something our \ncolleague, Senator Gregg from New Hampshire, has talked a lot about. It \nimplements one-size-fits-all capital standards and uses flawed funding \nmechanisms. It also perpetuates bailouts, and burdens small businesses \nwith new regulations, which I will speak about in a moment.\n  Let me address a few of these problems in more detail: First, the \ncost and offsets of the bill; second, the failure to address the GSEs, \nFannie Mae and Freddie Mac; and, third, the job-killing Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau that will reduce available credit for \nAmerican businesses and thus reduce job creation.\n  First, the cost and offsets. The Congressional Budget Office has put \nthe 10-year cost of the conference report bill at approximately $19 \nbillion. That is the cost of this alleged new reform. Democrats \ninitially tried to fund this obligation with a new tax imposed on large \nfinancial institutions. When that could not be sustained, they decided \non a new funding mechanism that, as National Review recently \neditorialized, ``were a corporation to try it, would get its \naccountants sent to prison for fraud.''\n  Here is how it works. The bill would now ``cancel'' the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, or TARP, a few months early, thus ``saving,'' \ntheoretically, the government around $11 billion, even though it is \nhighly unlikely that money would ever have been used to make additional \nTARP loans. That $11 billion would then be used to partially offset the \ncost of the bill.\n  Remember, that is money that has to be borrowed. So instead of simply \nborrowing 11 billion fewer dollars, we are going to pretend as though \nwe already have that money and that we can save it by not spending it \non TARP, so we will spend it on this legislation. It is a double \ncounting that National Review is right about: It would have put a \nprivate business CEO or CFO in jail if he had tried to do an accounting \ntrick such as that.\n\n  The TARP law moreover states that any money rescinded from TARP shall \nnot be counted for the purpose of budget enforcement. But to avoid \nviolating the so-called pay-go rule in the House, the conference report \nnevertheless uses this alleged savings to pay for the financial reform \nprovisions, thereby violating both the letter and the spirit of the \nTARP law. And, as I said, taking these funds to pay for something else \nrather than rescinding them simply pushes our Nation deeper into debt.\n  So with regard to the cost of the bill--$19 billion--and the offset, \nmuch of which is not a true offset but simple double accounting with \nmoney we don't own or have anyway, but have to borrow, is a bad way to \ndo business, to say the least, especially on something that is called a \nfinancial reform bill.\n  Now, I guess, fortunately, we have changed the name to reflect the \nauthors of the bill. It is no longer the financial reform bill; it is \nnow the Dodd-\n\n[[Page S5884]]\n\nFrank bill. I appreciate the naming of the bill for my good friend, the \nSenator from Connecticut, but it is supposed to be about financial \nreform, and it isn't financial reform when you take money you don't \nhave, spend it for something you are not legally able to spend it for, \nand call that an offset for the cost of the bill.\n  Nevertheless, problem No. 2: Fannie and Freddie. It is just \nunconscionable that this bill doesn't attempt to reform in any way the \ntwo biggest causes of the problem: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. It was \ntheir reckless behavior that was a major cause of the financial crisis. \nIt is not for lack of trying on Republicans' part. Our Democratic \nfriends say: Well, we will do that later, maybe next year. I suggest \ndoing that is highly improbable. The way things work around here is, \nwhen you do a comprehensive bill such as this, there are a lot of \ntradeoffs, a lot of different interests involved. If you can't include \nall of the elements in one bill, it is very difficult to find the \npolitical will to tackle the biggest problem of all--Fannie and \nFreddie--next year without the leverage of the other provisions of the \nbill to deal with.\n  The behavior of these two institutions--these GSEs that have come to \nepitomize too big to fail--has surged through the entire commercial \nbanking sector and our economy as a whole and has turned out to be one \nof the most expensive aftereffects of the financial crisis. For years, \nFannie and Freddie made mortgages available to too many people who \ncould not afford them. Smaller companies were crushed while the two \nGSEs and their shareholders reaped enormous profits, recklessly taking \nadvantage of the government's implicit guarantee to purchase trillions \nof dollars worth of bad mortgages, including those made to risky, so-\ncalled subprime borrowers. It was a textbook example of moral hazard on \na massive scale.\n  I was reminded of what I am speaking of this morning driving in and \nhearing an ad on the radio which said that through Fannie Mae, you \ncould get a mortgage for 105 percent of the value of your home. Now \nthat means that immediately you are so-called underwater; that is to \nsay, you owe more than your home is worth.\n  Why are we immediately making the same mistake with Fannie Mae that \ngot us into the problem in the first place, where the mortgages \nexceeded the value of the homes? I don't understand it.\n  The easy credit that was provided before is what helped to fuel the \nrising home prices that created the inflated housing bubble, especially \nin the subprime mortgage market. As prices rose, so too did the demand \nfor even larger mortgages, so Fannie and Freddie looked for ways to \nmake even more credit available to borrowers. But, of course, when the \nmarket collapsed, the two GSEs were left with billions of dollars of \nbad debt.\n  By 2008 they held nearly $5 trillion in mortgages and mortgage-backed \nsecurities. They were overleveraged but, unfortunately, deemed too big \nto fail.\n  So what do we have today? Fannie and Freddie hold a combined $8.1 \ntrillion of outstanding debt. Think of that: $8.1 trillion. In total, \ntaxpayers have lost already $145 billion bailing them out. When \nSecretary of the Treasury Geithner lifted the bailout cap last \nDecember, it put the taxpayers on the hook for the remainder of these \nlosses, for unlimited losses at these two institutions.\n  So let's be clear. Every day that Fannie and Freddie remain in their \ncurrent form is a day that U.S. taxpayers are subsidizing the failed \npolicies of the past. I think it is very doubtful we are going to get \nmeaningful reform of Fannie and Freddie when it couldn't be done in the \nbill that is supposed to deal with all of the underlying problems that \ncreated the recession we are in now.\n  The third problem: Harming small business through ``consumer \nprotection.'' It harms far more than small business; it harms everyone \nwho is attempting to get credit. As our friend and colleague, Senator \nGregg, has said many times on this floor, perhaps the biggest problem \nwith this legislation is the fact that it is going to make credit much \nmore expensive for everyone. But let's start with small businesses.\n  In my home State of Arizona and across the country, these are the \nentities that hire. They are supposed to be the first ones that hire \ncoming out of a recession. The way they do that is to have access to \ncredit. Well, they are obviously very wary of the intrusive new \nbureaucracy that masquerades as consumer protection in this bill, but \nwhich would compound the problem of credit availability.\n  All of us here support the concept of consumer protection, so let's \ndon't get off on a tangent of being for or against consumer protection. \nWe all support that. The question is, How do you do it? Safeguards can \nbe strengthened without creating a new regulatory bureaucracy with the \npowers that exist in this bill and all of the untoward ramifications \nthat result. Unfortunately, the conference report maintains, with very \nlittle change, the flawed Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from the \nbill that was passed in the Senate, the so-called CFPB. It is housed in \nand funded by the Federal Reserve but theoretically would operate as an \nindependent agency with an enormous budget and with rule-writing \nability and enforcement authority that I think will, in fact, create \nindependence from the Fed.\n  The CFPB could significantly reduce credit access for small \nbusinesses and thereby jeopardize America's economic recovery. Without \navailable credit, companies cannot grow and consequently will not hire \nadditional American workers. Obviously, that is not what the bill's \nauthors intended, but it is the inevitable result.\n  The new bureau will have a say in almost every aspect of American \nbusiness. In an attempt to ensure--and I am quoting now--``ensure the \nfair, equitable and nondiscriminatory access to credit for individuals \nand communities''--the wording in the law--the new bureau will have \nlatitude to impose its will, with few checks and balances, on American \ncredit providers, all of which will result in more expense, more \nregulation, higher costs for consumers, and less availability of \ncredit.\n  The CFPB also exposes companies to very costly compliance and \nextensive enforcement proceedings, including potentially frivolous \nlawsuits, by eliminating national preemption and other means.\n  In my view, the potentially serious costs of this bureau do not \njustify its purported benefits. Consumer protection could have been \naccomplished in much less intrusive and fairer ways. We all want to \nshield consumers from abuses and exploitation, but this is obviously \nnot the right way to do it.\n  So we should ask ourselves one question: Why is it that the CEOs of \nsome of the largest companies on Wall Street, some of the largest \nfinancial institutions, actually favor this bill? Well, it is no skin \noff their backs. They have the money, and they have the resources and \nthe personnel to deal with its complexity and to put the money up front \nand then charge the consumers on down the line. It would entrench their \nprivileged status, as they have the resources to maneuver around its \nprovisions, as I said, and would certainly institutionalize the idea \nthat certain big financial firms deserve preferential treatment by \nFederal regulators.\n  So for all of the reasons I have discussed, as well as others, and \ndespite my strong desire to enact prudent financial reforms, I think \nthis legislation is misguided. I can't support it, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I recognize my friend and colleague from \nDelaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the Dodd-Frank \nbill. I must start by expressing my awe--that old expression from Iraq, \n``shock and awe''--at what Chairman Dodd has been able to do during \nthis session of the Congress. I have been around this place since 1973, \nand I genuinely cannot think of an example where an individual Senator \never participated in passing three bills in one Congress of the \nmagnitude of the health care bill, the credit card reform bill, and now \nthe Dodd-Frank bill. If there is a legislative hall of fame, there is a \nspot for Chris Dodd in that hall of fame.\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\n  I am going to speak today about areas where I don't agree with this \nbill. Anyone who has followed my speeches on the floor would recognize \nthat I have a difference of opinion on a number of issues. However, I \nwish to make it clear from the beginning--and I will raise it again in \nmy speech--to the extent this bill doesn't reach where I want it to \nreach, the responsibility lies on my friends--and I truly mean my \nfriends--and colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n  Time and again, vote after vote, they voted as a block to block \nmeaningful reform on many issues. We can talk about the Brown-Kaufman \namendment to break up the banks or we can talk about the maneuvers that \nwere done on the Brownback bill so we never got a vote, and on Levin-\nMerkley. So as I give this speech today, the reason we didn't get the \nthings I wanted in this bill is because 41 Republicans, time and time \nand time again--when there was a vote up they could have changed the \nway we do things; they could have instituted the kinds of reforms I \nwanted in this bill--voted against it.\n  So Chairman Dodd was left with the problem of, How do we get the \nvotes together to pass the bill? It is essential that we pass a bill, \nand a good bill, and we did, and I am voting for it. But it could have \nbeen, in my opinion, a better bill if several votes had gone the other \nway.\n  After months of careful consideration, landmark financial reform \nlegislation moves toward final passage. While this bill is a vast \nimprovement over the existing regulatory structure, I believe it should \ngo further with respect to erecting statutory rules that address the \nfundamental problem of too big to fail.\n  Anyone who has heard my speeches on the Senate floor starting 4 or 5 \nmonths ago will understand my position on that. I made it abundantly \nclear. I will support the conference report, but I do so with \nreservations about a missed opportunity to enact meaningful reforms \nthat would prevent another financial crisis. But as I said before, \nultimately, given the makeup of the Senate and the requirement for 60 \nvotes and the intransigence on the other side of the aisle, this was \nthe best bill that could pass.\n  For those who wish the bill were stronger, let there be no confusion \nabout where the blame lies. It is because almost every Senator on the \nother side of the aisle did everything they could to stall, delay, and \noppose Wall Street reform.\n  To be sure, the bill that has come out of conference includes some \nextremely important reforms. It establishes an independent Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau with strong and autonomous rulemaking \nauthority and the ability to enforce those rules for large banks and \nnonbank entities such as payday lenders and mortgage finance companies. \nIn addition, it requires electronic trading and centralized clearing of \nstandardized over-the-counter derivatives contracts, as well as more \nrobust collateral margin requirements. The bill's inclusion of the \nKanjorski provision will give regulators the explicit authority to \nbreak up megabanks that pose a ``grave threat'' to financial stability.\n  I was pleased that the bill includes a provision I helped develop to \ngive regulators enhanced tools and powers to pursue financial fraud. \nThrough the Collins provision, the bill also establishes minimum \nleverage and risk-based capital requirements for bank holding companies \nand systemically risky nonbank institutions that are at least as \nstringent as those that apply to insured depository institutions, an \nimportant reform in this bill.\n  In light of the failures of past international capital accords, this \nrequirement will set a much-needed floor on how low capital can drop in \nthe upcoming Basel III negotiations on capital requirements. It will \nalso ensure that the capital base of megabanks is not adulterated with \ndebt that masquerades as equity capital.\n  That being said, unfortunately, I believe the bill suffers from two \nmajor problems. First, the bill delegates too much authority to the \nregulators. I have been around the Senate for 37 years. As I said on \nthe Senate floor on February 4 of this year and in several speeches \nsince then, I know that many times laws are not written with hard and \nclear lines. Laws are a product of legislative compromise, which often \nmeans they are vague and ambiguous. We often justify our vagueness by \nsaying the regulators to whom we grant statutory authority are in a \nbetter position than we are to write the rules--and then to apply those \nregulatory rules on a case-by-case basis. But, as I have said, this was \nnot one of those times. This was a time for Congress to draw hard lines \nthat get directly at the structural problems that afflict Wall Street \nand our largest banks.\n  Despite repeated urging from me and others to pass laws that would \nhelp regulators to succeed, Congress largely has decided instead to \npunt decisions to the regulators, saddling them with a mountain of \nrulemakings and studies. The law firm Davis Polk has estimated that the \nSEC alone must undertake close to 100 rulemakings and more than a dozen \nstudies. Indeed, Congress has so choked the agencies with rulemakings \nand studies, the totality of the burden threatens to undermine the very \nability of the agencies to accomplish their ongoing everyday mission. I \nfor one urge the agencies carefully to triage these required \nrulemakings and studies, establish a hierarchy of priorities, and \nensure that the agencies do not shift all resources to new rules meant \nto address old problems to such a degree that they fail to stay on top \nof current and growing problems. I will have more to say on this \nsubject in a future speech.\n  Second, the legislation does not go far enough in addressing the \nfundamental problem of ``too big to fail.'' Instead of erecting \nenduring statutory walls as we did in the 1930s, the bill invests the \nsame regulators who failed to prevent the financial crisis with \nadditional discretion and relies upon a resolution regime to \nsuccessfully unwind complex and interconnected mega-banks engaged \nacross the globe. I am also disappointed that key reform provisions \nlike the Volcker Rule and the Lincoln swaps dealers spin-off provision \nwere scaled back in conference.\n  The bill mainly places its faith and trust in regulatory discretion \nand on international agreements on bank capital requirements and \nsupervision. After decades of deregulation and industry self-\nregulation, it is incumbent upon the regulators now to reassert \nthemselves and establish rulemaking and supervisory frameworks that not \nonly correct their glaring mistakes of the past, but also anticipate \nfuture problems, particularly risks to financial stability. \nUnfortunately, the early indications we are seeing out of the G-20 and \nso-called Basel III discussions are not encouraging, as critical \nreforms are already being watered down and pushed back in part because \nsome foreign regulators carelessly refuse to heed the risks posed by \ntheir megabanks.\n  The legislation also puts in place a resolution authority to deal \nwith these institutions when they inevitably get into trouble. While \nsuch authority is absolutely necessary, it is not sufficient. That is \nbecause no matter how well Congress crafts a resolution mechanism, \nthere can never be an orderly wind-down of a $2-trillion financial \ninstitution that has hundreds of billions of dollars of off-balance-\nsheet assets, relies heavily on wholesale funding, and has more than a \ntoehold in over 100 countries. Of course, since financial crises are \nmacro events that will undoubtedly affect multiple megabanks \nsimultaneously, resolution of these institutions will be enormously \nexpensive. And until there is international agreement on resolution \nauthority, it is probably unworkable.\n  Given the history of financial regulatory failures and the enormous \nburden of rulemakings and studies with which the regulators are being \ntasked, Congress has a critical oversight responsibility. Congress \nfirst must ensure that the regulators have enough staff and resources \nat their disposal to follow through on their serious obligations. Just \nas important, Congress must monitor the regulatory phase of this bill's \nimplementation closely to ensure that the regulators don't return to \n``business as usual'' when the experience of the most recent financial \ncrisis fades into memory.\n  How quickly we forget. Time and again, I have heard people speak as \nif there was no big financial crisis, saying: I have a bank in my \nhometown that is going to have a problem with this legislation. So we \nshould let all the banks be free to do whatever they\n\n[[Page S5886]]\n\nwant to do. We had a crisis here that practically destroyed the \ncountry, the world, and these people are bringing up anecdotal evidence \nto give these banks more responsibility and not go after the root \ncause.\n  For example, in addition to granting great discretion to regulators \non how they interpret the ban on proprietary trading at banks, the \nscaled-back Volcker Rule contains a large loophole that allows \nmegabanks to continue to own, control and manage hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds under certain conditions. Most notably, it \nincludes a de minimis exception that permits banks to invest up to \nthree percent of Tier 1 capital in hedge funds and private equity funds \nso long as their investments don't constitute more than three percent \nownership in the individual funds.\n  The impact of a supposedly small three percent de minimis exception \nfor investments in hedge funds and private equity firms has the \npotential to be massive. For example, a $2 trillion bank that has $100 \nbillion in Tier 1 capital would be able to invest $3 billion into hedge \nfunds. Since that $3 billion could only constitute three percent \nownership, it would need to be invested alongside at least $97 billion \nof funds from outside investors. The bank would therefore be able to \nmanage $100 billion in hedge fund assets, a massive amount equal to the \ncurrent size of the largest hedge funds in the world combined. What's \nmore, that $100 billion in assets can be leveraged several times over \nthrough the use of borrowed funds and derivatives into overall \nexposures that could exceed a trillion dollars. And given the ambiguity \nof the legislative language, unless clarified by a rulemaking, some \ncommentators have indicated that megabanks could potentially provide \nprime brokerage loans to hedge funds they partially own and run.\n  Fortunately, the final bill does place costs on banks' de minimis \ninvestments in hedge funds and private equity funds. Specifically, the \nlegislation requires a 100 percent capital charge on these proprietary \ninvestments, making them expensive for banks to hold. While this may be \na helpful deterrent, I am concerned that it will not be enough of one, \nparticularly when considering how lucrative and risky an activity it is \nfor banks to run hedge funds and private equity funds.\n  The overarching problem is that banks will continue to be able to \noffer and run--never mind, partially own--risky investment funds. Even \nthough the scaled-back Volcker Rule includes a ``no bailout'' \nprovision, I have concerns about the credibility of that edict. Under \nany circumstance, the failure of a massive hedge fund run by a megabank \nwould pose serious reputational and financial risks to that \ninstitution.\n  Just look at what happened when the structured investment vehicles, \nor SIVs, of Citigroup and other megabanks began to falter. Because of \nthe reputational consequences of liquidating these funds and allowing \nthem to default on their funding obligations, they were bailed out by \nthe megabanks that spawned them even though the SIVs themselves were \ngenerally separate, off-balance-sheet entities with no official backing \nfrom the banks.\n  Finally, the strength of the core part of the Volcker Rule--the ban \non proprietary trading--will depend greatly on the interpretation of \nthe regulators. They will ultimately be the arbiter of whether broad \nstatutory exceptions for ``market making'' or ``risk-mitigating \nhedging'' or ``purchases'' or ``sales'' of securities on ``behalf of \ncustomers'' are allowed to swallow the putative prohibition. I \ntherefore urge the regulators to construe narrowly those activities \nthat constitute exceptions to proprietary trading to ensure that the \nVolcker Rule has some teeth in it.\n  Senator Lincoln's original swap dealer spin-off provision would have \nprohibited banks with swap dealers from receiving emergency assistance \nfrom the Federal Reserve or FDIC. By essentially forcing megabanks to \nspin off their swap dealers into an affiliate or separate company, this \nsection would have helped restore the wall between the government-\nguaranteed part of the financial system and those financial entities \nthat remain free to take on greater risk. It would also have forced \nderivatives dealers to be adequately capitalized.\n  While the final bill includes the Lincoln provision, it limits its \napplication to derivatives that reference assets that are permissible \nfor banks to hold and invest in under the National Bank Act. Since that \nexception covers interest rates, foreign exchange and other swaps, it \nultimately exempts close to 90 percent of the over-the-counter \nderivatives market. Regulators must therefore reduce counterparty \nexposures by requiring the vast majority of derivatives contracts to be \ncleared and calibrate carefully the amount of capital that bank \nderivatives dealers must maintain. Only then can we be sure we never \nagain face a meltdown caused by excessively leveraged derivatives \nexposure that no regulator helps to keep in check.\n  The financial reform bill places enormous responsibilities and \ndiscretion into the hands of the regulators. Its ultimate success or \nfailure will depend on the actions and follow-through of these \nregulators for many years to come.\n  One of my main concerns is, if we elected another President who \nbelieved we should not have regulators and regulation, they would again \nhave the ability to do what they did to cause a meltdown.\n  It is estimated that various Federal agencies will be charged with \nwriting over 200 rulemakings and dozens of studies. Many of the same \nregulators who failed in the run-up to the last crisis will once again \nbe given the solemn task of safeguarding our financial stability. Like \nmany others, I am concerned whether they have the capacity and \nwherewithal to succeed in this endeavor.\n  I repeat again, Congress has an important role to play in overseeing \nthe enormous regulatory process that will ensue following the bill's \nenactment. The American people, for that matter, must stay focused on \nthese issues, if just to help ensure that Congress indeed will fulfill \nits oversight duty and its duty to intervene if the regulators fail. \nLikewise, although I will be leaving the Senate in November, I will be \nwatching closely to see how the regulators follow through on the \nenormous responsibilities they are being handed.\n  Let us not forget why reform is so necessary and important. After \nyears of Wall Street malfeasance and the systematic dismantling of our \nregulatory structure, our financial system went into cardiac arrest and \nour economy nearly fell into the abyss. Wall Street, which had grown \nout of control on leverage and financial gimmickry, blew up. More than \n8 million jobs were wiped out; millions more have lost their homes. We \nspent trillions of dollars in monetary easing and emergency measures to \navert the wholesale failure of many of our megabanks. Not surprisingly, \nwe continue to feel the aftershocks of the worst financial crisis since \nthe Great Depression.\n  Every single thing you look at, almost without exception, when you \nread our newspapers, is related to our present economic situation, \nwhich was caused by lack of regulatory action on Wall Street.\n  The banks are not lending. Fed Chairman Bernanke just days ago urged \nthem to do more for small businesses. Companies and consumers alike \nremain shaken in their confidence. And despite dramatic stimulus \nmeasures, the economic recovery has been slow and tentative. Many of \nthe opponents of Wall Street reform would like to make the dubious \nclaim that the recovery is being held back by uncertainty about future \nregulations and taxes. Can you believe that? In reality, it is being \nheld back by the financial shock and the fact that we are still in a \nperiod of financial instability and undergoing an excruciating process \nof deleveraging. Even now it is unclear whether a European banking \ncrisis based on their holdings of sovereign debt will continue to \nimpede that recovery.\n  It is also being caused by the fact that Americans are losing faith \nin the credibility of our markets. Who wouldn't, after what has \nhappened?\n  I think it has been an important factor in our present hiccup--\nhopefully, it was a hiccup and not a double dip.\n  It is, therefore, imperative that we build a financial system on a \nfirmer foundation. The American economy cannot succeed--cannot \nsucceed--unless we restore and maintain financial stability--not only \nrestore and maintain financial stability but maintain\n\n[[Page S5887]]\n\nthe credibility of our financial system. We simply cannot afford \nanother financial crisis or continued financial instability if the \nAmerican economy is to succeed in the coming decades. Getting financial \nregulation right and maintaining it for years to come should be one of \nthis Nation's highest priorities because the price of failure is far \ntoo high.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Delaware. He \nhighlighted the difficulty in passing legislation. There are those who \nthink it goes too far and those who think it does not go far enough. We \ndo not write a bill on our own. There are 100 of us in this Chamber and \n435 in the other. There are stakeholders, the administration--all sorts \nof people we deal with on these matters. What we try to do is fashion \nthe best proposal we can that moves us forward and addresses the \nunderlying causes, as we tried to with this bill.\n  I appreciate the Senator's points that were raised during the debate \nand discussion. We tried to accommodate them where we could in \nfashioning legislation. It is always a difficult process. You do not \nget to write your own bill. You can write your own bill and introduce \nit, but ultimately, for it to become law requires cooperation. We had \nthat cooperation. I appreciate his involvement very much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I just laid it out. I taught a course \non Congress in law school for 20 years. I say this in all sincerity: \nHoudini could not have gotten through this process. Really and truly, \nwhen one looks at it, Houdini could not have gotten through this \nprocess with a bill.\n  I try very hard to be bipartisan in everything I do, and I try to \nspeak well of my colleagues because I really do like every one of my \ncolleagues on the other side. That is not hyperbole. But when we start \nout with 41 Senators bound and determined to slow down, delay, stop, \nand block, it makes the job the Senator from Connecticut has done even \nmore incredible. And then we have to get 60 votes on anything of \nsubstance. Then we have to go over to the House side. And God bless our \nfriends on the House side. When I talk with them, they just look over \nhere and cannot believe we ever get anything done.\n  Getting this bill done, getting it through the Senate, dealing with \nall the stakeholders, dealing with the administration, dealing with the \nfolks on the House side, and, with all due respect, doing it three \ntimes in one Congress, is definitely a Hall of Fame performance.\n  I thank the Senator again.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, my colleague talked about 41. There are a \nnumber of Republicans who played a very critical and supportive role on \nthis bill. I do not want the record to persist in suggesting that was \nnot the case. Even people on the other side who ended up not voting for \nthe bill--at least have not so far--added substantially to the value of \nthis bill. In some cases, they might not want to acknowledge that, but \nthey did.\n  In the case of our two colleagues from Maine and our colleague from \nMassachusetts, they have taken an awful lot of abuse in the last number \nof weeks because they worked with us on the bill and made significant \ncontributions. While they do not agree with every dotted ``i'' and \ncrossed ``t,'' as I do not with this bill, they decided our country \nwould be better off with the passage of this legislation than not.\n  I do not want the record to be uncorrected when it comes to the \nnumber of people, including those three in particular, who will, I \npresume, continue to take some abuse from others because they did not \ntoe the party line, nor have they on repeated occasions. They have \nacted as U.S. Senators, which is our first responsibility. I know what \nthat feels like. I have been there on numerous occasions in my 30 \nyears. Several times, I was the only Democrat to vote with Republicans \non substantive matters. It is a lonely moment. I can tell my colleague \nwhat happens. It is painful, and you get those long looks from your \ncolleagues. It is uncomfortable, to put it mildly. I will also tell my \ncolleague that some of the proudest moments a colleague will have when \nthey serve here is when they make those decisions and do so for the \nright reasons.\n  While I am deeply grateful to my Democratic colleagues, many of whom \nhad concerns about the bill, as my friend from Delaware did, and have \nbeen supportive all the way through, I guess there is a bit of the \nprodigal son--prodigal daughter in the case of our colleagues from \nMaine and prodigal son in the case of our colleague from \nMassachusetts--when they decided to stand up and help us get a bill \ndone despite the criticism they have received. Everyone who has been \nsupportive and helpful deserves credit, but I think those who were \nwilling to take an awful lot of abuse in the process of doing so \ndeserve commendation.\n  I did not want to let that number stand--41--because it implies \nsomehow there were people on the other side who were not helpful, and \nthey were, including people who did not vote for the bill who were \nhelpful as well.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I totally agree with the Senator. It is \noversimple. I know the Senator from Connecticut received a lot of \nsupport from the Republican side. I know how difficult it is to be the \nperson standing in your caucus when everyone in your caucus wants to \nvote another way. I appreciate that.\n  What is amazing to me is what passed was what the three of them would \nsign on to or others would sign on to. The idea that the Senator came \nwith a bill--every one of my concerns I raised today, if we had gotten \nsome help from the other side might have gone another way. But they \nwere not going to go another way with the group we had.\n  I could not agree with Senator Dodd more. I think it is easy to stand \nup in our caucus and be for this bill. I think what they did was truly \ncourageous. But I also think that on every major issue, to have to \nfigure out how we get 60 votes is a special, difficult problem. It is \nnot like a swan dive. It is not, like they do in the Olympics, a double \nsummersault. Putting all those things together is a triple summersault \nin the pike position. That is the point I want to make--the difficulty \nof getting a bill when we need to get 60 votes on every issue and there \nis a constant pressure on the other side for all to vote together one \nway.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I see our colleague from New Hampshire is \nhere. I will save this for a later debate, but I know there is talk \nabout changing the rules of the Senate because of the frustration \nSenators feel. I will make, in my waning hours here, as strong a plea \nas I can to not succumb to the temptation to change the institution \nbecause of the current frustrations people feel. There is a reason this \ninstitution exists and has the rules it does. All of us one day are in \nthe minority or majority. The fact that some may abuse the rules, as \nhas happened here without any question, ought not to be a justification \nfor fundamentally changing them. There are ways to deal with the \nproblem without losing the essence of the Senate. He is no longer with \nus, but my seatmate, Robert C. Byrd, would speak for hours on end about \nthe importance of not letting the vagaries of the moment dictate the \nlong-term interests of the institution.\n  I will leave that for another day, but I appreciate it.\n  My colleague from New Hampshire is here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nConnecticut, Senator Chris Dodd, and be here on the floor this \nafternoon to talk about the financial regulatory reform bill that is \npending.\n  Before I begin my remarks, I wish to recognize Senator Dodd for his \nleadership and hard work in getting this conference report to the floor \nso that we can hopefully adopt it this afternoon. It is important \nbecause of what has happened in this country and what has happened in \nmy State of New Hampshire.\n  Over the past 2 years, people in New Hampshire and across the country \nhave suffered the consequences of Wall Street's gambles. While we are \nseeing our economy in New Hampshire begin to rebound, which is thanks \nin no small part to the job creation that was spurred by the Recovery \nAct, it is critical that we act to prevent Wall\n\n[[Page S5888]]\n\nStreet's risky, reckless behavior from ever again bringing our economy \nto its knees.\n  We need to put in place reforms to stop Wall Street firms from \ngrowing so big and so interconnected that they can threaten our entire \neconomy. We need to protect consumers from abusive practices and \nempower them to make sound financial decisions for their families. We \nneed more transparency and regulation in the now shadowy markets where \nWall Street executives and investment banks have made gambles. In those \nshadowy markets, the Wall Street firms got all the upside and American \nfamilies got all the downside. We need to do everything we can to \nensure that a financial crisis, such as the one we experienced in late \n2008, never happens again. We need to ensure that taxpayers will not be \nasked to bail out Wall Street. In short, we need to pass the strong \nWall Street reform bill that is before us today.\n  It is also important to note that while this bill requires Wall \nStreet banks to be held more accountable, it does not unfairly burden \ncommunity banks. Community banks did not cause the financial crisis, \nand they should not have to pay for Wall Street's reckless behavior. \nThat is particularly important to us in New Hampshire, where community \nbanks make a huge difference for our cities and towns. That is why I \njoined with Senator Snowe on her amendment to eliminate the \nunnecessary, burdensome requirement that community banks and credit \nunions collect and report on various data about their depositors.\n  I also sponsored another bipartisan amendment, one to make large, \nriskier banks pay their fair share of FDIC premiums and lower \nassessments for community banks. Community bank lending is really the \nlifeblood of New Hampshire's economy. Every dollar community banks have \nto pay for Wall Street's mistakes is a dollar that could be going to \nextend credit to small businesses and to home and consumer loans to \nfamilies.\n  I also joined Senator Collins on her amendment to require Wall Street \nbanks to follow the same capital and risk standards small depository \nbanks must follow. This amendment will make the risky banks that led us \ninto this financial crisis--banks such as Bear Stearns and Lehman \nBrothers--follow the same standards that already apply to small \ndepository banks.\n  This bill requires the big Wall Street banks to have adequate capital \nto prevent taxpayers from having to bail them out again.\n  I am very pleased that those bipartisan amendments, which have \nstrengthened the bill by protecting community banks, have been adopted. \nIt speaks to the conversation Senator Dodd was having with Senator \nKaufman earlier that this is a bill that has gotten broad support in \nthis body and a lot of input that has made it better.\n  I am glad we have been able to work in this bipartisan manner to \ncraft a strong bill that reins in the reckless Wall Street conduct that \nbrought us to the edge of financial disaster. It keeps community banks \nstrong, and it protects consumers and taxpayers.\n  I look forward to voting ``aye'' this afternoon when we get to the \nvote on the conference report.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, briefly, I thank my colleague from New \nHampshire. I see my other colleague from New Hampshire as well. It is a \nNew Hampshire moment. I thank Senator Shaheen and our colleague from \nMaine, Senator Snowe, for working as they did on the community bank \nissues.\n  I was pleased, as I noted yesterday, that the Independent Community \nBankers Association, while not endorsing the entire bill but \nspecifically on their issues involving community banks expressed strong \nsupport for this bill and how much stronger these banks are today as a \nresult of our efforts than would be the case if we were to defeat the \nlegislation. Their ability to compete with these larger banks has been \nenhanced tremendously by what we have done in this bill. If these \nprovisions were not adopted, they would be back in a situation where \nthere would be significant disadvantages for them under the current \nlaw.\n  I am very grateful to Senator Shaheen and Senator Snowe and others \nwho supported their efforts to strengthen the role of our community \nbanks that play such a critical role. As the Senator from New Hampshire \npointed out, they were never a source of the problems in the \nresidential mortgage market at all. That deserves to be repeated over \nand over.\n  I thank the Senator for her comments.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Madam President, Congress is now on the brink of passing \na landmark deal on legislation to reform Wall Street and prevent \nanother financial crisis like the one we faced nearly 2 years ago. This \nlegislation is an important and long overdue measure that will help to \nsafeguard the long-term stability of our economy.\n  In the closing months of the Bush administration, our Nation faced an \neconomic situation so dire that many feared our financial system was on \nthe verge of collapse. Though we were able to avert such a collapse, \nthe impact of the crisis spread across America, leaving few untouched.\n  Virtually all of us have been impacted by the economic meltdown in \nsome way: businesses shed jobs, workers' hours were cut, some folks had \ngreat difficulty making their mortgage payments when their pay was cut, \nsmall businesses lost customers and revenue in the downturn. South \nDakota homeowners, regardless of whether they had a mortgage or owned \ntheir home outright, saw their equity drop, and most folks with \ninvestments for retirement or other long-term goals suffered losses \neither through the stock market plunge, bond market turbulence, or \npassbook savings interest rates that hovered near zero percent. Lending \nat our Nation's banks contracted, spending fell, and overall consumer \nconfidence plummeted.\n  Americans were rightly angry that while they were losing their homes, \njobs, and long-term savings, they were also expected to foot the bill \nfor the irresponsible actions of Wall Street CEOs. Their outrage only \ngrew when these same CEOs continued collecting unprecedented bonuses--\npresumably for their work in recklessly taking our Nation to the brink \nof collapse. Frankly, I share that anger.\n  It is clear that our economy has not yet fully recovered, but in the \nlast year and a half, Congress has dedicated itself to turning our \neconomy around. We are now on the verge of passing historic legislation \nthat creates better accountability and transparency for Wall Street and \nthe financial sector.\n  As a senior member of the Banking Committee, and a member of the \nconference committee, I have worked hard to identify the causes of the \ncrisis and find the right solutions to address these causes. I have \ntalked at length with South Dakotans of all backgrounds and political \nstripes to gain their perspective, and there are some things that get \nmentioned time and again: there were many causes for the meltdown, but \ngaps in regulation contributed to the problem; rules that applied to \nsome financial companies but not all opened loopholes that bad actors \ncould exploit; the lack of a system to monitor risks across the banking \nsector left taxpayers vulnerable; regulators were not very focused on \nlooking out for consumers; and large Wall Street firms operated with \nlittle or no accountability to either their shareholders or their \ncustomers. In addition, it became clear we needed a system to unwind \nbig financial firms like AIG, Lehman Brothers, and Bear Stearns in an \norderly fashion and without taxpayer bailouts. Doing nothing is not an \noption, and I do not think anyone can say with a straight face that our \ncurrent system of financial regulation works for America.\n  While not perfect, the Wall Street reform measure does a great deal \nto address many of these problems. It creates a mechanism to monitor \nsystemic risk in the financial sector, as well as regulating risky \nderivatives, credit default swaps and other complicated financial \nproducts that were not transparent and had previously gone unregulated. \nIt affords consumers better rules governing the products they use and \nbetter information about those products by creating a consumer watchdog \nagency. Importantly, it also creates a way to unwind large financial \nfirms without having to bail them out.\n  Specifically, I want to mention two provisions. First, I am pleased \nthat the conference committee accepted the\n\n[[Page S5889]]\n\nCarper-Bayh-Warner-Johnson amendment, which I strongly supported, \nregarding the preemption standard for State consumer financial laws. \nThis amendment received strong bipartisan support on the Senate floor \nand passed by a vote of 80 to 18. One change made by the conference \ncommittee was to restate the preemption standard in a slightly \ndifferent way, but it is clear that this legislation is codifying the \npreemption standard expressed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Barnett Bank \nof Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, Florida Insurance Commissioner, 517 \nU.S. 25 (1996) case. This will provide certainty to consumers and those \nthat offer consumers financial products.\n  Also, section 913 of the conference report reflects a compromise \nbetween the House and Senate provisions on the standard of care for \nbrokers, dealers, and investment advisers. It includes the original \nstudy provisions passed by the Senate, together with additional areas \nof study requested by the House--a total of 13 separate considerations \nand a number of subparts, where we expect the SEC to thoroughly, \nobjectively and without bias evaluate legal and regulatory standards, \ngaps, shortcomings and overlaps. We expect the SEC to conduct the study \nwithout prejudging its findings, conclusions, and recommendations and \nto solicit and consider public comment, as the statute requires. As \nChairman Frank described the compromise when he presented it to the \ncommittee, section 913 does not immediately impose any new duties on \nbrokers, dealers and investment advisers nor does it mandate any \nparticular duty or outcome, but it gives the SEC, subsequent to the \nconclusion of the study, the authority to conduct a rulemaking on the \nstandard of care, including the authority to impose a fiduciary duty. I \nthink this is a strong compromise between the House and Senate \npositions.\n  This bill gives financial institutions, regulators and consumers the \nright tools to make good decisions, and it also provides the right \ntools to prevent another crisis like the one we recently experienced. \nMany of the bill's provisions, including those mentioned previously, \nhave bipartisan support; in fact, many of the core ideas incorporated \ninto the bill originated from my Republican colleagues.\n  Critics of this legislation have said that it tackles the wrong \nproblems, hurts small banks and businesses, and burdens struggling \nfinancial institutions. I appreciate those points of view, but feel \nvery confident in saying we have taken specific steps to ensure that \nsmall banks and businesses are not negatively affected, to make it more \ndifficult for firms to take dangerous risks, and to strike the right \nbalance between regulation and flexibility. But the bottom line is \nthis: the kind of free-wheeling, self-regulating, anything goes \nenvironment that we had before the crisis is simply not an option.\n  There are certainly provisions in this bill that I would have written \ndifferently as any of my colleagues would if we wrote this legislation \nourselves. But that is not how the Senate and our legislative system \nworks, and overall I think this conference report is very strong \nlegislation. I look forward to its passage.\n  There is no doubt that after the President signs this bill into law, \nthere will be an important focus on implementing this legislation \ncorrectly, as well as continued oversight by Congress of the agencies \nand covered financial institutions, and efforts at international \ncoordination with our counterparts in other countries. It is also \nlikely that there may need to be corrections and adjustments to the \nbill in the future. That said, passage of this bill is important to our \nnation's economic recovery, and we must get it to the President's desk.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the conference \nagreement on financial services regulatory reform and specifically an \nissue in section 619 of title VI, known as the Volcker rule. The \nsection's limitations on financial organizations that own a depository \ninstitution from investing or sponsoring in hedge funds or investments \nin private equity to 3 percent of an organization's assets, in the \naggregate, references ``tier 1 capital.''\n  The term ``tier 1 capital'' is a concept currently applied strictly \nto banks and bank holding companies and consists of core capital, which \nincludes equity capital and disclosed reserves. However, there are \nfinancial organizations subject to the Volcker rule's investment \nconstraints that do not have a principal regulator that utilizes tier 1 \ncapital measurements to determine an entity's financial strength. In \norder to ensure a level playing field with traditional banks, I would \nhope the appropriate regulators would determine a suitable equivalent \nof tier 1 capital to determine the investment limit, while still \nsatisfying the intent of the Volcker rule.\n  I ask the regulators to make certain that these types of financial \norganizations will be subject to the Volcker rule in a manner that \ntakes into account their unique structure.\n  In addition, I am pleased that as part of the conference report that \nthe Volcker language was modified to permit a banking entity to engage \nin a certain level of traditional asset management business, including \nthe ability to sponsor and offer hedge and private equity funds. With \nthat in mind, I wanted to clarify certain details around this \nauthority.\n  First, I was pleased to see that the Volcker Rule, as modified, will \npermit banking entities several years to bring their full range of \nactivities into conformance with the new rule. In particular, section \n619(c)(2) ensures that the new investment restrictions under section \n619(d)(1)(G)(iii) and section 619(d)(4)--including the numerical \nlimitations under section 619(d)(4)(B)(ii)--will only apply to a \nbanking entity at the end of the period that is 2 years after the \nsection's effective date. This date for the regulators to begin \napplying the new rules can also be extended into the future for up to \nthree 1-year periods under section 619(c)(2) and can also separately be \nextended for illiquid funds with contractual commitments as of May 1, \n2010, under section 619(c)(3), on a one-time basis for up to 5 years. \nOnly after all of these time periods and extensions have run will any \nof the limitations under section 619(d)(1)(G) and section 619(d)(4) be \napplied by regulators.\n  Second, as an added protection, section 619(f) applies sections 23A \nand 23B of the Federal Reserve Act to transactions between all of a \nbanking entity's affiliates and hedge or private equity funds where the \nbanking entity organizes, offers, serves as an investment manager, \ninvestment adviser, or sponsor of such funds under section 619(d). \nThese restrictions are also applied to transactions between a banking \nentity's affiliates and other funds that are ``controlled'' by a hedge \nor private equity fund permitted for the banking entity under 619(d). \nImportantly, these 23A and 23B restrictions do not apply to funds not \n``controlled'' by funds permitted for the banking entity under section \n619(d), and it should also be clear that under section 619 there are no \nnew restrictions or limitations of any type placed on the portfolio \ninvestments of any hedge or private equity fund permitted for a banking \nentity under section 619.\n  Third, as a condition of sponsorship, section 619(d)(1)(G)(v) \nrequires that a banking entity does not, directly or indirectly, \nguarantee or assume or otherwise insure the obligations or performance \nof any sponsored hedge or private equity fund or of any other hedge or \nprivate equity fund in which the sponsored fund invests. While this \nrestricts guarantees by the banking entity as well as the insuring of \nobligation or performance, it does not limit other normal banking \nrelations with funds merely due to a noncontrol investment by a fund \nsponsored by the banking entity. As described above, section 619(f) \nlimits transactions under 23A and 23B of the Federal Reserve Act with a \nfund ``controlled'' by the banking entity or a fund sponsored by the \nbanking entity. However, 619(f) does not limit in any manner \ntransactions and normal banking relationships with a fund not \n``controlled'' by the banking entity or a fund sponsored by the banking \nentity.\n  Finally, section 619(d)(4)(I) permits certain banking entities to \noperate hedge and private equity funds outside of the United States \nprovided that no ownership interest in any hedge or private equity fund \nis offered for sale or sold to a U.S. resident. For consistency's sake, \nI would expect that, apart from the U.S. marketing restrictions, these \nprovisions will be applied by the\n\n[[Page S5890]]\n\nregulators in conformity with and incorporating the Federal Reserve's \ncurrent precedents, rulings, positions, and practices under sections \n4(c)(9) and 4(c)(13) of the Bank Holding Company Act so as to provide \ngreater certainty and utilize the established legal framework for funds \noperated by bank holding companies outside of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, let me begin by thanking the Senator from \nConnecticut and congratulating him. He has been pretty effective in his \nlast year in the Senate. He got a lot of stuff moving and a lot of \nstuff through. And I have not agreed with all of it, by the way. Most \nimportantly, he has done it in a fair and balanced way, always with a \nsense of humor and an openness and willingness to listen to those with \nwhom he may not agree entirely and allow us to participate at the table \nin discussions about the problems at the very beginning of the process \nin a very substantial way. So I thank him for his courtesy and for the \nway he runs the committee and the way he ran the HELP Committee when he \nsucceeded to that leadership on the unfortunate passing of Senator \nKennedy. It has been a pleasure to serve with him on this bill and on \nsome very significant issues as we tried to work through them.\n\n  I have reservations about this bill--they are more than reservations. \nI, obviously, believe the bill doesn't get us to where we need to go. \nWhen we started on this effort, our purpose was, in the beginning, \ntwofold: First, we wanted to make sure we could do everything we could \nto build into the system of regulatory atmosphere and the marketplace \nthe brakes and the ability to avoid another systemic meltdown of the \ntype we had in late 2008, which was a traumatic event.\n  Nobody should underestimate how significant the events of late 2008 \nwere. If action had not been taken under the TARP proposal, and under \nthe leadership of President Bush, Secretary Paulson, and then President \nObama and Secretary Geithner, this country would have gone into a much \nmore severe economic situation--probably a depression. Secretary \nPaulson once estimated the unemployment rate would have gone to 25 \npercent. The simple fact is the entire banking system would have \nprobably imploded--most likely imploded--and certainly Main Street \nAmerica would have been put in dire straits.\n  But action was taken. It was difficult action. We are still hearing \nabout the ramifications of it, but it was the right action, and it has \nled to a stabilization of the financial industry. But we never want to \nhave to see that happen again. We never want to have to go through that \ntype of trauma again as a nation, where our entire financial community \nis teetering. So the purpose of this bill should be to put in place a \nseries of initiatives which will hopefully mute that type of potential \nfor another event of a systemic meltdown.\n  The second purpose of this bill--and it is an equally important \npurpose--is that we not do something that harms one of the unique \nstrengths and characteristics of our Nation, where if you are an \nentrepreneur and have an idea and are willing to take a risk and try to \ncreate jobs, you can get credit and capital reasonably easily compared \nto the rest of the world. That has been the engine of the economic \nprosperity of our Nation--the availability of credit and capital, \nreasonably priced and reasonably available to entrepreneurs in our \nNation.\n  Those should have been our two goals. If we match this bill to those \ngoals, does it meet the test of meeting those goals? Unfortunately, I \ndon't think it does. There are some very positive things in the bill. \nThe resolution authority is a good product in this bill, and it will, \nin my opinion--though I know there is a lot of discussion about this--\npretty much bring an end to the concept of too big to fail.\n  If an institution gets overleveraged to a point where it is no longer \nsustainable, and it is a systemic risk institution, it is going to be \ncollapsed. The stockholders will be wiped out, the unsecured bond \nholders will be wiped out, and the institution will be resolved under \nthis bill.\n  That is positive because we do not want to send to the markets a \nsignal that the American taxpayer is going to stand behind institutions \nwhich are simply large. That perverts capital in the markets, and it \nperverts flow of economic activity in the markets when people think \nthere is that sort of guarantee standing behind certain institutions in \nthis country. And I think progress is made in this bill on the issue of \nresolution.\n  But, unfortunately, in a number of other areas, the opportunity to do \nsomething constructive was not accomplished. In fact, in my opinion, \nthere will be results from this bill which will cause us to see a \nnegative effect from this bill. The most negative effects I think will \noccur from this bill lie in two areas. First, in the area of the \nformation of credit.\n  It is very obvious that under this bill there is going to be a very \nsignificant contraction of credit in this country as we head into the \nnext year, 2 years, maybe even 3 years. We are in a tough fiscal time \nright now. It is still very difficult on Main Street America to get \ncredit. The economy is slow. We should not be passing a bill which is \ngoing to significantly dampen down credit, but it will. This bill will. \nIt will for three reasons:\n  First, the derivatives language in this bill is not well thought out. \nIt just isn't. Most people don't understand what derivatives are, but \nlet's describe them as the grease that gets credit going in this \ncountry and everywhere. It is basically insurance products that allow \npeople to do business and make sure they can insure over the risks that \nthey have in a business. This bill creates a new regime for how we \nhandle derivatives in this country.\n  Our goal should have been to make derivatives more transparent and \nsounder. That could have been done easily by making sure most \nderivatives were on over-the-counter exchanges--went through \nclearinghouses I mean, and had adequate margins behind them, adequate \nliquidity behind them, and were reported immediately to the credit \nreporting agencies as to what they were doing. It didn't involve a lot \nof complications, just changing the rules of the road. Instead of doing \nthat, we have changed the entire process. In changing the entire \nprocess, we are basically going to contract significantly the \navailability of these products to basically fund and to be the engine \nor the grease or the lubricant for the ability of a lot of American \nbusinesses to do business.\n  End users in this country who use derivatives are going to find it \nvery hard to have an exemption. They are basically going to have to put \nup capital, put up margin--something they do not do today on commercial \nderivative products--and that is going to cause them to contract their \nbusiness. They will have to contract their business or they are going \nto have to go overseas. Believe me, there is a vibrant market in \nderivatives overseas. They will go to London, and this business will \nend up offshore.\n  Then we have this push to put everything on an exchange. Well, there \nare a lot of derivatives that obviously should go through \nclearinghouses but are too customized to go on exchanges, and we are \ngoing to end up inevitably with a contraction in the derivatives market \nas a result.\n  Then we have the swap desk initiative, which was simply a punitive \nexercise, in my opinion. It is going to accomplish virtually nothing in \nthe area of making the system sounder or more stable. But what it will \ndo is move a large section of derivative activity--especially the CDS \nmarkets--offshore. They will go offshore because they will not be done \nhere any longer. Banks and financial houses which historically have \nwritten these instruments are not going to put up the capital to write \nthem because they don't get a return that makes it worth it to them.\n  I guarantee we are going to see a massive contraction in a number of \nderivatives markets as a result of this swap desk initiative, which was \nmore a political initiative than a substantive initiative, and which is \ncounterproductive. It is a ``cut off your nose to spite your face'' \ninitiative, and it will move overseas a lot of the products we do here \nand make it harder for Americans to be competitive--especially for \nfinancial services industries to be competitive--in the United States. \nSo that will cause a contraction and a fairly big one.\n\n[[Page S5891]]\n\n  The estimates are that the contraction may be as high as $\\3/4\\ \ntrillion. That is a lot of credit taken out of the system. On top of \nthat, there is the issue of the new capital rules in this bill.\n  It isn't constructive for the Congress to set arbitrary capital \nrules. That should be left to the regulators. But this bill pretty much \ndoes that. As a result, a lot of the regional banks, the middle-sized \nbanks--the larger banks would not be affected too much--will find they \nare under tremendous pressure as their tier I capital has to be \nrestructured relative to trust preferred stock.\n  This is not a good idea because, as a practical matter, we will again \ncause a contraction in the market of capital--of credit. As banks grow \ntheir capital, they will have to contract credit. When a bank has to \nget money back in order to build its capital position up, it doesn't go \nto its bad loans because the bad loans aren't performing. It goes to \nits good loans, and it doesn't lend to them. Or it says: We are going \nto draw down your line of credit, because that is where they can get \ncapital. That is what will happen, and we will see capital contract \nthere.\n  On top of that, we have the Volcker rule. The concept is a very good \nidea. We should never have banks using insured deposits to do their \nproprietary activity. But straightening out what this Volcker rule \nmeans will take a while. It may be a year or two before anybody can \nsort out what it means and before the regulations come down that define \nit. So there will be a period of uncertainty, and that uncertainty \nmeans less credit available.\n  Of course, this is another situation where the international banks \nare the winners and the domestic banks are the losers because the \ninternational banks will be able to go and do the same business--the \nproprietary trade--in London, if they are based in London or in \nSingapore, if they are based in Singapore or Tokyo, if they are based \nin Tokyo. But the American banks they compete with aren't going to be \nable to do it. So that makes no sense at all.\n  But as a practical matter, that is what this bill does. So we will \nend up again with a tentativeness in the markets as to what they are \nsupposed to be doing and what they can do in the area relative to the \nVolcker rule, and this will end up creating further credit \ncontractions.\n  So my guess is, when we add it all together, this bill will lead to a \ncredit contraction of probably $1 trillion or more in our economy. What \ndoes that translate into? It translates into fewer jobs and less \neconomic activity. It didn't have to happen this way. This could have \nbeen done in a way that would have been clearer, where the clarity \nwould have been greater, and where we would not have had to take \narbitrary action which was more political than substantive to address \nwhat problems in the industry did exist and should have been addressed.\n  Another area of concern, of course, is this consumer agency. Consumer \nprotection is critical. We all agree to that. What we proposed on our \nside of the aisle was that we link consumer protection and safety and \nsoundness at the same level of responsibility and the same level of \nauthority within the entire bank regulatory system so that the \nprudential regulator--whether it is the Fed or the Office of the \nComptroller--when they go out to regulate a bank and check on it for \nsafety and soundness--or the FDIC--they, at the same time, have the \nsame standard of importance placed on making sure that the consumer is \nbeing protected in the way that bank deals with the consumers. That is \nthe way it should be done. The two should be linked because the \nregulator that regulates the bank for safety and soundness is the \nlogical regulator to regulate the bank to make sure it is complying \nwith consumers' needs.\n  But this bill sets up this brandnew agency, which it calls consumer \nprotection, but it will not be at all, in my opinion. It will be the \nagency for political correctness or correcting political justice or \nissues of political justice that somebody is concerned about. It is \ntotally independent of everybody else. It doesn't answer to anyone \nexcept on a very limited and narrow way to the systemic risk council. \nIt is a single person with an $850 million unoversighted revenue stream \nwith no appropriations. Basically, the person just gets the money and \ncan go off and do whatever they want. There is no relationship between \nthis person and the prudential regulator. So what we will have is an \nindividual who may get on a cause of social justice and say that XYZ \ngroup isn't getting enough loans, and they go out to the banks and say: \nYou have to send XYZ group more loans.\n\n  We might have the bank regulator over here saying to the local banks, \nthe regional banks: You can't lend to XYZ group because we know they \nare not going to pay you back or they will not pay you back at a rate \nthat is reasonable. So we are going to have this inherent conflict.\n  Now, what will be the result of that? The banks will probably have to \nlend to the XYZ group, which means the people borrowing from that bank \nwho pay their loans back will have to pay more because the bank will \nhave to make up for the loss of revenues. As a result, the cost of \ncredit will go up, especially for individuals who are responsible and \npaying down their debts and paying for their credit--paying back their \nloans. We are going to end up with layers and layers of conflicting \nregulation which will cost the banking community money--a significant \namount of unnecessary money.\n  Who pays for that? Well, the consumer pays for it. Clearly, that gets \npassed through. This is one of those Rube Goldberg ideas that can only \ncome out of a government entity. They used to say: You know, the \ngovernment produces a camel when it is supposed to be producing a \nhorse.\n  There is just a disconnect between the reality of what we are \nsupposed to be doing in the area of producing effective regulation \nrelative to protecting consumers and what this bill ends up finally \ndoing.\n  I would not be here to oversee it or participate in it. In fact, \nnobody gets to oversee it, by the way. This consumer protection agency \nis not responsible to the Banking Committee of the Senate or the \nBanking Committee of the House. It is not responsible to the Fed. This \nperson is a true czar.\n  The term ``czar'' is thrown around here a lot, but this person is a \ntrue czar in the area of consumer activity. I suspect we will see that \nthis agency becomes a very controversial agency, with a very political \nsocial justice type agenda, not an agenda which is aimed at primarily \nprotecting consumers.\n  So that is a big problem with this bill, and there are a lot of other \nissues with this bill. At the margin, the issue of how we restructure \nthe regulatory regimes is of some concern, the whole question of how \nstockholders' rights in this bill--and probably not relevant to the \nbanking issue so much--could have been improved on. The bill overall \ncould have been a much better product. But the primary concern I have \ngoes back to this issue of what was the original purpose--to protect \nsystemic risk in the outyears and make sure we continue to have a \nstrong and vibrant credit market for Americans who want to take risks \nand create jobs.\n\n  Two major issues were totally ignored in the bill which would address \nthat question: What drove the event of this meltdown? What caused this \nfinancial downturn? It was the real estate market and the way it was \nbeing lent into. Two things were the basic engines of that problem, \nthat were government controlled. There were a lot of things which \ncaused it, but the two things which the government controlled were, No. \n1, underwriting standards. Basically we divorced underwriting standards \nfrom the issue of whether a person got a loan, so loans were being made \non assets which could not cover the cost of the loan. It was presumed \nthe asset was going to appreciate, a home was always going to \nappreciate in these communities and therefore they could loan at 100 \npercent of the value of the home or 105 percent of the value and still \nhave a safe loan. That was a foolish assumption, to say the least.\n  Second, we didn't look at whether the person could pay the loans back \nwhen these loans were made at zero interest for a year or 2 years. But \nthen they reset, these loans reset at a fairly reasonable or sometimes \nvery unreasonable interest rate and nobody looked at whether the person \ncould pay them back.\n  These loans were being made not for the purposes of actually \nrecovering the\n\n[[Page S5892]]\n\nloans. That was not the reason these loans were being made. These \nsubprime loans were being made because there were fees on the loans and \nthe people making the loans were getting the fees. There was a whole \ncottage industry of people down in Miami who had just gotten out of \nprison who figured this out while they were in prison and they \ndeveloped an entire cottage industry of former prisoners who had been \nreleased, legally, and actually went back into the loan business and \nwere making these loans and getting the fees.\n  Then what aggravated it--first what aggravated it was the \nunderwriting standards, but then it was that these loans got \nsecuritized. They got picked up by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, with the \nunderstanding--it was implicit but it was obvious, as we found out--\nthat Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would essentially insure these loans. \nSo if you bought one of these securitized loans, Fannie Mae and Freddie \nMac would be standing behind it even though the loans were not viable.\n  This bill ignores both those issues. It has very marginal language on \nthe issue of underwriting. It doesn't get us back to standards which \nwould basically protect us from overly aggressive underwriting.\n  People say Canada did not have a problem, Australia didn't have a \nproblem. Why didn't they have a problem? They didn't have a problem \nbecause they required people who were borrowing to put money down and \nthey required that people who were borrowing actually be able to pay \nthe money back. It seems like a perfectly reasonable thing to require, \nbut this bill ignores it.\n  Second, this bill does nothing about Fannie or Freddie--nothing. Talk \nabout ignoring the elephant in the room, this is the whole herd of \nelephants in the room. The American taxpayer today is on the hook for \nsomething like $500 billion to $1 trillion. The estimates vary. Some \npeople say it is even higher than that--the American taxpayer, for bad \nloans, securitized by Fannie and Freddie. This bill says nothing. It is \nas if this problem doesn't exist. It is as if this problem doesn't \nexist. Not only was it one of the primary drivers of the financial \nmeltdown but it is one of the biggest problems we have going forward. \nThe administration says we will do it next year. Well, if you do a \nfinancial reform bill without Fannie and Freddie, you essentially are \nnot doing a financial reform bill at all. I apply the same to the issue \nof underwriting.\n  In my opinion, this bill has some pluses. I know this was worked very \nhard and I admire the efforts of the Senator from Connecticut and \nactually the chairman in the House, Congressman Frank from \nMassachusetts. But the negatives of this bill unfortunately are too \nsignificant to ignore, especially in the area of the short-term credit \ncontraction that is going to occur, the poorly structured derivatives \nlanguage, the Consumer Protection Agency--which I think is going to end \nup being counterproductive to consumers--and the failure to take up the \nFreddie and Fannie issue, and the failure to do stronger underwriting \nstandards.\n  For that reason, I remain opposed to this bill. I understand it is \ngoing to pass. I hope some of my concerns do not come to fruition \nbecause, if they do, unfortunately this economy is going to be slowed \nand our Nation will be less viable economically. But I am afraid they \nwill come to fruition.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized\n  Mr. DODD. I see my other colleagues here, including Senator Specter \nwho wants to be heard, but I want to address my colleague from New \nHampshire because we are both going to be walking out of this Chamber \nin about 5 months. I thank him for his work going back to 20-some-odd \nmonths ago when we were involved in the critical weeks and days in \nSeptember and October. Judd Gregg was invaluable putting together a \nmoment here while, not terribly popular, I think saved the economy and \nthe country. I will not address all his concerns here. We have a \ndifferent point of view on the issues he raised. They are not \nillegitimate issues. We think we addressed them properly. He has a \ndifferent view, and I respect that. I appreciate his work and that of \nhis staff on this bill. He made a significant contribution to this \neffort and I thank him for it.\n  I see my colleague from Pennsylvania here and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, at the outset I wish to ascertain with \nprecision that I have 20 minutes, as had been arranged with the floor \nmonitors. I had looked for 30 but I ask consent I may speak for up to \n20 minutes now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Reserving the right to object, I want to be clear so my \ncolleague will understand this. I had a sheet of paper in front of me--\nI do not have it in front of me now--with the order of those who sought \ntime. I want to be careful, as my colleague from Pennsylvania will \nunderstand. We are going to vote at 2 o'clock. I want to be sure I can \naccommodate my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-three minutes remains to the majority.\n  Mr. DODD. I know Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget Committee, \nhas to be heard and it is critical to me he be heard on the budget \npoint of order.\n  Could you make it a little less than 20?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I really cannot. I had started at 30 and 20 is tough. \nHow early might I return for my 30 minutes?\n  Mr. DODD. After 2 o'clock? Any point after----\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent I may have 30 minutes when the \ntwo votes which are scheduled for 2 o'clock conclude.\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly I would have no objection to that whatsoever. \nTake some time at this juncture too, if you wish.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I will do it all at once. I don't want to truncate it.\n  I ask unanimous consent that I may have the floor for 30 minutes at \nthe conclusion of the two votes scheduled for 2 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DODD. Again, let me reserve the right to object. I see the \nminority wants to check on such a request. I have no objection myself \nbut obviously that is a matter--in fairness to the minority, we want to \nlet them know of such a request. Here we are eating up time right now. \nI see my friend from North Dakota here as well. I am deeply grateful to \nthe chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Go ahead with that request. I am told it is OK.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and my colleague and the unknown \npersons in the cloakroom.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania and the unknown \npersons in the cloakroom. Let the record show they acknowledged the \nSenator's request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I come to the floor to discuss the budget \npoint of order that has been raised against the financial reform \nconference report. I will be voting to waive this point of order. As \nBudget Committee chairman, I do not take this step lightly. In fact, \nthe point of order that has been offered is a point of order that I \ncreated in the 2008 budget, so it is something I feel strongly about as \na general matter. But its applicability here is false in the face of \nthe importance of the legislation we need to consider.\n  The legislation before us is critical to our economic strength. I \nthink we all understand that financial reform is long overdue. It has \nbeen almost 2 years since the financial sector collapse brought our \neconomy to the brink of global financial collapse. I was in the room \nand Senator Dodd was in the room when we were informed by the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of the Treasury in the \nprevious administration that if we failed to act at that dire moment, \nwe could face a global financial collapse. That is how serious it was.\n  Now that the economy has stabilized, it is easy to forget the crisis \nthat swept through the financial markets and threw us into the worst \ndownturn since the Great Depression--in fact, which risked a second \ngreat depression. But we cannot afford to forget. We need to remember \nthat the problems on Wall\n\n[[Page S5893]]\n\nStreet and in our financial sector have a direct impact on Main Street \nand the lives of every American. We need to ensure that taxpayers are \nnever again asked to bail out Wall Street.\n  This financial reform legislation will prevent another financial \nsector collapse, or at least will help prevent it. I do not think any \nof us can say this will prevent any future collapse, but it is \ncritically important to helping us prevent another collapse. It will \nallow the government to shut down firms that threaten to crater our \neconomy and ensure that the financial industry, not taxpayers, is on \nthe hook for any costs. It will rein in risky derivatives and other \nrisky trading practices that undermined some of our largest financial \ninstitutions. It will help level the playing field for smaller banks \nand credit unions by cracking down on the risky practices of Wall \nStreet and nonbank financial institutions that caused the financial \ncrisis.\n  I am grateful to Senator Dodd, the Banking Committee, and members of \nthe conference for working with me to make certain that the final bill \nrecognizes the special circumstances of community banks and credit \nunions in rural States such as mine. In particular, I appreciate the \ncommittee's modification to the lending limit standards. This is very \nimportant to farming communities across the country.\n  The final bill also provides added flexibility for rural lenders in \nthe new mortgage standards as well as provisions to improve interchange \nreform for smaller financial institutions. Finally, I am pleased the \ncommittee included a risk-focused deposit insurance fund assessment \nformula and modified risk retention requirements for high quality \nloans.\n  Especially I thank Senator Dodd for his extraordinary leadership. \nWhat a final year in the Senate. What a remarkable legacy he is \nleaving. I think the annals of the Senate will show very few Senators \nhave had a record of accomplishment that matches what Senator Dodd will \nhave done in this year.\n  With respect to the budget point of order that has been raised \nagainst the conference report, let me make a couple of general points. \nFirst, this budget violation is not significant enough to merit \nderailing this important legislation. Second, we must bear in mind the \nrisks of failing to act. If we fail to protect against a future \ncollapse and create an orderly process for dealing with giant insolvent \nfinancial institutions, it is inevitable that taxpayers will again at \nsome future point be asked to bail out the financial sector and prevent \na catastrophic financial collapse. If one measures on any scale the \ndifferences between the technical violation in this budget point of \norder against what would happen if this legislation fails, they cannot \neven be compared. I mean, it is a gnat against an elephant. So let's \nkeep things in mind here.\n\n  Second, we must bear in mind the risk of failing to act because that \nwould burden taxpayers in a way far beyond anything we see with this \nbudget point of order. None of us wants that. This bill is an insurance \npolicy against an expensive future taxpayer bailout.\n  The point of order that has been raised is the long-term deficit \npoint of order, a point of order I established in the budget resolution \nof 2008. This point of order prohibits legislation that worsens the \ndeficit by more than $5 billion in any of the four 10-year periods \nfollowing 2019.\n  CBO has determined that at least in one of those four 10-year \nperiods, the conference report would exceed this threshold. But this is \nreally just a timing issue caused by the new bipartisan resolution \nauthority created by the bill. This is the new authority given to the \ngovernment to wind down failing financial firms. Under the resolution \nauthority, if a financial firm is about to collapse, the government \nwill use the firm's assets to wind it down and put it out of business. \nIf the firm's assets are insufficient, the government will temporarily \nborrow funds from the Treasury. The financial industry will then \nreimburse the government and the taxpayers for 100 percent of the cost. \nAgain, 100 percent of the money will be paid back by the banks. So the \nnet impact on the deficit is zero.\n  Overall, the bill saves $3.2 billion over the first 10 years, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office. So while technically this \nbudget point of order lies, if you pierce the veil and look at what \nreally happens, this bill reduces the deficit, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, which is the nonpartisan scorekeeper here \nin the Senate. Because there is a lag time for the government to \ncollect this money from the financial industry, CBO scores the bill as \nincreasing the deficit in some of the later decades. But all of that \nmoney will be paid back in ensuing years, and that is what matters most \nin this case.\n  So although this bill does technically violate the long-term deficit \npoint of order, it is insignificant. The fact is, this bill reduces the \ndeficit, according to the Congressional Budget Office. So I urge my \ncolleagues to waive the point of order, to support passage of this \nfinancial reform legislation, which is clearly a significant step in \nthe right direction in preventing the kind of risk to our Nation's \neconomy that is so apparent with the current structure.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his extraordinary work not only on \nthis bill but throughout the year and, I think all of us know, \nthroughout his career.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, before my friend, the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, leaves, let me thank him immensely for his analysis of this \nissue. He has it, as we saw as well, exactly right. In fact, it is not \nonly repaying 100 percent but with interest. There is an interest \nrequirement, that if we borrow from the taxpayers in order to wind down \nsubstantially risky firms, then not only do you get paid back, but the \ninterest on the cost of that money is also part of the deal. So it is \n100 percent-plus coming back to the Treasury.\n  But his analysis and that of his committee--and there is no one who \nhas been more disciplined or guarded about the budgetary process over \nthe years we have served together, and so I appreciate the Senator's \nanalysis of this particular point on the long-term deficit.\n  I commend the Senator for including the provisions he has and trying \nto build some discipline into the process of how we expend taxpayer \nmoneys, collect taxes in the first place to pay for the needed \nexpenditures of our government. So I thank the Senator for that.\n  I thank him for his comments as well about the bill and his support \nand also the substantive contributions the Senator from North Dakota \nhas made, because one of the things we tried to be very careful about--\nJon Tester of Montana, who sits on the committee with me, has been very \ncareful and been tremendously active in seeing to it that rural America \nis going to be well served by this legislation. And there are \ndifferences. It is not all Wall Street, New York, and major financial \ncenters. The importance of the availability of credit in rural \ncommunities is critical, as my colleague from North Dakota has informed \nme over the years we have served together. That ability of a local \nfarmer to borrow that money in the spring, to be able to pay back in \nthe fall, at harvest time, has been essential, and knowing how \ndifficult it has been throughout the country to have access to credit \nis essential.\n  So his contributions to the legislation make sure that what we do \nhere is going to enhance the capability of rural America to not only \ncome out of this crisis we are in but to prosper in the years ahead \nwith this legislation. So beyond the budgetary considerations and the \npoints of order before us, I thank him for his contributions to the \nsubstance of the bill, which has made it a far better bill to begin \nwith.\n  I see my colleague from Oregon is here. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank Chairman Dodd for yielding to me \nand for his leadership on financial reform.\n  I yield to Senator Levin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator Merkley and I, as the principal \nauthors of sections 619, 620, and 621 of the Dodd-Frank Act, thought it \nmight be helpful to explain in some detail those sections, which are \nbased on our bill, S. 3098, called the Protect Our Recovery\n\n[[Page S5894]]\n\nThrough Oversight of Proprietary, PROP, Trading Act of 2010, and the \nsubsequently filed Merkley-Levin Amendment, No. 4101, to the Dodd-\nLincoln substitute, which was the basis of the provision adopted by the \nConference Committee.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague, Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank Senator Levin and will be setting forth here our \njoint explanation of the Merkley-Levin provisions of the Dodd-Frank \nAct. Sections 619, 620 and 621 do three things: prohibit high-risk \nproprietary trading at banks, limit the systemic risk of such \nactivities at systemically significant nonbank financial companies, and \nprohibit material conflicts of interest in asset-backed \nsecuritizations.\n  Sections 619 and 620 amend the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 to \nbroadly prohibit proprietary trading, while nevertheless permitting \ncertain activities that may technically fall within the definition of \nproprietary trading but which are, in fact, safer, client-oriented \nfinancial services. To account for the additional risk of proprietary \ntrading among systemically critical financial firms that are not banks, \nbank holding companies, or the like, the sections require nonbank \nfinancial companies supervised by the Federal Reserve Board, the \n``Board'', to keep additional capital for their proprietary trading \nactivities and subject them to quantitative limits on those activities. \nIn addition, given the unique control that firms who package and sell \nasset-backed securities (including synthetic asset-backed securities) \nhave over transactions involving those securities, section 621 protects \npurchasers by prohibiting those firms from engaging in transactions \nthat involve or result in material conflicts of interest.\n  First, it is important to remind our colleagues how the financial \ncrisis of the past several years came to pass. Beginning in the 1980's, \nnew financial products and significant amounts of deregulation \nundermined the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of commercial banking \nfrom securities brokerage or ``investment banking'' that had kept our \nbanking system relatively safe since 1933.\n  Over time, commercial and investment banks increasingly relied on \nprecarious short term funding sources, while at the same time \nsignificantly increasing their leverage. It was as if our banks and \nsecurities firms, in competing against one another, were race car \ndrivers taking the curves ever more tightly and at ever faster speeds. \nMeanwhile, to match their short-term funding sources, commercial and \ninvestment banks drove into increasingly risky, short-term, and \nsometimes theoretically hedged, proprietary trading. When markets took \nunexpected turns, such as when Russia defaulted on its debt and when \nthe U.S. mortgage-backed securities market collapsed, liquidity \nevaporated, and financial firms became insolvent very rapidly. No \namount of capital could provide a sufficient buffer in such situations.\n  In the face of the worst financial crisis in 60 years, the January \n2009 report by the Group of 30, an international group of financial \nexperts, placed blame squarely on proprietary trading. This report, \nlargely authored by former Federal Reserve System Chairman Paul \nVolcker, recommended prohibiting systemically critical banking \ninstitutions from trading in securities and other products for their \nown accounts. In January 2010, President Barack Obama gave his full \nsupport to common-sense restrictions on proprietary trading and fund \ninvesting, which he coined the ``Volcker Rule.''\n  The ``Volcker Rule,'' which Senator Levin and I drafted and have \nchampioned in the Senate, and which is embodied in section 619, \nembraces the spirit of the Glass-Steagall Act's separation of \n``commercial'' from ``investment'' banking by restoring a protective \nbarrier around our critical financial infrastructure. It covers not \nsimply securities, but also derivatives and other financial products. \nIt applies not only to banks, but also to nonbank financial firms whose \nsize and function render them systemically significant.\n  While the intent of section 619 is to restore the purpose of the \nGlass-Steagall barrier between commercial and investment banks, we also \nupdate that barrier to reflect the modern financial world and permit a \nbroad array of low-risk, client-oriented financial services. As a \nresult, the barrier constructed in section 619 will not restrict most \nfinancial firms.\n  Section 619 is intended to limit proprietary trading by banking \nentities and systemically significant nonbank financial companies. \nProperly implemented, section 619's limits will tamp down on the risk \nto the system arising from firms competing to obtain greater and \ngreater returns by increasing the size, leverage, and riskiness of \ntheir trades. This is a critical part of ending too big to fail \nfinancial firms. In addition, section 619 seeks to reorient the U.S. \nbanking system away from leveraged, short-term speculation and instead \ntowards the safe and sound provision of long-term credit to families \nand business enterprises.\n\n  We recognize that regulators are essential partners in the \nlegislative process. Because regulatory interpretation is so critical \nto the success of the rule, we will now set forth, as the principal \nauthors of Sections 619 to 621, our explanations of how these \nprovisions work.\n  Section 619's prohibitions and restrictions on proprietary trading \nare set forth in a new section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act of \n1956, and subsection (a), paragraph (1) establishes the basic principle \nclearly: a banking entity shall not ``engage in proprietary trading'' \nor ``acquire or retain . . . ownership interest[s] in or sponsor a \nhedge fund or private equity fund'', unless otherwise provided in the \nsection. Paragraph (2) establishes the principle for nonbank financial \ncompanies supervised by the Board by subjecting their proprietary \ntrading activities to quantitative restrictions and additional capital \ncharges. Such quantitative limits and capital charges are to be set by \nthe regulators to address risks similar to those which lead to the flat \nprohibition for banking entities.\n  Subsection (h), paragraph (1) defines ``banking entity'' to be any \ninsured depository institution (as otherwise defined under the Bank \nHolding Company Act), any entity that controls an insured depository \ninstitution, any entity that is treated as a bank holding company under \nsection 8 of the International Banking Act of 1978, and any affiliates \nor subsidiaries of such entities. We and the Congress specifically \nrejected proposals to exclude the affiliates and subsidiaries of bank \nholding companies and insured depository institutions, because it was \nobvious that restricting a bank, but not its affiliates and \nsubsidiaries, would ultimately be ineffective in restraining the type \nof high-risk proprietary trading that can undermine an insured \ndepository institution.\n  The provision recognizes the modern reality that it is difficult to \nseparate the fate of a bank and its bank holding company, and that for \nthe bank holding company to be a source of strength to the bank, its \nactivities, and those of its other subsidiaries and affiliates, cannot \nbe at such great risk as to imperil the bank. We also note that not all \nbanks pose the same risks. Accordingly, the paragraph provides a narrow \nexception for insured depository institutions that function principally \nfor trust purposes and do not hold public depositor money, make loans, \nor access Federal Reserve lending or payment services. These \nspecialized entities that offer very limited trust services are \nelsewhere carved out of the definition of ``bank,'' so we do not treat \nthem as banks for the purposes of the restriction on proprietary \ntrading. However, such institutions are covered by the restriction if \nthey qualify under the provisions covering systemically important \nnonbank financial companies.\n  Subsection (h), paragraph (3) defines nonbank financial companies \nsupervised by the Board to be those financial companies whose size, \ninterconnectedness, or core functions are of sufficiently systemic \nsignificance as to warrant additional supervision, as directed by the \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council pursuant to Title I of the Dodd-\nFrank Act. Given the varied nature of such nonbank financial companies, \nfor some of which proprietary trading is effectively their business, an \noutright statutory prohibition on such trading was not warranted. \nInstead, the risks posed by their proprietary trading is addressed \nthrough robust capital charges and quantitative limits that increase \nwith the size, interconnectedness, and systemic importance of the\n\n[[Page S5895]]\n\nbusiness functions of the nonbank financial firm. These restrictions \nshould become stricter as size, leverage, and other factors increase. \nAs with banking entities, these restrictions should also help reduce \nthe size and risk of these financial firms.\n  Naturally, the definition of ``proprietary trading'' is critical to \nthe provision. For the purposes of section 13, proprietary trading \nmeans ``engaging as a principal for the trading account'' in \ntransactions to ``purchase or sell, or otherwise acquire or dispose \nof'' a wide range of traded financial products, including securities, \nderivatives, futures, and options. There are essentially three key \nelements to the definition: (1) the firm must be acting ``as a \nprincipal,'' (2) the trading must be in its ``trading account'' or \nanother similar account, and (3) the restrictions apply to the full \nrange of its financial instruments.\n  Purchasing or selling ``as a principal'' refers to when the firm \npurchases or sells the relevant financial instrument for its own \naccount. The prohibition on proprietary trading does not cover trading \nengaged with exclusively client funds.\n  The term ``trading account'' is intended to cover an account used by \na firm to make profits from relatively short-term trading positions, as \nopposed to long-term, multi-year investments. The administration's \nproposed Volcker Rule focused on short-term trading, using the phrase \n``trading book'' to capture that concept. That phrase, which is \ncurrently used by some bank regulators was rejected, however, and \nthe ultimate conference report language uses the term ``trading \naccount'' rather than ``trading book'' to ensure that all types of \naccounts used for proprietary trading are covered by the section.\n\n  To ensure broad coverage of the prohibition on proprietary trading, \nparagraph (3) of subsection (h) defines ``trading account'' as any \naccount used ``principally for the purpose of selling in the near term \n(or otherwise with the intent to resell in order to profit from short-\nterm price movements)'' and such other accounts as the regulators \ndetermine are properly covered by the provision to fulfill the purposes \nof the section. In designing this definition, we were aware of bank \nregulatory capital rules that distinguish between short-term trading \nand long-term investments, and our overall focus was to restrict high-\nrisk proprietary trading. For banking entity subsidiaries that do not \nmaintain a distinction between a trading account and an investment \naccount, all accounts should be presumed to be trading accounts and \ncovered by the restriction.\n  Linking the prohibition on proprietary trading to trading accounts \npermits banking entities to hold debt securities and other financial \ninstruments in long-term investment portfolios. Such investments should \nbe maintained with the appropriate capital charges and held for longer \nperiods.\n  The definition of proprietary trading in paragraph (4) covers a wide \nrange of financial instruments, including securities, commodities, \nfutures, options, derivatives, and any similar financial instruments. \nPursuant to the rule of construction in subsection (g), paragraph (2), \nthe definition should not generally include loans sold in the process \nof securitizing; however, it could include such loans if such loans \nbecome financial instruments traded to capture the change in their \nmarket value.\n  Limiting the definition of proprietary trading to near-term holdings \nhas the advantage of permitting banking entities to continue to deploy \ncredit via long-term capital market debt instruments. However, it has \nthe disadvantage of failing to prevent the problems created by longer-\nterm holdings in riskier financial instruments, for example, highly \ncomplex collateralized debt obligations and other opaque instruments \nthat are not readily marketable. To address the risks to the banking \nsystem arising from those longer-term instruments and related trading, \nsection 620 directs Federal banking regulators to sift through the \nassets, trading strategies, and other investments of banking entities \nto identify assets or activities that pose unacceptable risks to banks, \neven when held in longer-term accounts. Regulators are expected to \napply the lessons of that analysis to tighten the range of investments \nand activities permissible for banking entities, whether they are at \nthe insured depository institution or at an affiliate or subsidiary, \nand whether they are short or long term in nature.\n  The new Bank Holding Company Act section 13 also restricts investing \nin or sponsoring hedge funds and private equity funds. Clearly, if a \nfinancial firm were able to structure its proprietary positions simply \nas an investment in a hedge fund or private equity fund, the \nprohibition on proprietary trading would be easily avoided, and the \nrisks to the firm and its subsidiaries and affiliates would continue. A \nfinancial institution that sponsors or manages a hedge fund or private \nequity fund also incurs significant risk even when it does not invest \nin the fund it manages or sponsors. Although piercing the corporate \nveil between a fund and its sponsoring entity may be difficult, recent \nhistory demonstrates that a financial firm will often feel compelled by \nreputational demands and relationship preservation concerns to bail out \nclients in a failed fund that it managed or sponsored, rather than risk \nlitigation or lost business. Knowledge of such concerns creates a moral \nhazard among clients, attracting investment into managed or sponsored \nfunds on the assumption that the sponsoring bank or systemically \nsignificant firm will rescue them if markets turn south, as was done by \na number of firms during the 2008 crisis. That is why setting limits on \ninvolvement in hedge funds and private equity funds is critical to \nprotecting against risks arising from asset management services.\n  Subsection (h), paragraph (2) sets forth a broad definition of hedge \nfund and private equity fund, not distinguishing between the two. The \ndefinition includes any company that would be an investment company \nunder the Investment Company Act of 1940, but is excluded from such \ncoverage by the provisions of sections 3(c)(1) or 3(c)(7). Although \nmarket practice in many cases distinguishes between hedge funds, which \ntend to be trading vehicles, and private equity funds, which tend to \nown entire companies, both types of funds can engage in high risk \nactivities and it is exceedingly difficult to limit those risks by \nfocusing on only one type of entity.\n  Despite the broad prohibition on proprietary trading set forth in \nsubsection (a), the legislation recognizes that there are a number of \nlow-risk proprietary activities that do not pose unreasonable risks and \nexplicitly permits those activities to occur. Those low-risk \nproprietary trading activities are identified in subsection (d), \nparagraph (1), subject to certain limitations set forth in paragraph \n(2), and additional capital charges required in paragraph (3).\n  While paragraph (1) authorizes several permitted activities, it \nsimultaneously grants regulators broad authority to set further \nrestrictions on any of those activities and to supplement the \nadditional capital charges provided for by paragraph (3).\n  Subparagraph (d)(1)(A) authorizes the purchase or sale of government \nobligations, including government-sponsored enterprise, GSE, \nobligations, on the grounds that such products are used as low-risk, \nshort-term liquidity positions and as low-risk collateral in a wide \nrange of transactions, and so are appropriately retained in a trading \naccount. Allowing trading in a broad range of GSE obligations is also \nmeant to recognize a market reality that removing the use of these \nsecurities as liquidity and collateral positions would have significant \nmarket implications, including negative implications for the housing \nand farm credit markets. By authorizing trading in GSE obligations, the \nlanguage is not meant to imply a view as to GSE operations or structure \nover the long-term, and permits regulators to add restrictions on this \npermitted activity as necessary to prevent high-risk proprietary \ntrading activities under paragraph (2). When GSE reform occurs, we \nexpect these provisions to be adjusted accordingly. Moreover, as is the \ncase with all permitted activities under paragraph (1), regulators are \nexpected to apply additional capital restrictions under paragraph (3) \nas necessary to account for the risks of the trading activities.\n  Subparagraph (d)(1)(B) permits underwriting and market-making-related\n\n[[Page S5896]]\n\ntransactions that are technically trading for the account of the firm \nbut, in fact, facilitate the provision of near-term client-oriented \nfinancial services. Market-making is a customer service whereby a firm \nassists its customers by providing two-sided markets for speedy \nacquisition or disposition of certain financial instruments. Done \nproperly, it is not a speculative enterprise, and revenues for the firm \nshould largely arise from the provision of credit provided, and not \nfrom the capital gain earned on the change in the price of instruments \nheld in the firm's accounts. Academic literature sets out the \ndistinctions between making markets for customers and holding \nspeculative positions in assets, but in general, the two types of \ntrading are distinguishable by the volume of trading, the size of the \npositions, the length of time that positions remains open, and the \nvolatility of profits and losses, among other factors. Regulations \nimplementing this permitted activity should focus on these types of \nfactors to assist regulators in distinguishing between financial firms \nassisting their clients versus those engaged in proprietary trading. \nVigorous and robust regulatory oversight of this issue will be \nessential to the prevent ``market-making'' from being used as a \nloophole in the ban on proprietary trading.\n  The administration's draft language, the original section 619 \ncontemplated by the Senate Banking Committee, and amendment 4101 each \nincluded the term ``in facilitation of customer relations'' as a \npermitted activity. The term was removed in the final version of the \nDodd-Frank Act out of concern that this phrase was too subjective, \nambiguous, and susceptible to abuse. At the same time, we recognize \nthat the term was previously included to permit certain legitimate \nclient-oriented services, such pre-market-making accumulation of small \npositions that might not rise to the level of fully ``market-making'' \nin a security or financial instrument, but are intended to nonetheless \nmeet expected near-term client liquidity needs. Accordingly, while \nprevious versions of the legislation referenced ``market-making'', the \nfinal version references ``market-making-related'' to provide the \nregulators with limited additional flexibility to incorporate those \ntypes of transactions to meet client needs, without unduly warping the \ncommon understanding of market-making.\n  We note, however, that ``market-making-related'' is not a term whose \ndefinition is without limits. It does not implicitly cover every time a \nfirm buys an existing financial instrument with the intent to later \nsell it, nor does it cover situations in which a firm creates or \nunderwrites a new security with the intent to market it to a client. \nTestimony by Goldman Sachs Chairman Lloyd Blankfein and other Goldman \nexecutives during a hearing before the Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations seemed to suggest that any time the firm created a new \nmortgage related security and began soliciting clients to buy it, the \nfirm was ``making a market'' for the security. But one-sided marketing \nor selling securities is not equivalent to providing a two-sided market \nfor clients buying and selling existing securities. The reality was \nthat Goldman Sachs was creating new securities for sale to clients and \nbuilding large speculative positions in high-risk instruments, \nincluding credit default swaps. Such speculative activities are the \nessence of proprietary trading and cannot be properly considered within \nthe coverage of the terms ``market-making'' or ``market-making-\nrelated.''\n  The subparagraph also specifically limits such underwriting and \nmarket-making-related activities to ``reasonably expected near term \ndemands of clients, customers, and counterparties.'' Essentially, the \nsubparagraph creates two restrictions, one on the expected holding \nperiod and one on the intent of the holding. These two restrictions \ngreatly limit the types of risks and returns for market-makers. \nGenerally, the revenues for market-making by the covered firms should \nbe made from the fees charged for providing a ready, two-sided market \nfor financial instruments, and not from the changes in prices acquired \nand sold by the financial institution. The ``near term'' requirement \nconnects to the provision in the definition of trading account whereby \nthe account is defined as trading assets that are acquired \n``principally for the purpose of selling in the near term.'' The intent \nis to focus firms on genuinely making markets for clients, and not \ntaking speculative positions with the firm's capital. Put simply, a \nfirm will not satisfy this requirement by acquiring a position on the \nhope that the position will be able to be sold at some unknown future \ndate for a trading profit.\n\n  Subparagraph (d)(1)(C) permits a banking entity to engage in ``risk-\nmitigating hedging activities in connection with and related to \nindividual or aggregated positions, contracts, or other holdings of the \nbanking entity that are designed to reduce the specific risks to the \nbanking entity in connection with and related to such positions, \ncontracts, or other holdings.'' This activity is permitted because its \nsole purpose is to lower risk.\n  While this subparagraph is intended to permit banking entities to \nutilize their trading accounts to hedge, the phrase ``in connection \nwith and related to individual or aggregated positions . . .'' was \nadded between amendment 4101 and the final version in the conference \nreport in order to ensure that the hedge applied to specific, \nidentifiable assets, whether it be on an individual or aggregate basis. \nMoreover, hedges must be to reduce ``specific risks'' to the banking \nentity arising from these positions. This formulation is meant to focus \nbanking entities on traditional hedges and prevent proprietary \nspeculation under the guise of general ``hedging.'' For example, for a \nbank with a significant set of loans to a foreign country, a foreign \nexchange swap may be an appropriate hedging strategy. On the other \nhand, purchasing commodity futures to ``hedge'' inflation risks that \nmay generally impact the banking entity may be nothing more than \nproprietary trading under another name. Distinguishing between true \nhedges and covert proprietary trades may be one of the more challenging \nareas for regulators, and will require clear identification by \nfinancial firms of the specific assets and risks being hedged, research \nand analysis of market best practices, and reasonable regulatory \njudgment calls. Vigorous and robust regulatory oversight of this issue \nwill be essential to the prevent ``hedging'' from being used as a \nloophole in the ban on proprietary trading.\n  Subparagraph (d)(1)(D) permits the acquisition of the securities and \nother affected financial instruments ``on behalf of customers.'' This \npermitted activity is intended to allow financial firms to use firm \nfunds to purchase assets on behalf of their clients, rather than on \nbehalf of themselves. This subparagraph is intended, in particular, to \nprovide reassurance that trading in ``street name'' for customers or in \ntrust for customers is permitted.\n  In general, subparagraph (d)(1)(E) provides exceptions to the \nprohibition on investing in hedge funds or private equity funds, if \nsuch investments advance a ``public welfare'' purpose. It permits \ninvestments in small business investment companies, which are a form of \nregulated venture capital fund in which banks have a long history of \nsuccessful participation. The subparagraph also permits investments \n``of the type'' permitted under the paragraph of the National Bank Act \nenabling banks to invest in a range of low-income community development \nand other projects. The subparagraph also specifically mentions tax \ncredits for historical building rehabilitation administered by the \nNational Park Service, but is flexible enough to permit the regulators \nto include other similar low-risk investments with a public welfare \npurpose.\n  Subparagraph (d)(1)(F) is meant to accommodate the normal business of \ninsurance at regulated insurance companies that are affiliated with \nbanks. The Volcker Rule was never meant to affect the ordinary business \nof insurance: the collection and investment of premiums, which are then \nused to satisfy claims of the insured. These activities, while \ndefinitionally proprietary trading, are heavily regulated by State \ninsurance regulators, and in most cases do not pose the same level of \nrisk as other proprietary trading.\n  However, to prevent abuse, firms seeking to rely on this insurance-\nrelated exception must meet two essential qualifications. First, only \ntrading for the general account of the insurance firm would qualify. \nSecond, the\n\n[[Page S5897]]\n\ntrading must be subject to adequate State-level insurance regulation. \nTrading by insurance companies or their affiliates that is not subject \nto insurance company investment regulations will not qualify for \nprotection here.\n  Further, where State laws and regulations do not exist or otherwise \nfail to appropriately connect the insurance company investments to the \nactual business of insurance or are found to inadequately protect the \nfirm, the subparagraph's conditions will not be met.\n  Subparagraph (d)(1)(G) permits firms to organize and offer hedge \nfunds or private equity funds as an asset management service to \nclients. It is important to remember that nothing in section 619 \notherwise prohibits a bank from serving as an investment adviser to an \nindependent hedge fund or private equity fund. Yet, to serve in that \ncapacity, a number of criteria must be met.\n  First, the firm must be doing so pursuant to its provision of bona \nfide trust, fiduciary, or investment advisory services to customers. \nGiven the fiduciary obligations that come with such services, these \nrequirements ensure that banking entities are properly engaged in \nresponsible forms of asset management, which should tamp down on the \nrisks taken by the relevant fund.\n  Second, subparagraph (d)(1)(G) provides strong protections against a \nfirm bailing out its funds. Clause (iv) prohibits banking entities, as \nprovided under paragraph (1) and (2) of subsection (f), from entering \ninto lending or similar transactions with related funds, and clause (v) \nprohibits banking entities from ``directly or indirectly, \nguarantee[ing], assum[ing], or otherwise insur[ing] the obligations or \nperformance of the hedge fund or private equity fund.'' To prevent \nbanking entities from engaging in backdoor bailouts of their invested \nfunds, clause (v) extends to the hedge funds and private equity funds \nin which such subparagraph (G) hedge funds and private equity funds \ninvest.\n  Third, to prevent a banking entity from having an incentive to \nbailout its funds and also to limit conflicts of interest, clause (vii) \nof subparagraph (G) restricts directors and employees of a banking \nentity from being invested in hedge funds and private equity funds \norganized and offered by the banking entity, except for directors or \nemployees ``directly engaged'' in offering investment advisory or other \nservices to the hedge fund or private equity fund. Fund managers can \nhave ``skin in the game'' for the hedge fund or private equity fund \nthey run, but to prevent the bank from running its general employee \ncompensation through the hedge fund or private equity fund, other \nmanagement and employees may not.\n  Fourth, by stating that a firm may not organize and offer a hedge \nfund or private equity fund with the firm's name on it, clause (vi) of \nsubparagraph (G) further restores market discipline and supports the \nrestriction on firms bailing out funds on the grounds of reputational \nrisk. Similarly, clause (viii) ensures that investors recognize that \nthe funds are subject to market discipline by requiring that funds \nprovide prominent disclosure that any losses of a hedge fund or private \nequity fund are borne by investors and not by the firm, and the firm \nmust also comply with any other restrictions to ensure that investors \ndo not rely on the firm, including any of its affiliates or \nsubsidiaries, for a bailout.\n  Fifth, the firm or its affiliates cannot make or maintain an \ninvestment interest in the fund, except in compliance with the limited \nfund seeding and alignment of interest provisions provided in paragraph \n(4) of subsection (d). This paragraph allows a firm, for the limited \npurpose of maintaining an investment management business, to seed a new \nfund or make and maintain a ``de minimis'' co-investment in a hedge \nfund or private equity fund to align the interests of the fund managers \nand the clients, subject to several conditions. As a general rule, \nfirms taking advantage of this provision should maintain only small \nseed funds, likely to be $5 to $10 million or less. Large funds or \nfunds that are not effectively marketed to investors would be evasions \nof the restrictions of this section. Similarly, co-investments designed \nto align the firm with its clients must not be excessive, and should \nnot allow for firms to evade the intent of the restrictions of this \nsection.\n  These ``de minimis'' investments are to be greatly disfavored, and \nsubject to several significant restrictions. First, a firm may only \nhave, in the aggregate, an immaterial amount of capital in such funds, \nbut in no circumstance may such positions aggregate to more than 3 \npercent of the firm's Tier 1 capital. Second, by one year after the \ndate of establishment for any fund, the firm must have not more than a \n3 percent ownership interest. Third, investments in hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds shall be deducted on, at a minimum, a one-to-one \nbasis from capital. As the leverage of a fund increases, the capital \ncharges shall be increased to reflect the greater risk of loss. This is \nspecifically intended to discourage these high-risk investments, and \nshould be used to limit these investments to the size only necessary to \nfacilitate asset management businesses for clients.\n  Subparagraphs (H) and (I) recognize rules of international regulatory \ncomity by permitting foreign banks, regulated and backed by foreign \ntaxpayers, in the course of operating outside of the United States to \nengage in activities permitted under relevant foreign law. However, \nthese subparagraphs are not intended to permit a U.S. banking entity to \navoid the restrictions on proprietary trading simply by setting up an \noffshore subsidiary or reincorporating offshore, and regulators should \nenforce them accordingly. In addition, the subparagraphs seek to \nmaintain a level playing field by prohibiting a foreign bank from \nimproperly offering its hedge fund and private equity fund services to \nU.S. persons when such offering could not be made in the United States.\n  Subparagraph (J) permits the regulators to add additional exceptions \nas necessary to ``promote and protect the safety and soundness of the \nbanking entity and the financial stability of the United States.'' This \ngeneral exception power is intended to ensure that some unforeseen, \nlow-risk activity is not inadvertently swept in by the prohibition on \nproprietary trading. However, the subparagraph sets an extremely high \nbar: the activity must be necessary to promote and protect the safety \nand soundness of the banking entity and the financial stability of the \nUnited States, and not simply pose a competitive disadvantage or a \nthreat to firms' profitability.\n\n  Paragraph (2) of section (d) adds explicit statutory limits to the \npermitted activities under paragraph (1). Specifically, it prevents an \nactivity from qualifying as a permitted activity if it would ``involve \nor result in a material conflict of interest,'' ``result directly or \nindirectly in a material exposure . . . to high-risk assets or high-\nrisk trading strategies'' or otherwise pose a threat to the safety and \nsoundness of the firm or the financial stability of the United States. \nRegulators are directed to define the key terms in the paragraph and \nimplement the restrictions as part of the rulemaking process. \nRegulators should pay particular attention to the hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds organized and offered under subparagraph (G) to \nensure that such activities have sufficient distance from other parts \nof the firm, especially those with windows into the trading flow of \nother clients. Hedging activities should also be particularly \nscrutinized to ensure that information about client trading is not \nimproperly utilized.\n  The limitation on proprietary trading activities that ``involve or \nresult in a material conflict of interest'' is a companion to the \nconflicts of interest prohibition in section 621, but applies to all \ntypes of activities rather than just asset-backed securitizations.\n  With respect to the definition of high-risk assets and high-risk \ntrading strategies, regulators should pay close attention to the \ncharacteristics of assets and trading strategies that have contributed \nto substantial financial loss, bank failures, bankruptcies, or the \ncollapse of financial firms or financial markets in the past, including \nbut not limited to the crisis of 2008 and the financial crisis of 1998. \nIn assessing high-risk assets and high-risk trading strategies, \nparticular attention should be paid to the transparency of the markets, \nthe availability of consistent pricing information, the depth of the \nmarkets, and the risk characteristics\n\n[[Page S5898]]\n\nof the assets and strategies themselves, including any embedded \nleverage. Further, these characteristics should be evaluated in times \nof extreme market stress, such as those experienced recently. With \nrespect to trading strategies, attention should be paid to the role \nthat certain types of trading strategies play in times of relative \nmarket calm, as well as times of extreme market stress. While \ninvestment advisors may freely deploy high-risk strategies for their \nclients, attention should be paid to ensure that firms do not utilize \nthem for their own proprietary activities. Barring high risk strategies \nmay be particularly critical when policing market-making-related and \nhedging activities, as well as trading otherwise permitted under \nsubparagraph (d)(1)(A). In this context, however, it is irrelevant \nwhether or not a firm provides market liquidity: high-risk assets and \nhigh-risk trading strategies are never permitted.\n  Subsection (d), paragraph (3) directs the regulators to set \nappropriate additional capital charges and quantitative limits for \npermitted activities. These restrictions apply to both banking entities \nand nonbank financial companies supervised by the Board. It is left to \nregulators to determine if those restrictions should apply equally to \nboth, or whether there may appropriately be a distinction between \nbanking entities and non-bank financial companies supervised by the \nBoard. The paragraph also mandates diversification requirements where \nappropriate, for example, to ensure that banking entities do not deploy \ntheir entire permitted amount of de minimis investments into a small \nnumber of hedge funds or private equity funds, or that they dangerously \nover-concentrate in specific products or types of financial products.\n  Subsection (e) provides vigorous anti-evasion authority, including \nrecord-keeping requirements. This authority is designed to allow \nregulators to appropriately assess the trading of firms, and \naggressively enforce the text and intent of section 619.\n  The restrictions on proprietary trading and relationships with \nprivate funds seek to break the internal connection between a bank's \nbalance sheet and taking risk in the markets, with a view towards \nreestablishing market discipline and refocusing the bank on its credit \nextension function and client services. In the recent financial crisis, \nwhen funds advised by banks suffered significant losses, those off-\nbalance sheet funds came back onto the banks' balance sheets. At times, \nthe banks bailed out the funds because the investors in the funds had \nother important business with the banks. In some cases, the investors \nwere also key personnel at the banks. Regardless of the motivations, in \nfar too many cases, the banks that bailed out their funds ultimately \nrelied on taxpayers to bail them out. It is precisely for this reason \nthat the permitted activities under subparagraph (d)(1)(G) are so \nnarrowly defined.\n  Indeed, a large part of protecting firms from bailing out their \naffiliated funds is by limiting the lending, asset purchases and sales, \nderivatives trading, and other relationships that a banking entity or \nnonbank financial company supervised by the Board may maintain with the \nhedge funds and private equity funds it advises. The relationships that \na banking entity maintains with and services it furnishes to its \nadvised funds can provide reasons why and the means through which a \nfirm will bail out an advised fund, be it through a direct loan, an \nasset acquisition, or through writing a derivative. Further, providing \nadvisory services to a hedge fund or private equity fund creates a \nconflict of interest and risk because when a banking entity is itself \ndetermining the investment strategy of a fund, it no longer can make a \nfully independent credit evaluation of the hedge fund or private equity \nfund borrower. These bailout protections will significantly benefit \nindependent hedge funds and private equity funds, and also improve U.S. \nfinancial stability.\n  Accordingly, subsection (f), paragraph (1) sets forth the broad \nprohibition on a banking entity entering into any ``covered \ntransactions'' as such term is defined in the Federal Reserve Act's \nsection 23A, as if such banking entity were a member bank and the fund \nwere an affiliate thereof. ``Covered transactions'' under section 23A \nincludes loans, asset purchases, and, following the Dodd-Frank bill \nadoption, derivatives between the member bank and the affiliate. In \ngeneral, section 23A sets limits on the extension of credit between \nsuch entities, but paragraph (1) of subsection (f) prohibits all such \ntransactions. It also prohibits transactions with funds that are \ncontrolled by the advised or sponsored fund. In short, if a banking \nentity organizes and offers a hedge fund or private equity fund or \nserves as investment advisor, manager, or sponsor of a fund, the fund \nmust seek credit, including from asset purchases and derivatives, from \nan independent third party.\n  Subsection (f), paragraph (2) applies section 23B of the Federal \nReserve Act to a banking entity and its advised or sponsored hedge fund \nor private equity fund. This provides, inter alia, that transactions \nbetween a banking entity and its fund be conducted at arms length. The \nfact that section 23B also includes the provision of covered \ntransactions under section 23A as part of its arms-length requirement \nshould not be interpreted to undermine the strict prohibition on such \ntransactions in paragraph (1).\n  Subsection (f), paragraph (3) permits the Board to allow a very \nlimited exception to paragraph (1) for the provision of certain limited \nservices under the rubric of ``prime brokerage'' between the banking \nentity and a third-party-advised fund in which the fund managed, \nsponsored, or advised by the banking entity has taken an ownership \ninterest. Essentially, it was argued that a banking entity should not \nbe prohibited, under proper restrictions, from providing limited \nservices to unaffiliated funds, but in which its own advised fund may \ninvest. Accordingly, paragraph (3) is intended to only cover third-\nparty funds, and should not be used as a means of evading the general \nprohibition provided in paragraph (1). Put simply, a firm may not \ncreate tiered structures and rely upon paragraph (3) to provide these \ntypes of services to funds for which it serves as investment advisor.\n  Further, in recognition of the risks that are created by allowing for \nthese services to unaffiliated funds, several additional criteria must \nalso be met for the banking entity to take advantage of this exception. \nMost notably, on top of the flat prohibitions on bailouts, the statute \nrequires the chief executive officer of firms taking advantage of this \nparagraph to also certify that these services are not used directly or \nindirectly to bail out a fund advised by the firm.\n  Subsection (f), paragraph (4) requires the regulatory agencies to \napply additional capital charges and other restrictions to systemically \nsignificant nonbank financial institutions to account for the risks and \nconflicts of interest that are addressed by the prohibitions for \nbanking entities. Such capital charges and other restrictions should be \nsufficiently rigorous to account for the significant amount of risks \nassociated with these activities.\n  To give markets and firms an opportunity to adjust, implementation of \nsection 620 will proceed over a period of several years. First, \npursuant to subsection (b), paragraph (1), the Financial Stability \nOversight Council will conduct a study to examine the most effective \nmeans of implementing the rule. Then, under paragraph (b)(2), the \nFederal banking agencies, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission shall each engage in \nrulemakings for their regulated entities, with the rulemaking \ncoordinated for consistency through the Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil. In coordinating the rulemaking, the Council should strive to \navoid a ``lowest common denominator'' framework, and instead apply the \nbest, most rigorous practice from each regulatory agency.\n  Pursuant to subsection (c), paragraph (1), most provisions of section \n619 become effective 12 months after the issuance of final rules \npursuant to subsection (b), but in no case later than 2 years after the \nenactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Paragraph (c)(2) provides a 2-year \nperiod following effective date of the provision during which entities \nmust bring their activities into conformity with the law, which may be \nextended for up to 3 more years. Special illiquid funds may, if \nnecessary, receive one 5-year extension and may\n\n[[Page S5899]]\n\nalso continue to honor certain contractual commitments during the \ntransition period. The purpose of this extended wind-down period is to \nminimize market disruption while still steadily moving firms away from \nthe risks of the restricted activities.\n  The definition of ``illiquid funds'' set forth in subsection (h) \nparagraph (7) is meant to cover, in general, very illiquid private \nequity funds that have deployed capital to illiquid assets such as \nportfolio companies and real estate with a projected investment holding \nperiod of several years. The Board, in consultation with the SEC, \nshould therefore adopt rules to define the contours of an illiquid fund \nas appropriate to capture the intent of the provision. To facilitate \ncertainty in the market with respect to divestiture, the Board is to \nconduct a special expedited rulemaking regarding these conformance and \nwind-down periods. The Board is also to set capital rules and any \nadditional restrictions to protect the banking entities and the U.S. \nfinancial system during this wind-down period.\n\n  We noted above that the purpose of section 620 is to review the long-\nterm investments and other activities of banks. The concerns reflected \nin this section arise out of losses that have appeared in the long-term \ninvestment portfolios in traditional depository institutions.\n  Over time, various banking regulators have displayed expansive views \nand conflicting judgments about permissible investments for banking \nentities. Some of these activities, including particular trading \nstrategies and investment assets, pose significant risks. While section \n619 provides numerous restrictions to proprietary trading and \nrelationships to hedge funds and private equity funds, it does not seek \nto significantly alter the traditional business of banking.\n  Section 620 is an attempt to reevaluate banking assets and strategies \nand see what types of restrictions are most appropriate. The Federal \nbanking agencies should closely review the risks contained in the types \nof assets retained in the investment portfolio of depository \ninstitutions, as well as risks in affiliates' activities such as \nmerchant banking. The review should dovetail with the determination of \nwhat constitutes ``high-risk assets'' and ``high risk trading \nstrategies'' under paragraph (d)(2).\n  At this point, I yield to Senator Levin to discuss an issue that is \nof particular interest to him involving section 621's conflict of \ninterest provisions.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank my colleague for the detailed explanation he has \nprovided of sections 619 and 620, and fully concur in it. I would like \nto add our joint explanation of section 621, which addresses the \nblatant conflicts of interest in the underwriting of asset-backed \nsecurities highlighted in a hearing with Goldman Sachs before the \nPermanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I chair.\n  The intent of section 621 is to prohibit underwriters, sponsors, and \nothers who assemble asset-backed securities, from packaging and selling \nthose securities and profiting from the securities' failures. This \npractice has been likened to selling someone a car with no brakes and \nthen taking out a life insurance policy on the purchaser. In the asset-\nbacked securities context, the sponsors and underwriters of the asset-\nbacked securities are the parties who select and understand the \nunderlying assets, and who are best positioned to design a security to \nsucceed or fail. They, like the mechanic servicing a car, would know if \nthe vehicle has been designed to fail. And so they must be prevented \nfrom securing handsome rewards for designing and selling malfunctioning \nvehicles that undermine the asset-backed securities markets. It is for \nthat reason that we prohibit those entities from engaging in \ntransactions that would involve or result in material conflicts of \ninterest with the purchasers of their products.\n  Section 621 is not intended to limit the ability of an underwriter to \nsupport the value of a security in the aftermarket by providing \nliquidity and a ready two-sided market for it. Nor does it restrict a \nfirm from creating a synthetic asset-backed security, which inherently \ncontains both long and short positions with respect to securities it \npreviously created, so long as the firm does not take the short \nposition. But a firm that underwrites an asset-backed security would \nrun afoul of the provision if it also takes the short position in a \nsynthetic asset-backed security that references the same assets it \ncreated. In such an instance, even a disclosure to the purchaser of the \nunderlying asset-backed security that the underwriter has or might in \nthe future bet against the security will not cure the material conflict \nof interest.\n  We believe that the Securities and Exchange Commission has sufficient \nauthority to define the contours of the rule in such a way as to remove \nthe vast majority of conflicts of interest from these transactions, \nwhile also protecting the healthy functioning of our capital markets.\n  In conclusion, we would like to acknowledge all our supporters, co-\nsponsors, and advisers who assisted us greatly in bringing this \nlegislation to fruition. From the time President Obama announced his \nsupport for the Volcker Rule, a diverse and collaborative effort has \nemerged, uniting community bankers to old school financiers to \nreformers. Senator Merkley and I further extend special thanks to the \noriginal cosponsors of the PROP Trading Act, Senators Ted Kaufman, \nSherrod Brown, and Jeanne Shaheen, who have been with us since the \nbeginning.\n  Senator Jack Reed and his staff did yeoman's work in advancing this \ncause. We further tip our hat to our tireless and vocal colleague, \nSenator Byron Dorgan, who opposed the repeal of Glass-Steagall and has \nbeen speaking about the risks from proprietary trading for a number of \nyears. Above all, we pay tribute to the tremendous labors of Chairman \nChris Dodd and his entire team and staff on the Senate Banking \nCommittee, as well as the support of Chairman Barney Frank and \nRepresentative Paul Kanjorski. We extend our deep gratitude to our \nstaffs, including the entire team and staff at the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations, for their outstanding work. And last \nbut not least, we highlight the visionary leadership of Paul Volcker \nand his staff. Without the support of all of them and many others, the \nMerkley-Levin language would not have been included in the Conference \nReport.\n  We believe this provision will stand the test of time. We hope that \nour regulators have learned with Congress that tearing down regulatory \nwalls without erecting new ones undermines our financial stability and \nthreatens economic growth. We have legislated to the best of our \nability. It is now up to our regulators to fully and faithfully \nimplement these strong provisions.\n  I yield the floor to Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank my colleague for his remarks and concur in all \nrespects.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I said so yesterday, and I will say it \nagain: I thank Senator Merkley. I guess there are four new Members of \nthe Senate serving on the Banking Committee. Senator Merkley, Senator \nWarner, Senator Tester, and Senator Bennet are all new Members of the \nSenate from their respective States of Oregon, Virginia, Montana, and \nColorado. To be thrown into what has been the largest undertaking of \nthe Banking Committee, certainly in my three decades here--and many \nhave argued going back almost 100 years--was certainly an awful lot to \nask.\n  I have already pointed out the contribution Senator Warner has made \nto this bill. But I must say as well that Senator Bennet of Colorado \nhas been invaluable in his contributions. I just mentioned Senator \nTester a moment ago for his contribution on talking about rural America \nand the importance of those issues. And Senator Merkley, as a member of \nthe committee, on matters we included here dealing particularly with \nthe mortgage reforms, the underwriting standards, the protections \npeople have to go through, and credit cards as well--we passed the \ncredit card bill--again, it was Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon who \nplayed a critical role in that whole debate not to mention, of course, \nworking with Carl Levin, one of the more senior Members here, having \nserved for many years in the Senate. But the Merkley-Levin, Levin-\nMerkley provisions in this bill have added substantial contributions to \nthis effort. So I thank him for his contribution.\n  I see my colleague from North Dakota is here. I suggest the absence \nof a\n\n[[Page S5900]]\n\nquorum and ask unanimous consent that the time be equally divided among \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we listened to Senator Conrad, the chairman \nof the Budget Committee, address the budget point of order. I urge my \ncolleagues to waive the point of order.\n  We came up with an alternative offset in the conference committee, \nmuch at the insistence--and I thanked him for that--of Senator Brown of \nMassachusetts, looking for a better offset than the ones which were \noriginally in the conference report. I know my colleague from Maine as \nwell had reservations about what we originally included.\n  The offset here ends TARP, which I presume most people would welcome \nwith open arms, saving us $11 billion by terminating it early, as well \nas then complying with the request by the chairperson of the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation, Sheila Bair, to provide for additional \nassessments to meet the obligations of the FDIC and the insurance fund. \nBoth of those items provide the necessary offsets to the cost of this \nbill.\n  The long-term deficit point of order is caused by the orderly \nliquidation authority for systemically significant financial \ninstitutions.\n  Let me note that this critically important aspect of the legislation \nwas developed in very close cooperation with Senator Shelby in the \nShelby-Dodd amendment. It also reflects the bipartisan cooperation of \nSenators Corker and Warner. The Shelby-Dodd amendment passed this body \noverwhelmingly with over 90 votes.\n  Even though the liquidation authority is the source of long-term \nbudget costs, it is still 100 percent paid for. The Shelby-Dodd \namendment and the Boxer amendment made sure that this would be the \ncase. Let me repeat, the liquidation authority, which is the dominant \nsource of the budget cost in the bill, is 100 percent paid for over \ntime.\n  The only reason that the liquidation authority scores at all is \nbecause of timing. The FDIC may initially have to borrow funds from the \nTreasury in order to wind down the failed company and put it out of \nbusiness. Because it will take time to liquidate a large, \ninterconnected financial company, there is a lag between when the funds \nare borrowed and when they are repaid by the sale of the failed \ncompanies' assets, its creditors and assessments on the industry if \nnecessary.\n  One more important point on budget scoring and the liquidation \nauthority. CBO cannot factor in the costs to our nation of a failure to \naddress the possibility of future bailouts. We have lived through that \nnightmare and it has cost our country dearly.\n  Now I would like to discuss the way in which we address the budget \nconsequences of the legislation. In particular, I would like to respond \nto some comments that have been made about the provisions increasing \nthe long-term minimum target for the FDIC and thereby strengthening the \nDeposit Insurance Fund, a goal that no one can credibly argue with in \nlight of the recent crisis.\n  In fact, this provision is supported by FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair, \nand she has sent us a letter expressing her support. I will submit that \nfor the Record at the end of this statement.\n  Some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have claimed \nthat the use of the FDIC in this way is unprecedented and questioned \nhow this could count as budget savings or offsets and at the same time \npreserve the funds for bank failures.\n  Let us clear up the misinformation. First, no FDIC funds are being \nspent on, or transferred to, other programs. Premiums paid by banks \nremain, as they have for over 75 years, in the FDIC fund solely to \nprotect insured deposits.\n  And counting FDIC premiums as budget savings in legislation \nabsolutely does have precedent. We have to look no further than \nrelatively recent actions of Republican Congresses to find them.\n  Budget reconciliation legislation enacted in February 2006 and \nsponsored by my colleague from New Hampshire, who was then the Chairman \nof the Budget Committee, included FDIC reforms authored by my colleague \nfrom Alabama, who was then Chairman of the Banking Committee. Those \nprovisions resulted in higher FDIC premiums, which CBO said yielded \nalmost $2 billion in budget savings over 10 years.\n  So, my colleagues from New Hampshire and Alabama in fact relied on \nreforms to the Deposit Insurance Fund to obtain savings that CBO \nfavorably scored.\n  And 10 years earlier, Congress attached to an omnibus spending bill \nenacted in September 1996 a provision calling for a special premium on \nthrifts to capitalize the FDIC's thrift insurance fund.\n  The appropriators in that earlier Republican Congress justified \nhigher discretionary spending based partly on the budget savings scored \nby CBO for the FDIC assessment.\n  I would also like to respond to some comments that have been made \nabout the treatment of TARP in this legislation.\n  We end TARP in the conference report. With the comprehensive \nfinancial reform put in place under this bill, we think it is the right \ntime to bring TARP to a close, ending it earlier than had been planned. \nI think that is something everyone should be happy about. And ending \nTARP saves the government money. That is not just my conclusion. It is \nthe conclusion of the Congressional Budget Office, $11 billion in \nsavings.\n  It is true that the original TARP legislation passed as an emergency, \nits costs were declared an emergency when it passed, so rescinding \nthose funds or ending the program now is ending spending that is \nconsidered ``emergency'' spending.\n  But the savings are no less real because of that. Interestingly, my \nRepublican colleague who has raised the point of order offered an \namendment in conference that would have rescinded stimulus funding to \npay for this bill. Why is that relevant? Because the stimulus money was \nalso designated as an emergency, so it would have received the same \naccounting treatment here in the Senate as TARP. Both were emergencies.\n  Both ending TARP early and rescinding stimulus funding would reduce \nthe deficit, but the burden of cuts in stimulus funding would fall \ndisproportionately on families and small businesses who have been \nvictims of the economic fallout from the Wall Street crisis. Cutting \nsuch spending would be exactly the wrong thing to do as we try to get \nthe economy back on track and people back to work.\n  The fact is that overall this bill does not do damage to our \nbudgetary outlook.\n  It does make vital changes to make our financial system stronger and \nmore stable and should be passed as soon as possible.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support a motion to waive the long-term \ndeficit point of order.\n\n                                                   Federal Deposit\n\n\n                                        Insurance Corporation,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 29, 2010.\n     Hon. Chris Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Banking, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Barney Frank,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Spencer Bachus,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Financial Services, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen Dodd and Frank and Ranking Members Shelby and \n     Bachus: Thank you for your interest in our views regarding \n     increasing the Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) ratio to 1.35.\n       Federal deposit insurance promotes public confidence in our \n     nation's banking system by providing a safe place for \n     consumers' funds. Deposit insurance has provided much needed \n     stability throughout this crisis. Moreover, insured deposits \n     provide banks with a stable and cost-effective source of \n     funds for lending in their communities. Importantly, the DIF \n     is funded by the insured banking industry.\n       A key measure of the strength of the insurance fund is the \n     reserve ratio, which is the amount in the DIF as a percentage \n     of the industry's estimated insured deposits. Current\n\n[[Page S5901]]\n\n     law requires us to maintain a reserve ratio of at least 1.15 \n     percent. One of the lessons learned from the current crisis \n     is that a minimum reserve ratio of 1.15 is insufficient to \n     avoid the need for pro-cyclical assessments in times of \n     stress. One of my first priorities when I assumed the \n     Chairmanship of the FDIC in June of 2006 was to begin \n     building our reserves. Regrettably, there was insufficient \n     time before the crisis hit. Indeed, we started this crisis \n     with a DIF reserve ratio of 1.22 percent (as of December 31, \n     2007). Beginning in mid-2008, as bank failures increased and \n     the insurance fund incurred losses, the Fund balance and \n     reserve ratio dropped precipitously. The reserve ratio became \n     negative in the third quarter of 2009 and hit a low of \n     negative 0.39 percent as of December 31, 2009. To date, we \n     have collected more than $65 billion in assessments, and are \n     projected to collect another $80 billion by 2016 to restore \n     the fund.\n       Given this experience, we believe it is clear that as the \n     economy strengthens and the banking system heals, the reserve \n     ratio needs to be increased. In fact, our Board has acted \n     through regulation to target the reserve ratio at 1.25 \n     percent, and a further increase to 1.35 percent is consistent \n     with our view that the Fund should build up in good economic \n     times and be allowed to fall in poor economic times, while \n     maintaining relatively steady premiums throughout the \n     economic cycle, thereby reducing the procyclicality of the \n     assessment system.\n       Please let me know if you have any questions or would like \n     to discuss further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Sheila C. Bair.\n\n  I again urge my colleagues to vote to waive the budget point of \norder, and, of course, I urge them as well to support the legislation \nwhen that vote occurs.\n\n\n                     intent behind sections 691-621\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to engage my colleagues, Senators \nDodd and Levin, in a colloquy regarding some key aspects of our \nlegislative intent behind sections 619 through 621, the Merkley-Levin \nrule on proprietary trading and conflicts of interest as included in \nthe conference report.\n  First, I would like to clarify several issues surrounding the ``de \nminimis'' investment provisions in subsection (d)(4). These provisions \ncomplement subsection (d)(1)(G), which permits firms to offer hedge \nfunds and private equity funds to clients. ``De minimis'' investments \nunder paragraph (4) are intended to facilitate these offerings \nprincipally by allowing a firm to start new funds and to maintain \ncoinvestments in funds, which help the firm align its interests with \nthose of its clients. During the initial start-up period, during which \ntime firms may maintain 100 percent ownership, the fund should be \nrelatively small, but sufficient to effectively implement the \ninvestment strategy. After the start up period, a firm may keep an \nongoing ``alignment of interest'' coinvestment at 3 percent of a fund. \nOur intent is not to allow for large, revolving ``seed'' funds to evade \nthe strong restrictions on proprietary trading of this section, and \nregulators will need to be vigilant against such evasion. The aggregate \nof all seed and coinvestments should be immaterial to the banking \nentity, and never exceed 3 percent of a firm's Tier 1 capital.\n  Second, I would like to clarify the intent of subsection (f)'s \nprovisions to prohibit banking entities from bailing out funds they \nmanage, sponsor, or advise, as well as funds in which those funds \ninvest. The ``permitted services'' provisions outlined in subsection \n(f) are intended to permit banks to maintain certain limited ``prime \nbrokerage'' service relationships with unaffiliated funds in which a \nfund-of-funds that they manage invests, but are not intended to permit \nfund-of-fund structures to be used to weaken or undermine the \nprohibition on bailouts. Given the risk that a banking entity may want \nto bail out a failing fund directly or its investors, the ``permitted \nservices'' exception must be implemented in a narrow, well-defined, and \narms-length manner and regulators are not empowered to create loopholes \nallowing high-risk activities like leveraged securities lending or \nrepurchase agreements. While we implement a number of legal \nrestrictions designed to ensure that prime brokerage activities are not \nused to bail out a fund, we expect the regulators will nevertheless \nneed to be vigilant.\n  Before I yield the floor to Senator Levin to discuss several \nadditional items, let me say a word of thanks to my good friend, \nChairman Dodd, for taking the time to join me in clarifying these \nprovisions. I also honor him for his extraordinary leadership on the \nentire financial reform package. As a fellow member of the Banking \nCommittee, it has been a privilege to work with him on the entire bill, \nand not just these critical provisions. I also would like to recognize \nSenator Levin, whose determined efforts with his Permanent Subcommittee \non Investigations helped highlight the causes of the recent crisis, as \nwell as the need for reform. It has been a privilege working with him \non this provision.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Senator, and I concur with his detailed \nexplanations. His tireless efforts in putting these commonsense \nrestrictions into law will help protect American families from reckless \nrisk-taking that endangers our financial system and our economy.\n  The conflicts of interest provision under section 621 arises directly \nfrom the hearings and findings of our Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations, which dramatically showed how some firms were creating \nfinancial products, selling those products to their customers, and \nbetting against those same products. This practice has been likened to \nselling someone a car with no brakes and then taking out a life \ninsurance policy on the purchaser. In the asset-backed securities \ncontext, the sponsors and underwriters of the asset-backed securities \nare the parties who select and understand the underlying assets, and \nwho are best positioned to design a security to succeed or fail. They, \nlike the mechanic servicing a car, would know if the vehicle has been \ndesigned to fail. And so they must be prevented from securing handsome \nrewards for designing and selling malfunctioning vehicles that \nundermine the asset-backed securities markets. It is for that reason \nthat we prohibit those entities from engaging in transactions that \nwould involve or result in material conflicts of interest with the \npurchasers of their products.\n  First, I would like to address certain areas which we exclude from \ncoverage. While a strong prohibition on material conflicts of interest \nis central to section 621, we recognize that underwriters are often \nasked to support issuances of asset-backed securities in the \naftermarket by providing liquidity to the initial purchasers, which may \nmean buying and selling the securities for some time. That activity is \nconsistent with the goal of supporting the offering, is not likely to \npose a material conflict, and accordingly we are comfortable excluding \nit from the general prohibition. Similarly, market conditions change \nover time and may lead an underwriter to wish to sell the securities it \nholds. That is also not likely to pose a conflict. But regulators must \nact diligently to ensure that an underwriter is not making bets against \nthe very financial products that it assembled and sold.\n  Second, I would like to address the role of disclosures in relations \nto conflicts of interest. In our view, disclosures alone may not cure \nthese types of conflicts in all cases. Indeed, while a meaningful \ndisclosure may alleviate the appearance of a material conflict of \ninterest in some circumstances, in others, such as if the disclosures \ncannot be made to the appropriate party or because the disclosure is \nnot sufficiently meaningful, disclosures are likely insufficient. Our \nintent is to provide the regulators with the authority and strong \ndirective to stop the egregious practices, and not to allow for \nregulators to enable them to continue behind the fig leaf of vague, \ntechnically worded, fine print disclosures.\n  These provisions shall be interpreted strictly, and regulators are \ndirected to use their authority to act decisively to protect our \ncritical financial infrastructure from the risks and conflicts inherent \nin allowing banking entities and other large financial firms to engage \nin high risk proprietary trading and investing in hedge funds and \nprivate equity funds.\n  Mr. President, I would like to thank Chairman Dodd for his \nextraordinary dedication in shepherding this massive financial \nregulatory reform package through the Senate and the conference \ncommittee. This has been a long process, and he and his staff have been \nvery able and supportive partners in this effort.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator, and I strongly concur with the \nintentions and interpretations set forth by the principal authors of \nthese provisions, Senators Merkley and Levin, as reflecting the \nlegislative intent of the conference committee. I thank Senators \nMerkley and Levin for their\n\n[[Page S5902]]\n\nleadership, which was so essential in achieving the conference report \nprovisions governing proprietary trading and prohibiting conflicts of \ninterest.\n\n\n                     Assessing Individual Entities\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I thank the Chairman for his continued work \nto ensure that appropriate resources are available to protect the \neconomy from a future failure of a systemically risky financial \ninstitution and to help pay back taxpayers for the recent failures we \nexperienced.\n  With regard to assessments under the orderly liquidation authority of \nthe bill, the bill requires that a risk-based matrix of factors be \nestablished by the FDIC, taking into account the recommendations of the \nFinancial Stability Oversight Council, to be used in connection with \nassessing any individual entity. One of the factors listed in the \nbill's risk matrix provision would take into account the activities of \nfinancial entities and their affiliates. Is it the intent of that \nlanguage that a consideration of such factors should specifically \ninclude the impact of potential assessments on the ability of an \ninstitution that is a tax-exempt, not-for-profit organization to carry \nout their legally required charitable and educational activities?\n  As the Senator knows, many Members of the Senate--like me--feel \nstrongly that we must ensure that our constituents and communities \ncontinue to have access to these vital resources, and any potential \nassessment on tax-exempt groups which are charitable and/or educational \nby mission could severely hamper these groups' ability to fulfill their \nobligations to carry out their legally required activities.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, that is correct. The language is not intended to \nreduce such charitable and educational activities that are legally \nrequired for tax-exempt, not-for-profit organizations that are so \nimportant to communities across the country. I thank the Senator for \nhis continued help on these efforts.\n\n\n                      section 603 trust companies\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I ask the chairman of the Senate Banking \nCommittee, my colleague from Connecticut, Senator Dodd, to clarify the \ntypes of trust companies that fall within the scope of section 603(a), \na provision that prohibits the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nfrom approving an application for deposit insurance for certain \ncompanies, including certain trust companies, until 3 years after the \ndate of enactment of this act.\n  Mr. DODD. I would be glad to clarify the nature of trust companies \nsubject to the moratorium under section 603(a). The moratorium applies \nto an institution that is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by \na commercial firm that functions solely in a trust or fiduciary \ncapacity and is exempt from the definition of a bank in the Bank \nHolding Company Act. It does not apply to a nondepository trust company \nthat does not have FDIC insurance and that does not offer demand \ndeposit accounts or other deposits that may be withdrawn by check or \nsimilar means for payment to third parties.\n  Ms. COLLINS. I thank my colleague for his clarification.\n\n\n                      Nonbank Financial Companies\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, as we move to final passage of this \nhistoric legislation, I would like to thank Senator Dodd again for his \nleadership and strong support for my amendment to ensure that all \ninsured depository institutions and depository institution holding \ncompanies regardless of size, as well as nonbank financial companies \nsupervised by the Federal Reserve, meet statutory minimum capital \nstandards and thus have adequate capital throughout the economic cycle. \nThose standards required under section 171 serve as the starting point \nfor the development of more stringent standards as required under \nsection 165 of the bill.\n  I did, however, have questions about the designation of certain \nnonbank financial companies under section 113 for Federal Reserve \nsupervision and the significance of such a designation in light of the \nminimum capital standards established by section 171. While I can \nenvision circumstances where a company engaged in the business of \ninsurance could be designated under section 113, I would not ordinarily \nexpect insurance companies engaged in traditional insurance company \nactivities to be designated by the council based on those activities \nalone. Rather, in considering a designation, I would expect the council \nto specifically take into account, among other risk factors, how the \nnature of insurance differs from that of other financial products, \nincluding how traditional insurance products differ from various off-\nbalance-sheet and derivative contract exposures and how that different \nnature is reflected in the structure of traditional insurance \ncompanies. I would also expect the council to consider whether the \ndesignation of an insurance company is appropriate given the existence \nof State-based guaranty funds to pay claims and protect policyholders. \nAm I correct in that understanding?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct. The council must consider a number \nof factors, including, for example, the extent of leverage, the extent \nand nature of off-balance-sheet exposures, and the nature, scope, size, \nscale, concentration, interconnectedness, and mix of the company's \nactivities. Where a company is engaged only in traditional insurance \nactivities, the council should also take into account the matters you \nraised.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Would the Senator agree that the council should not base \ndesignations simply on the size of the financial companies?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes. The size of a financial company should not by itself \nbe determinative.\n  Ms. COLLINS. As the Senator knows, insurance companies are already \nheavily regulated by State regulators who impose their own, very \ndifferent regulatory and capital requirements. The fact that those \ncapital requirements are not the same as those imposed by section 171 \nshould not increase the likelihood that the council will designate an \ninsurer. Does the Senator agree?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, I do not believe that the council should decide to \ndesignate an insurer simply based on whether the insurer would meet \nbank capital requirements.\n\n\n                          Preemption Standard\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am very pleased to see that the \nconference committee on the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act retained my amendment regarding the preemption standard \nfor State consumer financial laws with only minor modifications. I very \nmuch appreciate the effort of Chairman Dodd in fighting to retain the \namendment in conference.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. As the Senator knows, his amendment \nreceived strong bipartisan support on the Senate floor and passed by a \nvote of 80 to 18. It was therefore a Senate priority to retain his \nprovision in our negotiations with the House of Representatives.\n  Mr. CARPER. One change made by the conference committee was to \nrestate the preemption standard in a slightly different way, but my \nreading of the language indicates that the conference report still \nmaintains the Barnett standard for determining when a State law is \npreempted.\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator is correct. That is why the conference report \nspecifically cites the Barnett Bank of Marion County, N.A. v. Nelson, \nFlorida Insurance Commissioner, 517 U.S. 25(1996) case. There should be \nno doubt that the legislation codifies the preemption standard stated \nby the U.S. Supreme Court in that case.\n  Mr. CARPER. I again thank the Senator. This will provide certainty to \neveryone--those who offer consumers financial products and to consumer \nthemselves.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5902-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5902-S5933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NONBANK FINANCIAL COMPANIES\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the conference report to accompany H.R. \n4173, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform bill, creates a mechanism \nthrough which the Financial Stability Oversight Council may determine \nthat material financial distress at a U.S. nonbank financial company \ncould pose such a threat to the financial stability of the United \nStates that the company should be supervised by the Board of Governors \nof the Federal Reserve System and should be subject to heightened \nprudential standards. It is my understanding that in making such a \ndetermination, the Congress intends that the council should focus on \nrisk factors\n\n[[Page S5903]]\n\nthat contributed to the recent financial crisis, such as the use of \nexcessive leverage and major off-balance-sheet exposure. The fact that \na company is large or is significantly involved in financial services \ndoes not mean that it poses significant risks to the financial \nstability of the United States. There are large companies providing \nfinancial services that are in fact traditionally low-risk businesses, \nsuch as mutual funds and mutual fund advisers. We do not envision \nnonbank financial companies that pose little risk to the stability of \nthe financial system to be supervised by the Federal Reserve. Does the \nchairman of the Banking Committee share my understanding of this \nprovision?\n  Mr. DODD. The Senator from Massachusetts is correct. Size and \ninvolvement in providing credit or liquidity alone should not be \ndetermining factors. The Banking Committee intends that only a limited \nnumber of high-risk, nonbank financial companies would join large bank \nholding companies in being regulated and supervised by the Federal \nReserve.\n\n\n                          Capital Requirements\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I understand that it is the intent of \nparagraph 7 of section 171(b) of this legislation to require the \nFederal banking agencies, subject to the recommendations of the \ncouncil, to develop capital requirements applicable to insured \ndepository institutions, depository institution holding companies, and \nnonbank financial companies supervised by the Board of Governors that \nare engaged in activities that are subject to heightened standards \nunder section 120. It is well understood that minimum capital \nrequirements can help to shield various public and private stakeholders \nfrom risks posed by material distress that could arise at these \nentities from engaging in these activities. It is also understood and \nrecognized that minimum capital requirements may not be an appropriate \ntool to apply under all circumstances and that by prescribing section \n171 capital requirements as the correct tool with respect to companies \ncovered by paragraph 7, it should not be inferred that capital \nrequirements should be required for any other companies not covered by \nparagraph 7.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I also understand that the intent of this section is \nnot to create any inference that minimum capital requirements are the \nappropriate standard or safeguard for the council to recommend to be \napplied to any nonbank financial company that is not subject to \nsupervision by the Federal Reserve under title I of this legislation, \nwith respect to any activity subject to section 120. Rather, the \ncouncil should have full discretion not to recommend the application of \ncapital requirements to any such nonbank financial company engaged in \nany such activity.\n  Mr. DODD. I concur with Senator Collins and Senator Shaheen. Section \n171 of this legislation came from an amendment that Senator Collins \noffered on the Senate floor, and I truly appreciate the constructive \ncontribution she has made to this legislative process. My understanding \nalso is that the capital requirements under paragraph 7 are intended to \napply only to insured depository institutions, depository institution \nholding companies, and nonbank financial companies supervised by the \nBoard of Governors. I thank my friends from Maine and New Hampshire for \nthis clarification.\n\n\n                      Insurance Company Definition\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, first, I would like to commend \nChairman Dodd for his hard work on the Wall Street reform bill and for \nmaintaining an open and transparent process while developing this \nlegislation. With regard to the orderly liquidation authority under \ntitle II of the bill, an ``insurance company'' is defined in section \n201 as any entity that is engaged in the business of insurance, subject \nto regulation by a State insurance regulator, and covered by a State \nlaw that is designed to specifically deal with the rehabilitation, \nliquidation, or insolvency of an insurance company. Is it the intent of \nthis definition that a mutual insurance holding company organized and \noperating under State insurance laws should be considered an insurance \ncompany for the purpose of this title?\n  Mr. DODD. Yes, that is correct. It is intended that a mutual \ninsurance holding company organized and operating under State insurance \nlaws should be considered an insurance company for the purpose of title \nII of this legislation. I thank the Senator from Nebraska for this \nclarification.\n\n\n                      Independent Representatives\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Agriculture, \nNutrition, and Forestry Committee, I became acutely aware that our \npension plans, governmental investors, and charitable endowments were \nfalling victim to swap dealers marketing swaps and security-based swaps \nthat they knew or should have known to be inappropriate or unsuitable \nfor their clients. Jefferson County, AL, is probably the most infamous \nexample, but there are many others in Pennsylvania and across the \ncountry. That is why I worked with Senator Harkin and our colleagues in \nthe House to include protections for pension funds, governmental \nentities, and charitable endowments in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \nReform and Consumer Protection Act.\n  Those protections--set forth in section 731 and section 764 of the \nconference report--place certain duties and obligations on swap dealers \nand security-based swap dealers when they deal with special entities. \nOne of those obligations is that a swap dealer or the security-based \nswap dealer entering into a swap or security-based swap with a special \nentity must have a reasonable basis for believing that the special \nentity has an independent representative evaluating the transaction. \nOur intention in imposing the independent representative requirement \nwas to ensure that there was always someone independent of the swap \ndealer or the security-based swap dealer reviewing and approving swap \nor security-based swap transactions. However, we did not intend to \nrequire that the special entity hire an investment manager independent \nof the special entity. Is that your understanding, Senator Harkin?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes, that is correct. We certainly understand that many \nspecial entities have internal managers that may meet the independent \nrepresentative requirement. For example, many public electric and gas \nsystems have employees whose job is to handle the day-to-day hedging \noperations of the system, and we intended to allow them to continue to \nrely on those in-house managers to evaluate and approve swap and \nsecurity-based swap transactions, provided that the manager remained \nindependent of the swap dealer or the security-based swap dealer and \nmet the other conditions of the provision. Similarly, the named \nfiduciary or in-house asset manager--INHAM--for a pension plan may \ncontinue to approve swap and security-based swap transactions.\n\n\n                             Foreign Banks\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I wish to engage my colleague, Senator \nDodd, in a brief colloquy related to the section 716, the bank swap \ndesk provision.\n  In the rush to complete the conference, there was a significant \noversight made in finalizing section 716 as it relates to the treatment \nof uninsured U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks. Under the \nU.S. policy of national treatment, which has been part of U.S. law \nsince the International Banking Act of 1978, uninsured U.S. branches \nand agencies of foreign banks are authorized to engage in the same \nactivities as insured depository institutions. While these U.S. \nbranches and agencies of foreign banks do not have deposits insured by \nthe FDIC, they are registered and regulated by a Federal banking \nregulator, they have access to the Federal Reserve discount window, and \nother Federal Reserve credit facilities.\n  It is my understanding that a number of these U.S. branches and \nagencies of foreign banks will be swap entities under section 716 and \ntitle VII of Dodd-Frank. Due to the fact that the section 716 safe \nharbor only applies to ``insured depository institutions'' it means \nthat U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks will be forced to push \nout all their swaps activities. This result was not intended. U.S. \nbranches and agencies of foreign banks should be subject to the same \nswap desk push out requirements as insured depository institutions \nunder section 716. Under section 716, insured depository institutions \nmust push out all swaps and security-based swaps activities except for \nspecifically enumerated activities, such as hedging and other similar \nrisk mitigating activities directly related\n\n[[Page S5904]]\n\nto the insured depository institution's activities, acting as a swaps \nentity for swaps or security-based swaps that are permissible for \ninvestment, and acting as a swaps entity for cleared credit default \nswaps. U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks should, and are \nwilling to, meet the push out requirements of section 716 as if they \nwere insured depository institutions.\n  This oversight on our part is unfortunate and clearly unintended. \nDoes my colleague agree with me about the need to include uninsured \nU.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks in the safe harbor of \nsection 716?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I agree completely with Senator Lincoln's \nanalysis and with the need to address this issue to ensure that \nuninsured U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks are treated the \nsame as insured depository institutions under the provisions of section \n716, including the safe harbor language.\n\n\n                               End Users\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I will ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter that Chairman Dodd and I wrote to \nChairmen Frank and Peterson during House consideration of this \nConference Report regarding the derivatives title. The letter \nemphasizes congressional intent regarding commercial end users who \nenter into swaps contracts.\n  As we point out, it is clear in this legislation that the regulators \nonly have the authority to set capital and margin requirements on swap \ndealers and major swap participants for uncleared swaps, not on end \nusers who qualify for the exemption from mandatory clearing.\n  As the letter also makes clear, it is our intent that the any margin \nrequired by the regulators will be risk-based, keeping with the \nstandards we have put into the bill regarding capital. It is in the \ninterest of the financial system and end user counterparties that swap \ndealers and major swap participants are sufficiently capitalized. At \nthe same time, Congress did not mandate that regulators set a specific \nmargin level. Instead, we granted a broad authority to the regulators \nto set margin. Again, margin and capital standards must be risk-based \nand not be punitive.\n  It is also important to note that few end users will be major swap \nparticipants, as we have excluded ``positions held for hedging or \nmitigating commercial risk'' from being considered as a ``substantial \nposition'' under that definition. I would ask Chairman Dodd whether he \nconcurs with my view of the bill.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with the Chairman's assessment. There is no \nauthority to set margin on end users, only major swap participants and \nswap dealers. It is also the intent of this bill to distinguish between \ncommercial end users hedging their risk and larger, riskier market \nparticipants. Regulators should distinguish between these types of \ncompanies when implementing new regulatory requirements.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record the letter that Chairman Dodd and I wrote to Chairmen \nFrank and Peterson to which I referred.\n\n\n                           investment adviser\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I rise to discuss section 409 of the \nDodd-Frank bill, which excludes family offices from the definition of \ninvestment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. In section 409, \nthe SEC is directed to define the term family offices and to provide \nexemptions that recognize the range of organizational, management, and \nemployment structures and arrangement employed by family offices, and I \nthought it would be worthwhile to provide guidance on this provision.\n  For many decades, family offices have managed money for members of \nindividual families, and they do not pose systemic risk or any other \nregulatory issues. The SEC has provided exemptive relief to some family \noffices in the past, but many family offices have simply relied on the \n``under 15 clients'' exception to the Investment Advisers Act, and when \nCongress eliminated this exception, it was not our intent to include \nfamily offices in the bill.\n  The bill provides specific direction for the SEC in its rulemaking to \nrecognize that most family offices often have officers, directors, and \nemployees who may not be family members, and who are employed by the \nfamily office itself or affiliated entities owned, directly or \nindirectly, by the family members. Often, such persons co-invest with \nfamily members, which enable those persons to share in the profits of \ninvestments they oversee and better align the interests of those \npersons with those of the family members served by the family office. \nIn addition, family offices may have a small number of co-investors \nsuch as persons who help identify investment opportunities, provide \nprofessional advice, or manage portfolio companies. However, the value \nof investments by such other persons should not exceed a de minimis \npercentage of the total value of the assets managed by the family \noffice. Accordingly, section 409 directs the SEC not to exclude a \nfamily office from the definition by reason of its providing investment \nadvice to these persons.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. Pursuant to negotiations during the \nconference committee, it was my desire that the SEC write rules to \nexempt certain family offices already in operation from the definition \nof investment adviser, regardless of whether they had previously \nreceived an SEC exemptive order. It was my intent that the rule would: \nexempt family offices, provided that they operated in a manner \nconsistent with the previous exemptive policy of the Commission as \nreflected in exemptive orders for family offices in effect on the date \nof enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act; reflect a recognition of the range \nof organizational, management and employment structures and \narrangements employed by family offices; and not exclude any person who \nwas not registered or required to be registered under the Advisers Act \nfrom the definition of the term ``family office'' solely because such \nperson provides investment advice to natural persons who, at the time \nof their applicable investment, are officers, directors or employees of \nthe family office who have previously invested with the family office \nand are accredited investors, any company owned exclusively by such \nofficers, directors or employees or their successors-in-interest and \ncontrolled by the family office, or any other natural persons who \nidentify investment opportunities to the family office and invest in \nsuch transactions on substantially the same terms as the family office \ninvests, but do not invest in other funds advised by the family office, \nand whose assets to which the family office provides investment advice \nrepresent, in the aggregate, not more than 5 percent of the total \nassets as to which the family office provides investment advice.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I appreciate the Senator's explanation and ask that the \nSenator work with me to make this point in a technical corrections \nbill.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree that this position should be raised in a \ncorrections bill and I look forward to working with the Senator towards \nthis goal on this point.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator for his leadership and his \nassistance and cooperation in ensuring the passage of this important \nbill.\n\n\n                              VOLCKER RULE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to ask my good friend, the Senator \nfrom Connecticut and the chairman of the Banking Committee, to engage \nin a brief discussion relating to the final Volcker rule and the role \nof venture capital in creating jobs and growing companies.\n  I strongly support the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act, including a strong and effective Volcker rule, which is \nfound in section 619 of the legislation.\n  I know the chairman recognizes, as we all do, the crucial and unique \nrole that venture capital plays in spurring innovation, creating jobs \nand growing companies. I also know the authors of this bill do not \nintend the Volcker rule to cut off sources of capital for America's \ntechnology startups, particularly in this difficult economy. Section \n619 explicitly exempts small business investment companies from the \nrule, and because these companies often provide venture capital \ninvestment, I believe the intent of the rule is not to harm venture \ncapital investment.\n  Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nCalifornia, for her support and for all the work we have done together \non this important issue. Her understanding is correct.\n\n[[Page S5905]]\n\n  The purpose of the Volcker rule is to eliminate excessive risk taking \nactivities by banks and their affiliates while at the same time \npreserving safe, sound investment activities that serve the public \ninterest. It prohibits proprietary trading and limits bank investment \nin hedge funds and private equity for that reason. But properly \nconducted venture capital investment will not cause the harms at which \nthe Volcker rule is directed. In the event that properly conducted \nventure capital investment is excessively restricted by the provisions \nof section 619, I would expect the appropriate Federal regulators to \nexempt it using their authority under section 619(J).\n\n\n                            Captive Finance\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to discuss the derivatives \ntitle of the Wall Street reform legislation with chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, Senator Lincoln.\n  I would like to first commend the Senator and her staff's hard work \non this critically important bill, which brings accountability, \ntransparency, and oversight to the opaque derivatives market.\n  For too long the over-the-counter derivatives market has been \nunregulated, transferring risk between firms and creating a web of \nfragility in a system where entities became too interconnected to fail.\n  It is clear that unregulated derivative markets contributed to the \nfinancial crisis that crippled middle-class families. Small businesses \nand our manufacturers couldn't get the credit they needed to keep the \nlights on, and many had to close their doors permanently. People who \nhad saved money and played by the rules lost $1.6 trillion from their \nretirement accounts. More than 6 million families lost their homes to \nforeclosure. And before the recession was over, more than 7 million \nAmericans had lost their jobs.\n  The status quo is clearly not an option.\n  The conference between the Senate and the House produced a strong \nbill that will make sure these markets are accountable and fair and \nthat the consumers are back in control.\n  I particularly want to thank the Senator for her efforts to protect \nmanufacturers that use derivatives to manage risks associated with \ntheir operations. Whether it is hedging the risks related to \nfluctuating oil prices or foreign currency revenues, the ability to \nprovide financial certainty to companies' balance sheets is critical to \ntheir viability and global competitiveness.\n  I am glad that the conference recognizes the distinction between \nentities that are using the derivatives market to engage in speculative \ntrading and our manufacturers and businesses that are not speculating. \nInstead, they use this market responsibly to hedge legitimate business \nrisk in order to reduce volatility and protect their plans to make \ninvestments and create jobs.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that manufacturers and companies \nthat are using derivatives to hedge legitimate business risk and do not \nengage in speculative behavior will not be subjected to the capital or \nmargin requirements in the bill?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I thank the Senator for her efforts to protect \nmanufacturers. I share the Senator's concerns, which is why our \nlanguage preserves the ability of manufacturers and businesses to use \nderivatives to hedge legitimate business risk.\n  Working closely with the Senator, I believe the legislation reflects \nour intent by providing a clear and narrow end-user exemption from \nclearing and margin requirements for derivatives held by companies that \nare not major swap participants and do not engage in speculation but \nuse these products solely as a risk-management tool to hedge or \nmitigate commercial risks.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Again, I appreciate the Senator's efforts to work with \nme on language that ensures manufacturers are not forced to \nunnecessarily divert working capital from core business activities, \nsuch as investing in new equipment and creating more jobs. As you know, \nlarge manufacturers of high-cost products often establish wholly owned \ncaptive finance affiliates to support the sales of its products by \nproviding financing to customers and dealers.\n  Captive finance affiliates of manufacturing companies play an \nintegral role in keeping the parent company's plants running and new \nproducts moving. This role is even more important during downturns and \nin times of limited market liquidity. As an example, Ford's captive \nfinance affiliate, Ford Credit, continued to consistently support over \n3,000 of Ford's dealers and Ford Credit's portfolio of more than 3 \nmillion retail customers during the recent financial crisis--at a time \nwhen banks had almost completely withdrawn from auto lending.\n  Many finance arms securitize their loans through wholly owned \naffiliate entities, thereby raising the funds they need to keep \nlending. Derivatives are integral to the securitization funding process \nand consequently facilitating the necessary financing for the purchase \nof the manufacturer's products.\n  If captive finance affiliates of manufacturing companies are forced \nto post margin to a clearinghouse it will divert a significant amount \nof capital out of the U.S. manufacturing sector and could endanger the \nrecovery of credit markets on which manufacturers and their captive \nfinance affiliates depend.\n  Is it the Senator's understanding that this legislation recognizes \nthe unique role that captive finance companies play in supporting \nmanufacturers by exempting transactions entered into by such companies \nand their affiliate entities from clearing and margin so long as they \nare engaged in financing that facilitates the purchase or lease of \ntheir commercial end user parents products and these swaps contracts \nare used for non-speculative hedging?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes, this legislation recognizes that captive finance \ncompanies support the jobs and investments of their parent company. It \nwould ensure that clearing and margin requirements would not be applied \nto captive finance or affiliate company transactions that are used for \nlegitimate, nonspeculative hedging of commercial risk arising from \nsupporting their parent company's operations. All swap trades, even \nthose which are not cleared, would still be reported to regulators, a \nswap data repository, and subject to the public reporting requirements \nunder the legislation.\n  This bill also ensures that these exemptions are tailored and narrow \nto ensure that financial institutions do not alter behavior to exploit \nthese legitimate exemptions.\n  Based on the Senator's hard work and interest in captive finance \nentities of manufacturing companies, I would like to discuss briefly \nthe two captive finance provisions in the legislation and how they work \ntogether. The first captive finance provision is found in section \n2(h)(7) of the CEA, the ``treatment of affiliates'' provision in the \nend-user clearing exemption and is entitled ``transition rule for \naffiliates.'' This provision is available to captive finance entities \nwhich are predominantly engaged in financing the purchase of products \nmade by its parent or an affiliate. The provision permits the captive \nfinance entity to use the clearing exemption for not less than two \nyears after the date of enactment. The exact transition period for this \nprovision will be subject to rulemaking. The second captive finance \nprovision differs in two important ways from the first provision. The \nsecond captive finance provision does not expire after 2 years. The \nsecond provision is a permanent exclusion from the definition of \n``financial entity'' for those captive finance entities who use \nderivatives to hedge commercial risks 90 percent or more of which arise \nfrom financing that facilitates the purchase or lease of products, 90 \npercent or more of which are manufactured by the parent company or \nanother subsidiary of the parent company. It is also limited to the \ncaptive finance entity's use of interest rate swaps and foreign \nexchange swaps. The second captive finance provision is also found in \nSection 2(h)(7) of the CEA at the end of the definition of ``financial \nentity.'' Together, these 2 provisions provide the captive finance \nentities of manufacturing companies with significant relief which will \nassist in job creation and investment by our manufacturing companies.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I agree that the integrity of these exemptions is \ncritical to the reforms enacted in this bill and to the safety of our \nfinancial system. That is why I support the strong anti-abuse \nprovisions included in the bill.\n\n[[Page S5906]]\n\nWould you please explain the safeguards included in this bill to \nprevent abuse?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. It is also critical to ensure that we only exempt those \ntransactions that are used to hedge by manufacturers, commercial \nentities and a limited number of financial entities. We were surgical \nin our approach to a clearing exemption, making it as narrow as \npossible and excluding speculators.\n  In addition to a narrow end-user exemption, this bill empowers \nregulators to take action against manipulation. Also, the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission and the Securities Exchange Commission will \nhave a broad authority to write and enforce rules to prevent abuse and \nto go after anyone that attempts to circumvent regulation.\n  America's consumers and businesses deserve strong derivatives reform \nthat will ensure that the country's financial oversight system promotes \nand fosters the most honest, open and reliable financial markets in the \nworld.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chairman for this opportunity to clarify \nsome of the provisions in this bill. I appreciate the Senator's help to \nensure that this bill recognizes that manufacturers and commercial \nentities were victims of this financial crisis, not the cause, and that \nit does not unfairly penalize them for using these products as part of \na risk-mitigation strategy.\n  It is time we shine a light on derivatives trading and bring \ntransparency and fairness to this market, not just for the families and \nbusinesses that were taken advantage of but also for the long-term \nhealth of our economy and particularly our manufacturers.\n\n\n                           Stable Value Funds\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, as chairman of the Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committee, the pensions community approached me \nabout a possible unintended consequence of the derivatives title of the \nDodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. They were \nconcerned that the provisions regulating swaps might also apply to \nstable value funds.\n  Stable value funds are a popular, conservative investment choice for \nmany employee benefit plans because they provide a guaranteed rate of \nreturn. As I understand it, there are about $640 billion invested in \nstable value funds, and retirees and those approaching retirement often \nfavor those funds to minimize their exposure to market fluctuations. \nWhen the derivatives title was put together, I do not think anyone had \nstable value funds or stable value wrap contracts--some of which could \nbe viewed as swaps--specifically in mind, and I do not think it is \nclear to any of us what effect this legislation would have on them.\n  Therefore, I worked with Chairman Lincoln, Senator Leahy, and Senator \nCasey to develop a proposal to direct the SEC and CFTC to conduct a \nstudy--in consultation with DOL, Treasury, and State insurance \nregulators--to determine whether it is in the public interest to treat \nstable value funds and wrap contracts like swaps. This provision is \nintended to apply to all stable value fund and wrap contracts held by \nemployee benefit plans--defined contribution, defined benefit, health, \nor welfare--subject to any degree of direction provided directly by \nparticipants, including benefit payment elections, or by persons who \nare legally required to act solely in the interest of participants such \nas trustees.\n  If the SEC and CFTC determine that it is in the public interest to \nregulate stable value fund and wrap contracts as swaps, then they would \nhave the power to do so. I think this achieves the policy goals \nunderlying the derivatives title while still making sure that we don't \ncause unintended harm to people's pension plans.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I share Chairman Harkin's concern about \npossible unintended consequences the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \nConsumer Protection Act could have on pension and welfare plans which \nprovide their participant with stable value fund options. These stable \nvalue fund options and their contract wrappers could be viewed as being \na swap or a security-based swap. As Chairman Harkin has stated, there \nis a significant amount of retirement savings in stable value funds, \n$640 billion, which represents the retirement funds of millions of \nhardworking Americans. One of my major goals in this legislation was to \nprotect Main Street. We should try to avoid doing any harm to pension \nplan beneficiaries. When the stable value fund issue was brought to my \nattention, I knew it was something we had to address. That is why I \nworked with Chairman Harkin and Senators Leahy and Casey to craft a \nprovision that would give the CFTC and the SEC time to study the issue \nof whether the stable value fund options and/or the contract wrappers \nfor these stable value funds are ``swaps'' or some other type of \nfinancial instrument such as an insurance contract. I think subjecting \nthis issue to further study will provide a measure of stability to \nparticipants and beneficiaries in employee benefit plans--including \nthose participants in defined benefit pension plans, 401(k) plans, \nannuity plans, supplemental retirement plans, 457 plans, 403(b) plans, \nand voluntary employee beneficiary associations--while allowing the \nCFTC and SEC to make an informed decision about what the stable value \nfund options and their contract wrappers are and whether they should be \nregulated as swaps or security-based swaps. It is a commonsense \nsolution, and I am proud we were able to address this important issue \nwhich could affect the retirement funds of millions of pension \nbeneficiaries.\n\n\n                              volcker rule\n\n  Mr. BAYH. I thank the Chairman. With respect to the Volcker Rule, the \nconference report states that banking entities are not prohibited from \npurchasing and disposing of securities and other instruments in \nconnection with underwriting or market making activities, provided that \nactivity does not exceed the reasonably expected near term demands of \nclients, customers, or counterparties. I want to clarify this language \nwould allow banks to maintain an appropriate dealer inventory and \nresidual risk positions, which are essential parts of the market making \nfunction. Without that flexibility, market makers would not be able to \nprovide liquidity to markets.\n  Mr. DODD. The gentleman is correct in his description of the \nlanguage.\n\n\n                            Event Contracts\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank Chairman Lincoln and Chairman Dodd for \nmaintaining section 745 in the conference report accompanying the Dodd-\nFrank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which gives \nauthority to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to prevent the \ntrading of futures and swaps contracts that are contrary to the public \ninterest.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Chairman Dodd and I maintained this provision in the \nconference report to assure that the Commission has the power to \nprevent the creation of futures and swaps markets that would allow \ncitizens to profit from devastating events and also prevent gambling \nthrough futures markets. I thank the Senator from California for \nencouraging Chairman Dodd and me to include it. I agree that this \nprovision will strengthen the government's ability to protect the \npublic interest from gaming contracts and other events contracts.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. It is very important to restore CFTC's authority to \nprevent trading that is contrary to the public interest. As you know, \nthe Commodity Exchange Act required CFTC to prevent trading in futures \ncontracts that were ``contrary to the public interest'' from 1974 to \n2000. But the Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000 stripped the \nCFTC of this authority, at the urging of industry. Since 2000, \nderivatives traders have bet billions of dollars on derivatives \ncontracts that served no commercial purpose at all and often threaten \nthe public interest.\n  I am glad the Senator is restoring this authority to the CFTC. I hope \nit was the Senator's intent, as the author of this provision, to define \n``public interest'' broadly so that the CFTC may consider the extent to \nwhich a proposed derivative contract would be used predominantly by \nspeculators or participants not having a commercial or hedging \ninterest. Will CFTC have the power to determine that a contract is a \ngaming contract if the predominant use of the contract is speculative \nas opposed to a hedging or economic use?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. That is our intent. The Commission needs the power to, \nand should, prevent derivatives contracts that are contrary to the \npublic\n\n[[Page S5907]]\n\ninterest because they exist predominantly to enable gambling through \nsupposed ``event contracts.'' It would be quite easy to construct an \n``event contract'' around sporting events such as the Super Bowl, the \nKentucky Derby, and Masters Golf Tournament. These types of contracts \nwould not serve any real commercial purpose. Rather, they would be used \nsolely for gambling.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. And does the Senator agree that this provision will \nalso empower the Commission to prevent trading in contracts that may \nserve a limited commercial function but threaten the public good by \nallowing some to profit from events that threaten our national \nsecurity?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. I do. National security threats, such as a terrorist \nattack, war, or hijacking pose a real commercial risk to many \nbusinesses in America, but a futures contract that allowed people to \nhedge that risk would also involve betting on the likelihood of events \nthat threaten our national security. That would be contrary to the \npublic interest.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I thank the Senator for including this provision. No \none should profit by speculating on the likelihood of a terrorist \nattack. Firms facing financial risk posed by threats to our national \nsecurity may take out insurance, but they should not buy a derivative. \nA futures market is for hedging. It is not an insurance market.\n\n\n                       collateralized investments\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I would like to engage Senator Lincoln, \nchairman of the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, in a \ncolloquy.\n  Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer \nProtection Act, which Chairman Lincoln was the primary architect of, \ncreates a new regulatory framework for the over-the-counter derivatives \nmarket. It will require a significant portion of derivatives trades to \nbe cleared through a centralized clearinghouse and traded on an \nexchange, and it will also increase reporting and capital and margin \nrequirements on significant players in the market. The new regulatory \nframework will help improve transparency and disclosure within the \nderivatives market for the benefit of all investors.\n  Under the bill, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC, and \nthe Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, are instructed to further \ndefine the terms ``major swap participant'' and ``major security-based \nswap participant.'' The definitions of major swap participant and major \nsecurity-based swap participant included in the bill require the CFTC \nand the SEC to determine whether a person dealing in swaps maintains a \n``substantial position'' in swaps, as well as whether such outstanding \nswaps create ``substantial counterparty exposure'' that could have \n``serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the United \nStates banking system or financial markets.'' The definition also \nencompasses ``financial entities'' that are highly leveraged relative \nto the amount of capital it holds, are not already subject to capital \nrequirements set by a Federal banking regulator, and maintain a \nsubstantial position in outstanding swaps.\n  I understand when the CFTC and SEC are making the determination as to \nwhether a person dealing in swaps is a major swap participant or major \nsecurity-based swap participant, it is the intent of the conference \ncommittee that both the CFTC and the SEC focus on risk factors that \ncontributed to the recent financial crisis, such as excessive leverage, \nunder-collateralization of swap positions, and a lack of information \nabout the aggregate size of positions. Is this correct?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Yes. My good friend from North Carolina is correct. We \nmade some important changes during the conference with respect to the \n``major swap participant'' and ``major security-based swap \nparticipant'' definitions. When determining whether a person has a \n``substantial position,'' the CFTC and the SEC should consider the \nperson's relative position in cleared versus the uncleared swaps and \nmay take into account the value and quality of the collateral held \nagainst counterparty exposures. The committee wanted to make it clear \nthat the regulators should distinguish between cleared and uncleared \nswap positions when defining what a ``substantial position'' would be. \nSimilarly where a person has uncleared swaps, the regulators should \nconsider the value and quality of such collateral when defining \n``substantial position.'' Bilateral collateralization and proper \nsegregation substantially reduces the potential for adverse effects on \nthe stability of the market. Entities that are not excessively \nleveraged and have taken the necessary steps to segregate and fully \ncollateralize swap positions on a bilateral basis with their \ncounterparties should be viewed differently.\n  In addition, it may be appropriate for the CFTC and the SEC to \nconsider the nature and current regulation of the entity when \ndesignating an entity a major swap participant or a major security-\nbased swap participant. For instance, entities such as registered \ninvestment companies and employee benefit plans are already subject to \nextensive regulation relating to their usage of swaps under other \ntitles of the U.S. Code. They typically post collateral, are not overly \nleveraged, and may not pose the same types of risks as unregulated \nmajor swap participants.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank the Senator. If I may, I have one additional \nquestion. When considering whether an entity maintains a substantial \nposition in swaps, should the CFTC and the SEC look at the aggregate \npositions of funds managed by asset managers or at the individual fund \nlevel?\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. As a general rule, the CFTC and the SEC should look at \neach entity on an individual basis when determining its status as a \nmajor swap participant.\n\n\n                         Swap Dealer Provisions\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today as a supporter of the Wall \nStreet Transparency and Accountability Act, but also as one who has \nconcerns over how the derivatives title of the bill will be \nimplemented. I applaud the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee for \nhis work on the underlying bill. At the same time, I am concerned that \nsome of the provisions in the derivatives title will harm U.S. \nbusinesses unnecessarily.\n  I would like to engage the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee \nin a colloquy that addresses an important issue. The Wall Street \nTransparency and Accountability Act will regulate ``swap dealers'' for \nthe first time by subjecting them to new clearing, capital and margin \nrequirements. ``Swap dealers'' are banks and other financial \ninstitutions that hold themselves out to the derivatives market and are \nknown as dealers or market makers in swaps. The definition of a swap \ndealer in the bill includes an entity that ``regularly enters into \nswaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own \naccount.'' It is possible the definition could be read broadly and \ninclude end users that execute swaps through an affiliate. I want to \nmake clear that it is not Congress' intention to capture as swap \ndealers end users that primarily enter into swaps to manage their \nbusiness risks, including risks among affiliates.\n  I would ask the distinguished chairman whether he agrees that end \nusers that execute swaps through an affiliate should not be deemed to \nbe ``swap dealers'' under the bill just because they hedge their risks \nthrough affiliates.\n  Mr. DODD. I do agree and thank my colleague for raising another \nimportant point of clarification. I believe the bill is clear that an \nend user does not become a swap dealer by virtue of using an affiliate \nto hedge its own commercial risk. Senator Collins has been a champion \nfor end users and it is a pleasure working with her.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we are poised to pass what some have \ntermed a ``sweeping overhaul'' of our Nation's financial regulatory \nsystem. Unfortunately, this legislation does little, if anything--to \ntackle the tough problems facing the financial sector, nor does it \ninstitute real, meaningful and comprehensive reform. This bill is \nsimply an abysmal failure and serves as yet another example of \nCongress's inability to make the choices necessary to bring our country \nback into economic prosperity.\n  What this bill does represent is a guarantee of future bailouts. In a \nrecent Wall Street Journal op-ed titled ``The Dodd-Frank Financial \nFiasco,'' John Taylor--a professor of economics at Stanford and a \nsenior fellow at the Hoover Institution--wrote:\n\n       The sheer complexity of the 2,319-page Dodd-Frank financial \n     reform bill is certainly\n\n[[Page S5908]]\n\n     a threat to future economic growth. But if you sift through \n     the many sections and subsections, you find much more than \n     complexity to worry about.\n       The main problem with the bill is that it is based on a \n     misdiagnosis of the causes of the financial crisis, which is \n     not surprising since the bill was rolled out before the \n     congressionally mandated Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission \n     finished its diagnosis.\n       The biggest misdiagnosis is the presumption that the \n     government did not have enough power to avoid the crisis. But \n     the Federal Reserve had the power to avoid the monetary \n     excesses that accelerated the housing boom that went bust in \n     2007. The New York Fed had the power to stop Citigroup's \n     questionable lending and trading decisions and, with hundreds \n     of regulators on the premises of such large banks, should \n     have had the information to do so. The Securities and \n     Exchange Commission (SEC) could have insisted on reasonable \n     liquidity rules to prevent investment banks from relying so \n     much on short-term borrowing through repurchase agreements to \n     fund long-term investments. And the Treasury working with the \n     Fed had the power to intervene with troubled financial firms, \n     and in fact used this power in a highly discretionary way to \n     create an on-again off-again bailout policy that spooked the \n     markets and led to the panic in the fall of 2008.\n       But instead of trying to make implementation of existing \n     government regulations more effective, the bill vastly \n     increases the power of government in ways that are unrelated \n     to the recent crisis and may even encourage future crises.\n\n  Mr. Taylor then goes on to highlight the many ``false remedies'' \ncontained in this legislation including the ``orderly liquidation'' \nauthority given to the FDIC--which effectively institutionalizes the \nbailout process. Other examples are the new Bureau of Consumer \nFinancial Protection, the new Office of Financial Research, and a new \nregulation for nonfinancial firms that use financial instruments to \nreduce risks of interest-rate or exchange-rate volatility.\n  In addition to the ``false remedies,'' the huge expansion of \ngovernment, and the outright power-grab by the Federal Government \ncontained in this so-called reform measure--recent press reports note \nthat this bill has also become the vehicle for imposing racial and \ngender quotas on the financial industry. Section 342 of this bill \nestablishes Offices of Minority and Women Inclusion in at least 20 \nFederal financial services agencies. These offices will be tasked with \nimplementing ``standards and procedures to ensure, to the maximum \nextent possible, the fair inclusion and utilization of minorities, \nwomen, and minority-owned and women-owned businesses in all business \nand activities of the agency at all levels, including in procurement, \ninsurance, and all types of contracts.''\n  This ``fair inclusion'' policy will apply to ``financial \ninstitutions, investment banking firms, mortgage banking firms, asset \nmanagement firms, brokers, dealers, financial services entities, \nunderwriters, accountants, investment consultants and providers of \nlegal services.''\n  The provision goes on to assert that the government will terminate \ncontracts with institutions they deem have ``failed to make a good \nfaith effort to include minorities and women in their workforce.''\n  Diana Furchtgott-Roth, former chief economist at the U.S. Department \nof Labor and senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, spotlighted the \ncontroversial section in an article on Real Clear Markets on July 8th. \nShe wrote:\n\n       This is a radical shift in employment legislation. The law \n     effectively changes the standard by which institutions are \n     evaluated from anti-discrimination regulations to quotas. In \n     order to be in compliance with the law these businesses will \n     have to show that they have a certain percentage of women and \n     a certain percentage of minorities.\n\n  This provision was never considered or debated in the Senate. I do \nnot think it is unreasonable to expect that such a major change in \ngovernment policy--indeed a complete shift from anti-discrimination \nregulations to a system of quotas for the financial industry--be fully \naired and debated by both Chambers before it is enacted.\n  Finally, let me return to Mr. Taylor's piece from the Wall Street \nJournal. Mr. Taylor added:\n\n       By far the most significant error of omission in the bill \n     is the failure to reform Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the \n     government sponsored enterprises that encouraged the \n     origination of risky mortgages in the first place by \n     purchasing them with the support of many in Congress. Some \n     excuse this omission by saying that it can be handled later. \n     But the purpose of ``comprehensive reform'' is to balance \n     competing political interests and reach compromise; that will \n     be much harder to do if the Frank-Dodd bill becomes law.\n\n  I could not agree more. It is clear to any rational observer that the \nhousing market has been the catalyst of our current economic turmoil. \nAnd it is impossible to ignore the significant role played by Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac. The events of the past 2 years have made it clear \nthat never again can we allow the taxpayer to be responsible for poorly \nmanaged financial entities who gambled away billions of dollars. Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac are synonymous with mismanagement and waste and \nhave become the face of ``too big to fail.''\n  During the debate on this financial ``reform'' bill, we heard much \nabout how the U.S. Government will never again allow a financial \ninstitution to become ``too big to fail.'' We heard countless calls for \nmore regulation to ensure that taxpayers are never again placed at such \ntremendous risk. Sadly, the conference report before us now completely \nignores the elephant in the room--because no other entity's failure \nwould be as disastrous to our economy as Fannie Mae's and Freddie \nMac's.\n  As my colleagues know, during Senate consideration of this bill, I \noffered a good, common-sense amendment designed to end the taxpayer-\nbacked conservatorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by putting in \nplace an orderly transition period and eventually requiring them to \noperate--without government subsidies--on a level playing field with \ntheir private sector competitors. Unfortunately that amendment was \ndefeated by a near-party-line vote.\n  The majority, however, did offer an alternative proposal to my \namendment. Was it a good, well thought out, comprehensive plan to end \nthe taxpayer-backed free ride of Fannie and Freddie and require them to \noperate on a level playing field with their private sector competitors? \nNope. It was a study. The majority included language in this bill to \nstudy the problem of Fannie and Freddie for 6 months. Wow! Instead of \ndealing head-on with the two enterprises that brought our entire \neconomy to its knees--the majority wants to study them for 6 more \nmonths.\n  According to a recent article published by the Associated Press, \nthese two entities have already cost taxpayers over $145 billion in \nbailouts and--according to CBO--those losses could balloon to $400 \nbillion. And if housing prices fall further, some experts caution, the \ncost to the taxpayer could hit as much as $1 trillion. And all the \nmajority is willing to do is study them for 6 months. It is no wonder \nthe American people view us with such contempt.\n  The Federal Government has set a dangerous precedent here. We sent \nthe wrong message to the financial industry: when you engage in bad, \nrisky business practices, and you get into trouble, the government will \nbe there to save your hide. It amounts to nothing more than a taxpayer-\nfunded subsidy for risky behavior and this bill does nothing to prevent \nit from happening all over again.\n  Again, I regret that I have to vote against this bill. I assure my \ncolleagues, and the American people, that if this were truly a bill \nthat instituted real, serious and effective reforms--I would be the \nfirst in line to cast a vote in its favor. But it is not. It serves as \nevidence of a dereliction of our duty and a missed opportunity to \nprovide the American people with the protections necessary to avert yet \nanother financial disaster. They deserve better from us.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have long worked for the continued \nviability of rural low-volume hospitals so that Medicare beneficiaries \nliving in rural areas in Iowa and elsewhere in the country will \ncontinue to have needed access to care.\n  Today, I want to discuss another concern, one regarding low-volume \ndialysis clinics in rural areas and the kidney dialysis patients they \nserve.\n  Congress enacted a new end-stage renal dialysis, ESRD, bundled \npayment system in the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers \nAct of 2008 that takes effect next year.\n  I support the establishment of a fully bundled payment system for \nrenal dialysis services.\n  It is intended to improve payments for ESRD services and to ensure \naccess\n\n[[Page S5909]]\n\nto critical renal dialysis services, including those in rural areas.\n  It will also improve the quality of care for dialysis patients by \nrequiring ESRD providers to meet certain standards through a new \nquality incentive program that is established for ESRD providers.\n  It establishes a permanent annual update for ESRD providers.\n  It also provides for payment adjustments in certain circumstances, \nsuch as payments for low-volume facilities and for dialysis facilities \nand providers in rural areas that need additional resources.\n  Last fall, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nissued a proposed rule to implement the new ESRD bundled payment \nsystem. That rule will be finalized later this year.\n  I am concerned that overall some of the proposed adjustments that \nreduce payments for dialysis treatment may be unduly low.\n  But today I want to focus on one issue in particular--the adjustment \nthat CMS has proposed for low-volume facilities.\n  The legislation that established this new bundled payment system \nspecifically requires CMS to adopt a payment adjustment of not less \nthan 10 percent for low-volume facilities to ensure their continued \nviability with other facilities.\n  The Secretary was given the discretion to define low-volume \nfacilities.\n  Unfortunately, CMS has proposed a very restrictive definition and set \nof criteria to qualify as a low-volume facility so the payment \nadjustment would only apply to facilities that furnish fewer than 3,000 \ntreatments a year.\n  According to CMS, ``the low-volume adjustment should encourage small \nESRD facilities to continue to provide access to care to an ESRD \npatient population where providing that care would otherwise be \nproblematic.''\n  CMS also notes that low-volume facilities have substantially higher \ntreatment costs.\n  Previously, CMS considered an ESRD facility with less than 5,000 \ntreatments a year to be small.\n  But now CMS is proposing to limit eligible ESRD facilities to those \nwith less than 3,000 treatments a year and requiring this limit to be \nmet for 3 years preceding the payment year, along with certain \nownership restrictions.\n  CMS has not proposed any geographic restriction that would limit the \nlow-volume payment adjustment to dialysis facilities in rural areas.\n  Medicare reimbursement is already problematic for small dialysis \norganizations because they operate on very low Medicare margins.\n  According to the March 2010 report of the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, MedPAC, large dialysis organizations have Medicare margins \nof 4.0 percent compared to other dialysis facilities with Medicare \nmargins of only 1.6 percent.\n  MedPAC also found that rural dialysis providers have Medicare margins \nthat average -0.3 percent compared to urban providers with positive \nmargins of 3.9 percent, and they expressed concern that the gap in \nrural and urban margins has widened.\n  They project that Medicare margins will fall from an aggregate 3.2 \npercent margin in 2008 to an aggregate 2.5 percent in 2010.\n  If corresponding declines are seen in rural areas, negative margins \nfor rural facilities will increase, and low-volume rural facilities \nwill be hit even harder.\n  And this projection does not take into account any of the additional \nreductions that CMS has proposed as part of the new bundled payment \nsystem even though these reductions would have a significant adverse \nimpact on small dialysis facilities.\n  Should the proposed restrictions on low-volume facilities be \nfinalized, the continued viability of these small dialysis facilities \nwill be questionable.\n  This will be especially true in rural areas, and beneficiary access \nto these critical dialysis services will be severely jeopardized.\n  Small rural dialysis clinics provide beneficiaries with end-stage-\nrenal disease access to critically-needed dialysis services in \nmedically underserved areas.\n  In some rural areas, a single clinic may be the only facility that \nfurnishes this life-sustaining care.\n  Should the unduly restrictive treatment limit for low-volume \nfacilities be finalized as proposed, small rural facilities with \nslightly higher treatment volumes will lose these essential low-volume \npayments.\n  Since rural dialysis facilities already face negative Medicare \nmargins, many are likely to close, further limiting access to crucial \ndialysis services that these kidney patients depend upon to survive.\n  New facilities would not be eligible for low-volume payments until \ntheir fourth year of operation under the proposed rule, making it \nunlikely that other facilities would take the place of those that had \nclosed.\n  The prospect of Medicare beneficiaries' losing access to these life-\nsustaining services is simply unacceptable.\n  I, therefore, urge CMS to modify the proposed restrictions for low-\nvolume adjustments by raising the treatment limit to the existing 5,000 \ntreatment definition for small rural dialysis facilities.\n  One of my constituents, Laura Beyer, RN, BSN, is the manager of \ndialysis at Pella Regional Health Center, a critical access hospital in \nrural Iowa. She has written an editorial about this problem and the \nfinancial crises that small outpatient dialysis facilities, such as \nPella Regional Health Center, are facing. Her editorial will be \nappearing in Nephrology News in July.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n   Will the New ESRD Bundle Cause the Death of Rural Hospital-Based \n                            Dialysis Units?\n\n       The new End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Bundled payment \n     system scheduled to begin in January, 2011 is expected to \n     create a financial loss for dialysis clinics across the \n     United States. According to the CMS Office of Public Affairs \n     (2009) ``MIPPA [Medicare Improvements for Patients and \n     Providers Act] specifically requires that the new system trim \n     two percent of the estimated payments that would have been \n     made in 2011 under the previous payment system'' (para.3). \n     Although this is of concern to all dialysis clinics, it is \n     particularly alarming to non-profit hospital based dialysis \n     units which are already operating at a loss.\n       These small hospital-owned dialysis clinics are simply \n     trying to provide a service to an underserved rural area. \n     Patients would have no option but to let ESRD claim their \n     lives because the resources are not available for them to \n     drive the extended distances to urban areas where dialysis \n     services are more available. Pella Regional Health Center \n     (PRHC), a Critical Access Hospital (CAH) in rural Iowa, \n     offers outpatient dialysis services. Robert Kroese, CEO of \n     PRHC stated, ``We choose to keep this dialysis clinic open \n     despite the financial liability to the hospital for one \n     reason only, people will have no choice but to die without \n     it. Our community needs this service.''\n       Currently hospital-based dialysis units represent 13.6 \n     percent of all dialysis facilities in the United States. \n     Facilities classified as rural only make up 4.4 percent. The \n     current CMS payment system defines a small facility as \n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5933-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5933-S5943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to state my \nposition on the nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States and to \ncomment about the appropriate role of the Senate, what is happening to \nthe doctrine of separation of powers, and how institutionally the \nSenate might assert itself to stop the erosion of powers from this body \nto the Court and from the Congress to the executive branch.\n  I am supporting Ms. Kagan because of her intellect, her professional \nbackground, her academic background, and because I think she will be an \neffective balance in the ideological battle which is being waged in the \nconference room of the Supreme Court--the ideological balance which is \nso sorely needed at the present time.\n  The hesitancy I have had, as I have expressed it in the hearings, has \nbeen on the failure of Ms. Kagan to respond with substantive answers so \nthat Senators would have a realistic idea as to where she stands \nphilosophically on some of the very important questions of the day--not \nhow she would decide cases but what standards she would apply if \nconfirmed, and I will be very specific about that.\n  It has been especially troublesome because Ms. Kagan has been \noutspoken in the past about the importance of having substantive \nanswers in nomination proceedings. She wrote a now-famous article for \nthe University of Chicago Law Review criticizing Supreme Court \nproceedings on nominations by saying that they were vacuous and a farce \nand by name criticized Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Justice Stephen \nBreyer for not answering questions and, in effect, criticized the \nSenate and Senators for not asking and pressing questions to find out \nwhere nominees stood. There was a similar article written by a young \nlawyer in Phoenix, AZ, named Bill Rehnquist, back in 1958, for the \nHarvard Law Record, where he criticized the confirmation proceeding of \nSupreme Court Justice Whittaker, saying that the Senate did not ask \nquestions about the important substantive matters. During the \nconfirmation of Chief Justice Rehnquist, I asked him a series of \nquestions which he declined to answer; I cited his own words, and then \nhe answered a few--not very many, just about enough to be confirmed. \nWhich has been my conclusion, generally, having been a party now to 13 \nconfirmation hearings. Nominees answer just about as many questions as \nthey think they have to.\n\n  When Justice Scalia came up for confirmation in 1986, he answered \nvirtually nothing. When the question came up about Marbury v. Madison, \nhe said: Well, I can't answer that question. It might come before the \nCourt.\n  May the Record show the look of amazement on the face of the \ndistinguished Senator from Minnesota who is presiding. I was frankly \namazed by it myself.\n  But, with the tenor of the times, following the very contentious \nnomination proceeding of Chief Justice Rehnquist, and other factors, \nJustice Scalia was confirmed handily, 98 to nothing.\n  I have seen him frequently at social events. I saw him at one a \ncouple of weeks ago. I commented to a group standing with him that \nprisoners of war give their name, rank, and serial number, but in the \nScalia nomination proceeding he would only give his name and rank. It \njust about amounted to that.\n  Following the hearing on Justice Scalia, Senator DeConcini and I were \nformulating a resolution which would establish standards that Senators \nwould insist on, or could insist on--some guidance to try to get more \nforthcoming answers. Then we had the confirmation hearing of Judge \nRobert Bork, who answered questions. Judge Bork did so in a context of \nhaving very extensive legal writings, an article in the Indiana Law \nJournal in 1971 on original intent. In the context of that article, and \nbooks, many speeches, law review articles, I think it is realistic to \nsay that Judge Bork had no alternative but to answer questions.\n  Since the Bork hearings, the pattern has evolved where nominees do \nnot give substantive answers. It is a well-known fact of confirmation \nlife that there are murder boards. That is what they call them, when \nthe nominee goes down to the White House and they have practice \nsessions. Since that time it has been pure prepared pablum. That is \nwhat we get in these hearings.\n  So there had been reason to expect more from Ms. Kagan. We didn't get \nit. I had expressed at the hearings the concern as to how we could get \nanswers on substantive issues and was there any way to find that out \nshort of voting ``no,'' and rejecting a nominee? I decided it would not \nbe sensible to vote no to issue a protest vote in the context of what \nhas regrettably become\n\n[[Page S5934]]\n\nthe standard. Ms. Kagan was following the accepted practice. Why not, \nin the face of that strong advice from the White House and the success \nof all of the nominees who have stonewalled and been confirmed?\n  I have since discussed with a number of my colleagues the prospect of \nreverting to what Senator DeConcini and I had thought about in early \n1987, to try to establish some standards. Not that Senators would be \nbound to follow them. We have our stature under the Constitution to ask \nquestions as we choose. We cannot compel answers. Perhaps they would \nnot be followed. But it could obviate one line of excuse that nominees \nhave given: They better not be too specific or they may breach the \nstandard of ethics. If the Senate were to establish standards as to \nwhat we were looking for, for confirmation--it is our constitutional \nrole--there might be some benefit.\n  In looking further, to try to make a determination on the Kagan \nnomination, there were two of her responses which I found impressive. \nOne was her comments about Justice Thurgood Marshall, for whom she had \nclerked, who was a role model. There was extensive testimony about her \nadmiration for the way he decided cases. I inferred from that, that \nlooking as best I could to find her philosophy, ideology, where she \nwould stand, that she would be protective of civil rights, protective \nof constitutional rights, of individual rights, and respectful of \nrights of the Congress.\n  The second line of answers which she gave which I thought--and I do \nthink--is very important is her very positive attitude about televising \nthe Supreme Court. I will come to that in a few minutes, because there \nis an urgent need to find some line to have some influence on the Court \nas to their following precedent on stare decisis, as to their \nrespecting the constitutional role of the Congress in fact finding. \nThey have judicial independence and are the bulwark of the Republic. \nThe rule of law is what makes the United States famous for the \nstability of our government and that is very highly prized. In the long \nhistory of this country, it has been the courts which have protected \ncivil rights. It was the Supreme Court, as we all know, in Brown v. \nBoard of Education, where the Court did what the Congress did not have \nthe political courage to do, nor did the President have the political \ncourage to do, to integrate schools in America--the best example but \nonly one example of where the courts have stood up as a bulwark to do \nwhat the elective branches have not had the political courage to do.\n  Now on to the specifics, as to the concerns on the substantive \nquestions to which Ms. Kagan did not give substantive answers. I \npressed her hard on the separation of powers. We all know of the three \nbranches of government. Congress was article I, thought by the Framers \nto be the most important; the executive, President, No. II; and the \nCourt, No. III. I think if the Constitution were to be rewritten today \nthe numbers would be changed. The Court would be No. I, and the other \nbranches would be a distant second and third, but again the executive \nwould be ahead of the legislative branch because of the way the Court \nhas interpreted the law.\n  Coming to the first line of legislative responsibility, it is fact \nfinding on which we make a determination of what ought to be enacted by \nway of public policy. The Supreme Court of the United States has \nchanged the rules of the game. For a long time it was a ``rational \nbasis'' test, to decide whether the record was sufficient for the \nlegislation which was enacted.\n  Then, in 1997, in a case captioned City of Boerne, the Supreme Court \nof the United States adopted a new standard: Was the evidence \nproportionate and congruent; the test of proportionate and congruent. \nThat test, with its fluidity, has been the basis for the Supreme Court \nlegislating, taking over from the Congress. Now it is the Supreme Court \nwhich decides the sufficiency of the record on a test which is not \ndiscernible with any specificity. Justice Scalia has called the test a \n``flabby test,'' which is used for judicial legislation. That was the \nfact in the case of United States v. Morrison, which tested at the time \nconstitutionality of legislation to protect women against violence and \nthere was, in the hearings leading to that important legislation, a \nmountain of evidence as described by Justice Souter in dissent. Yet the \nCourt overturned that important statute to protect women against \nviolence, citing the Congress's ``method of reasoning.'' It is a little \nhard to understand what that means. We are not perfect around here. \nThere are a lot of failures in this body, especially now--even some \nfailures across the Rotunda in the House of Representatives. But who \ncan challenge the method of reasoning and what miraculous occurrence is \nthere, when somebody leaves the hearing room of the Judiciary \nCommittee, walks across Constitution Avenue, across the green from this \nChamber, and suddenly is in a position to have some superior reasoning? \nBut that legislation went down, as has so much legislation.\n  Another illustration is in Citizens United, where a 100,000-page \nreport was amassed, detailing the problems with what goes on with money \nin politics and what the corrupting influence is. As a result, the \nMcCain-Feingold law was passed, and, in Citizens United, the critical \nsection was declared unconstitutional. So there you have a tremendous \nshift in power from the Congress of the United States to the courts, to \nthe Supreme Court. What we legislate on our traditional standards--we \nhave the institutional expertise, and I am going to come to that in \nsome greater detail in a few moments, analyzing the positions which \nhave been taken by Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito.\n  But first an analysis of a decisive shift from the power of the \nCongress of the United States to the executive branch, to the \nPresident. Here again I will be specific. Arguably the most dramatic \nhistoric confrontation between Congress and the President is the \nForeign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which establishes the exclusive \nway to invade privacy and get a wiretap contrasted with the Terrorist \nSurveillance Program, initiated by President Bush, for warrantless \nwiretapping.\n  It was a Friday in December of 2005. I chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee. We were in the final day on the reauthorization of the \nPATRIOT Act, and that morning the New York Times broke the information \nabout this secret program of warrantless wiretapping.\n  As it was expressed on the floor that day, Senators who had been \nprepared to vote to reauthorize the PATRIOT Act declined to do so. \nThere was an extended proceeding--which is not relevant to the specific \npoint I am making now. But back to the point, a Federal judge in \nDetroit declared the Terrorist Surveillance Program unconstitutional. \nThe case went on appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, \nwhich declined to hear the merits in a 2-to-1 decision on standing \ngrounds.\n  The petition for cert. to the Supreme Court to take the case was \ndenied, no reason given. The doctrine of standing is a very flexible \ndoctrine, which I think, in a practical sense, although inelegantly \nstated, accurately stated, it is the way the Court ducks a case if they \ndon't want to hear the case. It avoids a judicial decision. But any \nfair-minded reading of the dissenting opinion in the Sixth Circuit \nwould say there was plenty of room for a judicial decision, adequate \nbasis for standing in that case.\n  We currently have before the Judiciary Committee legislation on \nanother issue which illustrates the shift of power from the Congress to \nthe executive branch because of the failure of the Supreme Court to \ndecide a case, and that involves the litigation brought by survivors of \npeople killed on 9/11 against, among others, the Government of Saudi \nArabia, Saudi princes, and Saudi charities, litigation where there is \nan enormous factual record showing the connection between financing of \nal-Qaida and the Saudi charities, which are really instrumentalities of \nthe Saudi Government, and showing the financing from Saudi princes and \nfrom the government itself.\n  The Second Circuit denied the claim on what I think is a spurious \nground, saying that Saudi Arabia is not on the list of countries \ndeclared by the State Department to be terrorist states. Well, there is \nan alternative under the immunity statute, and that is for tortious \nconduct, that is wrongful actions. Certainly that would encompass \nflying a plane into a building. And Senator Schumer, Senator Lindsey \nGraham, and I have introduced legislation to clarify this issue.\n\n[[Page S5935]]\n\n  When an application was made for certiorari to the Supreme Court, the \nadministration opposed having the Supreme Court hear the case on the \nground that the acts by the Saudis in financing the terrorists occurred \noutside of the United States. That hardly is a rational basis when you \nplot in Saudi Arabia and pay money to bring terrorists to the United \nStates, to board airplanes, to hijack the planes to fly into American \nbuildings, to fly and crash in Pennsylvania, fly and crash into the \nPentagon. That certainly happened in the United States. It is arguably \nthe most barbaric conduct in the history of mankind, certainly among \nthe terrorists.\n  Now I mention these cases because when I pressed Ms. Kagan--and \nothers did--what standard would you apply? Going back to the \nfactfinding, the two standards are proportionate and congruent, \ncontrasted with rational basis.\n  Now, that is not asking a nominee to decide a case; that is asking a \nnominee to decide a standard--certainly well within the ambit of Ms. \nKagan's famous law review article in 1995. But she simply stated she \nwould not answer.\n  On the cases involving the terrorist surveillance program and on the \n9/11 litigation, would she grant to hear the case--not how she would \ndecide the case but would she take the case? Again, a refusal to answer \nthe question.\n  So in this context, we are really searching for ways to find out more \nabout the nominees, and Ms. Kagan has said just enough to get my vote \nbecause of voting my hopes, rather than my fears, that she will be in \nthe mold, as a general sense, of Justice Thurgood Marshall and also \nbecause of her position on television, which I think has the potential \nfor being a very ameliorating factor in what goes on in the Supreme \nCourt, and that is the business of publicity.\n  The famous article ``What Publicity Can Do'' by lawyer Louis D. \nBrandeis back in 1913 provides insights as to where we might go in the \nmodern world with television. In that article, Brandeis made the famous \nstatement that, ``Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants.'' \nWell, that may be a little strong for these circumstances. We are not \nexactly looking at it as a disinfectant, but neither was Brandeis, and \nhe was really talking about publicity as the way to deal with problems \nin our society. I believe that if we had publicity and people \nunderstood what was going on, there would be a realistic chance to have \nthe Court respect the powers of Congress and have the Court respect the \nseparation of power between the President and the Congress.\n  I now turn to the confirmation proceedings as to Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justice Alito, which bear very heavily on this subject. \nBoth of the nominees were questioned at length during the course of the \nnomination proceeding, and this is what Chief Justice Roberts testified \nto on the question of factfinding:\n\n       The reason that Congressional factfinding and determination \n     is important is because the courts recognize they can't do \n     that. The Supreme Court cannot sit and hear witness after \n     witness in a particular area and develop that kind of a \n     record. Courts can't make the policy judgments about what \n     type of legislation is necessary in light of the findings \n     that are made. The courts don't have it, Congress does. It is \n     constitutional authority. It is not our job.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       When the courts engage in factfinding, they are really, in \n     effect, legislating.\n\n  These are his exact words in the confirmation hearing:\n\n       As a judge, you may be beginning to transgress into the \n     area of making a law. That is when you are in a position of \n     reevaluating legislative findings because that doesn't look \n     like a judicial function.\n\n  This is what Justice Alito had to say in his confirmation hearing:\n\n       The Judiciary is not equipped at all to make findings about \n     what is going on in the real world, not this sort of \n     legislative findings. And Congress, of course, is in the best \n     position to do that. Congress can have hearings and examine \n     complex social issues, receive statistical data, hear \n     testimony from experts, analyze that and synthesize that and \n     reduce that to the findings.\n\n  These two Justices were in the five-person majority which disregarded \n100,000 pages of congressional findings to make a declaration that \nMcCain-Feingold was unconstitutional.\n  Then you had the similar issue of stare decisis.\n  The best way to limit judicial activism is by respecting what the \nCongress has done on factfinding, and when the Court disregards \ncongressional factfinding and substitutes its own judgment on policy, \nthey are making the law. That is conceded by the citations I have read.\n  Then there was extensive questioning of both Chief Justice Roberts \nand Justice Alito on the issue of stare decisis.\n  This is what Chief Justice Roberts had to say, in part, about stare \ndecisis:\n\n       I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you \n     overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in \n     promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough that \n     you may think the prior decision was wrongly decided.\n\n  Justice Alito said about the same thing, in part:\n\n       It is important--\n\n  That is, stare decisis is important--\n\n     because it limits the power of the judiciary. It is important \n     because it protects reliance interests.\n\n  These are two of a five-person majority which decided in Citizens \nUnited that McCain-Feingold was unconstitutional.\n  This is what Seventh Circuit Judge Richard Posner, a distinguished \njurist and a commentator on the Court, had to say about the role of \nChief Justice Roberts in these decisions, coming from his book ``How \nJudges Think'':\n\n       Less than two years after his confirmation, he demonstrated \n     by his judicial votes and opinions that he aspires to remake \n     significant areas of constitutional law. The tension between \n     what he said at his confirmation hearing and what he is doing \n     as a justice is a blow to Roberts's reputation for candor and \n     further debasement of the already debased currency of the \n     testimony of nominees at judicial confirmation hearings.\n\n  In going into these issues, as to the contrast between what Chief \nJustice Roberts and Justice Alito testified to and what they have done \nonce on the Court, I do not challenge their good faith. I understand \nthe difference between what happens in a judicial confirmation hearing \nand what happens in court when there is a case in controversy to be \ndecided by the Justices of the Supreme Court. But these variations are \nso stark that had there been an understanding by Senators on these \nconfirmation hearings as to the judicial philosophy and how factfinding \nwould be handled in court and how precedents and stare decisis would be \nhandled in court, to take the opinion by Chief Justice Roberts, his \nconcurring opinion in Citizens United where they disregarded the Austin \ncase as an ``aberration''--there is your license to eliminate stare \ndecisis: the case is an aberration, down the drain. So what happened to \nprecedent? Is Roe v. Wade safe based on that standard? I questioned \nChief Justice Roberts at length about Roe v. Wade and the successor \ncase, Casey, and how the case stood.\n  Austin was not reversed when the Supreme Court had an opportunity to \ndo so. Chief Justice Roberts says in his opinion: Well, nobody asked \nthe Supreme Court to reverse the Austin case. Well, the way the Court \nreached for the Hillary movie in Citizens United, the way they \nreconstructed the issue, you do not have to--it is a thin veneer to say \nthat the Court is guided and that it is determinant who raises an issue \nand who asked the Court for a decision.\n  What can be done to have Justices adhere to standards agreed to at \ntheir hearings? I spoke earlier about the sanctity of judicial \nindependence and how the Court is the bulwark of our Republic and the \nrule of law. The most promising idea that I have found is to \ndemonstrate to the public what the Court does, how powerful the Court \nis, and how it makes decisions on the cutting edge of all of the \njudgments in society. It decides who lives and who dies, a woman's \nright to choose. It decides on late-term abortion. It decides on the \ndeath penalty. It decides whether juveniles may be executed for crimes \ncommitted below the age of 18. It decides affirmative action, who goes \nto school, who gets into the best colleges, who gets a job. It decides \nassisted suicide. It decides cases of international law. It is the \nultimate arbiter on all the cutting-edge issues.\n  America is cited as being the most litigious country on the face of \nthe Earth, but there is not an understanding among the public as to how \nfar the power of the Supreme Court is,\n\n[[Page S5936]]\n\nhow they have taken it from the Congress, how they have let the \nexecutive branch take it from the Congress.\n  In an article published yesterday in the Washington Post, Stuart \nTaylor, Jr., a noted commentator on the Supreme Court, had some \ninteresting observations on this precise subject. This is what he wrote \nin part:\n\n       The key is for the Justices to prevent judicial review from \n     denigrating into judicial usurpation.\n\n  This goes right to the point of separation of powers, to defer far \nmore often to the elected branches. Well, that is the Congress. That is \nthe hue and cry. That is the question asked every time we have a \nconfirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee: Will you interpret the \nlaw rather than make the law? But these are matters where demonstrably \nthey make the law.\n  Then Taylor goes on to write:\n\n       . . . the justices know that as long as they stop short of \n     infuriating the public, they can continue to enjoy better \n     approval ratings than Congress and the President, even as \n     they usurp those branches' powers.\n\n  This is an interesting test, the first time I have seen it \narticulated this way. It is the ``infuriating the public test.'' \nWhatever you may say in a democracy, in our society, the public has the \nultimate power, and it is felt in many ways, perhaps even by osmosis. \nBut wherever you go, when the public attitude changes on segregation, \nthe Supreme Court changes the decision. When the public attitude \nchanges on sexual orientation, the Supreme Court's position changes on \nsodomy cases. When we find so many States recognize same-sex marriage, \nit is a change recognized by the courts, as the Massachusetts court \nrecently did in declaring the Defense of Marriage Act unconstitutional. \nIt wouldn't have happened when it was passed 86 to 14 in the Senate of \nthe United States in 1996. So how do we activate the doctrine of \n``infuriating the public''?\n  The best way, to my knowledge, is to televise the Court. In that \nmagnificent chamber across the green from where I stand, we have a room \nwhich seats about 300 people fighting to get in there for about 3 \nminutes. That is where the most important business of the country is \nbeing conducted. Years ago the Supreme Court decided that when it came \nto judicial proceedings newspapers had a right to be in the courtroom. \nThat same logic would give television cameras and electronic radio \nsimilar rights to inform the public. That was a case in 1940. Today the \ninformation is gleaned largely from television and, to a lesser extent, \nby radio. So if the public knew what was going on in the Supreme Court, \nif they understood it, there would be a chance that they would be a \nlittle more respectful of the constitutional doctrine of separation of \npowers.\n  When the case of Bush v. Gore was scheduled for argument, then-\nSenator Biden and I wrote to Chief Justice Rehnquist asking that \ntelevision cameras be permitted inside the courtroom. To get inside the \ncourtroom that day, one practically had to be on the Judiciary \nCommittee. It was packed. Americans should have been able to see it.\n  Surrounding the building on all sides were mobile television units. I \nam not sure exactly what they were doing. The most they could have \nwould be stand-ups outside the chamber because they couldn't get inside \nthe chamber. That day the Supreme Court did release an audio of the \nproceedings, which was a novelty at that time. They have done that \noccasionally since, but relatively rarely.\n  Mr. President, in the face of these factors, I have been pressing for \nmore than a decade for legislation to televise the Supreme Court. It \nhas come out of the Judiciary Committee, once 12 to 6, and, most \nrecently this year, 13 to 6, first, a legislative proposal which would \ncall for the Supreme Court to be televised and, second, a sense-of-the-\nSenate resolution urging the Supreme Court on its own to be televised.\n  I believe as a legal matter that the Congress has the authority to \nrequire the Supreme Court to be televised. I say that because it is an \nadministrative function. Congress has the authority to decide, for \nexample, how many Justices there will be on the Court, illustrated by \nthe famous Roosevelt Court packing plan where the effort was made to \nraise the number from 9 to 15 new faces to control the decision. The \nCongress by law establishes the number of Justices--six--for a quorum. \nThe Congress decides that the Court will begin its session on the first \nMonday in October. The Congress has set the time limits on habeas \ncorpus matters in the appellate system under the Speedy Trial Act. I \nthink a strong case--in fact, the appropriate conclusion--is that \nCongress has the authority to act in this field.\n  There are now cameras in the United Kingdom's Supreme Court. They are \nnow televised in Canada. They are now televised in many State supreme \ncourts. They are now televised in two Federal appellate courts.\n  A recent poll was conducted and released on the day of the start of \nhearings on Solicitor General Kagan. That poll, conducted by C-SPAN, \nshowed that 63 percent of the American people think the Court ought to \nbe televised. Among the 37 percent who said no, when they were told \nthat the proceedings are open to the public but people have to come to \nWashington to see them and can only stay for 3 minutes, most of those \nfolks decided they ought to have television.\n  So the number went from 63 to 85 percent of the American people who \nthink the Supreme Court ought to be televised. That is a pretty good \nindication that the Congress ought to act; that if the Supreme Court \nwill not open its doors on a voluntary basis, the Congress ought to \nrespond.\n  On recent nominations I have asked every nominee: What is your \nattitude on television? I was pleased. Both in the informal meeting \nwith Ms. Kagan and in her testimony before the Judiciary Committee, she \nsaid she was in favor of television; that the more information the \npublic has, the better off our society is. It is a pretty obvious \nconclusion, but she would press the issue if seated.\n  Another key factor in my affirmative vote for Ms. Kagan is her sense \nof humor, her quick wit, which she displayed. She was even almost a \nmatch for the distinguished junior Senator from Minnesota, who has had \nsome expert experience in that line. I think that will stand her in \ngood stead in the ideological battle in that small conference room \nwhere these big decisions are made.\n  Chief Justice Roberts said he would be open to the idea. Justice \nAlito testified he voted for it on the Third Circuit but would want to \nconfer with his colleagues. I believe Justice Breyer said in a hearing \non the budget in the House of Representatives a few months ago that \ntelevision was inevitable. Justice Ginsburg was quoted at one point as \nsaying that if it were gavel to gavel, it would be satisfactory. \nJustice Scalia has been negative about it most of the time because \nthere would only be snippets, but if some way could be found to have \ngavel to gavel so that it was not just a snippet, there may be some \nflexibility on his part.\n  It is an item whose time has come because, institutionally, we ought \nto be doing something about it in the Senate. Institutionally, we have \nthe responsibility to confirm. We aren't doing a very good job of \nfinding out what a reasonable understanding is of where these nominees \nare heading. While we are fiddling, our institutional power is burning. \nIf we lose much more of it, what we legislate to will not amount to a \ntinker's dam when the Supreme Court disagrees with our factual findings \nno matter how voluminous and solid they may be. What power is left is \ngoing to gravitate down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. So it \nis time to sit up and take notice.\n  Ms. Kagan quoted me in her 1995 Law Review article, saying that I \nsaid one day the Senate is going to have to stand up on its rear legs \nand reject a nominee. Well, now is not the right day, in my opinion, \nfor the reasons I have said.\n  One other point I want to make. I would ask how much time I have \nremaining, but I think a more appropriate question would be how much \ntime have I gone over?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator has consumed his \ntime.\n  Mr. SPECTER. What is the answer to my question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Seventeen minutes extra.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Extra?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n\n[[Page S5937]]\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 4 more \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Only one colleague is present. He is the congenial \njunior Senator from Florida. I thank my colleague.\n  I want to make one more point. That is on the issue of the Supreme \nCourt taking more cases. Here again, if there was transparency, America \nwould be outraged at the workload on the Supreme Court, as the Court \nhas moved from one clerk, to two clerks, to three clerks, to four \nclerks. And I do not begrudge them the time between the session ending \nin late June and the first Monday in October, where they travel and \nlecture and write books. But I am much concerned about the circuit \nsplits.\n  For anyone who may be watching on C-SPAN2--and I know my aunt and \nsister are watching--these cases are very important because if the \nThird Circuit, having Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware, decides a \ncase one way and the Ninth Circuit, governing the Western States, \ndecides it another way, and the case arises in Wichita, KS, nobody \nknows which precedent to follow because the circuits are autonomous.\n  There are many important cases which the Supreme Court does not \ndecide when there are circuit splits and they have time to decide them. \nThey have time to decide the conflict between the Foreign Intelligence \nSurveillance Act and the Terrorist Surveillance Program. They have time \nto hear the case involving the 9/11 terrorist attacks and sovereign \nimmunity.\n  But these are the statistics which are very informative: In 1886, the \nSupreme Court decided 451 cases. In 1987, the Supreme Court wrote 146 \nopinions. That was cut by less than half in 2006 to 68, in 2007 to 67, \nin 2008 to 75, 2009 to 73; this in the face of Chief Justice Roberts's \ntestimony at his confirmation hearing that the Supreme Court ought to \nhear more cases. Ms. Kagan said about the same thing. My recollection \nis that Justice Sotomayor said about the same thing.\n  So here, again, it is a matter of the public understanding it. We are \nvery conscious in this body about not missing votes. When I miss votes, \nit appears in the Philadelphia Inquirer or the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. \nThe public does not like to see Arlen Specter missing votes. I am paid \nto vote.\n  Well, you cannot vote on a case if you do not take a case. But having \nthe discretion not to take the case just leaves this level of workload \nwith circuit splits undecided, and this is something which ought to be \nhandled.\n  I have legislation pending to compel the Supreme Court to take, for \nexample, the Terrorist Surveillance Program litigation. Most people do \nnot know, but Congress cannot decide cases for the Court. The Congress \ncan mandate what cases they take, as we did the flag burning case, as \nwe did McCain-Feingold, and many other cases.\n  So it is my hope that when we confirm Ms. Kagan--and it looks like we \nwill confirm her--we will pause on the nomination proceedings and focus \non their utility, if not to get substantive answers to see what \nintellectual dexterity the nominee has, but providing an opportunity to \nreview what the Court is doing. We have to bone up on what happened \nsince the last nomination proceeding. I think the record is open to \nsubstantial question. I think those questions could be answered for the \nreasons I have given, if we move ahead with television.\n  Mr. President, in conclusion, I ask unanimous consent that a full \ncopy of the text of my prepared statement be printed in the Record with \nthese exact words so people will understand what I have said up until \nnow is repeated to some extent in the formal written statement. Mr. \nPresident, I refer my colleagues to the two letters which I wrote to \nChief Justice Roberts in anticipation of his nominating proceeding, \nthree letters I wrote to Justice Alito, three letters I wrote to \nJustice Sotomayor, and three letters I wrote to Ms. Kagan. All have \npreviously been printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak on the \n     nomination of Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be an \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     General Kagan comes before us with an impressive background. \n     She received her bachelor's degree summa cum laude from \n     Princeton University, her master's degree through a \n     prestigious fellowship at Oxford University, and her law \n     degree magna cum laude from Harvard Law School. She was a \n     clerk for Judge Abner Mikva of the DC Circuit and for Supreme \n     Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. She practiced law at a top \n     private firm, Williams & Connolly, and served as special \n     counsel on the Senate Judiciary Committee. General Kagan was \n     an associate White House counsel to President Bill Clinton \n     and Deputy Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy and \n     Deputy Director of the Domestic Policy Council. General Kagan \n     has taught constitutional and administrative law as a tenured \n     professor at two of the country's best law schools, Harvard \n     and the University of Chicago. A breaker of glass ceilings, \n     General Kagan became the first female Dean of Harvard Law \n     School and the first female Solicitor General of the United \n     States, in which capacity she argued six cases before the \n     Supreme Court. Given these extraordinary credentials, it is \n     little surprise that the American Bar Association's Standing \n     Committee on the Federal Judiciary gave General Kagan a \n     unanimous ``well-qualified'' rating.\n       One characteristic of General Kagan which, I think, is a \n     subtle but important trait is her sense of humor. She is a \n     real intellectual beyond any question. And I think that since \n     the Court is an ideological battleground, it is good to have \n     somebody there to go against the ideologues, like Justice \n     Scalia in particular. A sense of humor is, in my opinion, a \n     high level intellectual characteristic. General Kagan is very \n     good at humor. As I said in the hearing, that trait is very \n     much to her credit because it demonstrates that she's fast on \n     her feet and I suspect it will serve her well as she sits \n     with her colleagues at that intimate conference table and \n     casts her votes on cases of monumental import.\n       In addition to her impressive resume and quick wit, General \n     Kagan brings with her a striking show of support from lawyers \n     representing all points on the ideological spectrum. The \n     outpouring of accolades from conservatives includes the \n     testimony of Professor Jack Goldsmith of Harvard Law School, \n     a respected scholar whose own views are much closer to those \n     of Justice Scalia than to those of General Kagan. Professor \n     Goldsmith, who served in the Bush Department of Justice and \n     Department of Defense, had this to say about Elena Kagan:\n       Based on my experiences with Kagan, my reading of her \n     scholarly work, and my assessment of her very successful \n     legal career, I believe that she will be a truly outstanding \n     Supreme Court Justice. I urge this Committee to approve her \n     nomination and the entire Senate to confirm her.\n       Professor Goldsmith also testified to General Kagan's deep \n     knowledge of the areas of law which arise often before the \n     Court. ``As an academic,'' he explained, ``Kagan taught and \n     was expert in constitutional law, administrative law, First \n     Amendment law, civil procedure, and labor law. These subjects \n     constitute a large chunk of the Supreme Court's docket . . . \n     Elena Kagan is immensely qualified to serve on the Supreme \n     Court. She should be easily confirmed.''\n       Professor Goldsmith is not alone in his effusive praise for \n     General Kagan; many other conservatives have expressed strong \n     support for her confirmation. Miguel Estrada, a conservative \n     lawyer nominated to the D.C. Circuit by President Bush, wrote \n     in his letter of support that ``Elena possesses a formidable \n     intellect, an exemplary temperament and a rare ability to \n     disagree with others without being disagreeable . . . Elena \n     is an impeccably qualified nominee.''\n       Professor Michael McConnell, a constitutional law expert at \n     Stanford and a former Bush-appointed federal appellate court \n     judge, also speaks highly of General Kagan. He writes,\n       On a significant number of important and controversial \n     matters, Elena Kagan has taken positions associated with the \n     conservative side of the legal academy. This demonstrates an \n     openness to a diversity of ideas, as well as a lack of \n     partisanship, that bodes well for service on the Court . . . \n     Publicly and privately, in her scholarly work and her \n     arguments on behalf of the United States, Elena Kagan has \n     demonstrated a fidelity to legal principle even when it means \n     crossing her political and ideological allies.\n       This perspective is shared by conservative legal scholar \n     and former Judiciary Committee aide to Senator John Cornyn, \n     Professor Brian Fitzpatrick of Vanderbilt Law School. \n     Professor Fitzpatrick, who was General Kagan's student in \n     administrative law at Harvard, wrote: ``The best those of us \n     on my side of the aisle can hope for at this time are Supreme \n     Court nominees who are thoughtful and open minded, with views \n     nearer the center than the poles. There is little doubt that \n     Elena fits this bill. In my experience, her ideas have been \n     more than reasonable, and she has always treated those who \n     may disagree with her with respect and understanding.''\n       General Kagan has also received strong support from legal \n     scholars and practitioners with moderate or progressive \n     views. The depth of her bipartisan support is clear from a \n     letter written by eight former Solicitors General--five \n     Republicans, three Democrats. According to their letter, \n     Elena Kagan ``would bring to the Supreme Court a\n\n[[Page S5938]]\n\n     breadth of experience and a history of great accomplishment \n     in the law.'' Additionally, the former Chief Judge of the \n     D.C. Circuit and Carter appointee Patricia M. Wald wrote of \n     General Kagan,\n       She is an extraordinarily smart lawyer with a practical \n     bent of mind. Her significant exposure as a law clerk and \n     Solicitor General to the way in which courts of appeal as \n     well as the Supreme Court operate, to the thrust and parry of \n     dueling theories in the academy and finally to the competing \n     demands at the highest level of government policymaking \n     provide a broad spectrum of experience on which she can draw \n     in the important post of Justice.\n       The praises of Judge Wald, who served on the D.C. Circuit \n     while General Kagan worked there as a law clerk for Judge \n     Abner Mikva, are echoed by Kagan's colleagues from the world \n     of academia. The former Dean of Notre Dame Law School, \n     Professor Patricia A. O'Hara, wrote in her letter of support \n     that General Kagan ``possesses a powerful intellect . . . She \n     listens to the views of others, adds her own, exhibits \n     respect for differences of opinion, and cogently makes her \n     case.'' In addition, the deans of 56 law schools, including \n     the top schools in the nation, expounded on General Kagan's \n     personal attributes, intellectual prowess, and legal \n     experience, arguing for swift confirmation. They wrote,\n       Elena Kagan excels along all relevant dimensions desired in \n     a Supreme Court Justice. Her knowledge of law and skills in \n     legal analysis are first rate. Her writings in constitutional \n     and administrative law are highly respected and widely cited. \n     She is an incisive and astute analyst of law, with a deep \n     understanding of both doctrine and policy. In terms of \n     intelligence as intellectual ability, she is superbly \n     qualified to sit on the United States Supreme Court . . . She \n     was a superb and successful dean, among other reasons, \n     because of her willingness to listen to diverse viewpoints \n     and give them all serious consideration.\n       Prominent legal organizations also spoke out in favor of \n     General Kagan's nomination, including the American Bar \n     Association, the National District Attorneys Association, and \n     the National Association of Women Judges. The consensus among \n     these groups is that General Kagan is well-qualified for the \n     position of Supreme Court Justice. It should also be \n     mentioned that noted attorney and past President of the \n     American Bar Association Jerome Shestack wrote in favor of \n     General Kagan, saying that ``Our Court and nation will be \n     well served if Elena Kagan becomes a Justice of the Supreme \n     Court.''\n       General Kagan's diversity of experience--in private \n     practice, in academia, in the executive branch, and in \n     Congress as an aide to the Judiciary Committee--has clearly \n     cultivated in General Kagan a deep and penetrating \n     understanding of the impact of law on people's lives. By \n     practicing, teaching, and studying the law from a broad array \n     of perspectives, Elena Kagan has prepared herself well for \n     the work of an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       The Fourteenth Amendment (which prohibits states from \n     denying any person within their borders the equal protection \n     of the laws or depriving them of life, liberty, or property \n     with due process of law) and the Fifteenth Amendment (which \n     prohibits both the federal government and the states from \n     denying any citizen the right to vote ``on account of race'') \n     give Congress strong remedial power to enforce their \n     commands. It is critical that the Court not stand in the way \n     of its exercise. The enforcement of the amendments' \n     substantive provisions depends on whether private citizens \n     can enforce their rights against states in federal and state \n     courts. Whether they can depends, in turn, on whether \n     Congress can abrogate the states' Eleventh Amendment immunity \n     from suits by private parties. The Supreme Court has held \n     that Congress cannot abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity \n     under its Article I powers (including its Commerce Clause \n     powers). Only through its remedial powers under the \n     Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments can Congress do so.\n       Until 1997, the Court required no more of federal \n     legislation passed under the Fourteenth and Fifteenth \n     Amendments than that it satisfy a ``rational basis'' test. \n     That is same test that governs legislation enacted under \n     Congress's Article I powers, including its power to regulate \n     interstate commerce, as I noted during the hearing when I \n     cited Justice Harlan's 1968 Commerce-Clause decision in \n     Maryland v. Wirtz. As the Supreme Court explained in South \n     Carolina v. Katzenbach (1966), Congress could ``use any \n     rational means to effectuate the constitutional \n     prohibition[s]'' of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. \n     A strong presumption of constitutionality attended the \n     rational basis standard. With one anomalous  exception, every \n     civil rights statute of the twentieth century tested in \n     the Court under this rational basis standard was upheld as \n     a permissible exercise of Congress's remedial authority.\n       That all changed in 1997 with the Court's decision in City \n     of Boerne v. Flores. The Court there abandoned the rational-\n     basis test and, citing no precedent, held that ``there must \n     be congruence and proportionality between the injury to be \n     prevented or remedied and the means adopted to that end.'' \n     This worked a sea change in the relationship between Congress \n     and the Court. As Justice Scalia observed in Tennessee v. \n     Lane (2004), the ``congruence and proportionality standard, \n     like all flabby legal tests, is a standing invitation to \n     judicial arbitrariness and policy-driven decisionmaking. . . \n     . [I]t casts . . . [the Supreme] Court in the role of \n     Congress's taskmaster. Under it, the courts . . . must \n     regularly check Congress's homework to make sure that it has \n     identified sufficient constitutional violations to make its \n     remedy congruent and proportional.''\n       Wielding the congruence-and proportionality test, the Court \n     has, again in Justice Scalia's words, come into ``constant \n     conflict'' with Congress. It has, among other things, struck \n     down the provision of the Age Discrimination in Employment \n     Act that prohibits age discrimination in employment by states \n     (Kimel v. Florida Board of Regents (2000)), the provision of \n     the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibiting states from \n     discriminating against disabled persons in employment (Board \n     of Trustees of the University of Alabama v. Garrett (2001)), \n     and the provisions of the Violence Against Women Act that \n     created a federal civil remedy for the victims of gender-\n     based crimes against private parties (United States v. \n     Morrison (2000)). In Morrison, the Court refused even to \n     sustain the challenged provisions on the alternative ground \n     that Congress could prohibit gender-based crimes under its \n     Article I authority--long considered to admit of few, if any, \n     justiciable limitations--to regulate interstate commerce. \n     This was just the second time since the New-Deal era that the \n     Court struck down a federal statute on the ground that \n     Congress exceeded its Article I power to regulate commerce.\n       Of the few federal statutes that survived Constitutional \n     muster under the congruence-and-proportionality test, most \n     survived by only slim margins. Chief among them were the \n     provisions of the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) \n     governing state employment practices challenged in Nevada \n     Department of Human Resources v. Hibbs (2003). There was no \n     principled basis to uphold the FMLA in Hibbs but not, say, \n     the ADA in Garrett. The Court's post-Boerne cases illustrate, \n     as Justice Scalia has noted, that the congruence-and-\n     proportionality test often allows the Supreme Court to go any \n     which way and the Justices to indulge their own personal \n     policy preferences.\n       Most significantly, in applying the congruence and \n     proportionality test (and, in Morrison, in evaluating the \n     challenge statute's constitutionality under the Commerce \n     Clause), the Court has cast aside legislative findings \n     justifying remedial legislation as it has never before done. \n     Each of the cases striking down federal civil rights \n     legislation--including Kimel, Garrett, and Morrison--involved \n     extensive Congressional factual findings justifying the \n     legislation. The Court even went out of its way in Morrison \n     to disparage the ``method of reasoning'' that underlay \n     Congress's unassailable finding that gender-based crimes have \n     a substantial effect on interstate commerce. This prompted \n     Justice Souter, in a dissent joined by three other justices, \n     to decry the Court's long-standing practice of assessing no \n     more than the ``rationality of Congressional conclusions.'' \n     Justice Souter's criticism reflects the once-dominant view \n     that, in Laurence Tribe's words, only ``Congress has the \n     institutional competence,'' including the fact-finding \n     capabilities, to evaluate what practices threaten the \n     Fourteenth Amendment's guarantees.\n       General Kagan, it seems to me, acknowledged the crazy quilt \n     of decisions in cases where the Court was reviewing statutes \n     enacted through Congress's remedial authority under Section 5 \n     of the Fourteenth Amendment. Though she did not prejudge the \n     congruence-and-proportionality test by affirmatively labeling \n     it ``unworkable,'' she did go pretty far in repeating \n     criticisms of the test and in acknowledging that its \n     application is unfair to Congress.\n       While General Kagan was not as forthcoming as she ought to \n     have been, or as forthcoming as her law review article stated \n     nominees should be, she did do a better job of answering \n     questions than most nominees have done.\n       When I criticized Chief Justice Rehnquist's denigration of \n     Congress's ``method of reasoning'' in Morrison and asked ``do \n     you think there is some unique endowment when nominees leave \n     this room and walk across the street to have a method of \n     reasoning which is superior to [the] congressional method of \n     reasoning so that a court can disregard voluminous records \n     because of our method of reasoning?'' General Kagan replied, \n     ``Well, to the contrary . . . I think it's extremely \n     important for judges to realize that there is a kind of \n     reasoning and a kind of development of factual material more \n     particularly that goes on in Congress.'' She continued, ``I \n     think it is very important for the courts to defer to \n     congressional fact finding, understanding that the courts \n     have no ability to do fact finding, are not, would not \n     legitimately, could not legitimately do fact finding.'' \n     Furthermore, General Kagan said, ``I have enormous respect \n     for the legislative process. Part of that respect comes from \n     working in the White House and working with Congress on a \n     great many pieces of legislation.''\n       After contrasting Justice Harlan's test in Wirtz with the \n     congruence-and-proportionality test that Justice Scalia \n     criticized in Lane, I asked General Kagan, ``would you take \n     Harlan's test as opposed to the congruence and \n     proportionality test'' and she replied, ``Justice Scalia is \n     not the only person who has been critical of the test. A \n     number of people have noted that the test which is of course \n     a test relating to Congress' power to legislate under Section \n     5 of the Fourteenth\n\n[[Page S5939]]\n\n     Amendment, that the test has led to some apparently \n     inconsistent results in different cases.'' I followed up \n     stating, ``What I want to know from you is whether you think \n     that is an appropriate standard to replace the rational basis \n     test of Wirtz?'' General Kagan responded, ``Now . . . there \n     are times when the Court decides that a precedent is \n     unworkable. It just, it produces a set of chaotic results.'' \n     When I asked whether the congruence-and-proportionality test \n     was unworkable General Kagan testified, ``I think that the \n     question going forward, and it is a question, I'm not stating \n     any conclusion on it, but I think that something that Justice \n     Scalia and others are thinking about is whether the congruent \n     and proportionality test is workable or whether it produces \n     such chaotic results . . . .'' General Kagan further \n     testified that she knew ``that Congress needs very clear \n     guidance in this area. It is not fair to Congress to keep \n     moving the goal posts. It is not fair to say oh well, you \n     know, if you do this this time it will be okay but if you do \n     that the next time it won't.''\n       While General Kagan refused to say whether, if confirmed, \n     she would apply the congruence-and-proportionality standard \n     to test the constitutionality of remedial legislation enacted \n     under the Fourteenth Amendment, she did at least express \n     serious reservations about that standard. She noted that the \n     standard had been subject to ``significant criticism'' and, \n     more importantly, that ``it's produced some extremely erratic \n     results.'' She added: ``There seems to me real force in the \n     notion that a test in this area dealing with Congress' \n     section 5 powers [under the Fourteenth Amendment] really \n     needs to provide clear guideposts to Congress so that \n     Congress knows what it can do and know what it can't do. And \n     so the goal posts don't keep changing and so . . . Congress \n     can . . . pass legislation confident in the knowledge that \n     legislation will be valid. And I think those concerns are of \n     very significant weight.'' None of General Kagan's \n     predecessors (Justice Sotomayor, Justice Alito, and Chief \n     Justice Roberts)--all of whom I questioned about Congress's \n     Fourteenth-Amendment powers--was as forthcoming. General \n     Kagan also said that Congressional fact findings are entitled \n     to ``great deference.''\n       When I later returned to the question of whether Justice \n     Kagan would apply a rational basis test or a congruence-and-\n     proportionality test when reviewing congressional facts \n     General Kagan replied, ``as I understand it, the congruence \n     and proportionality test is currently the law of the [C]ourt, \n     and notwithstanding that, its been subjected to significant \n     criticism and notwithstanding that its produced some \n     extremely erratic results. And I can't . . . sit at this \n     table without briefing, without argument, without discussion \n     with my colleagues and say, well, I just don't approve of \n     that test, I would reverse it.''\n       When I cited Justice Stevens' dissent in Citizens United \n     and asked General Kagan ``what deference [she] would show to \n     congressional fact finding'' she replied, ``the answer to \n     that is great deference to congressional fact finding.'' When \n     I asked General Kagan if there was ``any way you could look \n     at Citizens United other than it being a tremendous jolt to \n     the system'' she replied, ``this is one that as an advocate, \n     I have taken a strong view on which is that it was a jolt to \n     the system. There was a great deal of [reliance] interests \n     involved and many states had passed pieces of legislation in \n     reliance upon Austin that Congress had passed legislation \n     after accumulating a voluminous record.''\n       I also asked General Kagan about cases regarding Sovereign \n     Immunity and Federal Court Jurisdiction. One of the two cases \n     involving the jurisdiction of the federal courts was Weiss v. \n     Assicurazioni Generali, S.P.A., 529 F.3d 113 (2d Cir. 2010). \n     It was brought by victims of the Holocaust and their heirs to \n     recover on unpaid World War II-era insurance policies \n     issued by an Italian insurance company. Just a few months \n     ago, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second \n     Circuit affirmed the dismissal of the plaintiffs' claims \n     on the ground that they were preempted by an Executive-\n     branch foreign policy favoring the resolution of such \n     claims through an international commission. The Second \n     Circuit did so in reliance on the Supreme Court's 2003 \n     decision in American Insurance Association v. Garamendi. \n     There the Court held that this policy, though not \n     formalized in an executive agreement (let alone a Senate-\n     ratified treaty), preempted a state law requiring insurers \n     to disclose information about certain Holocaust-era \n     insurance policies. Among the important questions \n     presented by Generali is whether the executive branch can \n     shut the courthouse doors on litigants in the absence of \n     Congressional authorization. I asked General Kagan \n     whether, if confirmed, she would vote to grant cert. in \n     the Holocaust case and she replied, ``this is difficult \n     for me because, as I understand this, this is a live case \n     and I continue to represent one of the parties in this \n     case. In other words, there may very well be a petition \n     for certiorari in this case, but I continue to be \n     Solicitor General and--and would head the office that \n     would have to respond to a petition.''\n       The other case involving the jurisdiction of the federal \n     court was In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 538 \n     F.3d 113 (2d Cir. 2009). This litigation was brought by over \n     6,000 victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks against, \n     among other defendants, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and five \n     Saudi princes. The plaintiffs asserted various claims arising \n     from their allegation that Saudi Arabia financed the attacks. \n     The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \n     ruled that Saudi Arabia was immune from suit under the \n     Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA). In a brief filed on \n     behalf of the United States, Solicitor General Kagan urged \n     the Court not to hear the case even though she conceded that \n     the Second Circuit had effectively nullified the key \n     statutory exception to sovereign immunity on which the \n     plaintiffs had relied. I raised the case at Solicitor General \n     Kagan's confirmation hearing because of the key objective \n     underlying the FSIA: to take sovereign immunity \n     determinations away from the executive branch (which until \n     enactment of the FSIA had made discretionary immunity \n     determinations on case-by-case basis) and vest them the \n     courts (which would make immunity determinations according to \n     the FSIA's objective, non-discretionary statutory criteria). \n     I asked General Kagan, ``As a justice, would you vote to take \n     that kind of case?'' General Kagan responded, ``the \n     government did argue, based on very extensive consultations, \n     that the Supreme Court ought not to take that case, and that \n     continues to be the government's position. You know, I don't \n     think it would be right for me to undermine the position that \n     we took in that way by suggesting it was wrong.''\n       Another case I raised with Solicitor General Kagan \n     concerned the constitutionality of the Bush Administration's \n     secretive Terrorist Surveillance Program (TSP). The TSP \n     brought into sharp conflict Congress's authority under \n     Article I to establish the `exclusive means' for wiretaps \n     under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act with the \n     President's authority under Article II as Commander-in-Chief \n     to order warrantless wiretaps. The TSP operated secretly from \n     shortly after September 11, 2001, until December 2005, when \n     The New York Times exposed the existence of the program. In \n     August 2006, the United States District Court for the Eastern \n     District of Michigan found the program to be \n     unconstitutional. In July 2007, the Sixth Circuit reversed on \n     the ground that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue. One \n     judge on the three-judge panel , Judge Gilman, dissented. \n     Judge Gilman noted that ``the attorney-plaintiffs in the \n     present case allege that the government is listening in on \n     private person-to-person communications that are not open to \n     the public. . . . [T]he attorney-plaintiffs have thus \n     identified concrete harms to themselves flowing from their \n     reasonable fear that the TSP will intercept privileged \n     communications between themselves and their clients.'' The \n     Supreme Court denied certiorari without explanation. I asked \n     her about the Court's reticence to take up the Sixth \n     Circuit's decision in the Terrorist Surveillance Program \n     (TSP) case and General Kagan testified, in part, ``In a case \n     where the executive branch is determined or is alleged, \n     excuse me, is alleged to be violating some congressional \n     command, it is I think one of the kinds of cases that the \n     [C]ourt typically should take.'' She called this a third \n     specie of case, aside from circuit splits and those that \n     strike down statutes on constitutional grounds, where there \n     ``is an issue of some vital national importance.''\n       I later asked her ``would you vote to take that kind of \n     case?'' General Kagan responded, in pertinent part, ``Well . \n     . . I do think that this is a case that, as I understand it, \n     generally falls within the third category of case, a case \n     which presents an extremely important Federal issue as to \n     whether the executive has overstepped its appropriate \n     authority and has essentially flouted legislation in the \n     area.''\n       When I referenced the Court's declining docket and the need \n     to resolve more circuit splits of authority, General Kagan \n     responded, ``I do generally agree with that. I clerked on the \n     [C]ourt in 1987 which was pretty much at the high point of \n     what the [C]ourt was doing, about 140 cases a year.'' She \n     went on to testify, ``I do agree with you that there do seem \n     to be many circuit conflicts and other matters of vital \n     national significance.''\n       Although General Kagan failed, in many instances, to adhere \n     to her own standard of providing forthcoming and detailed \n     answers during her confirmation hearing, there is much that \n     we can glean from her record prior to her nomination. Since \n     nominees have a vested interest in saying whatever will get \n     them confirmed, and since past nominees have not always \n     decided cases in line with their testimony at nomination \n     hearings, in many ways a nominee's prehearing record is \n     more reliable than her confirmation hearing testimony.\n       While General Kagan refused to say whether, if confirmed, \n     she would apply the congruence-and-proportionality standard \n     to test the constitutionality of remedial legislation enacted \n     under the Fourteenth Amendment her pre-hearing record on the \n     issue, though limited, strongly suggests that she shares my \n     concerns about the denigration of Congressional power. I \n     refer to her notes of two (un-transcribed) speeches she gave \n     in 2003 (one to Princeton alumni) the other to an audience at \n     the University of Minnesota Law School). The notes suggest \n     that, contrary to the position taken by Justices Kennedy, \n     Scalia, and Thomas, as well as former Chief Justice Rehnquist \n     and Justice O'Connor, General Kagan believes that the Court \n     should give Congress substantial deference, especially when \n     legislating under its Fourteenth Amendment authority. In a \n     May 21,\n\n[[Page S5940]]\n\n     2010, article, The Wall Street Journal characterized General \n     Kagan's views as expressed in one of the speeches as follows: \n     ``The piece, in short, seems to suggest that in at least one \n     key area, she would be an arbiter of judicial restraint, \n     prone to giving considerable deference to Congress. . . . \n     [S]he says [that] courts should defer to Congress when the \n     framer of the Constitution clearly authorized legislators to \n     exercise power. Such a clear authorization, she says, can be \n     found in section 5 of the 14th Amendment. . . . So, Kagan \n     concludes, courts should defer to Congress when it takes \n     actions to effectuate 14th Amendment rights.'' As I said \n     during my June 7, 2010, floor statement on the confirmation \n     process, the Senate should put considerable weight on such \n     pre-hearing statements reflecting a nominee's legal ideology.\n       It is also clear that General Kagan is a strong and \n     principled supporter of civil rights. As Harvard Professor \n     Ronald Sullivan pointed out in his testimony before the \n     Committee, a telling story about General Kagan is that she \n     turned down the Royall Professorship of Law, Harvard Law \n     School's first endowed chair, because the fortune that \n     endowed the chair was derived from the slave trade. Instead, \n     then-Dean Kagan decided to become the first Charles Hamilton \n     Houston Professor of Law, a chair named in honor of one of \n     Harvard Law's most accomplished African-American graduates \n     and, as an architect of the civil rights movement's legal \n     strategy, an historic figure in his own right.\n       Elena Kagan's support for civil rights extends far beyond \n     symbolism, however. In an email from her time at the Clinton \n     White House, General Kagan wrote that she ``care[s] about \n     [affirmative action] a lot,'' which she demonstrated through \n     her work on the issue. For example, in a brief to then-\n     Solicitor General Walter Dellinger strategizing how to \n     ``avoid a broad and harmful ruling invalidating non-remedial \n     affirmative action in employment,'' General Kagan argued in \n     favor of pursuing a narrow judgment which would preserve \n     affirmative action policies. She wrote, ``I think this is \n     exactly the right position--as a legal matter, as a policy \n     matter, and as a political matter.'' This echoes her comments \n     to Justice Thurgood Marshall in a memo urging denial of \n     certiorari on a case involving a school desegregation plan \n     which had been upheld at the circuit court level. In her \n     memo, Kagan described the plan as ``amazingly sensible,'' \n     even though it was not implemented in response to historic \n     state-sponsored school segregation in that particular \n     district. It is clear to me from these memos and from her \n     comments that when it comes to civil rights, General Kagan \n     supports strong protections for racial minorities and \n     believes in expanding opportunities for historically \n     disadvantaged groups. If General Kagan were seated on the \n     Court, cases like Parents Involved in Community Schools v. \n     Seattle School District No. 1 may have been decided \n     differently.\n       Additionally, General Kagan's record reveals strong support \n     for ensuring fair and clean elections through campaign \n     finance regulation. Long before she urged the Court in \n     Citizens United v. FEC to uphold the federal ban on \n     independent campaign expenditures by corporations, Elena \n     Kagan assisted the development of the McCain-Feingold Act \n     during her time in the White House. In one of her memos from \n     that time, she argued vigorously for President Clinton to \n     support campaign finance reform and criticized the Court for \n     its ``mistaken'' conclusion ``that money is speech and that \n     attempts to limit the influence of money on our political \n     system therefore raise First Amendment problems.'' She argued \n     not only that the Court should uphold campaign finance \n     regulation on the basis of the compelling government interest \n     in preventing corruption or the appearance of corruption, she \n     also argued that the Court should reexamine the basis for its \n     rejection of expenditure regulations beginning with Buckley \n     v. Valeo in 1976. Although she may have made some of these \n     arguments in her capacity as a policy advisor and advocate \n     for the President's agenda, these memos provide insight into \n     General Kagan's views of campaign finance reform--views which \n     appear to be positive in terms of both personal preference \n     and legal analysis.\n       General Kagan's time as a senior aide to President Clinton \n     also shows that she has respect for Congress, respect born of \n     personal experience and legal reasoning. Although some from \n     my party have expressed concern that General Kagan has too \n     broad a view of executive power, her writings indicate \n     otherwise. She has clearly and unequivocally rejected the \n     Unitary Executive theory, which posits the President \n     possesses plenary authority over all federal agencies \n     involved in administering federal law and that Congress had \n     been granted too much power relative to the executive. In her \n     famous 2001 Harvard Law Review article, Presidential \n     Administration, she wrote, ``I do not espouse the Unitarian \n     position . . . the constitutional values sometimes offered in \n     defense of this claim are too diffuse, too diverse, and for \n     these reasons, too easily manipulable'' to support exclusive \n     presidential control over the administration of federal law \n     through agencies. Additionally, then-Dean Kagan criticized \n     the expansive views of executive authority in the so-called \n     torture memos of the Bush administration, which she described \n     in a 2007 commencement address as ``expedient and \n     unsupported.'' General Kagan also criticized expanding \n     executive power to the detriment of Congressional prerogative \n     when she wrote in a 1996 White House memo on a pending \n     decision on whether or not the Solicitor General would defend \n     two particular statutes. She wrote:\n       What difference does it really make whether Congress \n     explicitly directs the executive branch to take action \n     against private persons (via separation) or implicitly \n     directs the executive branch to take such action (via \n     prosecution)? In either case, refusal to comply with the \n     directive violates congressional will.\n       In light of these writings, it seems not only General \n     Kagan's personal opinion but also her legal opinion that \n     Congress has a powerful role to play vis-a-vis the executive \n     and the courts. Finally, General Kagan's experience working \n     with Congress and on the Senate Judiciary Committee also \n     increases my confidence in her understanding and respect for \n     this institution as the first branch of American government.\n       General Kagan has been clear and straightforward on the \n     issue of making the Supreme Court more accessible and more \n     accountable by televising its proceedings for the public. In \n     her 2009 speech before the Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference, \n     she expressed support for televising the Court. When I met \n     with General Kagan in my office, she continued to be \n     forthcoming about her support for broadcasting the Court's \n     proceedings, which I appreciated. I asked General Kagan \n     ``Wouldn't televising the [C]ourt and information as to what \n     the [C]ourt does have an impact on the values which are \n     reflected in the American people'' and she replied, ``I do \n     think . . . it would be a good thing from many perspectives \n     and I would hope to if I am fortunate enough to be confirmed \n     to engage with the other Supreme Court Justices about that \n     question. I think it is always a good thing when people \n     understand more about government rather than less and \n     certainly the Supreme Court is an important institution and \n     one that the American citizenry has every right to know about \n     and understand. I also think that it would be a good thing \n     for the [C]ourt itself that that greater understanding of the \n     [C]ourt I think would go down to its own advantage. So I \n     think from all perspectives, televising would be a good \n     idea.''\n       I have introduced both a resolution expressing the sense of \n     the Senate that Supreme Court proceedings should be \n     televised, as well as a bill to require the Court to allow \n     the television broadcast of its open proceedings, except in \n     some special circumstances. The Judiciary Committee passed \n     both the resolution and the bill on April 29, 2010, by an \n     overwhelming vote of 13 to 6. With the retirement, last year, \n     of Justice Souter, the strongest opponent of televising the \n     Court's proceedings, and the potential addition of General \n     Kagan, there is a good chance that the Court will finally be \n     accessible to all Americans, as it should be. If the Court \n     does not allow cameras in of its own volition, I will \n     continue to press for passage of my legislation before the \n     end of the year.\n       Regardless of personal political persuasion, there is near \n     consensus among Senators that a nominee should be able to \n     unmoor herself from political and policy views when deciding \n     a case in our nation's highest court. In her 25 years of \n     experience in the law, General Kagan has consistently \n     demonstrated fairness, humility, moderation, and adherence to \n     duty--the exact attributes we all seek in a Justice of the \n     Supreme Court of the United States.\n       In my first autobiography, Passion for Truth, I wrote:\n       Chief Justice William Rehnquist, at his 1986 confirmation \n     hearing, would not answer basic constitutional questions. \n     Rehnquist, an associate justice since 1971, didn't believe he \n     should have to go before the Senate a second time for \n     promotion to chief, according to Tom Korologos, a premier \n     Washington lobbyist.  . . . Rehnquist cited Korologos the \n     case of former Senator Sherman Minton, whom President Truman \n     nominated to the Supreme Court and who refused to go before \n     the Senate for a hearing. Minton argued that the legislative \n     branch had no right to question a nominee. The Senate \n     confirmed Minton without a hearing. ``What do you think of \n     that?'' Rehnquist asked Korologos. ``Why do I have to \n     testify?'' he demanded. Rehnquist's record was there; his \n     opinions were public. He would not expand on them or defend \n     them. Rehnquist insisted Korologos try to get him through \n     without a hearing. ``I said, `Fine, Bill,' and dismissed it \n     out of hand,'' Korologos recalled. . . . ``What am I going to \n     do, tell the leadership we're not going to have a hearing on \n     Rehnquist? Anyway, it died before it got off the ground.'' \n     [Korologos continued]. Rehnquist relented and agreed to go \n     before the Senate.\n       I further observed that ``Chief Justice Rehnquist answered \n     barely enough questions to get my vote. In all, sixty-five \n     senators supported him, but thirty-three others voted against \n     his nomination.'' Turning to Judge Robert Bork's nomination \n     in July 1987, I noted that Democrats controlled the Senate \n     and Senator Kennedy was a strong opponent of the nomination. \n     ``Considering the context and controversy, Bork concluded--\n     correctly, I think--that he would have to answer questions on \n     judicial philosophy to have a chance at confirmation.'' \n     Perhaps General Kagan concluded--again correctly--that with a \n     Democratic Senate and little controversial published work of \n     her own, she would be confirmed without betraying many of her \n     substantive views. I regret that she chose that course but it \n     is a course many before her have chosen and it is a course \n     that the Senate has permitted.\n\n[[Page S5941]]\n\n       When I was questioning Rehnquist he refused to answer my \n     question about stripping the federal courts' jurisdiction. He \n     deflected my question, stating ``I feel I cannot go to any \n     further than that, for fear that that sort of issue will come \n     before the Court.'' When I pressed him, Rehnquist insisted, \n     ``I honestly feel I must adhere to my view that it would be \n     improper for a sitting justice to try to advance an answer to \n     that question.''\n       I describe in my book that during an overnight recess, when \n     the hearing continued, a staffer brought me an article from \n     the Harvard Law Record that Rehnquist had written in 1959, \n     when he was a practicing lawyer. The article criticized \n     Charles Whittaker's nomination to the Supreme Court because \n     Whittaker had essentially told the Senate only that he was \n     the son of two states, that he had been born in Missouri and \n     practiced law in Kansas. Much like General Kagan in her 1995 \n     law review article, Rehnquist, in his Harvard article, \n     expressed outrage that the Senate had endorsed Whittaker \n     without asking him any substantive questions, writing that \n     ``Until the Senate restores its practice of thoroughly \n     informing itself on the judicial philosophy of a Supreme \n     Court nominee before voting to confirm him, it will have a \n     hard time convincing doubters that it could make effective \n     use of any additional part in the selection process.'' The \n     next day I confronted Justice Rehnquist with his article and \n     his own words twenty-seven years later. Rehnquist responded \n     ``I don't think I appreciated, at the time I wrote that, the \n     difficult position the nominee is in.''\n       Following that admission, I pressed Rehnquist on \n     jurisdiction and he finally answered that Congress cannot \n     take away jurisdiction from the Supreme Court on the First \n     Amendment. He refused, however, to answer questions regarding \n     the Fourth Amendment (search and seizure), the Fifth \n     Amendment (privilege against self-incrimination), the Sixth \n     Amendment, the Eighth Amendment (cruel and unusual \n     punishment), or even his reasoning for answering a question \n     regarding the first amendment but not the others.\n       While I do not condone General Kagan's change of view on \n     how much a nominee should answer, she is not the first \n     nominee to criticize the Senate for not insisting on \n     substantive answers and then later change her mind when she \n     is a Supreme Court nominee. We confirmed Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist after he disclaimed his statements in the Harvard \n     article, so there is no reason, at this point, not to do the \n     same for General Kagan.\n       I have never asked that a nominee satisfy an ideological \n     litmus test--whether liberal or conservative--much less that \n     a nominee commit to reaching a particular certain outcome in \n     any given case. What I have asked is that a nominee, first, \n     affirm his or her commitment to the doctrine of stare \n     decisis; and, second, to honor the legislative powers the \n     Constitution assigns to the Congress, especially its remedial \n     powers to enforce the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments.\n       Nominees committed to stare decisis and respectful of \n     Congress's lawmaking powers are much less likely to indulge \n     their ideological preferences--whether left or right--in \n     interpreting the open-ended provisions of the Constitution \n     and federal statutes to which very different meanings could \n     be ascribed. They are, in short, less likely to become \n     activists. Noted Court commentator Jeffrey Rosen made just \n     that point soon before the Roberts confirmation hearing. He \n     said that the ``best way'' to find out whether Chief Justice \n     Roberts was a conservative activist (in the mold of Justice \n     Scalia and Thomas) or a moderate, cautious, and restrained \n     conservative (in the mold of Justice O'Connor) would be ``to \n     explore Judge Roberts's view of precedents, which the lawyers \n     call stare decisis, or `let the decision stand.' '' (``In \n     Search of John Roberts,'' The New York Times, July 21, 2005.)\n       That is why when I questioned Roberts and Alito in 2005 and \n     2006, respectively, I focused heavily on the issue of stare \n     decisis. Several other Senators did as well. Both Chief \n     Justice Roberts and Justice Alito provided extensive \n     testimony on the subject. Their testimony warrants extensive \n     quotation.\n       Chief Justice Roberts testified:\n       ``Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the rules, \n     they apply them. The role of an umpire and a judge is \n     critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules, but it \n     is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a ball game to see the \n     umpire. Judges have to have the humility to recognize that \n     they operate within a system of precedent shaped by other \n     judges equally striving to live up to the judicial oath . . . \n     .''\n        ``[T]he importance of settled expectations in the \n     application of stare decisis is a very important \n     consideration.''\n       ``I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you \n     overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in \n     promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough--and \n     the Court has emphasized this on several occasions. It is not \n     enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongly \n     decided.''\n       ``Well, I think people's personal views on this issue \n     derive from a number of sources, and there's nothing in my \n     personal views based on faith or other sources that would \n     prevent me from applying the precedents of the Court \n     faithfully under principles of stare decisis.''\n       ``I think one way to look at it is that the Casey decision \n     [Casey v. Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania \n     (1992)] itself, which applied the principles of stare decisis \n     to Roe v. Wade [1973], is itself a precedent of the Court, \n     entitled to respect under principles of stare decisis. And \n     that would be the body of law that any judge confronting an \n     issue in his care would begin with, not simply the decision \n     in Roe v. Wade but its reaffirmation in the Casey decision. \n     That is itself a precedent. It's a precedent on whether or \n     not to revisit the Roe v. Wade precedent. And under \n     principles of stare decisis, that would be where any judge \n     considering the issue in this area would begin.''\n       Testifying a year later, Justice Alito was no less \n     emphatic. He testified:\n       ``I think the doctrine of stare decisis is a very important \n     doctrine. It's a fundamental part of our legal system, and \n     it's the principle that courts in general should follow their \n     past precedents, and it's important for a variety of reasons. \n     It's important because it limits the power of the judiciary. \n     It's important because it protects reliance interests, and \n     it's important because it reflects the view of the courts \n     should respect the judgments and the wisdom that are embodied \n     in prior judicial decisions. It's not an inexorable command, \n     but it's a general presumption that courts are going to \n     follow prior precedents.''\n       ``I agree that in every case in which there is a prior \n     precedent, the first issue is the issue of stare decisis, and \n     the presumption is that the Court will follow its prior \n     precedents. There needs to be a special justification for \n     overruling a prior precedent.''\n       ``I don't want to leave the impression that stare decisis \n     is an inexorable command because the Supreme Court has said \n     that it is not, but it is a judgment that has to be based, \n     taking into account all of the factors that are relevant and \n     that are set out in the Supreme Court's cases.''\n       Again, without challenging their good faith, I note the \n     contrast between the testimony cited at length above, from \n     both Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito, with their \n     concurring opinion in Citizens United. That concurrence, \n     authored by Roberts and joined by Alito, says, ``The Court's \n     unwillingness to overturn Austin in [subsequent] cases cannot \n     be understood as a reaffirmation of that decision.'' \n     (emphasis in original). It seems to me that Chief Justice \n     Roberts's concurrence flies in the face of what he said about \n     Casey reaffirming the central holding in Roe. Contrary to his \n     testimony that ``It is not enough that you may think the \n     prior decision was wrongly decided[,]'' Roberts went on to \n     write in Citizens United, ``[w]hen considering whether to \n     reexamine a prior erroneous holding, we must balance the \n     importance of having constitutional questions decided against \n     the importance of having them decided right.'' (emphasis in \n     original). That is an about face.\n       In announcing my ``aye'' vote for General Kagan's \n     nomination to the Supreme Court, I have attempted to sound a \n     cautionary note. The point is to remind Senators, in the \n     first instance, of the need to jealously guard against \n     incursions from the other branches. It is also, I submit, to \n     remind the nominee and the sitting Justices of the Supreme \n     Court that Congress is a coequal branch of Government \n     deserving of a modicum of respect. It takes at least fifty-\n     one votes in the Senate (some would say sixty) and at least \n     two-hundred and eighteen votes in the House to present \n     legislation to the President for his signature. Getting from \n     the introduction of any legislative measure to enacting a new \n     law is a Herculean task. When that task is augmented by a \n     lengthy congressional record supported by hearings and \n     reasoned testimony it should not be cast aside. So it has \n     been important for this Senator to underscore a healthy \n     respect for Congress in the course of Supreme Court \n     confirmation proceedings.\n       Of the 13 nominees to have come before the Judiciary \n     Committee for a hearing during my tenure in the Senate, none \n     was less forthcoming than Justice Scalia. He answered no \n     substantive questions at all. He would not even say whether \n     Marbury v. Madison, which established the principle of \n     judicial review, was correctly decided.\n       In my first autobiography, Passion for Truth, I wrote that \n     ``From my experience participating in Supreme Court \n     nomination hearings, I have found that the better the nominee \n     thinks his chances are, the less he will say at the hearing \n     to minimize his risk.'' In short, Justice Scalia was \n     confident he would be confirmed and, therefore, less \n     forthcoming on substantive inquiries. Justice Scalia's \n     testimony prompted Senator DeConcini to remark: ``It is \n     apparent to me that nominees are advised by the \n     administration to be as evasive and passive as they can be.''\n       Since General Kagan has only followed the precedent set by \n     previous nominees and by the Senate, I believe that she \n     should be confirmed based on her record. In evaluating Ms. \n     Kagan's overall record and performance before the committee, \n     I have concluded that her intellect, academic \n     accomplishments, professional qualifications and earlier \n     statements expressing great respect for Congress outweigh her \n     failure to give substantive answers. But it is worth \n     preserving for the record my views as to what she failed to \n     testify to during the course of the hearing. Several Senators \n     tried in vain to elicit meaningful answers from General \n     Kagan. Senator Kohl asked straightforward questions. When \n     Senator Kohl asked her about her passions,  she demurred, \n     discussing ``the rule of law'' instead. He asked again, \n     ``What are your passions?'' but General Kagan did not \n     answer. Senator Kohl asked how she would impact\n\n[[Page S5942]]\n\n     the everyday lives of Americans. Again, General Kagan did \n     not answer. She referred back to her previous three \n     responses, where she discussed just taking ``one case at a \n     time,'' and nothing more. Senator Kohl tried asking \n     ``Which cases will motivate you?'' and again General Kagan \n     refused to answer, and instead simply recited facts we \n     already knew about the certiorari process. When asked by \n     Senator Kohl about her views on the Bush v. Gore case, a \n     case that the Court specifically said was unique and would \n     not hold precedential value, General Kagan refused to \n     answer, stating that she could not answer because the \n     ``question of when the court should get involved in \n     election contests . . . might well come before the court \n     again.''\n       Similarly, when asked by Senator Coburn if a law requiring \n     Americans to eat three vegetables and three fruits every day \n     would be unconstitutional, certainly not a case likely to \n     come before the Court, she refused to answer even that \n     question in a substantive manner.\n       After pressing General Kagan on her views of the Second \n     Amendment several times without making any progress, Senator \n     Grassley resigned himself to the fact that, in his words, she \n     ``[didn't] want to tell us what [her] own personal belief \n     is.''\n       Senator Coburn criticized General Kagan for ``dancing'' \n     around instead of answering questions and suggested that \n     ``Maybe [she] should be on `Dancing with the Stars'.''\n       When General Kagan refused to discuss internal Justice \n     Department deliberations with White House staff regarding \n     upcoming cases, Senator Kyl pointed out that ``simply noting \n     whether or not there were such contacts would not be an \n     inappropriate thing for you to provide the Committee.''\n       General Kagan consistently declined to answer questions on \n     whether she would vote to take two critical cases as Justice.\n       Toward the conclusion of my second round of questions, I \n     told General Kagan:\n       I think the commentaries in the media are accurate. We \n     started off with the standard you articulated at the \n     University of Chicago Law School about substantive \n     discussions. And they say we haven't had them here, and I'm \n     inclined to agree with them . . . It would be my hope that we \n     could find some place between voting ``no'' and having some \n     sort of substantive answers. . . . I think we are searching \n     for a way how senators can succeed in getting substantive \n     answers, as you advocated in the Chicago Law Review, short of \n     voting ``no.''\n       In her 1995 article, General Kagan criticized Justice \n     Ginsburg's handling of her nomination hearing, stating that \n     ``Justice Ginsburg's favored technique took the form of a \n     pincer movement. When asked a specific question on a \n     constitutional issue, Ginsburg replied . . . that an answer \n     might forecast a vote and thus contravene the norm of \n     judicial impartiality. Said Ginsburg: `I think when you ask \n     me about specific cases, I have to say that I am not going to \n     give an advisory opinion on any specific scenario, because . \n     . . that scenario might come before me.' But when asked a \n     more general question, Ginsburg replied that a judge could \n     deal in specifics only; abstractions, even hypotheticals, \n     took the good judge beyond her calling. Again said Ginsburg: \n     `I prefer not to . . . talk in grand terms about principles \n     that have to be applied in concrete cases. I like to reason \n     from the specific case.'''\n       However, General Kagan failed to take her own advice. She \n     frequently refused to answer questions without having a \n     concrete case or briefs to read. In my attempt to find her \n     views on the ``congruence and proportionality'' standard, she \n     repeatedly avoided answering, saying ``I've not delved into \n     the question the way I would want to as a judge,'' citing the \n     fact that she hadn't read any briefs as she would in a case \n     in controversy.\n       The Ginsburg-Kagan pincer movement creates a Catch-22 for \n     Senators, who must avoid asking about a concrete case that \n     could come before the Court, but then cannot receive any \n     answer from a nominee on a more abstract question because the \n     nominee simply shrugs and says, ``I haven't read the \n     briefs.''\n       In her article, General Kagan went so far as to say she \n     understood why nominees refused to answer questions, calling \n     it a ``game'' in which the ``safest and surest route to the \n     prize'' involves avoiding substantive answers. She wrote \n     ``Neither do I mean to deride Justices Ginsburg and Breyer \n     for the approach each took to testifying. I am sure each \n     believed . . . that disclosing his or her views on legal \n     issues threatened the independence of the judiciary. (It is a \n     view, I suspect, which for obvious reasons is highly \n     correlated with membership in the third branch of \n     government.) More, I am sure both judges knew that they were \n     playing the game in full accordance with a set of rules that \n     others had established before them. If most prior nominees \n     have avoided disclosing their views on legal issues, it is \n     hard to fault Justice Ginsburg or Justice Breyer for \n     declining to proffer this information. And finally, I suspect \n     that both appreciated that, for them (as for most), the \n     safest and surest route to the prize lay in alternating \n     platitudinous statement and judicious silence. Who would have \n     done anything different, in the absence of pressure from \n     members of Congress?''\n       General Kagan certainly did the same. . . . Even with \n     pressure from members of Congress, such as Senators Kohl, \n     Grassley, Coburn, and myself, she still refused to answer to \n     questions.\n       In her article, General Kagan took issue with the Senators \n     for not insisting that nominees answer questions. She stated \n     that ``Senators today do not insist that any nominee reveal \n     what kind of Justice she would make, by disclosing her views \n     on important legal issues. Senators have not done so since \n     the hearings on the nomination of Judge Bork. They instead \n     engage in a peculiar ritual dance, in which they propound \n     their own views on constitutional law, but neither hope nor \n     expect the nominee to respond in like manner.''\n       Again, I asked General Kagan several specific questions \n     that she refused to answer. When I asked a direct question as \n     to whether she would apply to the congruence-and-\n     proportionality test in evaluating the constitutionality of \n     laws passed under Congress's Fourteenth Amendment remedial \n     authority, she refused to answer. When Senator Kyl asked her \n     if detainees had habeas rights, she refused to answer. \n     Senator Grassley asked her if Heller was correctly decided \n     and she refused to answer. So I would hope that General Kagan \n     will not claim that all Senators participating in her \n     confirmation hearing did not hope for, or expect, substantive \n     answers. We tried our best to get her to answer questions, \n     but it was General Kagan who insisted on avoiding substantive \n     answers.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Finally, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \ncopy of an op-ed which I wrote which appeared in USA Today be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From USA Today, July 15, 2010]\n\n           Specter: ``Kagan Did Just Enough To Win My Vote''\n\n                           (By Arlen Specter)\n\n       Supreme Court nominee Elena Kagan did little to undo the \n     impression that nominating hearings are little more than a \n     charade in which cautious non-answers take the place of \n     substantive exchanges.\n       In this, she was following the practice of high court \n     nominees since Judge Robert Bork. But her non-answers were \n     all the more frustrating, given her past writings that the \n     hearings were vacuous and lacked substance. She accused \n     Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer of \n     stonewalling, but then she did the same, leaving senators to \n     search for clues on her judicial philosophy.\n       Her hearings showed an impressive legal mind, a ready humor \n     and a collegial temperament suitable to the court. But they \n     shed no light on how she feels about the court's contemptuous \n     dismissal of Congress' ``fact-finding'' role, its overturning \n     of precedent in allowing corporate political advertising, and \n     the expansion of executive authority at the expense of \n     congressional power.\n       She offered no meaningful observations on U.S. vs. \n     Morrison, in which the court overturned the Violence Against \n     Women Act, blaming Congress' ``method of reasoning,'' \n     notwithstanding a ``mountain of data assembled by Congress'' \n     demonstrating ``the effects of violence against women on \n     interstate commerce'' noted in Justice David Souter's \n     dissent.\n       She offered no substantive comment on Citizens United, in \n     which the court reversed a century-old precedent by allowing \n     corporations to engage in political advertising. Justice John \n     Paul Stevens said in dissent that the court showed disrespect \n     by ``pulling out the rug beneath Congress,'' which had \n     structured the campaign-finance reform bill, McCain-Feingold, \n     on a 100,000-page factual record based on standards cited in \n     a recent Supreme Court decision.\n       Likewise, she avoided taking sides in the court's expansion \n     of executive authority, declining comment on the historic \n     clash posed by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and \n     the president's warrantless wiretapping authorized under the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program.\n       Despite repeated questioning, Kagan refused to comment on \n     the court's refusal to resolve a contentious dispute \n     involving the Sovereign Immunity Act and the Obama \n     administration's foreign policy. Survivors of 9/11 victims \n     sued Saudi Arabia, Saudi princes and a Saudi-controlled \n     charity with substantial evidence that they had financed the \n     9/11 terrorists. The Obama administration persuaded the court \n     not to hear the case, arguing that the Saudi Arabian conduct \n     occurred outside the U.S.\n       On one controversial issue--the question of whether to \n     televise open Supreme Court proceedings--Kagan was candid, \n     stating that she welcomed TV in the court and, if confirmed, \n     would seek to convince her colleagues on the bench. ``It's \n     always a good thing,'' she said, ``when people understand \n     more about government, rather than less. And certainly, the \n     Supreme Court is an important institution and one that the \n     American citizenry has every right to know about and \n     understand.''\n       Her testimony recognized that the court is a public \n     institution that should be available to all Americans, not \n     just the select few who can travel to Washington. A recent C-\n     SPAN poll found that 63% of Americans support televising the \n     Supreme Court's oral arguments.\n       Given the fact that the court decides all of the cutting-\n     edge questions--a woman's right\n\n[[Page S5943]]\n\n     to choose, death penalty cases for juveniles, affirmative \n     action, freedom of speech and religion--public demand for \n     greater transparency should come as no surprise. When 85% of \n     those polled think the Citizens United case expanding \n     corporate spending in politics was a bad decision, one can \n     conclude they want to know why the court decided as it did.\n       On balance, Kagan did little to move the nomination \n     hearings from the stylized ``farce'' (her own word) they have \n     become into a discussion of substantive issues that reveal \n     something of the nominee's judicial philosophy and \n     predilections.\n       It may be understandable that she said little after White \n     House coaching and the continuing success of stonewalling \n     nominees. But it is regrettable. Some indication of her \n     judicial philosophy may be gleaned by her self-classification \n     as a ``progressive'' and her acknowledged admiration for \n     Justice Thurgood Marshall. That suggests she would uphold \n     congressional fact-finding resulting in remedial legislation \n     and protect individual rights in the congressional-executive \n     battles.\n       The best protection of those values may come from the \n     public's understanding through television of the court's \n     tremendous power in deciding the nation's critical questions. \n     In addition to her intellect, academic and professional \n     qualifications, Kagan did just enough to win my vote by her \n     answers that television would be good for the country and the \n     court, and by identifying Justice Marshall as her role model.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER.

Mr. President, I am here today to talk about the bill \nthe Senate just voted on and passed, the financial regulation overhaul \nbill. It is, in my mind, a missed opportunity. We had the opportunity \nto truly address the causes of the financial meltdown and put into \nplace measures that would stop the meltdown from happening the next \ntime. But, unfortunately--as I have seen in about the year's time I \nhave had the privilege to serve in the Senate--it seems it is the \npredilection of this Congress to take a crisis and then come forward \nnot with a narrowly focused and tailored solution but, instead, a \nlarge-ranging, comprehensive bill that creates more government, that \ncreates more bureaucracy, that puts more debt on our system of \ngovernment, and still fails to address the very problem we should be \ntrying to focus upon.\n  We were supposed to rein in the wild and risky speculative tools and \nempower our regulators to prevent another crisis. But we did not. I \nheard Senator Dodd, who I have enormous respect for--and I think he put \na tremendous amount of time into this bill, but I heard him on the \nfloor the other day, in giving his sort of summation as to why this \nbill should be passed, saying this will not stop any future recessions. \nHe is right. He is right because we did not do what we needed to do in \norder to truly fix the problems that happened back in the 2007-2008 era \nwhen we had this tremendous financial meltdown--this meltdown which has \ndepleted trillions of dollars of the net worth of Americans; this \nmeltdown that has led to one of the greatest, if not the greatest, \nrecession since the Great Depression.\n  In my home State of Florida, people are suffering mightily. We have \nnearly 12 percent unemployment. We are either No. 1 or No. 2--depending \nupon the month--in mortgage foreclosures, and our people are behind on \ntheir mortgage payments more than any other State in the Union.\n  We are a State that has been based, perhaps too much, on growth. So \nwhen folks are not coming to build a new home, the contractor does not \nhave a job. When folks are not coming to visit our beaches or our \ntourist attractions, the restaurateur, the hotelier--they lose their \nwork. So things are very difficult in Florida.\n  This financial crisis stemmed in part from some of the problems we \nsaw in lending, in real estate, and there was no place that was any \nworse than what happened in Florida. What this bill fails to address: \nthe underwriting standards that should have been in place to stop these \nso-called ninja loans--``no income, no job.'' They called them ninja \nloans. Anybody could get one, and people were put into homes they could \nnot afford.\n  Why was that able to happen? It was because there were no \nunderwriting standards. There was no skin in the game for those getting \nthe mortgage. There was no skin in the game for the mortgage broker, \nwho was able to sell off this mortgage to Wall Street, where there was \nthis vast and great demand to bundle these products into mortgage-\nbacked securities, and, for the first time ever, tie our real estate \nmarket, our homes--our most important investments--with the financial \nmarkets.\n  As soon as that was done, the speculation and the speculators ran \nwild. This bill does not do enough to prevent that in the future, to \nprovide the real skin in the game that should be needed to trade those \nmortgage-backed securities. We failed to address those two factors. \nPerhaps even worse, we failed to address Fannie and Freddie, the \ngovernment-sponsored entities that stood as silent guarantors to all \nthese mortgages, that let the market have faith and confidence that the \ngovernment was the backstop to these mortgages that should have never \nbeen let. This bill fails to address that. Two of the leading causes of \nthe financial debacle we failed to addressed.\n  Finally, a point we needed to address, and we did: My colleague and \nfriend, who presides over the Senate this afternoon, was the person who \nwas the leading proponent on trying to do something about the rating \nagencies, and we did do something. I was pleased to work with Senator \nCantwell, and I was appreciative of the efforts of Senator Franken, to \ntry to do something about these rating agencies. And we did.\n  That is one good thing about this bill. They are written out of law. \nThese rating agencies compounded the problem because when these \nmortgages, packed together--mortgages that were not any good, that were \nnot going to get paid, that then got turned into a trading vehicle--\nwhen they went up to Wall Street, these rating agencies that are paid \nfor by the investment banks stamped them with AAA ratings, gave them \nthe ``good housing seal of approval'' and let the world believe they \nwere sound investments. They failed. And lo and behold, we find that \nthe government has given a sanction in law to these rating agencies to \nbe the determiners of creditworthiness--a monopoly, if you will.\n  Well, one good thing this bill does is to strip that out. No longer \nwill they be given that state-sponsored monopoly. Now the marketplace \nwill have to work. Now we will not be so relying upon people who are \npaid by the investment banks that did not do their homework and in part \ncaused this crisis.\n  If we would have tackled the GSEs, Fannie and Freddie, and if we \nwould have tackled underwriting standards, I would be here giving a \nspeech today talking about why I voted for the bill. But we only did \none of the four things and, unfortunately, now, we have a bill that \nWall Street loves. Citigroup loves it. Goldman Sachs loves it. But Main \nStreet is very concerned about it. We are going to make sure that \northodontists are regulated because they, every once in a while, extend \ncredit to their patients. But the folks on Wall Street, who caused \nthese problems, and the underlying cause of the debacle, the mortgage \nproblem, the underwriting problem, and the Fannie and Freddie problem \ndo not get addressed.\n  According to the study by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, this bill \nwill create a huge new governmental bureaucracy: 70 new Federal \nregulations through the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection, 54 new \nFederal regulations through the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, 11 new Federal regulations through the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation, 30 through the Federal Reserve, 205 through the \nSEC.\n  You may say: Well, that sounds good. We need more regulations, right? \nThere was a problem. But if the regulation does not go after the \nproblem that caused the debacle, what do the regulations do? We are in \na situation right now where business in this country is frozen. It is \nfrozen solid because of the actions of the Congress and this \nadministration who are doing so much to this economy that big business \nand small business alike do not believe they can hire new workers.\n\n[[Page S5944]]\n\n  There is so much uncertainty in the marketplace. I hear this from \nsmall businesspeople in Florida where we have 1.9 million small \nbusinesses, to workforce centers which are trying to get people back to \nwork, to incubators which are trying to grow new jobs, to presidents of \nchambers of commerce, and other folks I talk to regularly. They tell me \nbusiness is frozen. Washington is doing so much to the economy they do \nnot know where to turn next. Because they do not know what the future \nlooks like, and because this government is pulling these huge levers on \nthe economy, they believe they cannot make any moves.\n  Because of the health care bill, businesses in Florida, small \nbusinesses are telling me they are not going to hire new people because \nthey cannot afford the new regulation. In fact, some of these \nbusinesses are not only going to not hire new people, they are going to \nlet people go.\n  This financial regulatory reform bill--a business in Florida has told \nme its trading desk is going to the Bahamas. Those folks are now going \nto move and no longer add to our tax base and the wealth and diversity \nof our community because this regulation is going to put them in a \nsituation where business says it is more beneficial to move them out of \nthe State, out of the country. There are always unintended \nconsequences. When we pull these huge levers on the economy, we create \ntremendous uncertainty, and business does what business needs to do to \nkeep its people working and to make profits. That is what business is \nfocused on. Those are the jobs that allow all of us to work, to provide \nfor our families. Right now, those jobs are under siege. In a State \nsuch as mine where we have nearly 12 percent unemployment, where times \nare especially difficult, the last thing in the world we need is for \nthe Federal Government to be monkeying with the economy to the extent \nthat businesses can't feel as though they can hire new workers.\n\n  This financial regulatory reform bill does more of what the health \ncare bill did, and it seems to be the penchant of this Congress. We \nshould be focused on jobs. We should be here day and night trying to \nfind ways to make sure business has the incentives it needs to create \nnew jobs and retain jobs, because we need to get people back to work.\n  This financial regulatory reform bill was a bill we should have had \n80 or 90 votes on. It should have been narrowly focused and tailored on \nthe problems that caused the financial debacle of 2008 that we still \nsuffer through. This Chamber needs to get in the business of focusing \non what should be done to address the problem and not using every \ncrisis as an excuse to grow government. This new consumer agency we \ncreated will cost billions of dollars and will empower a new Federal \nGovernment executive, who reports to no board, to be able to make broad \nand wide-ranging policy decisions across this country and in the \nboardrooms of the businesses of America's companies. That is how \nWashington solves a problem these days. We don't fix the SEC which is \nthe agency that is supposed to be doing the job. We don't go in and \nfire all the people at the Securities and Exchange Commission who \nshould have been on top of this. We create a whole new governmental \nlevel of bureaucracy. We layer governmental agency on top of \ngovernmental agency, create more power, create bigger government, spend \nmore of your money, and run this country into further debt.\n  We need a change. We need to do things differently. I wish I could \nhave voted for this. I wish it would have focused on the issues it \nneeded to, but, unfortunately, I can't because it does more harm than \ngood. I am appreciative of my colleagues for supporting the amendment I \ndid with Senator Cantwell on the rating agencies, but only in that \nregard and in a few other regards did we do something that actually \nhelped. Most of what we did didn't fix the problem and it caused more \nharm than good.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I have come to the floor to speak about \nthe conference report on the financial regulation bill the Senate has \njust passed. I think it was a huge mistake. I voted against the bill, \nand now I wish to take some time to explain why.\n  The short explanation is the bill does not address the causes of the \nfinancial crisis and instead it sows the seed of the next financial \ncrisis while adding unnecessary strains on our already struggling \neconomy. I am going to spend the next little while giving the longer \nexplanation.\n  As I have said many times in the Banking Committee and on the floor \nof the Senate, I want to pass a strong financial reform bill that reins \nin the excesses of our large financial companies and the Federal \nReserve. No one has been a stronger voice against the financial \nindustry enablers at the Fed than I have. I have fought every bailout \nbrought to the Congress as well as the bailouts that the Federal \nReserve and both the Bush and Obama administration put in place without \nthe approval of Congress. I very much wanted to pass a bill that ends \nbailouts and reins in the reckless activities of our financial system. \nUnfortunately, like the bill passed by the Senate earlier this year, \nthe conference report before the Senate today did not end bailouts. In \nfact, it does the opposite and makes them permanent.\n  This bill will also lead to future financial disasters because it \nignores the root causes of the crisis. It fails to put the necessary \nhandcuffs on the key parts of the financial system and will result in \neven greater concentration of the financial system in a very few large \nfirms.\n  The largest single contributing factor in the current financial \ncrisis and most other financial crises in the past is flawed Federal \nReserve monetary policy. Starting in the late 1990s, former Fed \nChairman Alan Greenspan used easy money to prop up the financial firms, \nmanipulate the stock market, and micromanage the economy. That easy \nmoney inflated the tech stocks and the dot.com bubble. After that \nbubble burst, as well as following the September 11 terrorist attacks, \nhe again loosened monetary policy which began to inflate the largest \nasset bubble in history. While the bubble was the most visible in \nhousing, it was a debt bubble that spread across all households, \ncorporate, and government borrowing.\n  In about 2004, the housing bubble started to become unstable, but \nlending standards were relaxed and the rise of subprime and other \nnontraditional mortgages enabled the bubble to keep growing for another \ncouple of years. Eventually, the housing bubble became unsustainable \nand popped. The corporate debt bubble largely did the same, and we are \nnow seeing government debt become unsustainable around the world, \nincluding here in the United States of America.\n  Despite the Fed's history of causing financial crises and its clear \nrole in the current crisis, this bill does nothing to rein in the Fed. \nChairman Dodd's original draft bill presented to the Banking Committee \nlast year took some positive steps to get the Fed back on track by \nremoving the Fed as a regulator. But unfortunately, that did not make \nit into the final bill. Nothing in this bill will stop the next bubble \nor collapse if the Fed continues with its easy money policies. Cheap \nmoney will always distort prices and lead to dangerous behavior. No \namount of regulation can contain it.\n  In addition to its flawed monetary policy, the Federal Reserve failed \nas a regulator leading up to the crisis. The Fed was responsible for \nregulating most of the large financial holding companies, but instead \nof regulating them, it was a cheerleader for them. The Fed, along with \nother regulators, allowed those firms to grow even larger and take \nunwise risks. And in what may be the Fed's greatest regulatory failure, \nChairman Greenspan refused to do the job Congress gave him and the Fed \nin 1994--1994--the job to regulate mortgages. Instead of taking action \nthat could have prevented at least part of the housing bubble inflated \nby subprime and nontraditional mortgages, Chairman Greenspan encouraged \nhomebuyers to get those kinds of mortgages. He and Chairman Bernanke, \nalong with many others at the Fed, sang the praises of those mortgages \nas financial innovation that reduced risk.\n  How well did the Fed approach to regulation work, I ask my \ncolleagues? Well, in 2008, most, if not all, of the largest firms \nregulated by the Fed would have failed had they not been bailed out \nthrough TARP or by the Fed on its own. That seems like a pretty\n\n[[Page S5945]]\n\nopen-and-shut case for me for removing all regulatory responsibility \nfrom the Fed and giving it to someone who will use it. But that is not \nwhat this bill does. Instead of real regulatory reform, the bill \nconcentrates regulation of the largest financial firms at the Federal \nReserve, despite the Fed's long history of failed regulation.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the original draft of this bill removed bank \nand consumer protection regulations from the Fed and all the other \nregulators and created a single new banking regulator. That is a better \napproach. But it was dropped before the bill ever got out of the \nBanking Committee, and now the Fed gets more power for both jobs. \nExcept for possibly Chairman Dodd, no one has criticized the Fed more \nthan me for its failure to use its consumer protection powers to \nregulate mortgages. Chairman Greenspan did nothing for 12 years after \nCongress gave him the power. Chairman Bernanke took another 2 years to \nact after he replaced Chairman Greenspan. Clearly, the Fed did not take \nconsumer protection seriously and it deserves to lose that job.\n  I support strengthening consumer protection in the financial system, \nbut I cannot understand keeping that job inside the same Fed that \nignored it for decades. Next to reining in the Fed, the most important \ngoal of this bill should be to end bailouts and the idea of too big to \nfail. Instead, the bill makes too big to fail a permanent feature of \nour financial system and will increase the size of the largest \nfinancial firms. As I said earlier, the bill concentrates regulation of \nthe largest financial institutions at the Federal Reserve. The Fed \nfailed as a regulator leading up to the crisis and should not be the \nregulator of any banks. But now Fed regulation will be a sign that a \nfirm is too big to fail.\n  On top of the new Fed's seal of approval for the largest banks, this \nbill creates a new stability council that will designate other nonbank \nfirms for Federal regulation and, thus, too big to fail. Fed regulation \nof the largest banks is not the only way this bill makes too big to \nfail and bailouts permanent. The largest bank holding companies and \nother financial firms will now be subject to a new resolution process. \nAny resolution process is by definition a bailout because the whole \npoint is to allow some creditors to get paid more than they would in a \nbankruptcy court. The regulator will have the power to pick winners and \nlosers by paying some creditors off on better terms than other \ncreditors.\n  Even if the financial company is closed down at the end of the \nprocess, the fact that the creditors are protected against the losses \nthey would normally take will undermine market discipline and encourage \nmore risky behavior. That will lead to more Bear Stearns, Lehmans, and \nAIGs, not less.\n  The resolution process is not the only way this bill keeps bailouts \nalive. The bill does not shut off the Federal Reserve's bailout powers. \nWhile some limits are placed on the Fed, the bill still lets it create \nbailout programs to buy up assets and pump money into struggling firms \nthrough ``broad-based'' programs. That will put taxpayers directly at \nrisk and make Fed bailouts a permanent part of the financial system.\n  Instead of putting all these bailout powers into law, we should be \nputting failing companies into bankruptcy. Bankruptcy provides \ncertainty and fairness, and protects taxpayers. Under bankruptcy, \nsimilar creditors are treated the same, which prevents the government \nfrom picking winners and losers in bailouts. Shareholders and creditors \nalso know up front what losses they are facing and will exercise \ncaution when dealing with financial companies. Some of us tried to \nreplace the bailout provisions with a revised bankruptcy section for \nfinancial companies, but, unfortunately, we were not successful.\n  Since the bill does not take away government protection for financial \ncompanies and send those that fail through bankruptcy, it should at \nleast make them small enough to fail. Decades of combination have \nallowed a handful of banks to dominate the financial landscape. The \nfour largest financial companies have assets totaling over 50 percent \nof our annual gross domestic product, and the six largest have assets \nof more than 60 percent. The four largest banks control approximately \none-third of all deposits in the country. This concentration has come \nabout because creditors would rather deal with firms seen as too big to \nfail, knowing that the government will protect them from losses. I \nwould rather take away the taxpayer protection for creditors of large \nfirms and let the market determine their size. But if that is not going \nto happen we should place hard limits on the size of financial \ncompanies and limit the activities of banks with insured deposits. Any \nfinancial companies that are over those size limits must be forced to \nshrink. This will lead to a more competitive banking sector, reduce the \ninfluence of the largest firms, and prevent a handful of them from \nholding our economy and government hostage ever again. Like most of the \nother real reform ideas that were proposed while previous versions of \nthis bill were in the Banking Committee or on the Senate floor, \nmeaningful limits on the size of banks were left out.\n\n  Along with not solving too big to fail, this bill does not address \nthe housing finance problems that were at the center of the crisis--and \nstill with us today. First, there is nothing in this bill that will \nstop unsafe mortgage underwriting practices such as zero downpayment \nand interest-only mortgages. There is a lot of talk of making financial \ncompanies have skin in the game, but when it comes to mortgages, the \nskin in the game that matters is the borrower's. Second, the bill \nignores the role of government housing policy and Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, which have received more bailout money than anyone else. \nThe bill does not put an end to the government-sponsored enterprises' \ntaxpayer guarantees and subsidies or stop the taxpayers from having to \nfoot the bill for their irresponsible actions over the past decade. \nOver 96 percent of all mortgages written in the first quarter were \nbacked by some type of government guarantee. Until we resolve the \nfuture of the these entities, the private mortgage market will not \nreturn and the risk to the taxpayers will continue to increase.\n  As I mentioned at the beginning of my statement, this bill is going \nto have real consequences for the economy at a time when the recovery \nis looking more like a second dip of the recession. Combined with the \ntax increases that will take effect at the end of this year, I am \nafraid we may not see real recovery until 2012 or later. One way this \nbill is going to affect the economy is by the increased consumer \nprotection regulation that will reduce the availability of credit from \nbanks and other firms that had nothing to do with the financial crisis.\n  Another way was highlighted in a front-page article in the Wall \nStreet Journal yesterday on the impact of the derivatives regulation in \nthe bill on farmers. I have been as critical as anyone of the lack of \nregulation of derivatives--which was again largely thanks to Alan \nGreenspan--and I think we need more transparency and oversight in that \nmarket, especially for credit default swaps and related products. But \nthe bill goes too far in its impact on ordinary end users who are using \nderivatives to hedge commodity costs or interest rate and currency \nrisks. The Wall Street casino needs to be shut down, but the bill \nshould not prevent legitimate derivative customers from buying \nresponsible protection.\n  I have many other concerns about this bill that I have discussed in \nthe past on the floor and in the Banking Committee. The bill returned \nby the conference committee will not solve the problems in our \nfinancial system. It is regulation without reform. I had hoped we could \nwork together in a bipartisan way to craft a bill that ends too big to \nfail forever, but this is a highly partisan bill that will accomplish \nlittle. And one of the chief authors of the bill, Chairman Dodd, admits \nthat even he does not know how the bill will work and won't until after \nit is in place.\n  In the end, the bill gives so much discretion to the Fed that the \nbest description of the new regulations is they are whatever the Fed \nsays they are. Or to borrow the title of David Wessel's recent book, it \ncan be described as ``in Fed we trust''. We saw how well that worked \nout the last time. I cannot understand why anyone expects it will work \nout better this time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5946]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise today to urge my colleagues to \njoin me and my colleague, Senator Isakson, in honoring the life and \ncommitment of 1LT Robert Collins of Tyrone, GA.\n  Lieutenant Collins grew up in the small town of Tyrone in Fayette \nCounty, where he attended Sandy Creek High School, played football on \nFriday nights, where he became a standout student that would take him \nto the halls of West Point, and where he attended Hopewell United \nMethodist Church with his family every Sunday morning.\n  On the 7th of April 2010, Lieutenant Collins made the ultimate \nsacrifice when an improvised explosive device detonated near his \nvehicle on the streets of Mosul, Iraq. He was 24 years old.\n  To me, it is a particularly difficult situation because Lieutenant \nCollins was one of my appointees to West Point. He graduated from West \nPoint in 2008 and became an officer in B Company, 1st Battalion, 64th \nRegiment of the Armor Unit, 3rd Infantry Division, based at Fort \nStewart, GA. He deployed to Iraq in the autumn of 2009.\n  Lieutenant Collins served as his platoon's commander. While in Iraq, \nhis unit was charged with improving security and the quality of life \nfor the Iraqi people. He and his men also provided security for the \nrecent successful Iraqi elections. They were dedicated to the goal of a \ndemocratic Iraq and sought to help its people lead normal, safe lives.\n  Robert's friends have described him as a man of great compassion. He \nwas a natural leader who truly found a calling in the honor and \npatriotism of service in the U.S. Army. He has been described by his \nsuperiors as a young man who performed his duties courageously, without \nhesitation, and without reservations because, after all, he was a \nsoldier in the U.S. Army.\n  As a small token of gratitude and remembrance for the ultimate \nsacrifice paid by Lieutenant Collins, I am pleased to join Senator \nIsakson in urging our colleagues to rename the post office in Tyrone, \nGA, as the ``1st Lt. Robert Wilson Collins Post Office Building'' in \nLieutenant Collins' honor. Nothing we can do can ever repay the debt \nand the ultimate sacrifice this young man has made, but this will \nensure his name lives on, not just in his friends' and families' hearts \nbut in the heart of his hometown.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I am pleased to join the senior Senator \nfrom Georgia, my friend Saxby Chambliss, to pay tribute today to Robert \nCollins.\n  This naming of a post office is most appropriate in Tyrone, GA, and \nit is most appropriate because of the great sacrifice of this young \nman, whose story, as Senator Chambliss says, is compelling.\n  One interesting point I wish to make is that he was the son of two \nlieutenant colonels retired from the U.S. military. His mother, LTC \nSharon L.G. Collins, and his father, LTC Burkitt ``Deacon'' Collins, \nspent more than 20 years in the U.S. military.\n  His mother said: We never asked him to follow us into the family \nbusiness--being the military--but he did follow us into the family \nbusiness in large measure because of what happened on 9/11/2001.\n  Following that tragic day in American history when he watched the \nterrorist attacks on the Twin Towers, he expressed to his parents a \ndesire to join the U.S. military. His mother responded, along with his \nfather, by making an appointment for him to visit West Point. They \ndressed him up in his very best outfit and took him to West Point.\n  Upon leaving Tyrone, one of his friends stopped him before he got in \nthe car to go to West Point and said: Why are you dressed up so well?\n  He said: Because my mom and dad are colonels.\n  That is the kind of young man he was--respect for his parents, the \nU.S. military, and the greatness of our country.\n  He applied to West Point. Senator Chambliss appointed him to West \nPoint, and he was there with distinction. And later in 2009, he went \noff to serve the U.S. military. Unfortunately, on April 7, he made the \nultimate sacrifice for the people of this country.\n  It is only appropriate in every way possible that we pay tribute to \nthe young men and young women who sacrifice for us so all of us can \nenjoy the freedom of our country.\n  I am pleased, I am honored, and I am proud to join Senator Chambliss \nin naming this post office in Tyrone, GA, after First Lieutenant \nCollins, who was a member of B Company, 1st Battalion, 64th Armor \nRegiment, 3rd Infantry Division, Fort Stewart, GA.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5946-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5946-S5948]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING MAURICE ``MO'' BAILEY\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, as I mentioned, this has been a very \ndifficult week for our military and our veterans communities in the \nState of Alaska. On Tuesday of this week we came together in Sitka, at \nSitka Air Station, the Coast Guard air station there, to honor the \nmemory of three members of the U.S. Coast Guard who gave their lives in \na very tragic accident, the crash of an H-60 Jayhawk helicopter. This \nwas off the coast of Washington on July 7. It was a real tragedy for \nthe Coast Guard families as a whole. The community of Sitka is one that \ntruly embraces the men and the women of the Coast Guard. In addition to \nbeing the ones who pluck the fishermen out of the sea when they are in \njeopardy or at risk, these are the men and women who are helping in the \nlocal churches, helping with Boy and Girl Scouts, coaching the kids. \nThey are truly members of our community. The loss of these three men is \nvery painful for us all.\n  I attended that ceremony on Tuesday in the hangar in Sitka. After I \nleft, I took the flight back to Washington, DC. I took the redeye. When \nI arrived on Wednesday morning I was informed of the passing of a very \ndear friend of mine, a gentleman who made a profound contribution to \nthe lives of so many of Alaska's veterans. I am speaking today of an \nindividual by the name of Maurice Bailey. We called him Mo. Mo was from \nWasilla, AK, and he was a disabled Vietnam era veteran who fought the \nVA bureaucracy to obtain his earned benefits.\n  He fought for himself and he was successful in that, but he went \nbeyond that. He devoted the rest of his life to ensuring that the \nchallenges of Alaska's veterans were not forgotten. He focused his \nefforts on those veterans who live in more than 200 rural communities \nthat are not connected by road to the rest of Alaska or certainly to \nthe continental United States. These are the communities of bush \nAlaska.\n  In 2003, Mo founded Veterans Aviation Outreach. This is an \norganization of volunteer pilots who travel to rural Alaska, to the \ncommunities that are hundreds and hundreds of miles from the nearest VA \nfacility. He and his other volunteers did what the VA simply was not \ndoing. They sought out those forgotten veterans and helped them in \nevery way they possibly could.\n  When you listen to the stories about what Mo did and what the \nVeterans Aviation Outreach group did, it was a little bit of \neverything. They helped the veterans fill out applications for their \nbenefits. Oftentimes it meant volunteering to fly a veteran to \nAnchorage for a medical appointment or perhaps raising the money for an \nairplane\n\n[[Page S5947]]\n\nticket. In so many of our very rural, very remote communities, there is \nno road. You don't get in your car and drive. So for the veteran to go \nfor care, they may be traveling hundreds of miles. They don't have the \nmoney to do so. So Mo would bring his guys together or he would get in \nhis plane and he would fly out there and pick them up.\n  Sometimes the help meant delivering moose meat, clearly a very \ndesired food staple in rural Alaska. Sometimes it meant building a \nwheelchair ramp in a veteran's home. This was an all-volunteer \noperation. It functioned on raffles and bake sales. All too often the \nmoney came straight from the pockets of its own volunteers.\n  We are a State that reveres all of our veterans. In Alaska we are \nhome to more veterans per capita than any other State in the Union. We \nare also known as a very strong State for voluntarism. Support for \nveterans is clearly the rule. In many of the communities it is \ndifficult to provide for that level of support, but we figure out a way \nto do it anyway.\n  It is universally acknowledged that there was something exceptional \nabout Mo Bailey. His was a life of selfless service, sacrifice, and \nhumility. He was truly a cut above the rest, and that is a pretty \nstrong statement when you consider the many veterans who call Alaska \nhome. But Mo never sought recognition for himself. He was so humble. \nBut this did not stop his friends from ensuring that he received the \nrecognition he had so honorably earned. In 2007, Mo was awarded with \nthe prestigious Alaska Governor's Veterans Advocacy Award. I do not \nbelieve I am overstating when I say today that we mourn the loss of one \nof our State's most significant veteran leaders.\n  Mo Bailey was born in 1939 and grew up in Memphis, TN, during the Jim \nCrow era. The story goes he was looking up at the B-17s flying overhead \nand he told himself: Someday I am going to be flying those. Mo \nrecounted, in a 2009 interview published in the Frontiersman newspaper:\n\n       Black people there said they didn't think this would ever \n     happen. But at 7 years old I knew this is the United States \n     of America and you can do anything you want to do. That was \n     my heart's desire.\n\n  Those were Mo's words.\n  Mo enlisted in the Army at the age of 17. I say to the pages down \nhere, he joined the Army at 17. He forged his father's signature on the \nconsent form. Then he served 20 years. He pulled two tours in Vietnam \nand one in Alaska. He was a helicopter crew chief and a gunner.\n  Then, upon retirement from the Army, he decided to stay in Alaska and \nget involved in our community. He became a private pilot and a flight \ninstructor. He was a trained Veterans Service Officer and he served as \npresident of the Vietnam Veterans of America Chapter 903 in the \nMatanuska-Susitna Valley.\n  It was not too long ago that Mo discovered he had leukemia, but he \nsaid it was not going to slow him down. In an interview in the \nFrontiersman newspaper Mo said:\n\n       I feel as though I'm probably on somebody else's time. But \n     that's OK. There is no quit. No way, no how. I'm never going \n     to prepare myself to die. Never.\n\n  Mo really did live his life and live it large.\n  I got a call in early January. I was traveling and I got a call from \nmy staff person out in the Mat-Su Valley and he said: Mo has leukemia. \nHe is not doing well. He is in the hospital and this may be it.\n  I called the hospital. A man answered. I asked to speak to Mo. The \nguy on the other end said, ``Well, this is Mo.''\n  I said: Mo, you sound pretty healthy.\n  He said: Yes, they tell me I am not going to make it. They tell me I \nam done. I am in the hospital. But I just don't feel like dying. I \ndon't feel like I am ready.\n  I said: Mo, you don't sound like you are going anywhere. You sound \nlike you have got a lot of fight left in you.\n  Mo said: You know, there are some things I want to do. I have been \nworking on this veterans gathering. It is a big gathering in the valley \nwith so many of our Alaskan veterans. I have got a lot of things to do. \nI have got some things I want to give you. You know, I am focusing on \nthat.\n  I said: Mo, I will see you in May at the gathering.\n  This was January and he had been told this was pretty much the end. \nBut in May Mo hosted the gathering in Palmer, his annual day-long event \nthat provides Alaska vets across the generations an opportunity to \nspend time with one another. They listen to music. They donate \nsomething to the Veterans Aviation Outreach, and they have a lot of \nfun.\n  There are some speeches, too. You can't go to any veterans gathering \nwithout a speech or so. But at that May gathering, Mo honored me with a \nVeterans Aviation Outreach jacket. It has my name on it and I am an \nhonorary member of the Veterans Aviation Outreach.\n  Mo stood with me there and we both talked about the fact that, back \nin January, May looked like it was a long way away. But Mo is a \nfighter. Mo was not one who was going to go out easy.\n  At those many speeches I told those at the gathering that as much as \nI can do, as much as I want to do for our veterans, I am here in the \nSenate to help Alaska's and all veterans. I said: Mo, I will never hold \na candle to you, but I sure promise to try. And I promised to try to do \nmore, and today I renew that commitment in Mo's loving memory.\n\n  Many of us who were gathered there thought that event was going to be \nMo's ``last hurrah,'' and indeed that is the way it turned out. But Mo \ncontinued to fight right up until the very end on Tuesday evening.\n  I could go on for a while about Mo's work in service to the Alaska \nveterans community, but I would suggest it is probably a more powerful \nstatement, a more powerful story, if it is done in Mo's own words. I \nask unanimous consent that two articles, one from the Vietnam Veterans \nof America magazine and the other from the Anchorage Daily News, be \nprinted in the Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I place these articles in the Record not only because \nMo's legacy needs to be preserved in history, not only to do justice to \nthe tremendous contribution of Mo Bailey, I am really hoping these \narticles will catch the attention of some of the senior officials \nwithin the VA. Reading about the gaps in service Mo Bailey sought to \nfill might challenge the VA to think a little bit harder about how it \ncan improve its service to other rural veterans. At the very least, it \nmight cause the VA to acknowledge the debt it owes to people like Mo \nBailey and so many others in our veterans service organizations who are \ngiving of their own time, their own energy, their own money, to fill \nthese gaps. So maybe, just maybe, Mo's story, which has been an \ninspiration to so many of us in Alaska, will also inspire the VA to do \nmore and to do better.\n  On behalf of all of my Senate colleagues, I express my deepest \ncondolences to Mo's wife Ann and all of those who have been touched by \nMo Bailey's generosity and kindness.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      Reaching the Unreached in Alaska Veterans Aviation Outreach\n\n                            (By Jim Belshaw)\n\n       In the course of his 20-year Army career, Maurice Bailey, \n     president of VVA Chapter 903 in Mat-Su, Alaska, pulled two \n     tours in Vietnam and one in Alaska. He thought Alaska was a \n     ``cool place'' and went back there to live. It was different \n     from anything he'd known, and he liked things that were \n     different. Since 1980, the mechanic-turned-pilot has flown \n     small fixed wing aircraft around the state. With a handful of \n     other veteran-pilots, he's hoping to turn those long years of \n     experience in the air into something that will help Alaska's \n     aging veteran population.\n       As Bailey himself got a little older, he said he decided to \n     put in for ``some VA disability stuff Agent Orange-related \n     and PTSD. Just a whole gamut of stuff.'' He said the VA \n     experience ``wasn't a cakewalk,'' but when it was done the VA \n     found him to be 90 percent disabled. That got him to thinking \n     about other veterans. 74,000 of whom live in Alaska, some in \n     remote villages far from any kind of service, Alaska being a \n     good place to be alone if that's your desire. There are 234 \n     villages in Alaska. They range in population from 50 to 500. \n     A big town might have as many as 2000.\n       ``A lot of people are hiding,'' Bailey said. ``They just \n     wanted to run away. They just don't want to be bothered.''\n       He'd spent many year flying to such places. While he \n     noticed the large number of veterans, he didn't give it much \n     thought until he went through his own VA experience. He \n     wondered how many of Alaska's\n\n[[Page S5948]]\n\n     veterans might be so far removed that they didn't know they \n     had benefits coming, let alone how to get them.\n       He became a veterans service officer. It seemed the natural \n     for him. He met men he hadn't expected to meet.\n       ``I met World War II guys,'' he said. ``One guy in \n     particular, a tough old guy 84 years old. He was gut shot \n     twice, medically discharged, and given a 30 percent \n     disability. He quietly disappeared into the wilds of Alaska. \n     When I met him, he was still flying airplanes. The oldest guy \n     I saw was 90 years old.\n       He says he doesn't mean to criticize the VA when he says it \n     needs to do outreach. He thinks that if the VA did a credible \n     job of outreach, it would be overwhelmed by the needs of \n     veterans. He thought perhaps a smaller number of people \n     working on a modest scale might be a good place to begin.\n       Maurice Bailey got together with other veteran pilots--Tom \n     Baird and Joe Stanistreet (no longer with VAO) and Chuck \n     Moore--to talk about the possibility of doing outreach \n     themselves. Bailey had been doing it on his own for a year \n     and asked his friends if they'd like to join him. A fourth \n     later joined the group--Jim Kendall, a photographer and \n     navigator.\n       From these conversations grew Veterans Aviation Outreach, \n     Inc., three veteran pilots flying their own airplanes to \n     reach people who live ``off the road'' in a place not known \n     to have many roads. Many of those veterans live in what is \n     described as ``survival mode'', barely existing, often \n     finding comfort in alcohol, only to have the alcohol lead to \n     unemployment.\n       From the beginning, Bailey said, trust was the critical \n     factor in the success they've had. Because of his long \n     experience flying around Alaska, he came to know many of the \n     distant veterans. It made a difference when he broached the \n     subject of benefits. By way of illustration, he tells of \n     another veteran who went to a small village where no one came \n     out to greet him. But when Aviation Outreach went to the same \n     place, they signed up 29 people in two days for health care \n     and benefits.\n       ``These guys have seen me around these villages and they \n     trust me,'' Bailey said. ``I know most of them. I know their \n     kids.''\n       Bailey said Moore, with whom he served in Vietnam 38 years \n     ago, is a key player in the effort and the pilot with the \n     most experience.\n       ``He was a young pilot (19) and I was an old man (25),'' \n     Bailey said. ``He flew gunships. He left the Army and went \n     into the Navy to fly jets. He flies 90 percent of the \n     missions for VAO. At this time he also flies for the State of \n     Alaska. We have three pilots and four airplanes. Chuck owns \n     two airplanes and the other two are owned by Tom Baird and \n     myself.''\n       Tom Baird underscores the importance of trust with the \n     veteran's community.\n       When I travel in the bush, most contacts are developed by \n     these kinds of relationships,'' he said. ``Once you establish \n     a relationship with an individual as a friend, you end up \n     being steadfast friends. Individual homes are open to one \n     another. Most of the people in this state will stop and give \n     a hand if you need it. We want to reach the unreached who are \n     out of sight and out of mind. These individuals are extremely \n     independent. They like to do things for themselves whether \n     they can or not.''\n       Bailey says the four members of Veterans Aviation Outreach \n     have no grand illusions. They try to do ``small stuff.'' They \n     sign people for VA benefits; they recruit new VVA members. \n     Believing there is strength in numbers, they do what they can \n     to build the veterans community.\n       They built a wheelchair ramp for a veteran to get in and \n     out of his house. He's 50, Bailey said, and he'd ``given up \n     on life.'' So they do small things that will enhance that \n     life.\n       They put in a claim for a veteran suffering from diabetes. \n     It took eight months to settle, but the veteran received \n     $4,000 in back pay and now gets $200 a month for the rest of \n     his life.\n       ``He's real happy because now he can buy fuel oil,'' Bailey \n     said.\n       Bailey is direct when dealing with veterans, ``I try to \n     explain to them, ``Look guys, you're old and you're sick \n     now,'' he said.\n       Tom Baird said decisions between quantity and quality is \n     always difficult.\n       ``We've run into difficulty making decisions about reaching \n     as many people as we can or making sure those we have \n     contacted are taken care of before we move on,'' he said. \n     ``Because of the difficulties of processing and getting \n     things done, it's looking like we're going to go for quality \n     first. These guys already had been promised the world and \n     gotten nothing, so it makes no sense to go out there if we're \n     not going to be able to do it right.''\n       Maurice Bailey counts his blessings and speaks of a duty to \n     share them.\n       ``Life has been pretty good to me,'' he said. ``I live \n     pretty good. But we're here for more than to just live pretty \n     good. We're here to help people when they need it.''\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, Nov. 18, 2008]\n\nPilots Bring Hope, Help to Veterans in Alaska--VAO: Outreach by 7 Vets \n          Includes Food, Claims Help and Flights to the Doctor\n\n                           (By Zaz Hollander)\n\n       Wasilla--A national veteran's group report released last \n     month highlighted health-care struggles facing Alaska Army \n     National Guard members returning from deployments to rural \n     villages. But news of under-served Bush veterans came as no \n     surprise to Maurice ``Mo'' Bailey, a Wasilla flight \n     instructor who served as a helicopter flight engineer with \n     the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War.\n       Several years ago, Bailey and six other veterans--also \n     pilots--took to the skies in their own planes to help \n     veterans living in Western Alaska. All had flown the area for \n     fun, and saw veterans in need of help. In 2003, Bailey \n     created a nonprofit, Veteran's Aviation Outreach, which \n     serves ``isolated veterans'' in rural or remote parts of \n     western Alaska and elsewhere.\n       The men mostly help people file for Veterans Administration \n     benefits. But they've also flown out veterans in need of \n     medical care, made sure deceased veterans got flags for their \n     graves, and shared literally tons of moose meat scored from \n     helpful guides.\n       In 2005, they filed benefit claims on behalf of six Naknek \n     veterans. The next year, they flew a rural resident to \n     Anchorage for emergency medical care, a visit that also \n     resulted in diagnoses--and later treatment--of diabetes and \n     post-traumatic stress disorder.\n       Now 69, Bailey last year received the Governor's Veterans \n     Advocacy Award for his ``outstanding volunteer service.''\n       He talked about the flying outreach group during a recent \n     conversation.\n       Q. Why did you start?\n       A. Seeing the conditions that many veterans are in. Me and \n     the rest of the pilots used to fly to western Alaska. We saw \n     that people would have medical problems and some people in \n     some cases died, leaving huge debts. Had they known they had \n     benefits, the VA would have taken care of that. It's mostly \n     information: these people are clueless. Once you're released \n     from the military, you are not tracked, updated.\n       Q. Why western Alaska?\n       A. We were retired, just kind of goofing around (and flying \n     the area). They're all combat pilots--the rest of the guys \n     are. I'm not. We were all in Vietnam together. All of us are \n     retired from the military, looking at our brothers and \n     sisters and saying, ``Well, what can we do?'' We didn't set \n     out to do this, trust me. We were enjoying our retirement, \n     our grandchildren.\n       Q. Can you give me some specifics of the kind of outreach \n     you do?\n       A. We've been to all villages up and down the Kvichak River \n     and Lake Iliamna. We found out veterans had been buried \n     without flags. We decided that was totally unacceptable.\n       Q. Where was that?\n       A. It was in Newhalen on Lake Iliamna. We came back and \n     went around to organizations such as the VFW. We got flags at \n     the Wasilla Vet Center. We took flags out to make sure that \n     people who had died recently, they received flags they hadn't \n     gotten before and we left flags there so they could have them \n     to take to six surrounding villages. That was last year.\n       Q. What about more recently?\n       A. We help veterans, no matter where. Last month, a guy was \n     on dialysis. He had to come into Wasilla three times a week. \n     He lived in Sutton. His house was not sanitized, broken \n     pipes. We took a couple ladies out, cleaned the house, took a \n     plumber out to fix pipes for water, built a handicapped ramp. \n     Now he's able to do his dialysis at home.\n       Q. Where does the money come from?\n       A. Most of it comes out of our pockets. Sometimes people \n     give fundraisers, spaghetti dinners, garage sales, cookie \n     bakes or whatever. We do lots of stuff. I tell you what, I'm \n     not just bragging, I'm really proud. We've had a heckuva \n     impact doing things for people, little things that \n     (otherwise) people, they got to paperwork it to death.\n       We just gave away 2,100 pounds of moose meat. We do it \n     every year, have a deal with guides in Healy. They bring \n     Lower 48'ers on hunts. They want horns. We want meat. We \n     caravan a couple of trucks, pick up the meat and have it \n     processed. The neediest people get it first. Valley veterans. \n     Actually, we sent meat to the Bush--400 pounds last year to \n     Naknek. Last week we also bought two freezers for needy \n     veterans and filled both up with meat.\n       Q. How many veterans do you serve?\n       A. I just started tracking that. We see and help maybe two \n     veterans a week. On a large scale, like the meat giveaway, \n     it's to 50 to 60 people. Out in the Bush, we file claims for \n     people with disabilities, illnesses. We do a little bit of \n     everything.\n       Q. Where's the next trip?\n       A. Dillingham. Hopefully (early November). We'd like to \n     have a gathering there.

I have come to the floor many times to speak out about \nthe Castro regime's abuses of the Cuban people. Today, I come to the \nfloor once again, this time in strong opposition to any attempt in this \nChamber to pass any bill that in any way lifts or lessens the travel \nban on Cuba. I wish to make it absolutely clear that I will oppose and \nfilibuster, if I need to, any effort to ease regulations that stand to \nenrich a regime that denies its own people basic human rights. I do not \nwant to obstruct the business of this Chamber, but I know my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle are well aware of how deeply I feel about \nfreeing the people of Cuba from the repressive regime under which they \nhave suffered for too long.\n  The fact is, the big corporate interests behind this misguided \nattempt to weaken the travel ban could not care less whether the Cuban \npeople are free. They care only about opening a new market and \nincreasing their bottom line. This is about the color of money, not the \ndesire for freedom.\n  The very fact that a travel bill has moved through the House \nAgriculture Committee makes one wonder why American agricultural \ninterests would even care about tourist travel to Cuba. One can only \nassume it is about generating increased tourism dollars for the Castro \nregime to buy more agricultural products. That would only serve to \nenrich the regime and do absolutely nothing to bring democracy to the \nisland.\n  Let's be clear. Those who believe that increasing travel will \nmagically breed democracy in Cuba are simply dead wrong. For years, the \nworld has been traveling to Cuba and nothing has changed. Millions of \ntourists from democratic nations have visited Havana, and the Castro \nregime has not loosened its iron grip on its people. It has not ended \nits repressive policies. It has not stopped imprisoning and brutally \nabusing prodemocracy forces.\n  Now, sometimes I wonder; those who lament our dependence on foreign \noil because it enriches regimes and terrorist states such as Iran \nshould not have a double standard when it comes to enriching a brutal \ndictatorship such as Cuba right here in our own backyard.\n  How coincidental that suddenly, now that the Congress is considering \nlifting a travel ban, the Castro regime is hoping the world will \nbelieve it will release 52 prisoners of conscience. Well, let's set the \nrecord straight. Many people are wrongly under the impression--wrongly, \nreading and watching media reports--that 52 political prisoners have \nalready been released and are free in Cuba. The fact is, only about \nseven have been released, and forcibly--forcibly--deported from their \ncountry--another human rights violation--instead of allowing them to \nstay and peacefully advocate for change within their own country.\n  So even when the regime releases people whose simple crime was trying \nto peacefully create change in their country and who get imprisoned for \nyears for that peaceful act, then when they are released, they are \nreleased only with the understanding that they will be deported out of \ntheir country so they can no longer be advocates, peaceful advocates, \nfor civil society and democratic change. Imagine if those of us who are \nAmericans could be arrested simply because we disagreed with the \ngovernment, sought to peacefully change it, and then ultimately, after \nbeing arrested for years, were deported to some other country in the \nworld.\n  The remaining 47 prisoners are set to be released but not now, not \ntomorrow, not next week, not even next month, but sometime during the \nnext 3 to 4 months, we are told--or so the regime says.\n  According to reports in the Miami Herald, nine of those prisoners \nhave said they will refuse to leave for Spain if released, and many who \nwere released and forcibly deported to Madrid have vowed to continue \ntheir activism in exile. They have told reporters they feel the shock \nof being forced to leave their country. Omar Rodriguez Saludes told a \nreporter he feels ``like I was still in prison. I left behind part of \nmy family. I still feel like I have the cuffs on my hands.''\n  The released men said conditions in the prison were horrendous. They \nshared their cells with rats. Diseases infested the prison. And they \ntold of inmates trying to kill themselves or do themselves bodily harm \nbecause of the squalid prison conditions they were forced to endure. \nRemember, these are political prisoners, not people who committed \ncommon crimes.\n  Julion Cesar Galvez, one of the dissidents, told reporters:\n\n       The hygiene and health conditions in prisons in Cuba are \n     not terrible--they're worse than terrible. We had to live \n     with rats and cockroaches and excrement. It's not a lie.\n\n  Galvez, a 66-year-old journalist who was sentenced to 15 years simply \nbecause of what he sought to write, 15 years of his life in these \nhorrible prisons, said:\n\n       There were outbreaks of dengue fever and tuberculosis.\n\n  He said there were more than 1,500 prisoners in the prison in Villa \nClars--40 prisoners to a cell measuring 32 square feet.\n  Another prisoner, Norman Hernandez, said:\n\n       The prisoners are tired of demanding their rights . . . \n     They lose all hope. They lose their desire to live, and they \n     try to hurt themselves so they will get attended to.\n\n  These men were lucky to be released, but they will not give up. They \nwill continue to tell their stories, and they will continue to fight \nfor freedom for all Cubans.\n  It took the regime one night in March to arrest these 52 people--one \nnight. That scooped up 52 people who were peacefully advocating for \nchange in their own country. So we might ask ourselves: If it took you \none night to arrest 52 political prisoners, why will it take 4 months \nto release all of them?\n  It is not a coincidence that during the next 3 or 4 months, there \nwill be Members of the Congress who will be looking to provide the \nCastro regime with billions of dollars of added tourism revenue. It is \nnot a coincidence that in September, the European Union will once again \ndeliberate the wisdom of its remaining sanctions. The nagging question \nthat lingers in my mind is, Will the 47 ever see the light of day or \nwill they be forcibly deported from their country and another 52 \narrested overnight to take their place?\n  It is possible the regime will never release them because they do not \nwant the world to see them because of the torture to which they have \nbeen subjected. Here is one of those prisoners. Last month, a man named \nAriel Sigler was released from a Cuban prison on the verge of death. He \nwas a 250-pound amateur boxer. You see him there in great health. This \nis the picture of his release--a 100-pound paraplegic. A 100-pound \nparaplegic. He did nothing to deserve that set of consequences.\n  Last month, the regime once again refused to let the United Nations \nSpecial Rapporteur on Torture visit the island, which, in my own view, \nspeaks volumes about the conditions of the thousands of Cubans who have \nbeen imprisoned.\n  When you oppose the Castro regime, you are called dangerous, and \nthere is a charge of dangerousness. Thousands of Cubans have been sent \nto Castro's prisons because of dangerousness. That is dangerousness: \nsimply opposing the regime and seeking change in your home country--and \nfor other trumped-up political charges.\n  If that is what is happening to the 200 internationally recognized \nand known political prisoners, then how much worse must it be for the \nthousands of anonymous political prisoners who have not been reported \nbecause they fall under the charge of dangerousness?\n  According to the State Department:\n\n       The total number of detainees is unknown because the \n     government does not disclose such information and keeps its \n     prisons off limits to human rights organizations and \n     international human rights monitors.\n\n  Again according to the State Department:\n\n       One human rights organization lists more than 200 political \n     prisoners currently detained in Cuba in addition to as many \n     as 5,000 people sentenced for dangerousness.\n\n  Yet, in the face of this repression, some Members want to provide the \nCastro regime with its No. 1 source of income: tourism. This is not \nabout travel; this is about rewarding a repressive regime. We already \nhave hundreds of thousands of Americans who travel to Cuba for family, \neducation, or humanitarian reasons under our existing law. But tourism \nto Cuba is a natural resource, akin to providing refined petroleum \nproducts to a country such as Iran. It is reported that 2.5 million\n\n[[Page S5950]]\n\ntourists visit Cuba each year--1.5 million from North America, 1 \nmillion Canadians; more than 170,000 from England; more than 400,000 \nfrom Spain, Italy, Germany, and France combined; all bringing in nearly \n$2 billion in revenue to the Castro regime.\n  Yet nothing has changed in Cuba except the amount of tourism dollars \nthe regime has at its disposal. What does it do with nearly $2 billion \nof resources from tourism? Does it put more food on the plates of Cuban \nfamilies? Does it create a better quality of life for the Cuban people? \nNo. Even with all of that money coming in, the Castro regime still \nrations people's food. They have to stand in line with a coupon to get \naccess to a simple meal, waiting in long lines for a subsistence meal. \nOf course, when the regime rations people and they are in line just \ntrying to get a meal for the day, there is no time for promoting \ndemocracy or human rights. The people are just trying to exist, trying \nto keep their family fed. There is no time but to stand in line, \ndespite several billions of dollars to the Castro regime from tourism.\n  To me, that is an irreversible concession to a regime that this week \narrested a Cuban American for providing laser printers and ink \ncartridges to a rural woman's opposition movement in Santiago. He was \ninterrogated, the head of the movement's home raided by a dozen state \nsecurity agents, the printer and cartridges confiscated. What a threat, \na bunch of printers and ink cartridges. What a threat. He was \nsubsequently released and put on a plane back. Meanwhile, an American \nremains in prison for helping the island's Jewish community connect to \nthe Internet. After 6 months in jail, this individual still faces no \ntrial and no charges, a U.S. citizen, jailed simply because he was \ntrying to help the Jewish community in Havana to access the Internet. \nWhat a crime. What a crime. Yet for the most part we are relatively \nsilent.\n  They were looking to help the Cuban people. But the regime doesn't \nwant anyone engaging with the Cuban people. They want tourists to \nprovide only one thing--hard currency, dollars, money.\n  Visiting the beaches of Varadero and sipping a Cuba libre, which is \nan oxymoron, provides money to continue repression, but it will not let \nthe Cuban people sip the sweetness of freedom. It will not change the \nplight of the Women in White. These are women who are the mothers, \ndaughters, sisters, and wives of those many political prisoners in \nCastro's jails who each week, normally on Sunday, march dressed in \nwhite in peaceful protest with a gladiola and, in doing so, are \nultimately trying to say: Free my relative.\n  This photograph shows the consequence of what they face. State \nsecurity, dressed up as civilians, ultimately, as we can see, \nassaulting them, hurting them, arresting them. It will not change the \nfate of the Women in White, and it will not change the fate of their \nfamily member who remains jailed.\n  It will not change the fate of being imprisoned by the regime and \nthen being released, as they have done so many times when there is some \ninternational spotlight on an individual, only to be rearrested over \nand over and over.\n  It will not change the tragic fate of Orlando Zapata Tamayo, who was \ndeemed a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International, who died in \nFebruary after being on a hunger strike in a Cuban prison for 85 days \nprotesting horrific prison conditions. It will not end the desire for \nfreedom or change conditions in Cuba for men like Guillermo Farinas who \nbegan his hunger strike after the death of Zapata, ending it after he \nheard of the prisoner release, but vowing that he and other courageous \nCubans would join in yet another hunger strike, if the 52 other \npolitical prisoners are not released and put back in their homes by \nNovember 7.\n  This photograph shows what he has been emaciated to in his hunger \nstrike.\n  Lifting the travel ban, allowing tourist dollars to flow to the \nregime will not end any of it. It will not free the people of Cuba. It \nwill not change the fate of the Women in White or the desire for \nfreedom of Guillermo Farinas and the other political prisoners. It will \nonly enrich the regime.\n  Reports this week have pointed out the economic impact opening travel \nto Cuba will cause to the Gulf States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, \nand other democratic neighbors in the Caribbean. The dollars that will \nbe transferred from those tourism economies should be for the benefit \nof a democratic government in a free Cuba not to bail out a brutal \nregime. The Castros don't deserve it, and the U.S. Gulf States and our \nCaribbean friends cannot afford it.\n  According to the Jamaica Daily Gleaner:\n\n       The results of various studies of the likely impact on the \n     Caribbean of lifting of the U.S. travel ban suggests that \n     Cuba's tourism arrival would surge to full capacity at the \n     expense of other Caribbean destinations . . .\n       . . . Apart from Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, \n     the most heavily dependent Caribbean destinations on the U.S. \n     and the most vulnerable, should the legislation to lift the \n     travel ban pass, ultimately include [many of the islands in \n     the Caribbean that would have an enormous economic damage to \n     them].\n\n  It seems to me we should be promoting tourism to the beaches along \nthe gulf coast, not to the apartheid beaches of Castro's Cuba.\n  You are not even allowed, as a Cuban citizen, to go to the beaches, \nmany of the beaches of your own homeland, because they are reserved for \ntourists. You can't enter some of the hotels unless a tourist in your \nown country brings you in. That is why we call it apartheid. You cannot \nhave access in your own homeland.\n  Imagine in my home State of New Jersey, where we love the New Jersey \nshore, imagine me not being able to go to any of the beaches in New \nJersey because the government wants to restrict me from interacting \nwith tourists and that those beaches would be reserved only for foreign \ntourists in my own home State in my own home country. That is what goes \non.\n  Allowing the regime to benefit from increased tourism will not change \na thing in Cuba. It will not bring democracy to Cuba. It will not make \nconditions for the Cuban people any better or change the history of the \nbrutality of the Castro regime, a brutality that continues to this day. \nSometimes I think some of my colleagues just don't have a sense. This \nis not using the word ``brutality'' for the sake of it. The pictures \nspeak a thousand words.\n  I would like my friends in the Senate and others beyond, who may not \nhave fully engaged in understanding what this brutality is all about, \nto recall the words of Armando Valladeres who wrote the prize-winning \nbook ``Against All Hope.'' He was imprisoned in the infamous Isla de \nPinos in 1960 for his opposition to communism. He lived through the \nhell of Castro's jail, suffering violence, forced labor, and solitary \nconfinement. His writings were smuggled out of Cuba, read throughout \nthe world. He was finally released after intense international \npressure, 22 years after he was taken prisoner. They had to \nrehabilitate him because they didn't want him released and shown to the \nworld in the circumstances that some of these prisoners are.\n  Here are some of his memories of activity at the hands of the Castro \nbrothers while in captivity:\n\n       I recalled the two sergeants, Porfirio and Matanzas, \n     plunging their bayonets into Ernesto Diaz Madruga's body. . . \n     . Boitel, denied water, after more than fifty days on a \n     hunger strike, because Castro wanted him dead; Clara, \n     Boitel's poor mother, beaten by Lieutenant Abad in a \n     Political Police station just because she wanted to find out \n     where her son was buried. . . . Officers . . . threatened \n     family members if they cried at a funeral.\n       I remember Estebita and Piri dying in blackout cells, the \n     victims of biological experimentation. . . . So many others \n     murdered in the forced-labor fields, quarries and camps. A \n     legion of specters, naked, crippled, hobbling and crawling \n     through my mind, and the hundreds of men mutilated in the \n     horriffing searches.\n       Eduardo Capote's fingers chopped off by a machete. \n     Concentration camps, tortures, women beaten. . . .\n       And in the midst of that apocalyptic vision of the most \n     dreadful and horrifying moments in my life, in the midst of \n     the gray, ashy dust and the orgy of beatings and blood, \n     prisoners beaten to the ground, a man \n     emerged. . . .\n       . . . the skeletal figure of a man wasted by hunger with \n     white hair, blazing blue eyes, and a heart overflowing with \n     love, raising his arms to the invisible heaven and pleading \n     for mercy for his executioners.\n       ``Forgive them, Father, for they know not what they do.'' \n     And a burst of machine-gun fire ripping open his chest.\n\n  I hope my colleagues remember these memories of Armando Valladeres \nand\n\n[[Page S5951]]\n\nthe realities of Castro's prisons before we think about rewarding the \nCastro regime in any way. Their sins are too great, and this is not a \nthing of the past. Their brutality and repression have been going on \nsince the inception and still go on today. It has never stopped. It has \nnever gotten better. It has never changed. It never will for so long as \nthe regime is in power.\n  When I hear my colleagues come to the floor and talk about lifting \nthe travel ban, I am compelled to ask, Why is there such an obvious \ndouble standard when it comes to Cuba? Why are the gulags of Cuba so \ndifferent than the gulags of other places in the world? Why are we \nwilling to tighten sanctions against some but loosen them when it comes \nto an equally repressive regime in Cuba, in effect rewarding them? Why \nare we so willing to throw up our hands and say: It is time to forget?\n  I don't believe it is time to forget. We can never forget those who \nhave suffered and died at the hands of dictators anywhere, and \ncertainly not in Cuba. It is clear the repression in Cuba continues \nunabated, notwithstanding the embargo, notwithstanding calls by those \nwho want us to ease travel restrictions, ease sanctions, \nnotwithstanding the fact that we have millions of visitors from other \nplaces in the world bringing billions of dollars, and still the \nrepression goes on. In good conscience, I cannot do that. I will not \nstep back.\n  I have come to the floor in the past to oppose any attempt to do \nthat, to pass any bill that in essence lifts the travel ban on Cuba. I \nwill continue to do so. I will continue to do so until we have the \nopportunity to make sure the Cuban people are ultimately free, make \nsure they have the basic fundamental rights that you and I enjoy in \nthis great country, and to ensure the voices of all who languish in \nCastro's jails--for which the world seems to be deaf to their cries, \ndoes not seem to care, does not speak about, does not do anything \nabout--will continue to raise their voices in this Chamber and beyond.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5951-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5951-S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TRAVEL TO CUBA\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, sometimes on the floor of the Senate, good \nfriends disagree--perhaps not as often as some would think, but on \noccasion that is the case, and it is the case today, when I observed \nand listened to a presentation by my colleague from New Jersey on the \nsubject of Cuba. I am sure we do not disagree about some parts of this \nsubject; that is, I do not like the Cuban Government. I want freedom \nfor the Cuban people. We, I assume, both believe that and believe the \nimprisonment of political prisoners in Cuba--who languish in Cuban \njails for exercising their right of free speech and who are doing that \nin dark cells--is wholly unfair and we should as a country do \neverything we can to try to bring the vestige of freedom to the Cuban \npeople. I understand all that. I support that strongly.\n  I have been to Cuba. I have spoken to Cuban Government leaders. I \nhave spoken to dissidents. I have spoken to people on the streets of \nCuba. And I want Cuba, an island 90 miles off the shore of our country, \nto be a free country.\n  Let me describe how long Cuba has had Communist rule and, by the way, \nhow many Presidents we have had during that Communist rule and, \ntherefore, the embargo that has been leveled against Cuba all these \nyears. Let me describe how many Presidencies that embargo has existed \nthrough. The Presidencies begin with John F. Kennedy and go through \nthis administration. That is 10 Presidencies.\n  We slapped an embargo on the country of Cuba and punished the \nAmerican people in the process by saying: We are going to limit your \nright to travel to Cuba. And we were going to shut off all commerce to \nCuba, including, by the way, most of these years, a restriction on \nsending food and medicine to Cuba.\n  The embargo has not seemed to work very well. It is now 50 years old, \nand it still exists. Well, what has happened as a result of the \nembargo? We have now a debate about what should happen with respect to \nour relationship with Cuba at this point. My colleagues say: Well, \ndon't do anything that would reward the Cuban Government. Far from it. \nI have no interest in rewarding a government that I substantially \ndisagree with, a government that I believe throws innocent people in \njail. I have no interest, nor do the people who support the bill \nSenator Enzi and I have now offered in the Senate, with 40 Senators \ncosponsoring it--we have no interest in rewarding the Cuban Government. \nThat is not the issue. But we do believe the restriction on the \nAmerican people's rights--the decision by a government that says: We \nare going to tell the American people where they can and cannot \ntravel--we believe that is inappropriate. We do believe that ought to \nchange.\n  So what I would like to do is talk about a couple things, including, \nNo. 1, lifting the travel ban to Cuba and making it easier to sell food \nto Cuba.\n  I was the person who changed the law 10 years ago that allowed for \nthe first time just a crack in this embargo that allows us to sell food \ninto Cuba if it is paid for with cash. I think it is immoral for a \ncountty to use food as a foreign policy weapon. I do not think food \nought to be part of any embargo. I think that is immoral.\n  By the way, using food as a part of an embargo just hurts poor, sick, \nand hungry people. Do you think the Castro brothers have missed \nbreakfast or lunch or dinner because we had an embargo on food \nshipments to Cuba? Hardly. So 10 years ago, I got the law changed. In \nfact, it was the Dorgan-Ashcroft amendment. I got the law changed. That \nallowed us to begin selling food into the country of Cuba. That was the \nfirst opportunity to make any changes at all in this embargo.\n  Now the question is travel to Cuba by the American people. Should we \ncontinue to say to the American people: You have no right to travel to \nCuba. We do not like the Cuban Government, so what we are going to do \nis restrict the rights of the American people? We have been doing that \nfor 50 years, and it is time--long past the time--for it to change.\n  Let me describe a letter that came recently to the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  By the way, the reason this issue has now come to the forefront is \nthe Agriculture Committee of the House of Representatives just passed a \nbill that lifts the travel restrictions on the American people to \ntravel to Cuba. It also makes some changes in the conditions under \nwhich agricultural goods can be sold to Cuba, which is very important \nto do as well because even though 10 years ago I got the provision \nenacted into law that allows the sale of farm products for cash into \nCuba, in 2003, as a runup to the 2004 election, President Bush \ntightened all of those provisions and actually changed a rule so that \nin order for Cuba to purchase goods from our country; that is, \nagricultural commodities, they had to pay in cash before the \ncommodities were even shipped. Well, that never happens in a \ntransaction. You pay cash when you get the goods. But President Bush \nwas attempting to restrict the sale of agricultural products to Cuba. \nSo we need to fix that as well.\n  But the House of Representatives Agriculture Committee has now passed \na bill lifting the travel ban. That means this issue is going to be \nfront and center here in the Senate. Senator Enzi and I have the bill--\nit is bipartisan--that would lift the travel ban to Cuba, and we have \n40 Senators who are cosponsors.\n  Let me read to you a letter that was sent to the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives by 74 Cuban human rights leaders, dated May 30, 2010, \njust a month and a half ago. They said:\n\n       The supportive presence of American citizens, their direct \n     help, and the many opportunities for exchange, used \n     effectively and in the desired direction, would not be an \n     abandonment of Cuban civil society but rather a force to \n     strengthen it. Similarly, to further facilitate the sale of \n     agricultural products would help alleviate the food shortages \n     we now suffer.\n       The current Cuban government has always violated this right \n     [to travel] and in recent years has justified its actions \n     with the fact that the government of the United States\n\n[[Page S5952]]\n\n     also restricts its citizens' freedom to travel. The passage \n     of this bill would remove this spurious justification.\n\n  This is not from me or the cosponsors of my bill; this is from 74 \nCuban human rights leaders.\n  As to the issue of lifting the travel ban--the one we have slapped on \nthe American people in order to punish somebody else; we have punished \nthe American citizens because we are upset with somebody else--here are \npeople who support lifting the travel ban: a political prisoner, \nMarcelo Rodriquez from Cuba; Guillermo Farinas, a hunger striker in \nCuba; Yoani Sanchez, one of the leading political bloggers in Cuba; \nOscar Chepe, a former political prisoner; and Miriam Leiva, founder of \nthe Ladies in White.\n  One of my colleagues recently had a poster I saw about the Ladies in \nWhite. The founder of the Ladies in White supports lifting this travel \nban. They are not soft on Castro or soft on a Communist government. \nThey just believe this travel ban should be lifted because it will be \nbeneficial to their interests as leaders in human rights in the country \nof Cuba.\n  The sacrifices of those whom I have shown here in photographs, the \nsacrifices they have made in Cuba--sitting in dark prison cells, hunger \nstrikes, and more--I think give them great credibility when they speak \nout on what is the best way to promote democracy in Cuba.\n  I indicated that I got a law passed that allowed us to sell some food \ninto Cuba for cash. Since that time, U.S. farmers have sold $3.2 \nbillion worth of food to Cuba. I mentioned that in 2003 the Bush \nadministration decided to dramatically change that to try to restrict \nthe sale of agricultural products to Cuba, and they succeeded in some \nrespects. We need to change that as well. It makes no sense to do what \nthey did in 2003.\n  But let me try to describe what was done in 2003 so that everybody \nunderstands what happened. The President, trying to get tough in 2003, \neliminated the people-to-people visits program with Cuba; eliminated \nsecondary school education travel with Cuba; restricted family travel \nto Cuba by Cuban Americans; restricted amateur athletic travel; \nprohibited gift parcels with clothing, personal hygiene items, soap-\nmaking equipment, and so on; restricted religious travel; and then also \nimposed the cash-before-shipment rule in order to restrict the sale of \nagricultural commodities to Cuba. So that is where we have been with \nrespect to what happened in the previous administration.\n  President Obama has taken some unilateral actions since taking \noffice. He has removed the restrictions on Cuban Americans who want to \nvisit Cuba for family visits, and he has authorized U.S. \ntelecommunications companies to sell their services in Cuba. I think he \nshould go further immediately, and I think he has the capability to do \nthat by restoring people-to-people visits to Cuba, permanently \nrestoring the original definition of the term ``payment of cash in \nadvance'' so that farmers can continue to sell agricultural products to \nCuba. And especially, we need here in the Congress to pass S. 428, \nwhich is the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act.\n  The American people have the right to travel almost anywhere they \nwish. They could travel to Russia in the middle of the Cold War. In \nfact, we sent our philharmonic orchestra, in 1959, right at the height \nof the Cold War, to play music in Communist Russia. They were not \nrestricted. There is no travel restriction with respect to Russia.\n  The New York Philharmonic, in 2008, went to North Korea. And if you \nwant to get a lump in your throat and feel really proud, go get the \nrecording, the DVD, watching the New York Philharmonic play a concert \nin North Korea. It is extraordinary. But they were not prohibited from \ntraveling to North Korea because you can travel to North Korea.\n  You can travel to the country of Iran. This picture is from the \nOffice of Foreign Assets Control, which is the office down in the \nbowels of the Treasury Department that determines how they are going to \nenforce the travel ban to Cuba. They say:\n\n       All transactions ordinarily incident to travel to or from \n     Iran . . . are permitted.\n\n  So let's review. You could travel to Russia in the middle of the Cold \nWar. You can travel to Iran right now. You can travel to North Korea \nright now. North Korea is a Communist country. You can travel to China \nright now. China is a Communist country. You can travel to Vietnam \nright now. Vietnam is a Communist country. By the way, with respect to \nChina, I am cochair of the Congressional Executive Commission on China. \nWe have the world's most complete database of political prisoners held \nin China. There are very serious problems in China with respect to \nimprisonment of innocent people who are now sitting in the dark corners \nof cells in the farthest reaches of China, political prisoners, and we \ndon't decide because of that we are not going to allow travel or trade \nwith China or Vietnam. We have decided that engagement through travel \nand trade is the most productive way to move those countries toward \ngreater human rights. It is only with Cuba that our country has decided \nit is not a strategy that works at all. What works is punishing the \nAmerican people.\n\n  So what we have done is decided we are going to punish the American \npeople who wish to travel to Cuba by tracking them down--by diverting \nsomewhere around 25 percent of the resources in the Office of Foreign \nAssets Control, which is a little office in the Treasury Department \nthat is supposed to be working on tracking financing by terrorists. \nInstead, about a quarter of their time, I am told, is used to try to \ntrack American tourists who are being suspected of vacationing in Cuba. \nWhen they track them down, they get after them. They want to levy a big \nfine.\n  I have described previously, and I will again, because my colleague \nwho presented used a lot of posters to show what the circumstances are, \nbut here is what the Office of Foreign Assets Control says with respect \nto travel to Cuba by an American citizen:\n\n       Unless otherwise authorized, any person subject to U.S. \n     jurisdiction who engages in any travel-related transaction in \n     Cuba violates the regulations.\n\n  So what does that mean? What are the consequences? Well, it means we \nare punishing the American people saying: We restrict your right to \ntravel. So Carlos Lazo, a man whom I have met and who went to Iraq to \nfight for his country and who won a Bronze Star because he was brave \nand was a great soldier, came back to this country after having served \nhis country in uniform, was awarded with great fanfare a Bronze Medal \nfor bravery, and then was told, when he was informed--he had two sons \nliving in Cuba and his older son was sick--you have no right to travel \nto Cuba to see your sick child. Unbelievable. In fact, I even forced a \nvote in the Senate on this question.\n  Sergeant Lazo, back from Iraq, with a sick son in Cuba was told: You \nhave no right to travel. Unbelievable. Yet that was the case.\n  I have shown this photograph many times, but it is useful to describe \nhow unbelievably foolish these policies are. This is Joan Scott. The \nPresiding Officer knows Joan Scott as well. She went to Havana to \ndistribute free Bibles on the streets of Havana. For that, her \ngovernment tracked her down and tried to fine her $10,000. For going to \nCuba to distribute free Bibles, this government is going to track its \ncitizens down to try to fine them $10,000.\n  I have met Joan Slote as well. She was riding bicycles in Cuba. She \njoined a Canadian bicycle tour and took a bicycle trip to Cuba. This \ngovernment of ours tracked her down and tried to fine her $10,000. By \nthe way, this woman, I think, made $1,100 a month in Social Security, \nand her government decided to try to attach her Social Security \npayments. What was her transgression? What was her crime? She took a \nbicycle trip to Cuba as an American citizen.\n  I don't think there needs to be said very much more about this. This \nis the most unbelievable policy with respect to Cuba. I have been to \nVietnam, I have been to China--both Communist countries. We decided \nengagement through trade and travel is constructive. It works. It is \nwhy I assume the legislation Senator Enzi and I have offered is \ncosponsored by Senator Lugar, the ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee; Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee and chairman of the Subcommittee on Western Hemisphere \nAffairs. They are part of the 40 Senators who have cosponsored \nlegislation saying to our government: Would you stop\n\n[[Page S5953]]\n\npunishing the American people because you are upset with somebody else, \nand would you stop being so unbelievably inconsistent?\n  Don't tell us that trade and travel is a constructive way to deal \nwith Communist countries and then tell us that dealing with Cuba 90 \nmiles off our shore requires us to punish the American people by \nrestricting their right to travel.\n  I say again: What right does this government have to tell an American \ncitizen where they can travel? They can go to North Korea, Iran, China, \nVietnam, but not travel to Cuba. That is obscene. It makes no sense to \nme. Aside from we ought to stop doing stupid things, aside from just \nthat notion, we surely ought to decide that it is not in the interests \nof this country to have its government telling people how, when, and \nwhere they can travel.\n  I wish to finish by just saying this again. I don't deny there are \nsubstantial human rights abuses in Cuba. I have been there. I have \ntalked to the dissidents. I have talked to the Cuban people who have \ncome to this country who know of, who have seen, who have watched the \nunbelievable lack of human rights that exist in that country. So that \nis not the point. The point isn't to deny the charts that people show \non the floor of the Senate showing abuse. I could bring to the floor of \nthe Senate, as chairman of the commission that deals with China, dozens \nof photographs of Chinese prisoners held in the darkest cells in the \nfarthest reaches of China who have done nothing but are suffering. But \nwe have not decided as a country that we will restrict the American \npeople's right to go to China because that exists in China. We have set \nquite the opposite policy. We believe the best way to promote a march \ntoward greater human rights in China and Vietnam and elsewhere is \nthrough trade and travel. That is the construction that this country \nhas taken for a long while, except with respect to Cuba. In that \ncircumstance, we say, no, we must, we must, we must prevent Americans \nfrom traveling to Cuba.\n  I say, again, 74 leading Cuban human rights leaders have signed a \nletter sent to us from Havana, Cuba--74 of them--and have said: Lift \nthis travel ban. This travel ban makes no sense. You want to help Cuba? \nYou want to help the people of Cuba? Lift this travel ban.\n  I also would say again, if I can find the chart that I had, the very \nbrave citizens in Cuba who have spoken out and who are widely \nrecognized, who have suffered: Marcelo Rodriquez, Yoani Sanchez, \nGuillermo Farinas, Oscar Chepe, and Miriam Leiva, all of them have \nsuffered in Cuba. All of them believe this travel ban ought to be \nlifted.\n  I hope this Senate pays some attention to that and finally sees we \ncan't do two things at the same time: No. 1, stop punishing the \nAmerican people because we disagree with another country's government \nand, No. 2, do smart things that allow us to find ways to push and move \nthat government toward greater human rights for its citizens.\n  Lifting the travel ban will accomplish both because there are 40 of \nus in the Senate who have sponsored and cosponsored legislation to lift \nthat travel ban. When we have the opportunity for that vote in the \nSenate, I believe we will prevail at last--at long last--and we will \nprevail, and it will be constructive public policy for this country to \nhave done so. Certainly, it will have lifted the yolk of oppression by \na government that restricts the rights of its own citizens--I am \ntalking about our government--that will lift the yolk of oppression \nthat has existed for some 50 years by a government that tells its \ncitizens where it can and cannot travel.\n  I don't want to hear any more about a government that tracks down a \nguy from the State of Washington whose father was a minister in a small \nchurch in Cuba, who immigrated to this country, and his father died and \nhis father's last wish was that his ashes would be strewn on the church \nproperty in Cuba where he was a minister. So his son carried out his \nfather's wish. He went to Cuba and took his father's ashes to the \nchurch where he once served and deposited them on the lawn by that \nchurch. For that his government tracked him down and attempted to levy \na very substantial fine on that young man from the State of Washington.\n  I am tired of those stories. Those stories are an embarrassment about \npublic policy gone wrong, and we need to fix it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5953-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CROSS-BORDER THREAT OF ASSAULT WEAPONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, last month, Mexican President Felipe \nCalderon addressed a joint session of Congress, highlighting the \ndangerous role that American-made firearms play in the violence \ncurrently plaguing both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border. President \nCalderon drew a link between the 2004 expiration of the U.S. federal \nassault weapons ban and a subsequent surge in violence in Mexico. In \nhis speech, President Calderon urged Congress to reinstate a federal \nban on assault weapons, a call I have long supported. By exploiting \nweak U.S. gun laws and corrupt gun sellers in the United States, \nMexican drug gangs have amassed arsenals of military-style assault \nweapons. These guns have been used to kill thousands in Mexico and pose \na grave and growing security threat to Americans north of the border.\n  Mexican law enforcement officials increasingly are being out-gunned \nby drug gangs bearing military-style assault weapons, .50 caliber \nsniper rifles and other high-powered weapons that originate in the \nUnited States. Using trace data from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives, ATF, the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice, GAO, determined that from fiscal year 2004 to fiscal year 2008, \nover 20,000, or 87 percent, of firearms seized by Mexican authorities \noriginated in the United States. Additionally, the GAO reported that \nthe number of assault weapons within this total continues to grow. In \nfact, approximately 25 percent of the firearms seized by Mexican \nauthorities in fiscal year 2008 were high-powered assault weapons, such \nas AR-15 and AK-type semi-automatic rifles.\n  However, the threat posed by assault weapons is not faced exclusively \nby law enforcement personnel in Mexico. Drug trafficking across the \nborder into the United States has been increasingly accompanied by \nviolence in the American Southwest, forcing police departments to \ncombat criminals with military-style arsenals. Former Houston Police \nChief Harold Hurtt acknowledged the AK-47 assault rifle has become the \n``weapon of choice'' for major drug dealers, warring gangs and \nimmigrant smugglers. ``The reality on the street is that many of these \nweapons are readily available,'' according to Hurtt, forcing the \nHouston Police Department to consistently upgrade its weaponry to match \nthe firepower of criminals armed with assault weapons. Just last week, \nJeffrey Kirkham, the Chief of Police in Nogales, Arizona, reported that \nMexican drug cartels have made death threats against his department in \nresponse to a successful drug bust. Criminals armed with assault \nweapons are a direct threat to American law enforcement officials and \nthe communities they protect.\n  Reauthorizing a Federal ban on assault weapons would help to reduce \nviolence in Mexico and the United States. When the first federal \nassault weapons ban expired in 2004, 19 of the highest powered and most \nlethal firearms became legal to purchase, including semiautomatic \nweapons that incorporated bayonet mounts or grenade launchers. In the \nabsence of a ban, these lethal weapons continue to stream across the \nMexican border, arming criminals and placing border communities in \ngrave danger. The reinstatement of a Federal assault weapons ban has \nthe overwhelming support of the law enforcement community, and I look \nforward to working with my colleagues in the Senate toward that goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5953-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5953-S5954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, West Virginia, the U.S. Senate, and our \nNation have experienced an incredible loss. Over the last few weeks, \nthis Chamber witnessed poignant eulogies and remembrances of the \nlegendary Senator Robert Byrd. Much has been said and written since \nSenator Byrd's death on June 28, 2010.\n\n[[Page S5954]]\n\n  Those who have so eloquently written and spoken knew the Senator much \nbetter than I--Presidents, Senators, world leaders, dignitaries, as \nwell as members of his family and friends in West Virginia.\n  He will be remembered as an intelligent, compassionate and \nillustrious figure. A giant.\n  Many people have recalled his historic milestones, distinguished \ncareer and legendary speeches. I first met Senator Byrd when I arrived \nin the Senate in 2007. I introduced myself and told him about a friend \nand patient of mine from Wyoming who had told me that Robert Byrd was \nhis favorite senator. Like Senator Byrd, my friend uses a wheelchair. \nSenator Byrd asked me why my friend liked him so much. I told him it \nwas because of their mutual commitment to the Constitution.\n  I went on to say that he thought Senator Byrd was ``the best thing \nsince sliced bread.'' Senator Byrd's eyes brightened and widened with \nthe reference to sliced bread. He then gave me a complete history of \nsliced bread in America and the date when the first mechanical bread \nslicer was used in the United States. As a true man of the people, \nSenator Byrd also sent a note and a copy of the Constitution to my \nfriend in Wyoming.\n  When former Wyoming Senator Cliff Hanson died late last year, I \nshared the news with Senator Byrd. Senator Byrd said, ``I liked Cliff \nHansen. Cliff Hansen was a friend of mine. Cliff Hansen knew what he \nstood for.'' The same can be said for Senator Byrd.\n  As a public servant, he had few equals. As a parliamentary expert, he \nhad none. Every day, Senator Byrd showed his enduring dedication to his \nfamily, the people of West Virginia, the United States Constitution, \nand our Nation.\n  Senator Byrd leaves us with a memory of the man--the memory of his \nkindness, grace, and passion. He had a depth of institutional \nunderstanding and knowledge of the traditions of the U.S. Senate that \nwill never be replaced. While many of us are students of history, \nSenator Byrd truly lived this Nation's history. His strength, \ndetermination, and unyielding pursuit of knowledge serve as a model for \nall of us.\n  To his daughters Mona Byrd Fatemi and Marjorie Byrd Moore, his \ngrandchildren, and family, I extend my family's sympathy and hope the \ncoming days are filled with love, enduring strength, and God's grace.\n  Bobbi and I wish the Byrd family our best and our prayers are with \nyou.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5954-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               KYRGYZSTAN\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, in the last few weeks, great turmoil has \nunfolded in Kyrgyzstan. According to media reports, ethnic riots in the \nsouthern cities of Osh and Jalalabad have left up to 2,000 dead--309 \nconfirmed by the Kyrgyz Government--thousands have been injured, and \napproximately 400,000 Uzbeks have been displaced.\n  I am deeply concerned about ethnic clashes and ongoing tension \nbetween the Kyrgyz and Uzbeks, especially given reports that \ninternational observers have noted they are reminiscent of the \ntragedies in Bosnia and Rwanda in the 1990s. Today, the situation \nappears to have stabilized, but we cannot discount the potential for \nrenewed conflict after an apparent lull, which happened in both Bosnia \nand Rwanda.\n  We must also not forget that what happens in Kyrgyzstan has \nimplications for U.S. interests throughout central Asia. As the Senate \nnoted in Resolution 566, which passed unanimously on June 25, the \nevents of the past month could spark unrest across the Ferghana Valley, \nwhich borders Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan. Kyrgyzstan also \nplays host to a U.S. air base at Manas International Airport that \nserves as a critical supply line for NATO and U.S.-led operations in \nAfghanistan.\n  For these reasons, I rise today to urge the provisional government \nand all citizens of Kyrgyzstan to move ahead with the process of \nreconciliation. I would also like to commend the Obama administration \nand others in the international community--particularly the United \nNations and Russia--who have rendered fiscal and humanitarian aid to \nthe Government of Kyrgyzstan during this difficult time. The \ninternational community must call on all parties to refrain from \nviolence, cease persecution of minorities, and explore peaceful routes \nto conflict resolution.\n  There is other news out of Kyrgyzstan worth noting--namely, the \nreferendum held on June 27 in support of a constitution that will \nestablish central Asia's first parliamentary democracy. This referendum \nwas peaceful and inclusive, and I commend the provisional government \nfor organizing this process. The referendum marked a historic \nopportunity to usher in a new period of democracy and stability in \nKyrgyzstan, and the stakes are high. This is why I would like to \nhighlight three areas where I hope there can be additional progress can \nbe made.\n  Perhaps most importantly, there must be a credible investigation into \nthe recent violence. One of the most important actions to take is to \nestablish an investigative team that is viewed as credible by all \nsides. This investigation must ensure the perpetrators of violence are \nheld accountable for their actions and initiate a process whereby all \ncitizens, including ethnic Uzbeks, see themselves as sufficiently \nrepresented in the country's national institutions.\n  The interim government must also ensure a smooth transition to the \nnew Constitution. This means that the Kyrgyz authorities should \nredouble efforts to prevent the escalation of violence, and observers \nmust monitor the elections. The first transition of power is critical \nto the success of this democratic transition because it will set the \nbaseline for all future elections. The people of Kyrgyzstan have shown \noverwhelmingly that they want democracy, and now the provisional \ngovernment should do everything in its power to make those aspirations \na reality.\n  Finally, the government must promote freedom of the press. According \nto Freedom House, in 2010, Kyrgyzstan was ranked 159th of 192 \ncountries. At this critical juncture, the interim government may feel \ntempted to muzzle criticism to avoid giving fodder to dissidents. But \nto do so would undermine its credibility far more than any words \npublished in a free press. There is an undeniable connection between a \npopulation's confidence in their political system and the capacity of \nthat system to ensure the free flow of information through an \nindependent media. If the interim government and its successor want to \nidentify the failures of previous governments in Kyrgyzstan, they need \nlook no further than its abysmal record in the area of press freedom. \nTo make the new constitution in Kyrgyzstan a success, the nation needs \na truly independent media.\n  Mr. President, we are at an important turning point in Kyrgyzstan, \nwhere there is a glimmer of hope about democracy taking root in the \nfuture. At the same time, the potential for renewed unrest, rampant \ncorruption, and curtailed freedoms could easily jeopardize recent \nprogress. It is incumbent on all sides to act responsibly and to ensure \nthere is not a resurgence of violence, so that the new Government of \nKyrgyzstan can set an example of successful democracy for the region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5954-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5954-S5955]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SMALL BUSINESS LENDING\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak of an amendment, \ncosponsored by Senators Grassley, Enzi, Isakson, and Collins, which has \nproven small business job creating power.\n  It should come as no surprise to anyone that it remains difficult for \nsmall businesses to access credit. We have all heard the justifiable \nfrustration and outrage expressed by entrepreneurs nationwide in \nresponse to the albatross of tight credit which has a chokehold on our \neconomy. And frankly, who could blame them, when just this past April, \nthe Federal Reserve's Senior Loan Officer Opinion Survey found the \npercentage of banks easing credit terms for small businesses was just a \nmeager 1.9 percent--after it was an astonishing zero percent in both \nthe past January and October surveys! Is this any way to jumpstart an \nanemic economy?\n  As ranking member of the Senate Small Business Committee I, along \nwith Chair Landrieu, have vigorously championed measures to ease credit \nand increase small business lending. Together, we fought to include in \nthe\n\n[[Page S5955]]\n\nRecovery Act key provisions to increase the maximum government \nguarantee on Small Business Administration, SBA, loans to 90 percent \nand to appropriate $375 million to reduce fees for SBA 7(a) and 504 \nborrowers. This program proved to be so popular and viable that its \nfunds were expended first in November 2009, then in February 2010, and \nagain in March 2010, following short term extensions.\n  But regrettably, these provisions have lapsed, and a program that \npaid tangible dividends, having been credited with increasing loan \nvolumes by a remarkable 90 percent nationwide and 236 percent in Maine, \nhas to my dismay come to a close. At a time when unemployment hovers at \nnear ten percent and consumer confidence hangs in abeyance, nothing \ncould be more counter-intuitive than to allow this to happen. And the \nnumbers speak for themselves. In June alone, the SBA approved only $647 \nmillion in SBA 7(a) guaranteed loans, a 65.9 percent decrease from the \n$1.9 billion in 7(a) loans it approved in May.\n  No wonder in a July 11 New York Times article, SBA Administrator \nKaren Mills urged Congress to continue these programs, stating that \n``we've been able to put $30 billion in the hands of small businesses \nand now is not the time to pull back . . . .'' Talk about the \nproverbial snatching defeat from the jaws of victory!\n  Our amendment would resuscitate this highly effective program, \nproviding $485 million to reinstate SBA fee reductions and the elevated \nguarantee on SBA 7(a) loans through the end of 2010. And we pay for it \nby using unobligated Recovery Act funds. In fact, according to the \nRecovery Accountability and Transparency Board, there are approximately \n$50 billion in unobligated stimulus funds, and our amendment, which \nwould cost less than 1 percent--.97 percent to be exact--of the overall \namount, is paid for by rescinding, on a pro rated basis, from these \nfunds. While we all must make difficult spending decisions, it should \nbe clear that reinstating these vital provisions represents a \ncommonsense approach to providing capital to small businesses across \nour Nation.\n  These are actions we can take right here and right now that \ncomplement this bill's SBA related provisions which increase the \nmaximum limits for SBA 7(a) and 504 loans from $2 million to $5 \nmillion, raise the maximum microloan limit from $35,000 to $50,000, and \nallow for the refinancing of conventional small business loans through \nthe SBA 504 program.\n  They will begin providing capital immediately to small businesses, \nand they have strong industry support from the National Association of \nDevelopment Companies, which represents 504 lenders and the National \nAssociation of Government Guaranteed Lenders, which represents 7(a) \nlenders.\n  In conclusion, this initiative ought to be a simple way to swiftly \nprovide assistance to those economic engines that are the lifeblood of \nour economy--our Nation's small businesses. It is my hope that this \nbody can accept this amendment quickly, by unanimous consent, so that \nwe can provide our economic catalysts with at least a modicum of \ncapital security, financial stability, and economic certainty.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5955-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5955-S5956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BOMBINGS IN UGANDA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I join President Obama, Secretary \nClinton, and people around the world in condemning the horrific \nbombings in Uganda last Sunday. These attacks killed scores of innocent \npeople and wounded many others who had peacefully gathered to watch the \nWorld Cup final.\n  I was particularly saddened to learn that Nate Henn, an American who \nworked as a volunteer with Invisible Children to help children affected \nby war in Uganda's northern region, was among those murdered in this \ncowardly act. I have worked closely with members of the Invisible \nChildren team to bring attention to the atrocities committed by the \nLord's Resistance Army, and I know their passion and dedication. I \noffer my deepest condolences to the Henn family and the whole Invisible \nChildren family, as well as to all the other victims and their \nfamilies.\n  The United States has close ties and a strong working partnership \nwith the people and Government of Uganda, and we stand with them in \nthis difficult moment. I strongly support efforts by the U.S. \nGovernment to assist Ugandan authorities to investigate these attacks \nand bring the perpetrators to justice. And given the news of another \nattempted attack on Tuesday, we should also help the government take \nenhanced security measures.\n  At the same time though, we should encourage the government to avoid \nany actions that could be seen as broadly targeting Somalis or the \nMuslim community more generally in Uganda. These communities in Uganda \nhave not been known for violent or extremist activity in the past, and \nit would be counterproductive to alienate them. They should be allies \nin seeking to identify and apprehend those individuals behind these \nheinous attacks.\n  Al Shebaab, the Somali terrorist group whose leaders have links to \nal-Qaida, has claimed responsibility for this attack. Al Shebaab has \nbeen threatening for months to carry out attacks in Kenya, Uganda, and \nBurundi, and if their claim is true, this would be the first time that \nthey have carried out a major attack outside Somalia's borders. It \nwould underscore the threat that this terrorist group poses not only to \nneighboring countries but throughout Africa and potentially even to the \nUnited States.\n  For years, I have drawn attention to the continuing conflict in \nSomalia and its direct ramifications for our national security. As I \nmentioned, al Shebaab's leadership has links to al-Qaida and has \nindicated a desire to work with al-Qaida affiliates worldwide, \nparticularly al-Qaida in the Arab Peninsula in Yemen. In addition and \nperhaps even more disconcerting, al Shebaab has recruited a number of \nAmericans to travel to the region and fight. In October 2008, a Somali-\nAmerican blew himself up in Somalia as part of a coordinated attack by \nal Shebaab. The Justice Department has since brought terrorist charges \nagainst more than a dozen people for recruiting and raising funds for \nAmericans to fight with al Shebaab.\n  These developments have not gone unnoticed by our national security \nleaders, and the Obama administration has rightly put greater focus on \nSomalia. But our policy toward the country still lacks a strategic, \nlong-term vision, and sufficient resources. The Obama administration is \nproviding some support to the Transitional Federal Government and to \nthe AU peacekeeping force in Mogadishu, but this support has done \nlittle to change the fundamental dynamics of the situation. We need to \ngo back to the drawing board and develop a strategy that directly \ntargets the conflicts and conditions that are bolstering al Shebaab \nand, by extension, al-Qaida. That strategy may entail greater support \nfor the TFG and AMISOM, but we may also need to explore alternative \noptions.\n  To carry out such a strategy, we need a diplomatic effort equal to \nthe challenges we face in Somalia. We need an increased, strengthened \nteam with the necessary resources, access, and mandate to engage with \nactors in Somalia and across the wider region. I have called on the \nPresident and Secretary of State to appoint a senior envoy to help \noversee such a diplomatic effort toward Somalia. Such an envoy could \nalso advance much needed public diplomacy efforts to address the high \nlevel of suspicion and resentment with which many Somalis continue to \nview the United States. And finally, this person could help ensure that \nwe are connecting the dots among all the other countries affected by \nthe Somalia crisis and al Shebaab.\n  Mr. President, there are no easy or quick solutions to Somalia's \ntroubles, and attempts by external actors to impose solutions have \nfailed. But as the tragic events in Uganda this week should make clear, \nthe current situation in Somalia is intolerable--for the region and the \ninternational community, not to mention the Somali people who continue \nto suffer one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. We cannot \nafford to just continue with our current halfhearted efforts and hope \nfor the best. Working with our regional partners and others in the \ninternational community, we need to get serious about a new push for \npeace and stability in Somalia.\n\n[[Page S5956]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5956-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5956-S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n               OSCE PARLIMENTARY ASSEMBLY SESSION IN OSLO\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I want to report on the activities of a \nbicameral, bipartisan congressional delegation I had the privilege to \nlead last week as chairman of the Helsinki Commission. The purpose of \nthe trip was to represent the United States at the 19th Annual Session \nof the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and \nCooperation in Europe, otherwise known as the OSCE PA. The annual \nsession this year was held in Oslo, Norway, and the U.S. delegation \nparticipated fully in the assembly's standing committee, the plenary \nsessions, the three general committees and numerous side events that \nincluded discussion of integration in multiethnic societies and \naddressing gender imbalances in society.\n  Although some last-minute developments at home compelled him to \nremain behind, our colleague from the other Chamber, Mr. Alcee Hastings \nof Florida, was present in spirit as the deputy head of the delegation. \nMr. Hastings, who cochairs the Helsinki Commission, was very active in \nthe preparations for the trip, and his legacy of leadership in the OSCE \nPA--for over a decade--is tangible in the respect and goodwill afforded \nthe United States during the proceedings.\n  Our assistant majority leader, Mr. Durbin of Illinois, joined me on \nthe trip, as he did last year. Our colleague from New Mexico who serves \nas a fellow Helsinki Commissioner, Mr. Udall, also participated. \nHelsinki Commissioners from the other Chamber who were on the \ndelegation include Mr. Christopher Smith of New Jersey, serving as the \nranking member of the delegation, as well as Mrs. Louise McIntosh \nSlaughter of New York, and Mr. Robert Aderholt of Alabama. Although not \na member of the Helsinki Commission, Mr. Lloyd Doggett of Texas has a \nlongstanding interest in OSCE-related issues and also participated on \nthe delegation.\n  As many of you know, the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly was created \nwithin the framework of the OSCE as an independent, consultative body \nconsisting of over 300 Parliamentarians from virtually every country in \nEurope, including the Caucasus, as well as from Central Asia, and the \nUnited States, and Canada. The annual sessions are held in late June/\nearly July as the chief venue for debating issues of the day and \nissuing a declaration addressing human rights, democratic development \nand the rule of law; economic cooperation and environmental protection; \nand confidence building and security among the participating states and \nglobally.\n  This active congressional participation helps ensure that matters of \ninterest to the United States are raised and discussed. Robust U.S. \nengagement has been the hallmark of the Parliamentary Assembly since \nits inception nearly 20 years ago.\n  The theme for this year's annual session was ``Rule of Law: Combating \nTransnational Crime and Corruption.'' In addition to resolutions for \neach of the three general committees, delegations introduced a total of \n35 additional resolutions for consideration, a record number, including \n4 by the United States dealing with:\n  Nuclear security, which followed up directly on the Nuclear Summit \nhere in Washington in April;\n  The protection of investigative journalists, a critical human rights \nissue as those who seek to expose corruption are targeted for \nharassment or worse;\n  Mediterranean cooperation, building on the OSCE partnerships to \nengage important countries in North Africa and the Middle East; and\n  Combating the demand for human trafficking and electronic forms of \nexploitation, a longstanding Helsinki Commission issue requiring \npersistence and targeted action.\n  U.S. drafts on these relevant, important topics received widespread \nsupport and were adopted with few if any amendments.\n  Beyond these resolutions, the United States delegation also undertook \ninitiatives in the form of packages of amendments to other resolutions. \nThese initiatives addressed:\n  the needs of the people of Afghanistan in light of the smuggling and \nother criminal activity which takes place there;\n  the struggle for recovery stability and human rights in Kyrgyzstan, \nwhich is an OSCE state in the midst of crisis; and\n  manifestations of racism and xenophobia that have become particularly \nprevalent in contemporary Europe.\n  A critical U.S. amendment allowed us generally to support a French \nresolution that usefully addressed issues relating to the closure of \nthe detention facility in Guantanamo Bay. Still other amendments coming \nfrom specific members of the U.S. Delegation covered a wide range of \npolitical, environmental and social issues relevant to policymakers. My \ncolleagues and I were also active in the successful countering of \namendments that would have steered resolutions on the Middle East and \non the future of the OSCE multilateral diplomatic process in directions \ncontrary to U.S. policy.\n  Beyond the consideration of the resolutions which now comprise the \nOslo Declaration, the annual session also handled some important \naffairs for the OSCE PA itself. These, too, had relevance for U.S. \npolicy interests:\n  the American serving as OSCE PA Secretary General, Spencer Oliver, \nwas reappointed to a new 5-year term;\n  a modest--and for the third fiscal year in a row--frozen OSCE PA \nbudget of about $3\\1/2\\ million was approved that requires continued \nand unparalleled efficiency in organizing additional conferences, \nelection observation missions, and various other activities that keep \nthe Parliamentary Assembly prominently engaged in European and Central \nAsian affairs;\n  in addition to my continued tenure as a vice president in the \nParliamentary Assembly, Mr. Aderholt of Alabama was reelected as the \nvice chair of the general committee dealing with democracy, human \nrights, and humanitarian questions which ensures strong U.S. \nrepresentation in OSCE PA decisionmaking; and\n  a Greek parliamentary leader defeated a prominent Canadian senator in \nthe election of a new OSCE PA president, following a vigorous but \nfriendly campaign that encouraged the assembly to take a fresh look at \nitself and establish a clearer vision for its future.\n  While the congressional delegation's work focused heavily on \nrepresenting the United States at the OSCE PA, we tried to use our \npresence in Europe to advance U.S. interests and express U.S. concerns \nmore broadly. The meeting took place in Norway, a very close friend and \nstrong, long-time ally of the United States of America. In discussions \nwith Norwegian officials, we expressed our sorrow over the recent \ndeaths of Norwegian soldiers in Afghanistan. We also shared our \nconcerns about climate change and particularly the impact global \nwarming has on polar regions\n  Indeed, on our return we made a well received stop on the archipelago \nof Svalbard, well north of the Arctic Circle, to learn more about the \nimpact firsthand, from changing commercial shipping lanes to relocated \nfisheries to ecological imbalance that make far northern flora and \nfauna increasingly vulnerable. The delegation also visited the Svalbard \nGlobal Seed Vault, a facility that preserves more than 525,000 types of \nseeds from all over the world as a safeguard for future crop diversity, \nand took the opportunity to donate additional U.S. seeds to the \ncollection.\n  Norway is located close to a newer, but also very strong, ally with \nclose ties to the United States, Estonia. Since last year's delegation \nto the OSCE PA Annual Session went to Lithuania and included Latvia as \na side trip, I believed it was important to utilize the opportunity of \nreturning to northern Europe to visit this Baltic state as well.\n  While some remained in Oslo to represent the United States, others \ntraveled to Tallinn, where we had meetings with the President, Prime \nMinister, and other senior government officials, visited the NATO \nCooperative Cyber-Defense Center of Excellence and were briefed on \nelectronic networking systems that make parliament and government more \ntransparent, efficient and accessible to the citizen. Estonia has come \na long way since it reestablished its independence from the Soviet \nUnion almost 20 years ago, making the visit quite rewarding for those \nof us on the Helsinki Commission who tried to keep a spotlight on the \nBaltic States during the dark days of the Cold War.\n  During the course of the meeting, the U.S. delegation also had \nbilateral\n\n[[Page S5957]]\n\nmeetings with the delegation of the Russian Federation and a visiting \ndelegation from Kyrgyzstan to discuss issues of mutual concern and \ninterest.\n  U.S. engagement in the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly sends a clear \nmessage to those who are our friends and to those who are not that we \nwill defend U.S. interests and advance the causes of peace and \nprosperity around the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5957-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING NATALIA ESTEMIROVA\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, on July 15, 2009, Natalia Estemirova, head \nof the Memorial Human Rights Center in Grozny, Chechnya, was abducted \nfrom her home and murdered. Estemirova belonged to a tradition of \nRussian heroism, persevering for truth and justice in spite of great \ndanger, but she deserves recognition from all nations.\n  Today, as we commemorate the 1-year anniversary of her tragic \npassing, it is fitting to recall the words of the Memorial's founder, \nAndrei Sakharov:\n\n       You always have to be aware of [your ideals], even if there \n     is no direct path to their realization. Were there no ideals, \n     there would be no hope whatsoever. Then everything would be \n     hopelessness, darkness--a blind alley.\n\n  In her life and in her work, Estemirova radiated hope in the face of \nadversity, and was steadfast in her ideals even when pursuing them \nentailed great risk and personal sacrifice.\n  Natalia Estemirova was born in 1958 to a Russian mother and a Chechen \nfather, embodying in her parentage what was to become her life's \ncalling: reconciling both peoples through her keen sense of justice and \nsingular commitment to the truth. A widow and a mother, a teacher and \nan advocate, Estemirova found her purest voice in Chechnya. Her \nreporting on the second Chechen war and its aftermath exposed countless \nabuses committed by both sides, and provided an invaluable source of \ninformation to the outside world.\n  Estemirova was no stranger to controversy. On more than one occasion, \nher work raised the ire of the local authorities, and twice she was \nforced to flee her homeland. But Estemirova was not one to surrender to \nfear. It is said that above all she was motivated by the love of her \ndaughter, Lana, and the desire to help the victims of Chechnya's tragic \nwars.\n  And help other people she did. From the wrongly accused in need of \nlegal assistance to the families in search of their loved ones, \nEstemirova provided solace and service to generations of Russians. She \npursued hidden graves, requested investigations from the authorities, \nand gave voice to Chechens by bringing their cases to the European \nCourt of Human Rights.\n  Estemirova knew better than anyone about the tenuous stability that \nreigns in Chechnya. She knew that corruption there could spread to \nneighboring provinces and corrode the institutions of the Russian \nstate. She knew that violence and instability are seldom contained \nwithin internationally recognized borders. And she believed that \njustice for victims must be at the center of any effort to rebuild \nsocieties devastated by war.\n  On this day, we are called to remember Estemirova's generosity of \nspirit and dedication of purpose in spite of the many blind alleys that \nconfronted her in life. Her voice may be silenced, but her message of \nhope and reconciliation endure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5957-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5957]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO BLANQUITA CULLUM\n\n Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, as Blanquita Cullum's service as \nGovernor on the Broadcasting Board of Governors comes to an end, I wish \nto make note of her untiring efforts to maintain United States \ninternational broadcasting during times of enormous pressures.\n  Throughout her tenure, Blanquita Cullum has been a champion for the \nmission of American international broadcasting, but also for the \naudiences who rely upon our international broadcasts for credible, \nauthoritative, accurate and factual news and information.\n  Chief among her concerns has been for the continuation of U.S. \ninternational radio broadcasts, the form of communication which to this \nday remains the most readily accessible and cost-effective means of \ncommunication for billions of oppressed people living in poverty.\n  In our technologically driven consumer society, it escapes our \nattention that almost two billion people make less than $2 a day. \nBlanquita Cullum has insisted, often in the face of resistance, that \nthese populations not be abandoned and their fate left to chance.\n  In addition, she has argued strongly that cuts not be made to \ncritical strategic regions of the world where regions are often one \nincident away from open conflict. She was among those calling for the \nresumption of United States international broadcasts to Russia. This \ncall to action was given added impetus during the armed conflict \nbetween Russia and the Republic of Georgia, days after U.S. \ninternational broadcasts to Russia were ended. Even though the other \nmembers of the Board inexplicably refused to restore Russian \nbroadcasts, Blanquita Cullum's forceful arguments helped avert their \nplanned termination of U.S. broadcasts to the Republic of Georgia and \nthe Ukraine.\n  Blanquita Cullum has global vision. International terrorism and other \nthreats to the United States are globalized. We ignore this fact at our \nown risk. For example, she has argued strongly for a more robust \npresence of U.S. international broadcasting to Latin America, including \ntargeted broadcasts to Cuba, Venezuela, and other audiences whose \nairwaves are saturated with antidemocracy sentiments and propaganda.\n  Further, she has strongly argued for increased oversight and \naccountability with regard to U.S. international broadcasting, \nrecognizing the importance of our broadcasts being above reproach. In \nthe course of my own investigations, I discovered VOA broadcasts to \nIran that undermined U.S. policy and gave a platform for the propaganda \nof our enemies. U.S. broadcasts in Arabic have also given uninterrupted \nand unchallenged platforms to terrorists and other enemies of the U.S. \nand our allies. Blanquita Cullum was the only Governor to support my \nand my colleagues' calls for greater transparency and accountability in \nour broadcasts--an ongoing need that has yet to be adequately \nrectified.\n  In the Asian sphere, she resisted efforts by the BBG bureaucracy to \nreduce the agency's Tibetan broadcasts and made certain that broadcasts \nto Burma during its violent crackdown of pro-democracy advocates were \nnot interrupted.\n  Long before it became a topic of urgency, Blanquita Cullum recognized \nthe importance of cybersecurity and argued for increased vigilance on \nthe part of the agency's technical component to take measures necessary \nto ensure that BBG broadcasts and Internet assets were protected \nagainst such threats.\n  Finally, it is a secret to no one that Blanquita Cullum has been a \nstrong believer in the human component of the agency's operations. She \nhas enjoyed an engaged relationship with the agency's employees and \nbristled over the agency's poor showing in the annual Human Capital \nSurvey. An organization that cannot command the confidence of its staff \nis not likely to be fully engaged with the audiences it portends to \nserve.\n  One needs to look no further than Governor Blanquita Cullum as the \nmodel of unselfish public service in the National and Public Interest. \nShe will be sorely missed by those at the BBG and in Congress who still \nbelieve in the original purpose of U.S. international broadcasting. The \nnew Board of Governors will have a challenge ahead of them as they \nattempt to fill her shoes and continue her efforts to reform U.S. \nInternational Broadcasting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5957-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5957-S5958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO LEANNE MEDEMA\n\n Mr. CRAPO.

Leanne Medema has spent close to 20 years working on \nbehalf of Idaho's nuclear research industry, and she has been a \nterrific asset to local contractors as well as to the Idaho \ncongressional delegation over the years.\n\n[[Page S5958]]\n\n  Leanne came to Idaho from Illinois in the early 1990s and helped \nmanage a complex and very public transition with one of the Idaho \nNational Laboratory's facilities, INL, the Idaho Chemical Processing \nPlant. She has spent 30 years working to improve the working \nenvironment of the companies who have employed her. And she has \nsucceeded admirably. She has a personable manner that makes everyone \nfeel comfortable, and she has an unerring sense of how best to resolve \nconflicts and address other challenges.\n  Most recently, Leanne worked as the protocol officer at the INL, \nwhich was a terrific fit. She always handled herself well and dealt \nwith tough situations without ever losing her poise.\n  INL's reputation has increased nationally and internationally, and \nLeanne's efforts have been essential to the process. She always goes \nabove and beyond to make sure each visitor to INL feels like they are a \nspecial guest.\n  We have particularly appreciated Leanne's relationship with our own \nSenate offices. Her professionalism was always top notch, her knowledge \nof the INL is superb and her ability to communicate and work easily \nwith others is among the finest we have seen. When schedules are tight \nand people were stressed, Leanne had the ability to rise above it all \nand navigate the pitfalls with style, grace and ease.\n  We would be remiss if we didn't mention Leanne and her family and \ntheir involvement in the local community. She was an active volunteer \nwith the Idaho Falls Chamber of Commerce serving as co-chair on the \nLegislative Committee and always did an outstanding job in each of her \nassignments.\n  As she nears retirement, we join many others in thanking her for her \nservice to her community and the state of Idaho. She has done an \noutstanding job at the INL, one that will be hard for others to fill. \nWe wish her the best in her retirement, knowing that she isn't one to \nstay still for long.

ROBINSON\n\n    \n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate William L. \nRobinson as he celebrates 28 years as pastor of First Baptist Church in \nNorth Little Rock. First Baptist is the oldest Black church in North \nLittle Rock, and under Pastor Robinson's leadership, the congregation \nhas thrived for nearly 30 years.\n  From a young age, Pastor Robinson knew his calling. At the age of 12, \nhe was licensed by Dr. T. M. Chambers, then Pastor of Gaines Street \nBaptist Church in Little Rock. In 1977, at the age of 17, Pastor \nRobinson became an ordained minister.\n  An Arkansas native, Pastor Robinson graduated from historic Little \nRock Central High School and earned a bachelor of arts degree in social \nsciences from Arkansas Baptist College in Little Rock. He is a graduate \nof Jackson Theological Seminary of Shorter College in North Little \nRock.\n  Recognized as a pillar of the North Little Rock community, Pastor \nRobinson has been asked to serve in a variety of statewide commissions \nand leadership roles, including the Martin Luther King Jr. Commission, \nthe Board of Trustees of the William F. Laman Library Commission, and \nthe Executive Board of the Union Rescue Mission and Salvation Army. \nPastor Robinson is an Honorary Deputy Sheriff of Pulaski County and a \nChaplain of the North Little Rock Police and Sheriff's Office.\n  Pastor Robinson has also been invited to take part in numerous \ninaugurations and official events in Arkansas and Washington, DC. He is \nthe visionary of the recently reestablished ``4'' Church Fellowship and \nserves currently as president. This fellowship consists of local \nchurches coming together to uplift our Savior and the community through \nquarterly worship services. Most recently, Pastor Robinson served as \ncochairman of the First Interfaith Christian Conference, ``The Arkansas \nGathering,'' featuring nationally known pastors and more than 100 local \npastors and their churches for a 4-day retreat.\n  Pastor Robinson is also a local radio personality in his own right. \nFor more than 26 years, he has promoted First Baptist's ``Sunday \nMorning at The First,''' a 1 hour broadcast that airs Sunday evening at \n5 p.m., reaching all four corners of Arkansas.\n  I salute Pastor Robinson and the work he does for North Little Rock \nand the entire state of Arkansas.

Dr. Bourland won the award for his innovative cotton \nbreeding achievements.\n  The Cotton Researcher of the Year award was started in 2009 to help \nraise awareness of the importance of research to the improvement of the \ncotton industry and to provide international recognition of exceptional \nachievements. Dr. Bourland will receive a trophy and $1,000 prize.\n  I commend Dr. Bourland for his research, which benefits Arkansas's \nentire cotton farming community. Through his efforts, he represents the \nbest of our Arkansas values: hard work, dedication, and perseverance. \nHe also inspires the next generation of Arkansas leaders as a member of \nthe UA team.\n  As an Arkansas farmer's daughter, and as chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, I understand firsthand and appreciate the hard \nwork and contributions of our Arkansas agriculture community. \nAgriculture is the backbone of Arkansas's economy, creating more than \n270,000 jobs in the state and providing $9.1 billion in wages and \nsalaries. In total, agriculture contributes roughly $15.9 billion to \nthe Arkansas economy each year.\n  I salute Dr. Bourland and the entire Arkansas agriculture community \nfor their hard work and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5958-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ROGERS-LOWELL AREA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today I congratulate Mr. J. David \nDaniel, a resident of my home State, as he nears the end of his term as \nthe 105th chairman of the Nation's largest insurance association, the \nIndependent Insurance Agents & Brokers of America, IIABA. Mr. Daniel \nwas elected to the IIABA's executive committee in 2004 and was \ninstalled as the association's chairman last September.\n  Founded in 1896, IIABA, or the Big ``I'' as it is better known, is \nthe Nation's oldest and largest association of independent insurance \nagents and brokers, representing a network of more than 300,000 agents, \nbrokers, and their employees. During his term as chairman of the Big \n``I,'' David Daniel has been a leader on a number of issues for the \nassociation including health care overhaul legislation and financial \nservices regulatory reform. In a time of tectonic shifts in the \nfinancial services industry landscape, Mr. Daniel has proven to be a \nstrong leader and a steady hand for the association and the insurance \nindustry as a whole.\n  David Daniel is president of Daniel and Eustis Insurance in Baton \nRouge, LA. Prior to his election to the IIABA Executive Committee in \n2004, he served on the board of directors of the Independent Insurance \nAgents & Brokers of Louisiana, IIABL, for eight years before becoming \npresident in 1997. Daniel served as Louisiana's national board director \nbeginning in 1998 and has acted as the State association's \nrepresentative to the Louisiana Insurance Rating Commission. Mr. Daniel \nis also the recipient of IIABL's Lifetime Achievement Award and the \nOutstanding Committee Chairman Award. On the national level, Mr. Daniel \nhas served on IIABA's Technical Affairs Committee and was chairman of \nthe Governance and Communication Task Force.\n  David Daniel has long been praised for his work in Baton Rouge as \nwell as the insurance industry. For 28 years he has been a member of \nthe Capital City Kiwanis and was once awarded the George R. Hixson \naward for community service. As a pioneering member of the Christmas on \nthe River Committee, Daniel worked to revitalize the riverfront area in \nBaton Rouge. He has been a volunteer youth basketball coach for the \nYMCA and is a founding member of the Vision 21 Foundation, an \norganization that collects and distributes grant money to nonprofit \ngroups in the Baton Rouge area.\n  I would like to sincerely thank David Daniel for his commitment to \nhis profession, his community, and the state of Louisiana. His efforts \nare greatly appreciated, and I wish Mr. Daniel, his wife Janet, and \ntheir family all the best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5959-2", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO JIM FUNK\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Mr. Jim \nFunk for his leadership and dedication to the Louisiana Restaurant \nAssociation. Mr. Funk has served as the president and chief executive \nofficer of the Louisiana Restaurant Association for almost 30 years, \nand announced his retirement earlier this year. I would like to take \nsome time to remark on his work and his contribution to the State of \nLouisiana.\n  First founded in 1946, the Louisiana Restaurant Association promotes, \nprotects, and serves the interests of Louisiana's food service and \nhospitality industry. Now one of the premiere associations in the \nNation, the Louisiana Restaurant Association has grown in membership \nand status with Jim Funk at the helm during the past three decades. \nThrough recessions, hurricanes and the most recent oil spill, Mr. Funk \nhas led the industry through a business climate that has challenged \nLouisiana's restaurants on many levels.\n  Mr. Funk has also been recognized nationally for his success in \nassociation management, for his clout in Louisiana's politics, and for \nhis dedication to culinary education. In 2007, he received the \nindustry's highest honor--induction into the National Restaurant \nAssociation Educational Foundation College of Diplomats. Mr. Funk was \nalso an impressive advocate for the employees of the hospitality \nindustry. As the head of the Louisiana Restaurant Association, he \ncreated the LRA's Self Insurer's Fund for Worker's Compensation, which \nprovides important and necessary insurance to Louisiana restaurants and \ntheir workers. The fund now ensures more than 2,300 restaurants and \nhotels in Louisiana.\n  Mr. Funk also fought to protect the integrity and reputation of \nLouisiana restaurants and food products. At the National Restaurant \nAssociation Show on May 22 of this year, he stressed the need to \nprotect the wetlands and Louisiana's prominent fishing and seafood \nindustry. Having guided the LRA through the devastating destruction of \nHurricane Katrina and the current oilspill threatening our shores, Mr. \nFunk has shown laudable leadership.\n  The profile of Louisiana's restaurants industry and culinary \ntraditions has been significantly enhanced during Mr. Funk's tenure as \npresident of the Louisiana Restaurant Association. Thus, today, I am \nproud to honor Jim Funk and thank him for his dedication to the \nLouisiana Restaurant Association and to the State of Louisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5959-3", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO COLONEL ALVIN B. LEE\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I wish to acknowledge the service \nof COL Alvin B. Lee as he relinquishes command of the New Orleans \nDistrict, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Colonel Lee, the New Orleans \nDistrict's 60th commander and district engineer, took command on July \n20, 2007, and has served in that position for the past 3 years.\n  The New Orleans District is the largest district within the Corps of \nEngineers. The complexity and magnitude of the issues dealt with in \nthis command are staggering. In addition to the normal operating budget \nof $550 million, this district includes the $14 billion hurricane and \nstorm damage risk reduction system, HSDRRS, program for the Greater New \nOrleans Metropolitan area. No other colonel in the Corps of Engineers \nis given responsibility even remotely close to this.\n  Previous to his service as commander, New Orleans District, Colonel \nLee served in other key command and staff positions which include: \nCompany Commander, 317th Engineer Battalion, 3rd Brigade, 24th Infantry \nDivision, Mechanized; Commander, Alaska Projects Office, Cold Regions \nResearch Laboratory; Battalion Executive Officer of the 10th Engineer \nBattalion, and the Engineer Brigade Operations Officer, Third Infantry \nDivision, Mechanized. Colonel Lee also served in Afghanistan during \nOperation Enduring Freedom as the Deputy Commander for the Afghanistan \nEngineer District. This resume serves as a testament to the character \nof Colonel Lee.\n  While it is no secret that I do not see eye-to-eye with the Army \nCorps of Engineers as an organization, I can say that I greatly \nappreciate the efforts of Colonel Lee individually. Colonel Lee earned \nthe respect of many within the local Louisiana communities over the \npast three years through his strong leadership and hard work. He is a \nfine officer who has given much in service to the Nation. I wish him \nwell in future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5959-4", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5959-S5960]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TIMBER LAKE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Illinois urging Congress to \n     pass legislation that would provide financial assistance to \n     those states with budget deficits in order that the length \n     and depth of the recession will not be worsened due to the \n     limited resources and difficult alternatives presently \n     confronting many states; to the Committee on Appropriations.\n\n                        House Resolution No. 551\n\n       Whereas, at this time, the United States is continuing to \n     experience one of the worst economic downturns in its \n     history; and\n       Whereas, the Department of Labor recently reported that the \n     unemployment rate in June rose to a level of 9.5%; and\n       Whereas, approximately 3.5 million jobs have been lost in \n     the United States since the beginning of the year; and\n       Whereas, state governments furnish assistance to the \n     unemployed and also provide direct and indirect services to \n     the neediest people in our communities, including the \n     elderly, the disabled, and the very young; and\n       Whereas, although the American Recovery and Reinvestment \n     Act of 2009 is providing funds to state governments as part \n     of the economic stimulus package designed to spur our \n     nation's economic recovery, the budget deficits of many \n     states have grown significantly, even with the original \n     infusion of federal funds, as shown by the current budget \n     gaps of $26.3 billion in California and approximately $9.2 \n     billion in Illinois; and\n       Whereas, each state with a revenue shortfall faces \n     difficult decisions involving raising taxes and fees on its \n     citizens and businesses that are already adversely affected \n     by the recession and unemployment; reducing financial \n     assistance and grants to educational institutions, local \n     governments, and social service agencies; and laying off \n     significant numbers of employees from the state workforce; \n     and\n\n[[Page S5963]]\n\n       Whereas, the effect of a state, like Illinois, taking one \n     or more of those difficult alternatives may be to worsen the \n     effects of the recession in that state because of higher \n     unemployment, increased state costs of health care for the \n     uninsured, increased numbers of foreclosures, increased state \n     expenditures for unemployment insurance, and lower state tax \n     revenues due to reduced economic activity; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has the resources and the \n     ability to assist states with budget deficits during this \n     difficult time so that the rate of unemployment can be \n     reduced, or at least not increased, and so that educational \n     and social service programs can be continued at current \n     levels; and\n       Whereas, the state budget deficits could be eliminated if \n     Congress passed new legislation, with reasonable repayment \n     requirements, to provide financial assistance to the states \n     with budget deficits; therefore, be it\n       Resolved, by the House of Representatives of the Ninety-\n     sixth General Assembly of the State of Illinois, That we urge \n     Congress to pass legislation that would provide financial \n     assistance to those states with budget deficits in order that \n     the length and depth of the recession will not be worsened \n     due to the limited resources and difficult alternatives \n     presently confronting many states; and be it further\n       Resolved, That suitable copies of this resolution be \n     presented to President Barack Obama, the Speaker of the \n     United States House of Representatives, the President pro \n     tempore of the United States Senate, and each member of the \n     Illinois congressional delegation.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-l29. A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     Louisiana urging the President of the United States, \n     Congress, and the Federal Communications Commission to \n     refrain from regulating Internet broadband services as common \n     carrier services under Title II of the Communications Act of \n     1934; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 117\n\n       To memorialize the president of the United States, the \n     United States Congress, and the Federal Communications \n     Commission to refrain from regulating Internet broadband \n     services as common carrier services under Title II of the \n     Communications Act of 1934.\n       Whereas, due in large part to the unregulated efforts of \n     private enterprise over the past twenty-five years, the \n     development of the Internet has dramatically transformed the \n     way Louisiana citizens work, live, and learn; and\n       Whereas, the deployment of efficient, fast, and reliable \n     broadband networks throughout the state has created thousands \n     of jobs and many benefits for local economies; and\n       Whereas, in order to encourage the growth and development \n     of the Internet, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) \n     historically has refrained from regulating broadband Internet \n     services as common carrier services under Title II of the \n     Communications Act of 1934; and\n       Whereas, as a result, the United States has been at the \n     forefront of technological, business, and social innovation \n     on the Internet; and\n       Whereas, on May 6, 2010, the chairman of the FCC announced \n     a policy to reclassify broadband Internet services as common \n     carrier services so that they can be more tightly regulated, \n     with a proposal to forebear from imposing certain common \n     carrier obligations on broadband Internet providers; and\n       Whereas, using antiquated provisions of Title II of the \n     Communications Act of 1934 to regulate the Internet will slow \n     investment in Louisiana's Internet broadband infrastructure \n     and jeopardize future job growth. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the Legislature of Louisiana \n     memorializes the president of the United States, the United \n     States Congress, and the Federal Communications Commission to \n     refrain from regulating Internet broadband services as common \n     carrier services under Title II of the Communications Act of \n     1934. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the president of the United States, to the presiding officers \n     of the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United \n     States Congress, to each member of the Louisiana \n     congressional delegation, and to the chairman of the Federal \n     Communications Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-130. A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Louisiana urging Congress to support \n     expansion and use of domestic natural gas reserves and \n     alternative energies to reduce our reliance on imported oil \n     by supporting H.R. 1835 and S. 1408; to the Committee on \n     Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                   Senate Concurrent Resolution No. 8\n\n       To memorialize the United States Congress to support \n     expansion and use of domestic natural gas and alternative \n     energies, and to urge agencies to operate vehicles using \n     compressed natural gas.\n       Whereas, the United States imports more than sixty-five \n     percent of its petroleum, two-thirds of which is used in the \n     form of gasoline and diesel fuel to power vehicles; and\n       Whereas, a large percentage of worldwide petroleum reserves \n     are located in politically volatile countries, making the \n     United States vulnerable to supply disruptions; and\n       Whereas, the United States has an abundance of natural gas; \n     and\n       Whereas, compressed natural gas provides safe, clean, \n     reliable, efficient, and secure energy, and is the \n     alternative fuel most used today for transportation in the \n     United States, with more than two hundred thousand buses, \n     taxis, delivery vehicles, and other fleet vehicles across the \n     nation using compressed natural gas daily; and\n       Whereas, the United States Department of Energy indicates \n     that compressed natural gas can be used as a replacement for \n     gasoline in light-duty vehicles and as a replacement for \n     diesel in heavy-duty vehicles; and\n       Whereas, vehicles powered by compressed natural gas \n     discharge far fewer harmful emissions than vehicles powered \n     by gasoline or diesel fuel; and\n       Whereas, studies indicate that maintenance costs for \n     vehicles powered by compressed natural gas are lower than for \n     vehicles powered by gasoline or diesel fuel; and\n       Whereas, the federal government currently provides, and is \n     expected to increase, incentives for use of alternative fuels \n     and, at the current price of various fuels, any additional \n     costs to purchase vehicles to run on compressed natural gas \n     would be quickly recouped; and\n       Whereas, in 2009, the United States imported four billion, \n     three hundred and fifty million barrels of oil, spending \n     roughly two hundred and sixty-five million dollars; and\n       Whereas, eighty-five million barrels of oil were produced \n     daily around the world; and\n       Whereas, twenty-one million barrels of oil are used daily \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas, world oil production has been declining since \n     2005; and\n       Whereas, roughly twenty percent of every barrel of oil \n     imported into the United States is used to fuel the transport \n     of goods around the country by road. Therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana memorializes \n     the United States Congress to support expansion and use of \n     domestic natural gas reserves and alternative energies to \n     reduce our reliance on imported oil by supporting H.R. 1835 \n     and S. 1408, which are under consideration by the United \n     States Congress. Be it further\n       Resolved, That the Legislature of Louisiana urges state and \n     federal agencies to purchase, when possible, vehicles that \n     can be converted to run on compressed natural gas, when it is \n     available. Be it further\n       Resolved, That a copy of this Resolution be transmitted to \n     the secretary of the United States Senate and the clerk of \n     the United States House of Representatives, and to each \n     member of the Louisiana delegation to the United States \n     Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/07/15/senate-section/article/S5963-1", "month": "07", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. KOHL, from the Committee on Appropriations, without \n     amendment:\n       S. 3606.

A bill to require the Federal Government to pay the costs \nincurred by a State or local government in defending a State or local \nimmigration law that survives a constitutional challenge by the Federal \nGovernment in Federal court; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to discuss a bill I have \nintroduced because I see a very unfair battle unfolding right in front \nof us. The battle I foresee is this: In one corner we have the enormous \nresources of the Federal Government; in the other corner, cities and \nStates with very limited resources, especially in these economic times, \nbut with a good-faith desire to protect their communities.\n  What I am speaking of today and what my legislation goes to is the \nFederal Government's use of litigation to insert itself into State and \npotentially local immigration laws.\n  I rise with a great deal of knowledge about this. As a former mayor \nand county commissioner, city council member and Governor, I know what \nit is like when the Federal Government swoops in and brings its power \nto bear on an issue. I have seen it from both sides, having also served \nas a member of the President's Cabinet. I know that when the resources \nof the Federal Government are used to weigh in with litigation, it is \ncrushing. The administration can send in a team of lawyers and \noverwhelm the resources of a community or a State. Litigation brings \nwith it a huge financial burden for cities and States. In fact, \nlitigation can and does have a chilling effect on the local \ndecisionmaking process, even if local leaders believe their action in \ngood faith is appropriate and necessary.\n  I believe that is the exact reaction this administration is hoping to \ncause among communities and States across the Nation that are \nconsidering action on immigration issues.\n  In this case, I believe litigation is being used to send a warning to \nother communities, other States that might be considering taking action \nin this arena.\n  The administration's claim that the Federal Government has sole \nauthority to enforce immigration laws because of the supremacy clause \nof the Constitution is, in fact, inconsistent with the President's own \ninternal policies. Just last year, President Obama authored a memo, \nsent it out to all Federal departments and agencies, requiring serious \nand careful consideration when using Federal preemption of State laws.\n  In this memo, dated May 20, 2009, with the subject ``Preemption,'' \nthe President stated:\n\n       The purpose of this memorandum is to state the general \n     policy of my Administration that preemption of State law by \n     executive departments and agencies should be taken only with \n     full consideration of legitimate prerogatives of the States \n     and with sufficient legal basis for preemption.\n\n  That seems clear. But the memo went on further to say:\n\n       Executive departments and agencies should be mindful that \n     in our Federal system, the citizens of the several States \n     have distinctive circumstances and values, and that in many \n     instances it is appropriate for them to apply to themselves \n     rules and principles that reflect those circumstances and \n     values.\n  Then, finally, the President goes on to say:\n\n       It is one of the happy incidents of the federal system that \n     a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, serve \n     as a laboratory; and try novel social experimental \n     experiments without risk to the rest of the country.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of this memo be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  The White House,\n\n\n                                Office of the Press Secretary,\n\n                                                     May 20, 2009.\n\n     Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies\n\n     Subject: Preemption\n\n       From our Nation's founding, the American constitutional \n     order has been a Federal system, ensuring a strong role for \n     both the national Government and the States. The Federal \n     Government's role in promoting the general welfare and \n     guarding individual liberties is critical, but State law and \n     national law often operate concurrently to provide \n     independent safeguards for the public. Throughout our \n     history, State and local governments have frequently \n     protected health, safety, and the environment more \n     aggressively than has the national Government.\n       An understanding of the important role of State governments \n     in our Federal system is reflected in longstanding practices \n     by executive departments and agencies, which have shown \n     respect for the traditional prerogatives of the States. In \n     recent years, however, notwithstanding Executive Order 13132 \n     of August 4, 1999 (Federalism), executive departments and \n     agencies have sometimes announced that their regulations \n     preempt State law, including State common law, without \n     explicit preemption by the Congress or an otherwise \n     sufficient basis under applicable legal principles.\n       The purpose of this memorandum is to state the general \n     policy of my Administration that preemption of State law by \n     executive departments and agencies should be undertaken only \n     with full consideration of the legitimate prerogatives of the \n     States and with a sufficient legal basis for preemption. \n     Executive departments and agencies should be mindful that in \n     our Federal system, the citizens of the several States have \n     distinctive circumstances and values, and that in many \n     instances it is appropriate for them to apply to themselves \n     rules and principles that reflect these circumstances and \n     values. As Justice Brandeis explained more than 70 years ago, \n     ``[i]t is one of the happy incidents of the federal system \n     that a single courageous state may, if its citizens choose, \n     serve as a laboratory; and try novel social and economic \n     experiments without risk to the rest of the country.''\n       To ensure that executive departments and agencies include \n     statements of preemption in regulations only when such \n     statements have a sufficient legal basis:\n       (1) Heads of departments and agencies should not include in \n     regulatory preambles statements that the department or agency \n     intends to preempt State law through the regulation except \n     where preemption provisions are also included in the codified \n     regulation.\n       (2) Heads of departments and agencies should not include \n     preemption provisions in codified regulations except where \n     such provisions would be justified under legal principles \n     governing preemption, including the principles outlined in \n     Executive Order 13132.\n       (3) Heads of departments and agencies should review \n     regulations issued within the past 10 years that contain \n     statements in regulatory preambles or codified provisions \n     intended by the department or agency to preempt State law, in \n     order to decide whether such statements or provisions are \n     justified under applicable legal principles governing \n     preemption. Where the head of a department or agency \n     determines that a regulatory statement of preemption or \n     codified regulatory provision cannot be so justified, the \n     head of that department or agency should initiate appropriate \n     action, which may include amendment of the relevant \n     regulation.\n       Executive departments and agencies shall carry out the \n     provisions of this memorandum to the extent permitted by law \n     and consistent with their statutory authorities. Heads of \n     departments and agencies should consult as necessary with the \n     Attorney General and the Office of Management and Budget's \n     Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs to determine how \n     the requirements of this memorandum apply to particular \n     situations.\n       This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create \n     any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable \n     at law or in equity by any party against the United States, \n     its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, \n     employees, or agents, or any other person.\n       The Director of the Office of Management and Budget is \n     authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the \n     Federal Register.\n                                                     Barack Obama.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. So if the use of Federal power to preempt a State \nrequires such an extremely high threshold, how can one reconcile that \nwith the administration's decision to file a lawsuit?\n  My bill sends a message to the administration that it cannot use the \ncrushing force and threat and reality of litigation to intimidate local \nofficials or to scare them into inaction.\n  It would allow a State or a municipal government the ability, the \nright, to recover attorney's fees and other court costs associated with \ndefending a Federal challenge of their immigration laws. In other \nwords, this straightforward legislation just simply levels\n\n[[Page S5967]]\n\nthe playing field between the huge power of the Federal Government in \none corner, as I said, and the right of local communities in States to \npass laws to protect their citizens.\n  It carries this simple message to any administration: If you file a \nlawsuit and lose, cities and States will not face depleted resources as \na result.\n  My bill ensures that when the Federal Government takes on communities \nin court, the reasons are pure and based in law or else the impact on \nour communities will be neutralized.\n  The administration should focus time and resources on what is the \ncrux of this issue; that is, securing our borders and doing the job and \nenforcing existing immigration laws and not using litigation as a tool \nto send a message.\n  I encourage my colleagues to sign on and cosponsor this commonsense \nmeasure and level the playing field for communities when they are \nforced to defend themselves against the enormous, nearly unlimited \npower of the Federal Government.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON of Florida:\n  S. 3594. A bill to amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation \nand Management Act to mitigate the economic impact of the transition to \nsustainable fisheries on fishing communities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I would like to speak about \nfishing, a very important special pastime and industry for the Nation. \nFishing in Florida is a way of life for many. The small bait and tackle \nshops, the hotels, the restaurants, the charter boat captains, and the \nparents who want to see their children marvel when they pull a fish out \nof the ocean for the first time rely on being able to access the water. \nIn fact, just last week, a Washington Post article traced the path of \nfish caught in the Florida Keys and off of Florida's East Coast to a \nWhole Foods market here in the DC area. And sadly, the Deepwater \nHorizon has shown us how much healthy, high-quality seafood comes out \nof the Gulf of Mexico every year.\n  In 2007, the Congress reauthorized the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery \nConservation and Management Act. The Magnuson Act has certainly done \nsome good things to ensure the long-term viability of our Nation's \nfishery resources. But some of the provisions of the law have had major \nunintended consequences in Florida.\n  I have spoken before about the need for robust science on the status \nof our oceans and our fishery stocks. In fact, most recently, I worked \nwith Gulf Coast Senators to get funding in the Supplemental \nAppropriations bill for fisheries science in the Gulf of Mexico. But \ndespite the potential influx of dollars, fisheries data for the \nSoutheast in particular, is still sparse. This lack of data has lead to \na crisis in confidence amongst many in the fishing community. Here is \nwhy.\n  The 2007 Magnuson-Stevens Reauthorization contained a 2010 deadline \nto end overfishing. But the justification for that deadline rested on \ntwo assumptions. First, that there would be recent and accurate stock \nassessments. Second, that there would be improved catch data. I think \nthe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration is doing the best \nthey can with available resources to gather this data. However, for \nyears good data from recreational anglers has been a challenge but \nbecause of the changes to Magnuson-Stevens, regulations are coming out \nfaster than the data used to support them.\n  Having that hard and fast 2010 deadline created a situation where the \nresource managers are left without options. This has led to closures of \nlarge geographic areas to all fishing with no end on the horizon. These \nclosures have devastated small businesses that rely on fishing and left \nmany frustrated that they cannot access the same waters that they \nalways could.\n  Being a native Floridian, I know that many people develop a love for \nthe ocean and a desire to protect it after they truly experience it by \nswimming, fishing off their boat, or listening to the waves. This \naccess is a necessary component of conservation because the public \ngains a sense of ownership and this leads to a sense of responsibility.\n  That is why I am filing the Fishery Conservation Transition Act \ntoday. The bill will enable individuals, businesses, and communities to \nmake a smooth transition while the science catches up by creating a \nphase-in period for Federal fishing regulations and requiring enhanced \ndata collection in the interim. It also allows for economic assistance \nfor those who are negatively impacted by management measures.\n  Others have proposed different solutions to this problem, but I \nbelieve that my bill is a targeted solution that gives resource \nmanagers options to allow access to the water in a way that will also \nachieve conservation goals.\n  There are provisions in the bill that require fishery managers to use \nthe transition time wisely and research creative solutions to complex \nmanagement issues, like how to manage multispecies fisheries in a way \nthat protects the vulnerable stocks but still allows for access. This \nbill is also about jobs.

A bill to establish the Culture of Safety Hospital \nAccountability Study and Demonstration Program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Culture \nof Safety Hospital Accountability Act. This bill will test alternatives \nto the current, inflexible system to ensure that hospitals are meeting \nthe highest health and safety standards for their patients.\n  Under the current system, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, or \nCMS, requires hospitals participating in Medicare and Medicaid to \ncomply with Conditions of Participation--health and safety standards \nestablished by CMS for the protection of Medicare and Medicaid \nbeneficiaries. CMS contracts with State agencies to perform inspections \nof hospitals, nursing homes, and other health care facilities to ensure \ncompliance.\n  However, there are significant deficiencies in the current system. A \nmajor concern among hospitals is CMS' assignment of Immediate Jeopardy, \nwhich puts hospitals on a 23-day fast-track to losing their Medicare \nand Medicaid funding. Right now, the only remedy that CMS has when a \nhospital receives a citation is termination. There is no flexibility to \nconsider the incident on a case-by-case basis--or even to consider \nwhether the hospital self-reported and immediately corrected the \nincident. Moreover, current procedures fail to consider the substantial \nresources and efforts that hospitals are already investing in quality \nimprovement and patient safety.\n  Take, for example, a hospital in my State, which last year got a 23-\nday termination notice after they self-reported that one of their \nnurses had H1N1. The hospital immediately sent the nurse home and, as I \nmentioned, immediately reported the incident to CMS. Nevertheless, the \nhospital was required to undergo an inspection and submit the requisite \nplan of correction to CMS. The agency was not able to process the \npaperwork until day 22 of the 23-day notice, causing undue stress for \nthe community as they wondered whether the hospital was going to be \nforced to close its doors.\n  In addition to the uncertainty for the hospital, the human resources \nrequired and costs incurred to implement this inflexible system are \nenormous. Once a hospital is cited as out of compliance with their \nCondition of Participation, the State CMS inspectors are required to \nsurvey the entire hospital and any other hospitals under the same CMS \nprovider number. In the case of the hospital I just mentioned, it took \nState inspectors an entire week with 17 staff to survey their hospital \nsystem.\n  To address this inflexibility in the current system, I am introducing \nthe Culture of Safety Hospital Accountability Act. This bill would do \nthree things:\n  First, it would require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nstudy\n\n[[Page S5969]]\n\nexisting quality assurance and patient safety activities within \nhospitals and identify best practices that should be replicated.\n  Second, it would create a demonstration program among hospitals, \nState health care agencies, and HHS to promote and implement best \npractices for improving patient safety and quality of care. HHS would \nidentify up to 6 States and not more than 24 hospitals to participate \nin a 3-year demonstration program.\n  Finally, the bill would authorize the Secretary of HHS to promulgate \nregulations modifying termination agreements regarding health and \nsafety requirements with hospitals and critical access hospitals to \nbetter ensure compliance, prevent recurrence of violations, and improve \ninternal structures and processes that address patient quality and \nsafety.\n  Patient safety must be first and foremost, and it is not the intent \nof the demonstration project to keep CMS or State inspectors out of \nhospitals, nor to impair the remedies CMS needs to address quality \nissues. Instead, the bill will help to explore how CMS, State \nregulatory authorities, and hospitals can work collaboratively to \naddress quality and safety issues in ways that will ensure the best \nquality of care for patients.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 3602. A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to direct the \nSecretary to establish a comprehensive program to control and treat \npolluted stormwater runoff from federally funded highways and roads, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce legislation \nthat will help prevent millions of gallons of pollution from entering \nour Nation's precious water resources. The season we are in makes my \nlegislation particularly timely. Spring is one of the wettest times of \nyear, and with every Spring shower polluted stormwater runoff washes a \nmyriad of chemicals pollutants, sediment, debris, oil and grease, and \nother contaminates from our Nation's roads and highways into our lakes, \nrivers, streams, bays, and coastal waters.\n  Stormwater is the nation's largest source of water pollution. While \nrain itself contains air pollution particulates that are deposited in \nevery drop, most stormwater pollution is picked up on the surface and \ncarried off as runoff. Stormwater washes contaminants like oil, grease, \nheavy metals, nutrients, asbestos, sediments, road salts and other de-\nicing agents, brake dust, and road debris from the millions of miles of \nAmerica's roads and into storm drains that discharge into nearby \nwaters. Almost all of this polluted stormwater is discharged without \nany treatment.\n  When rain falls on these hard, impervious surfaces it often has no \nwhere to go but down the channels created by curbs and retaining walls, \ninto storm drains and into the nearest natural water body. According to \nresearch compiled by the National Oceanic & Atmospheric \nAdministration's, NOAA, National Geophysical Data Center, the U.S. is \ncovered by more than 112,600 square kilometers of impervious surfaces. \nThat is a space larger than the State of Ohio. With 985,139 miles of \nfederal aid highways stretching from every corner of the country, \npolluted highway runoff is no small problem facing our nation's waters.\n  The effects of polluted stormwater runoff are real. For example, the \nAnacostia River--Washington's ``other'' and often forgotten river--can \nbe seen from the Capitol Dome as it flows out of Prince George's \nCounty, Maryland, and into the District and on to its confluence with \nthe Potomac. Runoff from within the 176 square mile watershed of the \nAnacostia, most of which is in Maryland, but also includes the east \nside of DC and the entire Capitol complex, all makes its way into the \nAnacostia. The stormwater that enters the Anacostia is extremely \npolluted from the thousands of acres of road surfaces that cover the \nwatershed, which exacerbates the incidence of combined sewer overflows \nand has impaired the Anacostia for many years. It is no coincidence \nthat the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service has found the Anacostia's bottom-\nfeeder catfish to have the highest incidence of liver tumors than any \nother population of catfish in the country. The cause of the tumors are \nthe high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, a by-product of \nfuel combustion, that come from vehicle tailpipe emissions and are \ndeposited on the road and in the air and then washed into the river \nwith every shower or thunderstorm.\n  This is not a problem unique to Maryland or the Chesapeake Bay \nregion, nor is it a problem unique to urban environments as opposed to \nrural environments. Polluted runoff is a problem that affects any \nwatershed where impervious paved road and highway surfaces have altered \nthe natural hydrology of a watershed. Over time, Federal highway policy \nhas come to recognize the drastic impacts highways and surface \ntransportation can have on the environment and on water quality. Title \n23 of the U.S. Code states: ``transportation should play a significant \nrole in promoting economic growth, improving the environment, and \nsustaining the quality of life'' through the use of ``context sensitive \nsolutions.'' The Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act, \nISTEA, authorized using transportation enhancement funds for \n``environmental mitigation to address water pollution due to highway \nrunoff.'' It's important to note, however, that this is just one of 12 \ntypes of eligible enhancement projects and only 1.1 percent of \nenhancement project funds have gone toward environmental mitigation \nprojects since 1992.\n\n  In 2008, at the request of the House Transportation & Infrastructure \nCommittee, the Government Accountability Office issued a report \nexamining key issues and challenges that need to be addressed in the \nnext reauthorization of the transportation bill. That report \nhighlighted the clear link between transportation policy and the \nenvironment. Taking a policy approach to require that the planning, \ndesign, and construction of highways are done in an environmentally \nresponsible manner, with an eye toward mitigating the water quality \nimpacts highways have on our Nation's water resources, will help \naddress this issue and better meet our Nation's transportation goals. \nThis legislation also helps advance the October 5, 2009, Executive \nOrder affirming that Federal policy and Federal agencies shall \n``conserve and protect water resources through efficiency, reuse, and \nstormwater management; eliminate waste, recycle, and prevent pollution; \nand leverage agency acquisitions to foster markets for sustainable \ntechnologies and environmentally preferable materials, products and \nservices.''\n  The approach my legislation takes to mitigate polluted highway runoff \nis through the implementation of a minimum design standard, developed \nby the United States Department of Transportation, that requires the \nmaintenance or restoration of the pre-development hydrology of a \nFederal-aid highway project site. This same approach was made law by \nthe Energy Independence & Security Act of 2007 for the development of \nnew Federal buildings and facilities.\n  My bill would require that all significant Federal highway projects \nmust be planned and designed ``to maintain or restore, to the maximum \nextent technically feasible, the predevelopment hydrology of the \nproject site with regard to the temperature, rate, chemical \ncomposition, volume and duration of flow'' of stormwater. This would be \nachieved by approaches that avoid and minimize alteration of natural \nfeatures and hydrology and maximize the use of onsite pollution control \nmeasures using existing terrain and natural features.\n  My bill also recognizes that geography and other physical \ncharacteristics of the land may not always allow on-site treatment of \npolluted highway runoff. When conditions are impracticable my \nlegislation would allow for an ``appropriate off-site runoff pollution \nmitigation program'' within the watershed of a Federal-aid highway \nproject site that can protect against the water quality impacts of the \nproject.\n  The Clean Water Act requires that we protect the waters of the United \nStates. As with most pollution abatement strategies, preventing \nstormwater pollution is cheaper, more effective, and easier to \nimplement than trying to clean up and remediate the problem after the \ncontamination has occurred.\n  Not addressing stormwater pollution at its source just kicks the \nproverbial\n\n[[Page S5970]]\n\ncan down the road for someone else's attention. When water resources \nare contaminated by polluted highway runoff, mitigating the pollution, \nwhich is a preventable discharge in the first place, should not be the \nresponsibility of local governments, wastewater treatment facilities, \nor drinking water utilities.\n  Water pollution has many sources and our Nation's highways produce a \ntremendous volume of contaminated stormwater. Time and time again, \nexperience has taught us that addressing pollution at its source is the \nmost effective means of abating pollution. It is time we applied this \nprinciple to our Nation's Federal-aid highways. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport my legislation and help move our country closer to meeting the \ngoals of the Clean Water Act and the goals of our national \ntransportation policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3602\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 to establish \nthe Federal Oil Spill Research Committee and to amend the Federal Water \nPollution Control Act to include in a response plan certain planned and \ndemonstrated investments in research relating to discharges of oil and \nto modify the dates by which a response plan is required to be updated; \nto the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. President, over 21 years ago the tanker Exxon Valdez, en route \nfrom Valdez, Alaska, to Los Angeles, failed to turn back into the \nshipping lane after detouring to avoid ice. At 12:04 a.m., it ran \naground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound.\n\n[[Page S5971]]\n\n  Within six hours, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of \ncrude oil into the Sound's pristine waters and wrote itself into the \nhistory books as--at that time--the worst oil spill ever in U.S. \nwaters. Eventually, oil covered 11,000 square miles of ocean.\n  The environmental and economic damage is impossible to both fathom \nand assess; countless seabirds, marine mammals, and fish were killed. \nAs a result, companies like the Chugach Alaska Corporation went \nbankrupt. There were huge losses to recreational sports, fisheries, and \ntourism. And 21 years later there is still oil in the area.\n  Today, we are re-living a similar nightmare--only this time on an \neven larger scale. The BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, triggered by \nthe explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig and the failure of its \nsafety systems, has shattered all previous records as the single \nlargest marine oil spill in our Nation's history. Even today, oil \ncontinues to gush from the uncapped well, furthering the devastation to \nthe Gulf of Mexico's environment and economy.\n  The Exxon Valdez showed us just how unprepared we were in 1989, and \nthe BP oil spill is showing us today how unprepared we are in 2010. \nWhile the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 has been successful in achieving \nmany of its policy goals, the BP oil spill is proving to us that oil \nspill response technology remains largely stagnant, and that our \nresponse infrastructure remains inadequate.\n  This is why I rise today to introduce the Oil Spill Technology and \nResearch Act.\n  This legislation is designed to address the massive gap in oil spill \nresearch and development that has contributed to our inability to \nrespond to the BP oil spill. It will: put mechanisms in place that will \nfoster continuous research and development on oil spill response \nmethods and technologies; provide an incentive structure for \ntranslating new technologies from ideas into reality; and continuously \nadd new layers to our oil spill safety net.\n  This is an important step in the right direction to improve our \nNation's ability to contain and clean up oil spills in the future.\n  It is a proclamation that we are not going to allow complacency back \nat the wheel, nor are we going to allow politics to get in the way of \ndoing what is right.\n  Twenty-one years ago we saw the devastating costs of complacency, and \nwe are living that nightmare again today. It is up to us to ensure that \nthis country's environment, economy, and people are protected with the \ngreatest rigor that we can muster. Our oceans, coasts, and citizens \ndeserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3603\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE RECESS \n                   APPOINTMENT OF DR. DONALD BERWICK.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 19, 2010, the President nominated Dr. Donald \n     Berwick to serve as the Administrator of the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services (in this section referred to as \n     ``CMS'') in the Department of Health and Human Services. As \n     of that date, the position was vacant for the first 16 months \n     of the Obama Administration.\n       (2) Since that date, Dr. Berwick has been undergoing the \n     bipartisan nomination investigation review process of the \n     Committee on Finance of the Senate (in this section referred \n     to as the ``Senate Finance Committee'') and there has been \n     ongoing activity as the Senate Finance Committee continues to \n     gather and review information from Dr. Berwick.\n       (3) The Senate Finance Committee review process for the \n     Berwick nomination was proceeding normally. A hearing on the \n     nomination of Dr. Berwick had been requested and no \n     objections had been raised to having the hearing.\n       (4) On July 7, 2010, less than 3 months after the \n     nomination and without a Senate Finance Committee hearing \n     taking place, the President recess-appointed Dr. Berwick to \n     serve as the Administrator of CMS. Dr. Berwick was sworn in \n     on July 12, 2010.\n       (5) The appointment of the Administrator of CMS is subject \n     to Senate confirmation under article II, section 2, clause 2 \n     of the Constitution. Dr. Berwick's nomination was referred to \n     the Senate Finance Committee which has jurisdiction over \n     health programs under the Social Security Act and the \n     responsibility to examine Presidential nominees related to \n     these programs.\n       (6) It is especially true that Dr. Berwick's nomination \n     should have undergone the Senate Finance Committee nomination \n     review process in light of the significant responsibilities \n     of the Administrator of CMS.\n       (7) CMS is responsible for the health care of more than \n     100,000,000 Americans, and is one of the largest agencies in \n     the Federal Government.\n       (8) The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (commonly referred to as the ``health care reform \n     law'') significantly increases the responsibilities of CMS, \n     including half a trillion dollars in Medicare provider cuts \n     and the largest expansion of the Medicaid program since its \n     inception.\n       (9) The manner in which an individual nominated to serve as \n     the Administrator of CMS intends to carry out these \n     responsibilities is a serious matter and warrants a thorough \n     review. A thorough review is especially needed for Dr. \n     Berwick's appointment in light of statements he has made in \n     the past about health care rationing as well as the role of \n     government in health care.\n       (10) By recess-appointing Dr. Berwick, the President has \n     attempted to short circuit the requirement of article II, \n     section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution that he appoint \n     officers of the United States ``by and with the Advice and \n     Consent of the Senate''.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the recess appointment of Dr. Donald Berwick, while \n     consideration of his nomination to serve as Administrator of \n     CMS was proceeding normally through the Senate Finance \n     Committee nomination review process, constitutes an abuse of \n     power by the President; and\n       (2) notwithstanding his recess appointment to that \n     position, Dr. Donald Berwick should appear before the Senate \n     Finance Committee and respond to questions by members about \n     his qualifications to serve as Administrator of CMS.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4478.
